            <li>how many times I try to unscrew it</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t my favorite cleanser</li>
            <li>Probably the best facial cleaning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Will try more I think.</li>
            <li>The lactic acid really helps to keep the skin bright and renewed.</li>
            <li>my skin is noticeably clearer and has a nice fresh sheen    3.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super gentle but very effective.</li>

            <li>Love the smell and the clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish it had was a more pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The CLNS smells very earthy and amazing, I like to let sit on my face for a bit(morning and night)</li>
            <li>Using CLNS for over 1 month now, I&#x27;ve never seen my skin look so healthy, fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li>Originally bought this for my daughter, and she liked it so much, I bought another for myself.</li>
            <li>Very effective nightly facial</li>
            <li>the customer service is by far impressive, he seems to really care to hear the customers thoughts and wants to help.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products for those that struggle with mild acne for sure!</li>
            <li>It allows me the privilege to work on my wavy hair, while maintaining a nice clear face.</li>
            <li>At last a product that does the job it claims and it smells so GOOD</li>
            <li>Purchased this product for the first time and have used it for about a month - it is a very nice, gentle cleanser that has kept my skin clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The difference on my mild acne was from here to the moon.</li>
            <li>It does a good job removing makeup (and if I use a cleansing oil first, it does a great job at dissolving that last little bit of oiliness).  </li>
            <li>Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used in a very long time.</li>
            <li>It feels strange at first, but ultimately a pleasant sensation.  </li>
            <li>I got better results from the Neutrogena combined with treatments thereafter on my sensitive, acne-prone skin than I did with this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Smells and looks nice too, and can&#x27;t find anything of similar quality in the shops (Walgreen, Duane Reede at leats).</li>
            <li>smells good, left my skin feeling clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product, more people definitely need to be aware of this product.</li>
            <li>does not dry out your skin whatsoever and lives you feeling clean, smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been switching as many of the products I use as possible, to more bio-based and bio-available as possible.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel like a &#x27;medicinal&#x27; product, more like a quality liquid soap or similar.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait to do my review until I was certain about the product.</li>
            <li>I am beyond certain.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anyone nearby with combination or dry skin to test and see how well it works for them, but I&#x27;ve enjoyed the light scent and the lack of residue left after my shower.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this cleanser (which was already my first mistake).</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>All in all, it works well and even after burning my face with too much dermabrasion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very relieved</li>
            <li>and I enjoy how it isn&#x27;t an intense cleanser, but at the same time has everything that your skin wants-</li>
            <li>use it in conjunction with the antibiotic French clay mask and it makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>really like these products.</li>
            <li>PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate being the glaring exception), and gentle, but it just didn&#x27;t clean acne-prone skin as thoroughly before treatment as even a simple Neutrogena fragrance-free cleaning bar does.  </li>
            <li>Since I have used this, I have not had one new flare up!</li>
            <li>I have normal olive skin.</li>
            <li>I cannot guarantee you will have the same outcomes I did, but I think it is worth a try for you!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A lactic acid cleanser was recommended to me after having my first facial.</li>
            <li>The owner contacted me long before this review asking how I liked the product (typical general email chain)</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick,this product did not work for me,everyones skin is a little different and someone else mite have better results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My roommate has noticed my clear skin and she has been coming into my bathroom and stealing it for herself.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had these tiny whiteheads on my skin, and its really working with the BENZD lotion.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Wanted to like it because of its natural approach, but it just didn&#x27;t work as well as hoped.</li>
            <li>He did end up refunding my money (which I was surprised) after having a bit of a discussion regarding how I was using the product and providing additional advice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of store bought brands meant for acne in high school, but this year I&#x27;m starting to realize the only way to heal yourself is naturally</li>
            <li>Right away my skin started to convert back into an oily, cystic, and sensitive flared up mess.</li>
            <li>I think this would be a good product for someone who wants a less harsh facial wash for moisture and smooth skin and not for bad acne, redness, blemishes, etc.</li>
            <li>It will deep clean your skin yet its very mild and doesnt smell bad.</li>
            <li>I had no real trouble starting this regimen, it was simple from the start.</li>

            <li> I had no real trouble starting this regimen, it was simple from the start.</li>
            <li> have seen a substantial reduction in any red spots and minor blemishes on my skin</li>
            <li> the beginning the BENZD lotion was a little too strong for me to use it twice everyday, so i&#x27;ve been using it once everyday</li>
            <li> I am not particularly susceptible to major acne outbreaks, but I wanted to avoid minor skin blemishes and other skin inflammation (redness, etc.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark African American with oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is a soft cleanser, it&#x27;s green in color</li>
            <li> all though everyone says it is a smaller container than what they thought, it doesn&#x27;t matter because you only need a little bit.  </li>
            <li> , it was gentle and did not sting or make matters worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a few pictures; days 1-3 are using this product only and day 4 are the results with the acne kit</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for the last few months  </li>
            <li> This cleanser works well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But I will continue to use it along with other acne products to help moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This might be due to the pH of the product.    </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve got oily skin), doesn&#x27;t leave my beard dry and while I wish it was a little thicker (increased viscosity)</li>
            <li> so I use less make up.</li>
            <li> the product tingles a little bit when applying to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this a few days ago along with the Peter Thomas Ross acne kit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Put plainly, I like this product.  </li>
            <li> my face has been noticeably less red, and it never feels dried out OR artificially moisturized after I use the product.</li>
            <li> do tend to have very oily skin, and I don’t notice it as bad when I use this.</li>
            <li> I use this after I shower but usually follow up with a moisturizer like kiehls ultra fav cream.</li>
            <li> and this made it worse.</li>
            <li> Not that it smells terrible - there is almost no scent, but I would say it is just a bit earthy.</li>
            <li> I hate it!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> great product-- it&#x27;s super gentle but very effective. does not dry out your skin whatsoever and lives you feeling clean, smooth and moisturized. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good product! Good customer service!</li>
            <li> This cleanser works well and a little goes a long way. It does a good job removing makeup (and if I use a cleansing oil first, it does a great job at dissolving that last little bit of oiliness).  The only thing I wish it had was a more pleasant scent. Not that it smells terrible - there is almost no scent, but I would say it is just a bit earthy. Luckily it is only on my face a short time so it&#x27;s no big deal. All in all, it works well and even after burning my face with too much dermabrasion, it was gentle and did not sting or make matters worse.</li>
            <li> Smooth cleanser and a pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I started out the year going off of my acne medication that I&#x27;ve been on for seven years. Right away my skin started to convert back into an oily, cystic, and sensitive flared up mess. I&#x27;ve tried tons of store bought brands meant for acne in high school, but this year I&#x27;m starting to realize the only way to heal yourself is naturally-your body isn&#x27;t meant to react well with chemicals. I&#x27;m very relieved I came across this brand because I have never been happier with my smoother and brighter face- the customer service is by far impressive, he seems to really care to hear the customers thoughts and wants to help. The CLNS smells very earthy and amazing, I like to let sit on my face for a bit(morning and night) and I enjoy how it isn&#x27;t an intense cleanser, but at the same time has everything that your skin wants- and then I use BENZD throughout the day and RETIN at night (both only as a spot treatment). The mask I use once a week and I just let it sit on my face overnight, all though everyone says it is a smaller container than what they thought, it doesn&#x27;t matter because you only need a little bit.  This is my new favorite product, more people definitely need to be aware of this product. Who doesn&#x27;t want to support someone who actually cares about his product and customers?</li>
            <li> Extremely gentle cleanser that exfoliates and cleanses without any harsh dryness. I have normal olive skin.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t strip my skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few days ago along with the Peter Thomas Ross acne kit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YOPS9W/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While waiting for the acne kit to arrive I started using the CLNS cleanser. While it does make my skin feel fresh/smooth it did not help with the over all tone and evenness of my skin. I have always had issues with redness and acne even now into my twenties. I think this would be a good product for someone who wants a less harsh facial wash for moisture and smooth skin and not for bad acne, redness, blemishes, etc. But I will continue to use it along with other acne products to help moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a few pictures; days 1-3 are using this product only and day 4 are the results with the acne kit, I posted above, in only 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick,this product did not work for me,everyones skin is a little different and someone else mite have better results.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin and this made it worse.</li>
            <li> love the eco friendly packaging.&lt;br /&gt;works great with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these tiny whiteheads on my skin, and its really working with the BENZD lotion.&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning the BENZD lotion was a little too strong for me to use it twice everyday, so i&#x27;ve been using it once everyday instead.&lt;br /&gt;works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now and I LOVE IT!!! I wanted to wait to do my review until I was certain about the product. I am beyond certain. This stuff is incredible! I have an acne problem and it seems to flare up out of nowhere. I hate it! Since I have used this, I have not had one new flare up! I can&#x27;t even feel any bumps on my face when I run my hand over it. My roommate has noticed my clear skin and she has been coming into my bathroom and stealing it for herself. It only requires one pump, so it lasts for a while! When I was my face with this, I feel refreshed and smooth! I feel as if I have just left the spa after getting a facial, except without the pain. &lt;br /&gt;This product smells amazing and refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;**received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  I cannot guarantee you will have the same outcomes I did, but I think it is worth a try for you!&lt;br /&gt;I do tend to have very oily skin, and I don’t notice it as bad when I use this. I used this along with the MASK for blackheads and acne.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, relatively clean ingredients (PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate being the glaring exception), and gentle, but it just didn&#x27;t clean acne-prone skin as thoroughly before treatment as even a simple Neutrogena fragrance-free cleaning bar does.  I got better results from the Neutrogena combined with treatments thereafter on my sensitive, acne-prone skin than I did with this cleanser.  Wanted to like it because of its natural approach, but it just didn&#x27;t work as well as hoped.</li>
            <li> Originally bought this for my daughter, and she liked it so much, I bought another for myself. Great so far and a good value for the price. Love buying products that don&#x27;t have artificial/chemical ingredients</li>
            <li> I use CLNS along with BENDZ and RETIN. The difference on my mild acne was from here to the moon. No acne treatment is perfect, but my face looks so much better than it did before I started using these products. It allows me the privilege to work on my wavy hair, while maintaining a nice clear face. Keep in mind, this product can cause some dryness, but it&#x27;s all a matter of getting used to the product and seeing what works for your skin. I had no real trouble starting this regimen, it was simple from the start. This company is also great to work with. I highly recommend these products for those that struggle with mild acne for sure!</li>
            <li> Just got the product, however upon receiving it, it looked like some of the product leaked out and the pump doesn&#x27;t come up no matter how many times I try to unscrew it so I have to open up the bottle each time to use. Seems like a great cleanser though.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used in a very long time. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and my pores are noticeably smaller.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cleanser (which was already my first mistake). A lactic acid cleanser was recommended to me after having my first facial. This is a soft cleanser, it&#x27;s green in color so it&#x27;s not the easiest to look at and it doesn&#x27;t smell all that great but it&#x27;s bearable. The reason for a low rating - I wasn&#x27;t seeing results. I used this once/twice a day, with/without my clarisonic brush...and nothing. The 3 stars I provided go towards customer service. The owner contacted me long before this review asking how I liked the product (typical general email chain) and I did express my concerns. He did end up refunding my money (which I was surprised) after having a bit of a discussion regarding how I was using the product and providing additional advice.</li>
            <li> Worked good! Wasn&#x27;t my favorite cleanser but it is a good exfoliant! Gives the skin a nice squeaky clean feeling! I&#x27;d buy again!</li>
            <li> It evens up my skin tone so I use less make up. It will deep clean your skin yet its very mild and doesnt smell bad. No stinging. Probably the best cleanser I have ever used. Keeps skin clear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews until I&#x27;ve had time to test the product. Using CLNS for over 1 month now, I&#x27;ve never seen my skin look so healthy, fresh and glowing. At last a product that does the job it claims and it smells so GOOD I just want to bathe in it.</li>
            <li> I am not particularly susceptible to major acne outbreaks, but I wanted to avoid minor skin blemishes and other skin inflammation (redness, etc.) that appear periodically on my face, so I tried this cleanser.  I have been using it for a three weeks as a daily cleanser now.    1. the product tingles a little bit when applying to the skin.  It feels strange at first, but ultimately a pleasant sensation.  This might be due to the pH of the product.    2. my skin is noticeably clearer and has a nice fresh sheen    3. have seen a substantial reduction in any red spots and minor blemishes on my skin</li>
            <li> Put plainly, I like this product.  It cleans well (I&#x27;ve got oily skin), doesn&#x27;t leave my beard dry and while I wish it was a little thicker (increased viscosity) that just means an altered or added glycol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been switching as many of the products I use as possible, to more bio-based and bio-available as possible.  The CLNS is a solid product.  I don&#x27;t have anyone nearby with combination or dry skin to test and see how well it works for them, but I&#x27;ve enjoyed the light scent and the lack of residue left after my shower.</li>
            <li> Very effective nightly facial cleaner- my face has been noticeably less red, and it never feels dried out OR artificially moisturized after I use the product. Probably the best facial cleaning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Awesome and smells great! The lactic acid really helps to keep the skin bright and renewed. My biggest issue is texture and dullness. I&#x27;m dark African American with oily skin. Using this for 3wks and am very pleased. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> smells good, left my skin feeling clean but not dried out. I use this after I shower but usually follow up with a moisturizer like kiehls ultra fav cream. Great 1-2 punch.</li>
            <li> This is actually really good. Doesn&#x27;t feel like a &#x27;medicinal&#x27; product, more like a quality liquid soap or similar. Smells and looks nice too, and can&#x27;t find anything of similar quality in the shops (Walgreen, Duane Reede at leats). Will try more I think.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for the last few months  and I luv it. It foams up well and my face feels refresh.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in conjunction with the antibiotic French clay mask and it makes my skin feel smooth. But with the combination my acne is under control and do not break as much.&lt;br /&gt;I really like these products.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for the first time and have used it for about a month - it is a very nice, gentle cleanser that has kept my skin clear and smooth.  Definitely recommend it!</li>
