            <li>If you are one that can&#x27;t get over the wanting to have lather thing then this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>Best tip ever for curly hair:  </li>
            <li>I do wish the Deva curl products were cheaper but Amazon has the best prices I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Wonderful!</li>
            <li>Good Stuff!</li>
            <li>Great shampoo for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>However, One Condition works GREAT as a co-wash (I think the glycerin helps with this).</li>
            <li>Works great with my perm to create those longer corkscrew-like curls.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product for those with frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;LOW-POO: Love the low-poo!!</li>
            <li>i gave it a good shot, about a month, thinking my hair needed to adjust to it, but it just didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li>Smells good, leaves hair shiny, conditioner works well.</li>
            <li>Love DevaCurl!  </li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>I am loving the way my hair is turning out after using these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably do this most of the time with a break with a good shampoo to get rid of built up oils.</li>
            <li>I have a mix of 2c, 3a, and 3b hair that is fine and fairly porous.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair and these products make it easier to manage while leaving beautiful conditioned curls.  </li>
            <li>I like the low-poo better than the no-poo.  </li>
            <li>Not because it does not work, but because the DC professionals have stated that for thirsty hair the No-Poo is better.</li>
            <li>I love using it as my leave in.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Love the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li>The curl is more defined and lasts longer than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still think the conditioner needs to be more moisturizing, but they may have one better suited for my needs.  </li>
            <li>I use this with the devacurl gel, which I love.</li>
            <li>Since then there are a lot more curly care products out there</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>shampoo has a very light scent, but the conditioner has a strong earthy smell.</li>
            <li>The Low-Poo smells awesome to me and I love that my hair isn&#x27;t dried out after.</li>
            <li>The smell of the low poo is great and it cleans well as well.</li>
            <li>If you have natural wave or curl, this is a good shampoo and conditioner to put on it.  </li>
            <li>smells ok, probably works great, but I had to use so much of the shampoo to get my hair clean that investing in this as a daily shampoo would be cost prohibitive (</li>
            <li>Both products are creamy and wash out clean.</li>
            <li>i felt like i had to use a ton of the shampoo to get my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I now buy a cheaper light conditioner for my co-washing needs and spend more money on a good heavy conditioner instead.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft curls.</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t my first sulfate free shampoo either.</li>
            <li>My hair is now super soft, shiny, healthy, and frizz-free.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>After trying it again and using it regularly, I can honestly say that my hair is responding well.</li>
            <li>only product I&#x27;ve found that really works &amp; smells good too</li>
            <li>The one conditioner is always good and even when you are first putting it in your hair it seems a little light</li>
            <li>It gets my hair squeaky clean but also moisturizes and detangles really well.</li>
            <li>Incredible combo for curly to wavy hair, especially if you prefer not wash all the time and don&#x27;t enjoy using harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>So glad to have my deva curl products back.</li>
            <li>I will be getting my no poo again only because I love the tingling feeling of the no poo.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using the low-poo</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m starting to love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product; however, the second bottle of conditioner that I received seemed much thicker than the first.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is also good as a leave-in, and only a tiny bit is needed.  </li>
            <li>do not dry with a terri towel, use cotton knit (like a tee shirt) - makes huge difference in preventing frizz.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this set with high hopes, I was unimpressed.</li>
            <li>I really like these products, I have been using them for over one year</li>
            <li>but it really works very well.</li>
            <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t really do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>the conditioner did not feel very moisturizing either.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My scalp became very dry and flaky and I noticed I was losing more hair than normal.</li>
            <li>I went back to my previous shampoo and conditioner (Giovanni) and my hair is healthy and flake free again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i had to put a little more on after i rinsed</li>
            <li>I love the conditioner and always put a little in my hair and leave it in.  </li>
            <li>I have mixed feelings about these products but they are mostly positive.</li>
            <li>It is not drying, and it leaves my curls soft and spirally.</li>
            <li>My hair is SO soft after using this, even before I use conditioner.</li>
            <li>for reference i have 3a soft curls.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes my curly hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>When I use this shampoo and conditioner, my hair feels so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t think One Condition is worth it for me as it is pretty expensive, and I go through it too quickly using it as a co-wash almost everyday.</li>
            <li>I recommended the product to a friend and she told me she liked the shampoo, but didn&#x27;t like the conditioner as it was thick and gave her hair a heavy feel.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like these products, I have been using them for over one year and I plan on continuing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 20 years.  Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> So glad to have my deva curl products back. Tonight was my first time using the low poo as I usually get the no poo, but the low poo work just as well. I will be getting my no poo again only because I love the tingling feeling of the no poo. The smell of the low poo is great and it cleans well as well. If you are one that can&#x27;t get over the wanting to have lather thing then this is perfect for you. The one conditioner is always good and even when you are first putting it in your hair it seems a little light but it really works very well.</li>
            <li> Incredible combo for curly to wavy hair, especially if you prefer not wash all the time and don&#x27;t enjoy using harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have been trying everything ever since Aveda reformulated their shampoo into something unusable for me.  Curly haired people know how difficult it is to find the right product.  I&#x27;m now using this combo, and it is working for me.  I like the low-poo better than the no-poo.  It is not drying, and it leaves my curls soft and spirally. The conditioner is also good as a leave-in, and only a tiny bit is needed.  Best tip ever for curly hair:  do not dry with a terri towel, use cotton knit (like a tee shirt) - makes huge difference in preventing frizz.</li>
            <li> smells ok, probably works great, but I had to use so much of the shampoo to get my hair clean that investing in this as a daily shampoo would be cost prohibitive (and yes, I have to wash my hair daily or it is disgusting). The conditioner doesn&#x27;t really do much for my hair. After a few days, the set makes my hair somewhat flat. There are products at the drugstore that work just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> I am loving the way my hair is turning out after using these. The Low-Poo smells awesome to me and I love that my hair isn&#x27;t dried out after. I will be moving to the No-Poo after this bottle is done though. Not because it does not work, but because the DC professionals have stated that for thirsty hair the No-Poo is better. The One conditioner is a dream. I love using it as my leave in. For now I am using up my Mixed Chicks deep Co so DC One Co is my leave in after my detangling. But I will not have a problem switching to using the One Co for all my detangling needs later.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo once or twice a week but condition every day. Both products are creamy and wash out clean. Love. I do wish the Deva curl products were cheaper but Amazon has the best prices I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for curly hair.  You only have to use a little so you save money.  Love the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product; however, the second bottle of conditioner that I received seemed much thicker than the first.  I had to take the cover off to use it as it wouldn&#x27;t go through the cap hole.  I recommended the product to a friend and she told me she liked the shampoo, but didn&#x27;t like the conditioner as it was thick and gave her hair a heavy feel.  Did they change the formula?</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about these products but they are mostly positive. I have a mix of 2c, 3a, and 3b hair that is fine and fairly porous. Using this every day, my hair got rather dry and frizzy but with a little experimenting, I&#x27;ve figured out how to use these products to suit my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOW-POO: Love the low-poo!! It gets my hair squeaky clean but also moisturizes and detangles really well. My hair is SO soft after using this, even before I use conditioner. I massage it into my roots in sections. I do use quite a bit, as the bubbles don&#x27;t &amp;#34;spread&amp;#34; as easily as traditional shampoos. However, (as described in my routine below) I only use this every few days so it still lasts me a long time (from August to December thus far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE CONDITION: I think One Condition is not moisturizing enough for my hair. However, One Condition works GREAT as a co-wash (I think the glycerin helps with this). I ended up buying a different, heavier conditioner to add to my routine. Here&#x27;s what I do now. Day 1: Low-poo + heavy conditioner. Day 2-4: Co-wash with One Condition + heavy conditioner. Repeat! My hair is now super soft, shiny, healthy, and frizz-free. Woohoo!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely purchase the Low-poo again (although there are cheaper sulfate-free options out there). However, I don&#x27;t think One Condition is worth it for me as it is pretty expensive, and I go through it too quickly using it as a co-wash almost everyday. I now buy a cheaper light conditioner for my co-washing needs and spend more money on a good heavy conditioner instead.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this because i feel like this is the standard for curly hair care, but I&#x27;m disappointed. i felt like i had to use a ton of the shampoo to get my hair feeling clean. the low suds wouldn&#x27;t bother me if my hair didn&#x27;t feel greasy immediately. i gave it a good shot, about a month, thinking my hair needed to adjust to it, but it just didn&#x27;t work out. this isn&#x27;t my first sulfate free shampoo either. the conditioner did not feel very moisturizing either. i had to put a little more on after i rinsed so my hair didn&#x27;t get frizzy when it dried. back to kinky curly shampoo/conditioner i go. for reference i have 3a soft curls.</li>
            <li> Love DevaCurl!  Works great with my perm to create those longer corkscrew-like curls.  Conditioner does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> did not work for me, but it does my friend.</li>
            <li> I wish I never purchased this shampoo and conditioner! The first few washes, my hair was great, but after about two weeks my hair became flat and felt awful. My scalp became very dry and flaky and I noticed I was losing more hair than normal. I went back to my previous shampoo and conditioner (Giovanni) and my hair is healthy and flake free again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair product may work well for others, but not for me!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really help. It completely dried out the ends of my hair which I&#x27;m having hard time to make it not so dry anymore. :(</li>
            <li> Deva Low-poo makes a slight suds.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair as &amp;#34;nappy&amp;#34; as No-poo.  I love the conditioner and always put a little in my hair and leave it in.  Nice and soft curls.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the conditioner is thin and watery, much different from what I&#x27;ve purchased at a salon previously. I had to mix it with some leftover conditioner I had in order to make it somewhat useable-- needless to say, I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is my first time using the low-poo and it seems to feel like what I&#x27;d expect a shampoo to feel like, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all. I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is an edit to my previous review.  When I first bought this set with high hopes, I was unimpressed. I have naturally wavy hair.  It seemed like it was drying my hair out and causing it to be frizzy.  So I stopped using it, moved on to super moisturizing my hair and over the past few months have re-visited devacurl.  Now I&#x27;m starting to love it.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a very light scent, but the conditioner has a strong earthy smell. I had to get used to this, but now I like it.  After trying it again and using it regularly, I can honestly say that my hair is responding well. The curl is more defined and lasts longer than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are unsure, give it a try.  I still think the conditioner needs to be more moisturizing, but they may have one better suited for my needs.  I use this with the devacurl gel, which I love.</li>
            <li> Smells good, leaves hair shiny, conditioner works well. Using it for a girl with hairs ligthly curled.</li>
            <li> If you have natural wave or curl, this is a good shampoo and conditioner to put on it.  I started using it after my stylist used it on my hair.  Since then there are a lot more curly care products out there but this is still a staple for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product for those with frizzy curly hair. only product I&#x27;ve found that really works &amp; smells good too</li>
            <li> Wonderful! We love it! My daughter has very curly hair and these products make it easier to manage while leaving beautiful conditioned curls.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. But not worth the hype</li>
            <li> My stylist advised me to try Devacurl no-poo.  I have fine, straight hair.  Is this product only for curly hair?</li>
            <li> It makes my curly hair feel soft. Sometimes I&#x27;m not sure how well it cleans my scalp over an extended amount of time. I&#x27;d probably do this most of the time with a break with a good shampoo to get rid of built up oils.</li>
            <li> When I use this shampoo and conditioner, my hair feels so soft and manageable. It gives my curls definition and doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.</li>
