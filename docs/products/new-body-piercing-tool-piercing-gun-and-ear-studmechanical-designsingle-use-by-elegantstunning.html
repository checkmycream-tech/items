            <li>So glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>This lil mini gun is absolutely the best .</li>
            <li>Plus I thought you can put your own earring in it, but it already comes with one.</li>

            <li>Planning on buying more.</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law is scared to get her ears pierced, &amp; no matter how cute the earrings</li>
            <li>And the stud is a cute  CZ stone incased in stanless steel.</li>
            <li>If they worked better, then sure.</li>
            <li>My daughter was able to use it herself and had no problems·</li>
            <li>I love how the product came with a swab to prevent infections.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to let someone else do it for you, I messed up on myself &amp; I had to make my sister do it for me.</li>
            <li>But overall great product and price!</li>

            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>This product is great fast and easy to use</li>
            <li>when getting ear lobs pierced for the first time, you must get good gold or silver studs to kee from getting lobs infected...</li>
            <li>do it right the first time and youl be happy you did.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use·</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Its so easy.</li>
            <li>It was easy and painless.</li>
            <li>Did the job easily.</li>
            <li>they are very easy to use and go right through your ear.</li>
            <li>Be best to remove the earring back first, because it gets stuck,  which I think would hurt if your ear is still attached.</li>
            <li>works quick and one usage :)</li>
            <li>Much cheaper and sanitary than mall piercing booths!! :)</li>
            <li>This was a great tool although I didn&#x27;t use the blue thing because I broke the plastic peice</li>
            <li>The actual piercing part works great, but the stud that comes with it is not hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>However , it is a great product for someone to pierce your ear for you , it says one use only</li>
            <li>Great for people who have a problem with different types of piercing products.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying earrings and getting my lobs pierce for free..</li>
            <li>It came in an individual, sterile packaging and worked great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to order 2 more right now.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this, I have 4 more on the way for me and my sis!</li>
            <li>This piercing set looks quick, quite comfortable,&lt;br /&gt;&amp; really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first ear went ok.</li>
            <li>Super cheap, super easy.</li>
            <li>Save yourself the aggravation and pain, and just go to a clean place to get whatever you would buy this product to get pierced.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely, without a doubt, buy more.</li>
            <li>The pain is quick.</li>
            <li>and it was painless and quick.</li>
            <li>Came quick nothing to say I have not used it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the other 2 worked perfectly, the first one also worked but not as well (most likely because I did not know how to use it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this to pierce my upper cartilage and it worked AMAZINGLY.</li>
            <li>They each have their own individual protective plastic wrapping that appears trustworthy.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t worth buying.</li>
            <li>I bought a bunch of these and ended up doing my own second piercings with them...</li>
            <li>made it quick, simple and easy to do!</li>
            <li>I used all 5  of these right away for myself and 2  others.  </li>
            <li>A great little invention!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use un like the big bulky throw away guns.</li>
            <li>, they work fine, obviously don&#x27;t expect a professional piercing gun or professional results, but for regular ear lobe piercings this is perfect!</li>
            <li>I love this can&#x27;t beat the price ive used it and on a few people, I love the fact that it is reusable.</li>
            <li>I think they are fine for an adult piercing themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a simple mechanism that is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I recommend just paying more for an actual piercing gun.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li>Gun gets stuck and to get the backing out you really have to tug...which hurts a freshly pierced ear.</li>
            <li>Make sure the back piece is pushed down.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But it is pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li>The earring is also really cute which was a big plus.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t look safe, only comes with one earring and takes forever to arrive</li>
            <li>The equipment is suited for the job provided you have done this before and really know what you are doing!</li>
            <li>Make sure to use gloves and the wipe that came with it, twist it a few times a day and take 6 weeks before taking out!:)</li>
            <li>busteed the first time i pushed it</li>
            <li>My daughter wanted her ears pierced, but it didn&#x27;t go fully through the ear the first time.</li>
            <li>Worked amazing (thank god) took exactly a month to get from china and the earring was really cute but bigger than expected.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The earrings weren&#x27;t very nice and the gun was hard to use.</li>
            <li>The tube that contains the front of the earring often obscures your view of the ear when you position it to pierce, and when you must keep tugging the skin into position, it makes it very easy to pierce too high or too low.</li>
            <li>Also, they dont come with instructions, so look online for how to use them, but really, they are pretty self-explanatory.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it seems easy enough to do yourself.</li>
            <li>That shouldn&#x27;t be a problem because it&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>They really DO take a month to get there, so dont order these if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I was not, so it didnt really matter.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t really any pain involved.</li>
            <li>Gently pull downward to release the now applied earring from the clamp</li>
            <li>Pushed it back in and did my own ear with the same problem.</li>
            <li>Be sure to mark where you will pierce with a dark pen, and if your target requires you to use two mirrors, have a friend help.</li>
            <li>I dont know if I would buy these again for a young girl getting her ears pierced for the first time.</li>
            <li>, it wasn&#x27;t  a success like who wanna put a whole in your ear ,especially with force?</li>
            <li>The earrings inside are high quality and it even comes with alcohol pre treating pads.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more in the future just for the fact that it comes with new needle earrings</li>
            <li>really hurt!&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays young women pierce each other&#x27;s ears or their own, &amp; it&#x27;s no big deal.  </li>
            <li>The first one I did not know how to use well, and the ring and the back part were not aligning.</li>
            <li>Go to a professional.</li>
            <li>I would not waste your money on it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper then getting it professionally done.</li>
            <li>The only problem was that the back would NOT come out of the blue thing, and it was tricky, but I was able to take the tweezers and carefully pry the blue thing</li>
            <li>I pushed even harder, and it went right in and the back was pressed on correctly.</li>
            <li>It feels like cheap plastic and the quality is bad, however, the earring didn&#x27;t cause my ear to turn green, so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>Get a gun (for non-cartilage pierciings/ear lobes/flesh only) or just suck up the cost and go to a professional piercer.</li>
            <li>Just a quick pinch as far as pain goes &amp; hardly any soreness the next day.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a big deal though, and i barely felt it!</li>
            <li>, it hurts briefly when I clean it, and less than a few seconds later, it feels normal again.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t waste money on expensive products this one is amazing!</li>
            <li>Piercing was quick, smooth, only briefly painful.</li>
            <li>It was hard to use on myself because I couldn&#x27;t position in right, then it triggered without that much pressure, and I was just holding it, the little plastic stopper broke</li>

            <li> I will definitely buy more in the future just for the fact that it comes with new needle earrings</li>
            <li> really hurt!&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays young women pierce each other&#x27;s ears or their own, &amp; it&#x27;s no big deal.  </li>
            <li> The first one I did not know how to use well, and the ring and the back part were not aligning.</li>
            <li> Go to a professional.</li>
            <li> I would not waste your money on it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper then getting it professionally done.</li>
            <li> The only problem was that the back would NOT come out of the blue thing, and it was tricky, but I was able to take the tweezers and carefully pry the blue thing</li>
            <li> I pushed even harder, and it went right in and the back was pressed on correctly.</li>
            <li> It feels like cheap plastic and the quality is bad, however, the earring didn&#x27;t cause my ear to turn green, so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> Get a gun (for non-cartilage pierciings/ear lobes/flesh only) or just suck up the cost and go to a professional piercer.</li>
            <li> Just a quick pinch as far as pain goes &amp; hardly any soreness the next day.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a big deal though, and i barely felt it!</li>
            <li> , it hurts briefly when I clean it, and less than a few seconds later, it feels normal again.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste money on expensive products this one is amazing!</li>
            <li> Piercing was quick, smooth, only briefly painful.</li>
            <li> It was hard to use on myself because I couldn&#x27;t position in right, then it triggered without that much pressure, and I was just holding it, the little plastic stopper broke</li>
            <li> If you do not press the gun all the way through untill you hear and feel a soft click, the gun wont come down.</li>
            <li> I had to use tweezers to get the back out of the blue thing and carefully put it on the earring.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 individual mini-guns, each gun gives you a single piercing.</li>
            <li> but that was a long time ago</li>
            <li> so I have stretched ears</li>
            <li> Save $20 and go get your ears professionally done, A waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> But when he use one to pierce my cartllage in my ear it only went in half way and then the piercing gun broke.</li>
            <li> the backing does take a little jiggling to come off the blue part.</li>
            <li> I pierced my lower lobes and one piercing on my upper cartilage, the only problem was it was tough to get through my upper cartilage</li>
            <li> Not very sturdy</li>
            <li> then I pushed the little blue stick down</li>
            <li> and it only hurt a little bit!</li>
            <li> I recommend taking the back out of the tool and putting it back in before piercing due to the fact that it can be a little hard to get it out.</li>
            <li> On the outside of each one, in yet another protective wrapper, is a small sanitized cloth.</li>
            <li> Its not worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These look far less painful than the old &amp;#34;paper-punch&amp;#34; gun doctors used to pierce ears with (including mine)--that</li>
            <li> This hurt less and throbbed less than the piercings  </li>
            <li> Just some slight pressure as the pointy side of the earring penetrates your ear lobe.</li>
            <li> Took me less than five minutes to do both ears.</li>
            <li> The earring itself is silver,  with a small jewel/rhinestone/stone at its center.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waist your time with the cheap ones, as they don&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> did not trust the packaging, although it was in a tight sealed bag, I took the gun apart and disinfected</li>
            <li> These little gadgets are&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Thankfully I used numbing cream Speed Numb on our ears an hour or so before so you couldn&#x27;t really feel it at all).</li>
            <li> and I had trouble with that too</li>
            <li> So I have a few words I would like to say about this product.</li>
            <li> I put my earing in a few days ago and it doesn&#x27;t even hurt.</li>
            <li> I had a few problems with this piercing gun.</li>
            <li> It literally took less than a minute to pierce both ears!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my nose, :/ when it came i was really anxious to do so ,but i couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> As another reviewer mentioned, the backs are hard to remove from the device...</li>
            <li> (if you look at the loaded earring before use, you&#x27;ll see what I mean).</li>
            <li> gun is very very small.</li>
            <li> Never got to use because it was broken when I received.</li>
            <li> I could get addicted</li>
            <li> One of the piercers I received was broken.</li>
            <li> especially since u just pierced something it becomes very painful</li>
            <li> duhhh...</li>
            <li> and I was so afraid bit</li>
            <li> Would recommend purchasing Speed Numb or another numbing cream if you are using this just because you have to manually push it through while holding still.</li>
            <li> , so I won&#x27;t feel bad if she still rejects the idea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So when I bought this product, I did not expect to have to go to the doctors because my ear was so badly infected, to where even my antiseptic was not helping.</li>
            <li> it does not line up, and painful trying..</li>
            <li> I ordered this almost a month ago... and it has yet to come, I&#x27;m kinda disappointed...</li>
            <li> stupid thing broke during piercing</li>
            <li> Crap.  </li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t painful at all!</li>
            <li> Horrible and broke before I could even use it.</li>
            <li> This is awful for your ears.</li>
            <li> horrible, junk!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a great tool although I didn&#x27;t use the blue thing because I broke the plastic peice so instead I just used the ear ring to peirce my ear but that was a long time ago so I have stretched ears and I&#x27;m currently at a 00</li>
            <li> works quick and one usage :)</li>
            <li> Kinda unsteady when using  it</li>
            <li> It was hard to use on myself because I couldn&#x27;t position in right, then it triggered without that much pressure, and I was just holding it, the little plastic stopper broke and then I couldn&#x27;t use the gun at all!  I had to finish my piercing with a needle.  It feels like cheap plastic and the quality is bad, however, the earring didn&#x27;t cause my ear to turn green, so that&#x27;s good.  I recommend just paying more for an actual piercing gun.</li>
            <li> The actual piercing part works great, but the stud that comes with it is not hypoallergenic. My piercing would not heal with this stud in, and it occasionally oozed. If you are allergic to nickel I suggest using this to pierce your ear then switching the stud out for a different earring. I had someone else pierce my ear with this but it seems easy enough to do yourself.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these and they worked great! I pierced my lower lobes and one piercing on my upper cartilage, the only problem was it was tough to get through my upper cartilage and i had to push it the rest of the way in by hand. It wasn&#x27;t a big deal though, and i barely felt it! it was all around a great product. The earrings inside are high quality and it even comes with alcohol pre treating pads. I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my nose, :/ when it came i was really anxious to do so ,but i couldn&#x27;t and none of my household members didn&#x27;t want to do it , so i just tried to Pierced my ear , it wasn&#x27;t  a success like who wanna put a whole in your ear ,especially with force? However , it is a great product for someone to pierce your ear for you , it says one use only but i tried plenty of times. And it only comes with one so you should oder 2 if your trying to pierce both ears. That shouldn&#x27;t be a problem because it&#x27;s very inexpensive. Good Luck.</li>
            <li> This lil mini gun is absolutely the best . At first I didn&#x27;t get it then I pushed the little blue stick down and I had trouble with that too but ..HELLO.. duhhh... The blue stick had to break into the gun for earrings to pierce through. ... I suggest this to anyone. ...I&#x27;m about to order 2 more right now.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Great for people who have a problem with different types of piercing products. Planning on buying more.</li>
            <li> I recommend taking the back out of the tool and putting it back in before piercing due to the fact that it can be a little hard to get it out. It works great and is great for if you want to pierce your own ear.</li>
            <li> too flimsy you get what you paid for, , once plunger is pushed forward it does not retract back and you have to manual try to keep earring in and get back stud piece out of machine.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law is scared to get her ears pierced, &amp; no matter how cute the earrings I send her (&amp; clip or screw-on earrings&lt;br /&gt;make her ears sore, or slip off), she won&#x27;t go &amp; get her ears pierced.  I know these have been delivered to her, although she hasn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;mentioned them.  I&#x27;m hoping that her husband, or one of her women friends, can convince her to d.i.y.  These little gadgets are&lt;br /&gt;very inexpensive, so I won&#x27;t feel bad if she still rejects the idea.&lt;br /&gt;These look far less painful than the old &amp;#34;paper-punch&amp;#34; gun doctors used to pierce ears with (including mine)--that really hurt!&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays young women pierce each other&#x27;s ears or their own, &amp; it&#x27;s no big deal.  This piercing set looks quick, quite comfortable,&lt;br /&gt;&amp; really easy to use.  A great little invention!</li>
            <li> I love this can&#x27;t beat the price ive used it and on a few people, I love the fact that it is reusable. I will definitely buy more in the future just for the fact that it comes with new needle earrings</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. If you&#x27;re piercing your ear this would probably work but I tried to pierce my septum and was unsuccessful.</li>
            <li> SHORT REVIEW: Ive had no infections after two weeks. The guns work. They come with sanitizing wipes. They each have their own individual protective plastic wrapping that appears trustworthy. On the outside of each one, in yet another protective wrapper, is a small sanitized cloth. Piercing was quick, smooth, only briefly painful. This will vary depending on your pain tolerance. I highly recommend these. Save yourself the time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LESS SHORT: It came about a month after purchasing. My. mother pierced my ears, and I pierced my brothers. I ordered 4 individual mini-guns, each gun gives you a single piercing. The pain is quick. I had no pain after it was completly in my ears, even now cleaning it every day for 2 weeks, it hurts briefly when I clean it, and less than a few seconds later, it feels normal again. This hurt less and throbbed less than the piercings  I  received from a proffesional. The closest thing to a malfunction was after my mother had pierced my ears, she had some issues taking it off. If you do not press the gun all the way through untill you hear and feel a soft click, the gun wont come down. After i realized this, my brothers piercings had no issues at all, including no jams. Be sure to mark where you will pierce with a dark pen, and if your target requires you to use two mirrors, have a friend help. The tube that contains the front of the earring often obscures your view of the ear when you position it to pierce, and when you must keep tugging the skin into position, it makes it very easy to pierce too high or too low. My mother, unable to see the dot, went noticeably lower on me, but I&#x27;m oddly pleased with the effect. The earring itself is silver,  with a small jewel/rhinestone/stone at its center. I will update again if problems arise. I am inspired to do all my future piercings myself because of this.</li>
            <li> stupid thing broke during piercing</li>
            <li> i would not buy this at all, i ordered this and it was suppose to get here within a month from China, it never got here and i contacted them to solve the problem, they said they would send it out again and it would take another month or so. Well i ordered this back in February and still don&#x27;t have this!</li>
            <li> I used all 5  of these right away for myself and 2  others.  They are great!  I&#x27;ve already got more on the way!  They weren&#x27;t painful at all!</li>
            <li> I used this piercing gun to pierce my husbands ear and it was painless and quick. But when he use one to pierce my cartllage in my ear it only went in half way and then the piercing gun broke. So I reccomend you use it on ear lobs only, or you&#x27;ll be pushing the stud in manually if you try to do it in your upper ear. And the stud is a cute  CZ stone incased in stanless steel. It&#x27;s about 4mm big.</li>
            <li> I ordered this almost a month ago... and it has yet to come, I&#x27;m kinda disappointed... don&#x27;t waist your time!!!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t worth buying. I bought the same product from a different company, and didn&#x27;t have any problems with infection or anything else. Might I add that I am experienced at piercing ears. So when I bought this product, I did not expect to have to go to the doctors because my ear was so badly infected, to where even my antiseptic was not helping. Save yourself the aggravation and pain, and just go to a clean place to get whatever you would buy this product to get pierced. Its not worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for my daughter, (6yo). She wanted her ears pierced, and did NOT want to do it at the store. I did some reading, and settled on these. They really DO take a month to get there, so dont order these if you are in a hurry. I was not, so it didnt really matter. Also, they dont come with instructions, so look online for how to use them, but really, they are pretty self-explanatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first ear went ok. I pushed it in and it pierced the ear, but did not hook into the back. I had to use tweezers to get the back out of the blue thing and carefully put it on the earring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second ear I pushed even harder, and it went right in and the back was pressed on correctly. The only problem was that the back would NOT come out of the blue thing, and it was tricky, but I was able to take the tweezers and carefully pry the blue thing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter did well, but I dont know if I would buy these again for a young girl getting her ears pierced for the first time. If they worked better, then sure. I think they are fine for an adult piercing themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was my experience and I hope you all find it helpful!</li>
            <li> This piercer is phenomenal!  It is a simple mechanism that is super easy to use. Just a quick pinch as far as pain goes &amp; hardly any soreness the next day. The trauma your lobe would receive with a traditional piercer is nonexistent with this one. Two thumbs waaaay up! I will absolutely, without a doubt, buy more.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use· My daughter was able to use it herself and had no problems· She was very happy so I am too!!</li>
            <li> I love how the product came with a swab to prevent infections. The product was a very nice purchase for the price</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than promised and looks good. No problems here.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I wanted to get a second piercing in the upper lobe of both my ears and this product made it quick, simple and easy to do! It literally took less than a minute to pierce both ears! There wasn&#x27;t really any pain involved. Just some slight pressure as the pointy side of the earring penetrates your ear lobe.</li>
            <li> Horrible and broke before I could even use it.</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of these and ended up doing my own second piercings with them... they are very easy to use and go right through your ear. Perfect for at home piercings</li>
            <li> Crappy stud made my ear inflamed. Gun gets stuck and to get the backing out you really have to tug...which hurts a freshly pierced ear. You get what you pay for...but don&#x27;t bother with this junk.</li>
            <li> Does the trick.  Easy to use.  Comes sealed.</li>
            <li> I bought three of these. The first one I did not know how to use well, and the ring and the back part were not aligning. Make sure the back piece is pushed down.&lt;br /&gt;I did not trust the packaging, although it was in a tight sealed bag, I took the gun apart and disinfected every part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the other 2 worked perfectly, the first one also worked but not as well (most likely because I did not know how to use it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gun is very very small. Definitely would buy again, they work fine, obviously don&#x27;t expect a professional piercing gun or professional results, but for regular ear lobe piercings this is perfect!</li>
            <li> Super cheap, super easy. Comes in sterile packaging like disposable hospital supplies. Mark your piercing, line up the clamp and squeeze. Gently pull downward to release the now applied earring from the clamp (if you look at the loaded earring before use, you&#x27;ll see what I mean). Took me less than five minutes to do both ears. Cake.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper and sanitary than mall piercing booths!! :)</li>
            <li> It did not come with directions. But it is pretty self explanatory. Very easy to use un like the big bulky throw away guns. Very light and was well packaged. The earring is also really cute which was a big plus. Will be buying again in the future.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t look safe, only comes with one earring and takes forever to arrive</li>
            <li> this is a joke,,, don&#x27;t buy it... it does not line up, and painful trying..My husband tryed twice..I ended up buying earrings and getting my lobs pierce for free.. when getting ear lobs pierced for the first time, you must get good gold or silver studs to kee from getting lobs infected...do it right the first time and youl be happy you did. don&#x27;t waist your time with the cheap ones, as they don&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> Works great but buy two lol</li>
            <li> Works great! Just make sure to let someone else do it for you, I messed up on myself &amp; I had to make my sister do it for me. Painless literally feels like a pinch</li>
            <li> Go to a professional. This is awful for your ears. It&#x27;s 2015, educate yourself.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly the first time...the backing does take a little jiggling to come off the blue part. But overall great product and price!</li>
            <li> The equipment is suited for the job provided you have done this before and really know what you are doing!</li>
            <li> It pierces the ear but the backing don&#x27;t come out and it is a big hassle . especially since u just pierced something it becomes very painful</li>
            <li> I loved this product I used it on my cartilage and I was so afraid bit I did it and it only hurt a little bit! I would highly recommend this, I have 4 more on the way for me and my sis! Please don&#x27;t waste money on expensive products this one is amazing! Make sure to use gloves and the wipe that came with it, twist it a few times a day and take 6 weeks before taking out!:) gook luck!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Never got to use because it was broken when I received.</li>
            <li> Love this. Its so easy. Wish I had bought more. Plus the earring inside is cute. I could get addicted</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these to re-pierce my ear lobes. Worked great! It was easy and painless. As another reviewer mentioned, the backs are hard to remove from the device...it&#x27;s best to remove them before piercing and attach them after piercing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: This product ships from China. I received mine a month after I ordered them.</li>
            <li> So I have a few words I would like to say about this product. Yes it did come on time but it is so so so tiny. Plus I thought you can put your own earring in it, but it already comes with one. and it doesn&#x27;t even close all the way. I can see why I only paid $2 for this. I would not waste your money on it</li>
            <li> I used this to pierce my upper cartilage and it worked AMAZINGLY. There was no hassle at all. It came in an individual, sterile packaging and worked great.</li>
            <li> Came quick nothing to say I have not used it. But we will see. Looks good. Got it for someone I might keep it lol</li>
            <li> Its good for the price. Took the suggestion from a review and bought an extra onee to practice with. Glad I did. Be best to remove the earring back first, because it gets stuck,  which I think would hurt if your ear is still attached.</li>
            <li> busteed the first time i pushed it</li>
            <li> One of the 4 I ordered  came pierced in the package.</li>
            <li> Did the job easily. Saved me a lot of money! Can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> This product is great fast and easy to use also it&#x27;s painless. I put my earing in a few days ago and it doesn&#x27;t even hurt. I recommend buying this. It&#x27;s cheaper then getting it professionally done.</li>
            <li> horrible, junk! Save $20 and go get your ears professionally done, A waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I had a few problems with this piercing gun. My daughter wanted her ears pierced, but it didn&#x27;t go fully through the ear the first time. Pushed it back in and did my own ear with the same problem. Had to manually push it through. (Thankfully I used numbing cream Speed Numb on our ears an hour or so before so you couldn&#x27;t really feel it at all). Had my husband do my daughters ear the next time and he took the back out of the gun before using it and it worked better. Its a bit of a pain to hold still and push the push pin, but it was only a dollar or two (which is why I gave it three stars instead of one). Would recommend purchasing Speed Numb or another numbing cream if you are using this just because you have to manually push it through while holding still.</li>
            <li> Crap.  Don&#x27;t order.  I threw it out.  Get a gun (for non-cartilage pierciings/ear lobes/flesh only) or just suck up the cost and go to a professional piercer.</li>
            <li> The earrings weren&#x27;t very nice and the gun was hard to use. Not very sturdy</li>
            <li> Worked amazing (thank god) took exactly a month to get from china and the earring was really cute but bigger than expected. Please watch videos on YouTube before u do it yourself (maybe don&#x27;t do it yourself) ;)</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! I just got it yesterday and when I used it this morning it worked beautifully! It is virtually painless and the stud is beautiful. It&#x27;s also reusable which is great. So glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> One of the piercers I received was broken.</li>
