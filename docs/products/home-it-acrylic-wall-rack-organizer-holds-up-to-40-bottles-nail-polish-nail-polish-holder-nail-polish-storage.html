            <li>Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many people ask me where I got this.  </li>
            <li>such a great conversation piece!</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s also something to keep in mind while purchasing based on how many nail polishes</li>
            <li>It looks wonderful and holds all different sizes of nail polish bottles (my wife has many).  </li>
            <li>Overall, she is very happy with this product</li>
            <li>Love organizing my nail polish</li>
            <li>I use it to put my essential oils in, works perfect.</li>
            <li>I will probably order another as I love it.</li>
            <li>Did not realize how many nail polishes I had.  </li>
            <li>and it worked greaf &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Easy to hang and feels well built.</li>
            <li>It was easy to install.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install, holds all my essential oils beautifully.</li>
            <li>Nice that I can see exactly what colors I have like in the salon.</li>
            <li>but it works fine for my needs.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, and hold the polishes fine.</li>
            <li>Works great for my essential oils!</li>
            <li>Nice and holds all my OPI nailpolish. :)&lt;br /&gt;Was a bit larger than I expected, but am happy with it!</li>
            <li>Thinking of ordering another one to fit the rest of my nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Very neat and nicely displayed.</li>
            <li>Can fit 8 bottles of OPI or China Glaze on each level.</li>
            <li>I loved these and they are good quality for the money but some of the taller polishes would not fit!</li>
            <li>But most of all, happy that I have a cleared off shelf in our cabinets to fill with other items that I would rather hide now that the nail polish isn&#x27;t taking up that space!  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Also, and extra awesomely, I own 40 nail polishes - and they ALL (varying brands) fit!  </li>
            <li>I could def fit ONE more SKINNY bottle.....or tons more skinny bottles if all I had were smaller bottles.</li>
            <li>Not bad, after 1 month it already have some cracks.</li>
            <li>I have two large nail polish racks and wanted a little one for my Julep polish and this one was perfect!</li>
            <li>This arrived super swiftly and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, but too small to fit a lot if my polishes</li>
            <li>Worth the buy</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t fit tall polishes in all the shelves only the top shelf</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I had read from another reviewer that no screws were included with the shipment &amp; she was right.  </li>
            <li>It actually looked smaller to me when I opened it than I had originally envisioned, but it ended up fitting on my wall better</li>
            <li>It is a little smaller than it looks in the photo, but it&#x27;s still an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Wish the shelves had a little more height, but the top shelf works for taller bottles</li>
            <li>I am really happy with it, however I only wish I had purchased a bigger organizer.</li>
            <li>This product is great for starting my journey with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I can clearly see my oils names and I put them in alphabetical order to find each one easily.</li>
            <li>its really steady and the polishes fit really well</li>
            <li>Stays up and very well!</li>
            <li>and I wish I had gotten a larger one I have too many bottles of Polish.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to put it on the wall ofcourse, but I would think it&#x27;s pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li>It did not come with hardware or instructions, but as this is pretty self-explanatory, I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I can see exactly what I have.</li>
            <li>I really like it, it provides the right amount of space i need.  </li>
            <li>and I ordered another one to put right next to it to fit all of my polish.</li>
            <li>Just the right size to fit on the back of my linen closet door.</li>
            <li>Overall, great $25 well spent!</li>
            <li>Good product but was broken on the top right corner overall</li>
            <li>I can fit my essential oils in here with ease!</li>
            <li>It is holding up very well.</li>
            <li>It was very well packaged, arrived with 2 days</li>
            <li>Very flimsy but for the price U get what u pay for.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy</li>
            <li>My daughter really wanted this, so we ordered it for Christmas.</li>
            <li>10 small - regular nail polishes will fit just fine and snug but for bigger/bulkier nail polishes  , only 8 fit fit per row.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but couldn&#x27;t find anything better for my needs.</li>
            <li>The description says up to 40 bottles, however, I can only fit 9 per row, so 36 total.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to hang &amp; holds quite a few bottles &amp; supplies.</li>
            <li>It is clear acrylic and was easy to install within a few minutes to my wall.  </li>
            <li>Wrapped thoroughly in styrofoam, I was happily surprised.  </li>
            <li>very sturdy, just wish i got a bigger one now!</li>
            <li>I have it place near my vanity</li>
            <li>shelves are high enough that a bottle of polish remover fits as well.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was very easy to hang on the wall, and it not so heavy that I needed to anchor it.&lt;br /&gt;40 bottles would be a tight fit if the polishes are made round, but holds</li>

            <li> Product is exactly as I expected!  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is the bottom 3 shelves will not hold taller polishes like OPI.</li>
            <li> Works well for my model car paints and other small bottles of stuff.</li>
            <li> my medicine bottles, my lipsticks and other small toiletry items.  </li>
            <li> Basically, it&#x27;s just some little plastic shelves.</li>

            <li> Easy to install, holds all my essential oils beautifully.</li>
            <li> Good product, as described. Works well for it&#x27;s intended use in my house (holding bottles of essential oils.)&lt;br /&gt;Giving 3 stars because it does not come with ANY hardware at all. And the description does not mention that it&#x27;s not included.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many people ask me where I got this.  It was easy to install.  The description says up to 40 bottles, however, I can only fit 9 per row, so 36 total.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying another one of these.</li>
            <li> I am so happy and so in love with my purchase!! This wall rack is beautiful and such a great conversation piece! It was very well packaged, arrived with 2 days and I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problem with it what so ever. It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to put it on the wall ofcourse, but I would think it&#x27;s pretty self explanatory. I am very pleased with my purchase and recommend it to anybody! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. It says it fits 10 nail polishes on each shelf but that&#x27;s only depending on the size of the nail polish. 10 small - regular nail polishes will fit just fine and snug but for bigger/bulkier nail polishes  , only 8 fit fit per row. So that&#x27;s also something to keep in mind while purchasing based on how many nail polishes you&#x27;re wanting this rack to hold.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, and hold the polishes fine. It is a little smaller than it looks in the photo, but it&#x27;s still an awesome product.</li>
            <li> This acrylic nail polish organizer came in perfect condition and installed easily on the wall.  It did not come with hardware or instructions, but as this is pretty self-explanatory, I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  It looks wonderful and holds all different sizes of nail polish bottles (my wife has many).  Overall, she is very happy with this product and I liked the easy installation.</li>
            <li> If it came with screws to mount it up on the wall I would have given it 5 stars. But my polishes are all of all brands and sizes and still 40 fit :D</li>
            <li> My wife used to have a big basket of nail polish that she would essentially have to dump out to go through. Now she has this and can see all the colors and grab the one she needs with ease. It sits on a built in shelf in our walk in closet and didn&#x27;t require any installation.</li>
            <li> Love!! Thinking of ordering another one to fit the rest of my nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy but for the price U get what u pay for.</li>
            <li> I 1st saw someone on youtube.com with this handy wall organizer for nail polishes. I bought two of the wall organizers that hold 40 bottles each of nail polish as I didn&#x27;t have the wall space for the larger size 102 wall organizer.   I had read from another reviewer that no screws were included with the shipment &amp; she was right.  These wall organizer are really handy.</li>
            <li> The screws were not included in my box!!  Overall, I like it.</li>
            <li> I use this to store my essential oils. Works great! I think I may need one for my nail polish as well :) will order this again soon!</li>
            <li> very sturdy, just wish i got a bigger one now!</li>
            <li> Great purchase!!! It was packaged well enough to prevent any damage. It brought screws as well. Looks great and hold 45 nail polishes. I am really happy with it, however I only wish I had purchased a bigger organizer. Overall, great $25 well spent!</li>
            <li> Good product, clean, but a shame that they don&#x27;t give the hardware to hang it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Just the right size to fit on the back of my linen closet door. Product packaging was excellent to prevent any damage to the product.</li>
            <li> Love organizing my nail polish so I can see all my choices. Very sturdy</li>
            <li> Not bad, after 1 month it already have some cracks.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but couldn&#x27;t find anything better for my needs. Works well for my model car paints and other small bottles of stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and it is wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to organize all my nail polishes with this baby.</li>
            <li> It works awesome awesome.  I use it to put my essential oils in, works perfect. It makes it very easy to find the oils.</li>
            <li> PERFECT!! its really steady and the polishes fit really well</li>
            <li> Sturdy and durable material! Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this rack for my essential oils. I LOVE IT!!! I can see exactly what I have.</li>
            <li> This arrived super swiftly and was well packaged.  It is clear acrylic and was easy to install within a few minutes to my wall.  The size is nice and it is sturdy.  I have it in a bedroom to store nail polish, my medicine bottles, my lipsticks and other small toiletry items.  It keeps them nice and organized.  I will probably order another as I love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter really wanted this, so we ordered it for Christmas. Basically, it&#x27;s just some little plastic shelves. It does hold a lot, though not all, of her nail polish. But at this price, I won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
            <li> Nice!  Did not realize how many nail polishes I had.  Should have gotten the larger size. Nice that I can see exactly what colors I have like in the salon. Very neat and nicely displayed.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy product.  Can fit 8 bottles of OPI or China Glaze on each level.</li>
            <li> Great rack wit ample storage space. The only complaint is the bottom 3 shelves will not hold taller polishes like OPI. This makes it more difficult if your a a fan of OPI or other poliches that are a bit taller. And the wife is definitely a fan.</li>
            <li> I use this for my doTerra Essential Oils... It is easy to hang &amp; holds quite a few bottles &amp; supplies.</li>
            <li> This product is great for starting my journey with essential oils.  I can clearly see my oils names and I put them in alphabetical order to find each one easily. It also nicely hold the Houseables 20 Gram Jar, 20 ML Jar. where I am experimenting with different oils, face creams and blends for pain.  I am very satisfied.  &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Amazing! I just used push pins to keep it up and it worked greaf &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to keep all the bottles of polish from laying around her room.&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy to hang on the wall, and it not so heavy that I needed to anchor it.&lt;br /&gt;40 bottles would be a tight fit if the polishes are made round, but holds plenty.&lt;br /&gt;The shelves are high enough that a bottle of polish remover fits as well.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product, I am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use for storing essential oil bottles.  Just set it up on the bathroom shelf.  Wish the shelves had a little more height, but the top shelf works for taller bottles</li>
            <li> I really like it, it provides the right amount of space i need.  I have it place near my vanity and i didnt want it to over shadow that.</li>
