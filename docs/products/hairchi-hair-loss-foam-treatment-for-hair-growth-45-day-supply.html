            <li>I am fairly confident that I caught this early enough and whatever hair I lost will soon grow back.  </li>

            <li>I think I might be addicted. :)</li>
            <li>My thinning hair problem has been resolved, but you must keep using it if you want to enjoy thick, lustrous hair.</li>

            <li> My husband says his hair feels a little thicker with using this</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than what my doctor prescribed. Easy to apply. Mess free. Very effective.</li>
            <li> I used this for awhile and it didn&#x27;t really seem to make a difference in my hair. Besides making it really oily and greasy. I gave it 3 stars because maybe my hair type had something to do with the results. So I think you should try it out and see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> I use this daily on thinning areas of my hair and so far I&#x27;m noticing that those areas seem thicker with less fallout. I apply it to dry hair as recommended on the bottle. It&#x27;s foam so it&#x27;s really quick and easy to use. I&#x27;m sure with time, I&#x27;ll have more thickness and less hair loss with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback. I have not been using this product long but I have noticed a difference in the strength of my hair I am noticing less shedding every day. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Good product, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking at similar products. 4/5.</li>
            <li> So far great purchase. Got it for my sister, who lost some hair due to stress recently. And she has tried it so far and she swears there are new little hairs growing in. I will submit another review in a bout a month with an update but so far it is doing what it said it would.</li>
            <li> For a few months hair was flying out of my head.  It would cover the bathroom sink and toilet seat.  They&#x27;d dapple (yeah, I said dapple) my shoulders whenever I brushed my hair.  The trick to combatting hair loss is to attack it hard and early.  Don&#x27;t wait till it is obvious to the whole world that your hair is thinning.  For a few months I tried Lipogaine shampoo, Minoxidil and Procerin serum.  No improvement.  Hair kept falling out.  Now it may well be that the hair loss was actually a sign of improvement.  Those 3 products might have sped up my shedding phase to begin a cycle of new hair growth.  The thing is, if that is what was happening, I wanted to skip the shedding phase altogether and concentrate strictly on growth.  In desperation, I tried HairChi DHT blocker and the hair loss stopped within a day.  Now, I hardly lose any.  I still use the Lipogaine and Minoxidil because it is wise to attack this issue from multiple fronts.  I also treat my scalp with a micro needle roller before applying HairChi to allow better penetration.  So, the good news is the DHT is no longer causing hair to fall out at the slightest breeze.  I am fairly confident that I caught this early enough and whatever hair I lost will soon grow back.  Google some of the key ingredients in Hair Chi such as oleanolic acid and fennel seed.  You&#x27;ll be pleased with what you find.</li>
            <li> This foam is AWESOME. My sister turned me on to this product because it was working for her. It&#x27;s not fun to have your hair start thinning out and it&#x27;s relieving to have something you do about it. Great product and has scientific backing with the ingredients they use. If your hair is starting to thin out, give this a shot. Recommended!!</li>
            <li> tem delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help with my Traction alopecia. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Does not make my hair matted or greasy looking. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to tell if there is any significant hair growth. Will update later with that info.</li>
            <li> Ive been trying this for about two weeks now and I feel a difference in my hair. Even my girlfriend has noticed how smoother and silky my hair has become since ive been using HairChi. I haven&#x27;t seen any hair in the drain or on my comb!!!!</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to see a difference in new hair growth, I have already noticed that my existing hair is MUCH stronger and healthier.  This is an easy to use product and can be used for both women and men, unlike a lot of other hair growth products on the market.  In just a few weeks I have had friends notice and compliment how much healthier my hair looked and ask me what I was doing different.  I think I might be addicted. :)</li>
            <li> Seems to be working so far, delivery was fast</li>
            <li> I like many others struggled with hair loss. The only products that seemed to make any difference were so expensive that i just could not afford to keep using them. I bought HairChi a while back on there website and i was quite surprised with the results that it produced. My hair started to become thicker and more lush. This product is comparable to those that are 10x its price. This product is an absolute must for anyone struggling with hair loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products. My hair is much thicker after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product several months ago from their website. The foam is seriously amazing. Losing your hair at any age, for any reason is a very emotional experience. I had a friend recommend this product to me. I was skeptical, and still a little in denial. I saw a difference in my hair in about a month, I am now regrowing my own hair. I swear it is thicker than I ever remember it being. I now have my life back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that the product is chemical free, natural, and doesn&#x27;t have any nasty smells. Always a plus.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using it. I have high blood pressure and after a couple of days my heart started speeding up with anxiety and I started to get bad headaches. I was hoping this would have the one I could continuously use. Every product always claim to be natural that why I gave it a try. No hair product I have tried ever worked for me cause of the side effects. So it is not fair for me to rate it because I had to stop using cause of side effects. I bought two now I&#x27;m stuck with them both, maybe I&#x27;ll give to my sister.</li>
            <li> Made my scalp break out. I think its the copper. I tried a copper product once same thing happened. Should make one that is copper free.&lt;br /&gt;I think the Biotinyol Tripeptide 1 is the key ingredient that makes this work. I would be happy if had less and more of the main.</li>
            <li> Just started using but it sure is making my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister who has thinning hair. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks &amp; haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in thicker hair yet. But I do have softer hair now.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with thinning hair for quite some time and have ended up spending a ton of money on extensions so that I feel comfortable in public.  This is one brand that definitely lives up to its promise. My thinning hair problem has been resolved, but you must keep using it if you want to enjoy thick, lustrous hair.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after two days because it smells so bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had thinning in my hair ever since I got my tubes-tied which I reccomended not to. I was looking for something that was easy to use and the price was not bad either. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and my hair does feel smoother so I&#x27;m pretty excited to see my end results!</li>
