            <li> this is one of the very few fragrances which \\&quot;stay\\&quot; with my Wife.  It is not overpowering, yet definitely is noticable.</li>
            <li> The perfume was exactly as I expected. It arrived earlier than I thought it would. It&#x27;s a perfume that had been bought before, but in a smaller volume, so this is definitely a step up. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This Parfum is one is my favorite, has a good price, is a great item and it smells fantastic.  Will definately by this again!</li>
            <li> I wear this everyday and have gotten so many compliments.  It&#x27;s a mild fragrance, not over powering.  I would recommend this to everyone!  Great buy, great price.</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever......</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sent! I would suggest it to anyone who likes a powdery woodsy fragrance. Somewhat a blend of sandalwood and flowers. Lovely.</li>
            <li> this smells amazing.  My boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A HONEYSUCKLE BOMB WAITING TO LITERALLY EXPLODE!!!!  THIS IS NOT ONE OF MY FAVORITE PERFUMES THATS FOR SURE.  WHAT IS IT WITH AVON AND THE DAMN HONEYSUCKLE?????????  THEY LIKE HAVE THE MARKET CORNERED ON THIS STUFF!!!!!!!!  GAG ME REALLY.  A LITTLE BUT A BOMB OF IT-NO THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice,soft,warm and very pleasant perfume.Its very classy and has some similarities with Today,some characteristic note,but Today is more floral.I recommend to everyone to try this divine perfume and very long lasting for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Very good!!! I love it</li>
            <li> My mother taught me that a woman is incompletely dressed without wearing cologne or perfume -- fine cologne and perfume. So for decades I chose my scents carefully and with little regard for cost.  To help a colleague who was supplementing her income by selling Avon products, I bought a bottle of Tomorrow. The first time I wore it, I received a compliment and compliments have arrived frequently during the ten years I have worn this cologne. The last one came a few days ago in the supermarket. I now rarely spray anything else on my neck and wrist.</li>
            <li> Such a great fragrance and it stays with you</li>
            <li> The perfume is worthy of being like a department store fragrance, and if I had to recommend and Avon fragrance to purchase, this one would make the cut. It is spicy  and like a warm sweater.</li>
            <li> have used avon scents for years...this one is tomorrow !</li>
            <li> I love this Avon perfume! I tried out a sample of this product that I received from an Avon Rep and right away I knew I had to buy a whole bottle. The fragrance reminds me so much of summer, I can smell wonderful notes of Vanilla, and Sunflower with hints of other wonder fragrances. The delivery time was also exceptional.</li>
            <li> Love this. Soft and suttle...Package was very well secure.</li>
            <li> Been wearing this perfume for years and will continue. Light, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes, and scent lasts.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Lasts all day and has a slight vanilla scent to it. Kinda strong so a little goes a long way for me.</li>
