            <li>As a hairdresser I take it myself and recommend it to a lot of clients that are looking for an effective supplement.</li>
            <li>Started my 4th bottle and honestly I wish I was noticing results.  </li>
            <li>Okay, not as good as what I thought.</li>
            <li>She is very happy with the results and really wanted me to pass that on to the folks at dasgro.</li>
            <li>After 2 months my hair has stopped falling out and has thickened up quite nicely.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>I started my first month and the results have been incredible.</li>
            <li>After reading their customers&#x27; reviews I decided to order three bottles and was impressed with the early delivery.</li>
            <li>have used many of the popular hair growth products on the market.</li>
            <li>The growth is coming out so nice and lovely.</li>
            <li>I’m amazed and could cry tears of joy right now</li>
            <li>I am hoping for the best but so far I am just glad I am seeing something happening.</li>
            <li>so if you’re thinking of trying it then give it a fair shot and do the full 3 months.</li>
            <li>so I tried this product based on the great positive feedback.</li>
            <li>What a huge confidence boost!</li>
            <li>but I gotta say that I am very happy with the results especially because my hair is now thicker than it used to be and</li>
            <li>I love it and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I have been balding at the top of my head for years and decided to try this product since it was recommended to me by a friend.</li>
            <li>so much more TRIED TO GET THE REBATE</li>
            <li>The vitamins in it seem to give me more energy too...</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Not yet seen any change need more time.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t able to return since I&#x27;ve had a while.</li>
            <li>I really want this product to work as there are so many people with great things to say</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not even sure about that.  </li>
            <li>Stand by  :)  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t create more hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try, though.</li>
            <li>I have tried many solutions for hair loss, combs, treatments, oils, you name</li>
            <li>but I’ve had great hair my whole life</li>
            <li>I am very happy to see something finally work for me</li>
            <li>I am now on week 6 and can feel my hair getting thicker, as if it is retaining more moisture.</li>
            <li>have used for a week but no control in my hair loss, probably it needs some more time to work for my hair loss.</li>
            <li>My husband ordered this product and he is completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far… it’s a good quality product and the company seems to care about its customers which is rather rare these days.</li>
            <li>I’ll admit and say I am not the healthiest person and my hair has been receding for many years</li>
            <li>I did read many reviews</li>
            <li>but as I started using this it began to have more volume and it did look MUCH better this way.</li>
            <li>well satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad to have found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair had a bit more shine to it, felt thicker and softer.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>so I wasn’t sure if it would work for me</li>
            <li>but I missed the refund date as I was trying to use all the product to make sure it worked to give it the benefit of doubt.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients in this product are very good and have helped me tremendously with reducing my hair loss and helping me regrow healthy new hair.</li>
            <li>I read that these are all factors and it is important to maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle to get the most out of a product like this.</li>
            <li>If you are having troubles with your hair and it&#x27;s health or growth, I urge you to give these a try and to go for the full 3 month deal!</li>
            <li>I need more time to really put an honest review up.</li>
            <li>If you are born with fine hair, that is in your DNA.</li>
            <li>You cannot change the structure of your hair, but you can improve on the quality, health, and strength of fine hair by using this product.</li>
            <li>so it was fine.</li>
            <li>but I must be one of the lucky ones because 10 days in my hair started to change for the better.</li>
            <li>I reordered from amazon because their shipping  is quick!</li>
            <li>I have used the product for 3 weeks and my hair has improved in texture and length, but best of all I see some new hair growth happening near a thinned-out area of my scalp.</li>
            <li>Well,  I made a huge mistake of stopping and started taking a prenatal.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, she has been using DasGro Hair Formula for 6 months and has been seeing some fantastic results.</li>
            <li>To be honest I didn’t really think a tablet would work</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure the product would work, but after reading the ingredient list I thought it would be worth a try just for the vitamins.  </li>
            <li>purchased for my self and daughter her bald patch has filled in within a 2 week period</li>
            <li>It was a great decision, only 2 weeks after using the product my hair stopped falling out.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I am very grateful to have found such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>This is a very good natural product and I highly recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li>but once it did I quickly noticed a change (for the better) and can say that the improvement has been worth the 3 months of using this product.</li>
            <li>For me it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>That was good since I was anxious to try it based on a large number of great reviews.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, at the end of the three months I&#x27;ll have a more positive review.  </li>
            <li>my first bottle was good most of second bottle looks like this.</li>
            <li>but I’m thrilled with these early signs of progress.</li>
            <li>At this point I am pleased that my hair loss has been noticeably reduced for which I am very thankful.  </li>
            <li>I think I am now her favorite grandchild because she absolutely loves the results.</li>
            <li>but surprisingly her hair has seen a night and day improvement since starting.</li>
            <li>The hair was doing fairly well until I went to the salon last week</li>
            <li>and I can’t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>My friend recently asked what I had been doing to improve my hairline, it felt good to have someone notice.</li>
            <li>It really is a fantastic product and worth the try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m praying every day that I will get the full benefits of these hair vitamins.  </li>
            <li>It has done a lot of good for my hair and in a short period of time too.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think much of it, kept telling myself i need to order more, until 2 weeks went by</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best hair loss solution for me.</li>
            <li>Now, the hair at my crown is back and better, thicker, and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I know not everyone is this lucky to have something work for them</li>
            <li>I am lucky that I had a lot of hair to begin with otherwise</li>
            <li>During this time I made sure to keep a healthy lifestyle to make sure I wasn’t hindering my chances by drinking, smoking or getting too little sleep.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I have not been taking them long to give a good report.</li>
            <li>My hair is being treated to the maxium amount of vitamins and minerals needed to maintain a fresh head full of hair</li>
            <li>Well, 2 months in and the bald spot on the top of my head is growing new peach fuzz hair that seems to be getting longer.</li>
            <li>this is the product you need -- It really works!!</li>
            <li>I started taking them the second week in January and already the result is amazing.  </li>
            <li>What I can say is that this has alot of fillers and may not be worth it.  </li>
            <li>so I knew that overnight results are rare</li>
            <li>I decided I needed to try something more natural and</li>
            <li>I researched many hair loss products on the market, some seemed good but what drew me to this product was that it was natural and didn’t contain the fillers, chemicals and preservatives like some other products.</li>
            <li>My hair has fully stopped falling out and the new hair growth has continued and is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Not sure if anyone else experienced this &amp;#34;side affect&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The roots are coming out so shiny and healthy that I can hardly recognize my own hair</li>
            <li>Most exciting was the new hair growth that started on my third week,, my most problematic areas started to grow new</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did because I am finally seeing results.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s working , though slowly</li>
            <li>i have alopecia and tried many different treatments…….</li>
            <li>Give it the full 3 months and really let the product work and who knows, it may work much faster for you.</li>
            <li>Finished my first 3-month supply.</li>
            <li>I did notice on the first day of taking this, my urine color changed dramatically.</li>
            <li>bought a three month supply and still haven&#x27;t finished the first bottle.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Just about finished the first of three bottles and do not see any difference.  </li>
            <li>I just finished the first bottle today.</li>
            <li>First week</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping for the same type of results and even better.</li>
            <li>but I had to because they really do work!</li>
            <li>At first I thought nothing was growing</li>
            <li>I learned that many of the ingredients found in this product do indeed have the potential to regrow hair.</li>
            <li>I have been losing my hair for years, mostly from stress and not getting enough nutrients from my diet.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that the product worked much better at the end of the 2nd month</li>
            <li>Right now I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>but I read so many positive reviews on DasGro that I decided to try it and see if it actually did anything.</li>
            <li>I see new growth in the temple areas after the first bottle , I think it&#x60;s working !</li>
            <li>This is definitely a product worth trying if you’re someone who needs an effective and natural way to deal with hair loss or if you just want healthier hair in general.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered this from the company direct, after a month of using it I noticed I wasn&#x27;t losing as much hair, after a couple months I noticed the hair I had lost was coming back in, very exciting!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to do much</li>
            <li>I was really hoping.</li>
            <li>It took about 6 weeks to really see any difference in my hair volume and texture.</li>
            <li>but I have not seen much hair growth.</li>
            <li>and I still have not seen much hair growth.</li>
            <li>This product really works and I can’t see myself without it.</li>
            <li>will be hearing from my lawyer very soon</li>
            <li>I have very stubborn hair loss</li>
            <li>and this has been working better than expected.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to give it a real chance to work</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really think it&#x27;s helping as I had thyroid cancer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li>Some cost me thousands of dollars and did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>It wasn’t much</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m my 4th bottle in and haven&#x27;t noticed any real results.  </li>
            <li>so I didn’t really think anything could help much (given her age)</li>
            <li>I haven’t had this much hair since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>My hair has been restored to a much healthier state</li>
            <li>so I do recommend being patient and allowing it time to really kick in.</li>
            <li>I was really upset that I had to cut all off all my hair.</li>
            <li>Just finished my first bottle &amp; New hair growth  has begun at the hair line.</li>
            <li>It’s been slow and steady but any progress is good progress.</li>
            <li>I will come back and update once I am done a full 3 months.</li>
            <li>I decided I would finish a full 90 days but to my utter astonishment I started seeing progress on my 4th week of using it.</li>
            <li>I used it for the full 3 months and my biggest leap was towards the end of my second bottle.</li>
            <li>I am excited to say that new hairs are growing around my receding hairline after only 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>If new growth begins I will change my rating to five stars!  </li>
            <li>after using it for one month I see improvement in hair growth and condition, and my hairdresser, who recommended it because my hair had become dry and thinning, confirmed it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>After using DasGro Hair Formula I am noticing less hair loss and better texture.  </li>
            <li>, some are lucky enough to get it</li>
            <li>but it was better than what I was getting with much more expensive treatments.</li>
            <li>Still using with decent results.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest this for those looking for something that works without the side effects.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations and hopes for those products</li>
            <li>how many things I have tried with little to no results.</li>
            <li>Hopeful that it may take a little more to jump start the process.  </li>
            <li>At the end of my first month I barely noticed any hair loss at all!</li>
            <li>I have not seen any side effects in the time I&#x27;ve been using it and find it easy to take compared to some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>so expecting it to grow back that fast is not being very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I really owe it to DasGro Hair Formula, a big thanks!</li>
            <li>My husband even noticed all the new little hairs on top of my head.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any indication yet that new growth has begun.  </li>
            <li>I see new hair growth.</li>
            <li>The thinning areas are getting thicker and my hair line is showing new growth.  </li>
            <li>Am hoping to continue to see improvement with new hair growth,</li>
            <li>and I had alot of new growth all around my front hairline.</li>
            <li>I am seeing some new hair growth, coming in darker</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product if you need a natural hair growth solution that delivers results.</li>
            <li>Give it at least 60 days, that seemed to do the trick for me, the first month was a bit slow but it seemed to work better and better</li>
            <li>After my first 3 months of using this product I&#x27;ve noticed new hair growth especially around the hairline area.</li>
            <li>I am on my third bottle of this formula and will continue using it at a maintenance level, once I am confident that my hair is back to a constant growing mode.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I&#x27;m not pleased with is that many of the tablets are cracked.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying WOW!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend giving Das Gro a try if you need a product that delivers fast results!</li>
            <li>It has completely stopped falling out and is growing in thicker and longer!</li>
            <li>I began taking them right away but not consistently and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in hair fall or new hair growth.</li>
            <li>Guessing the old dormant hair is falling out and new hair is growing from the roots.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sort of hard to see the top of my head to see new growth</li>
            <li>I am a black female with hair thinning on the sides and top.  </li>
            <li>sure enough my hair actually felt thicker and looked much fuller, I also noticed less hair in the shower drain.</li>
            <li>here’s another one but after doing some research I decided to give it a try because of the natural ingredients and lack of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I chose this because of the review rating and the natural non-chemical blend.  </li>
            <li>Will complete sixty day supply.</li>
            <li>and I thought maybe a natural product like this might help.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using DasGro for 3 months I completely stopped losing my hair.</li>
            <li>I had devoted all of my time and energy into my 3 year old, my hair health had started to faulter.</li>
            <li>I honestly don’t understand some of the negative reviews complaining after only having used the product for a week or two, after all, your hair didn’t fall out in a week</li>
            <li>I have been on it for 3 months and my hair does look better AND no more hair in the sink!</li>
            <li>I had a small bald spot on the top of my head forming and this helped recover most of the hair in only a few short months.</li>
            <li>Long story short I have been using DasGro Hair Formula for 90 days and a lot of the thin areas have filled in and the rest of my hair has thickened up to the point where I can feel confident again.</li>
            <li>The tablets in two of the three bottles were swollen and cracked as if they had been in a very humid environment and not in dry Arizona where I live.</li>
            <li>I was initially going to give up after only the first month</li>
            <li>In the last 6 months my hair started to fall out more than usual.</li>
            <li>I was losing a little hair, my jacket was always full of hair.</li>
            <li>It is still too early to know if the new hair will stick around or grow further</li>
            <li>No more clogging the drain and my hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>When I read about this hair supplement, I was estacic because I knew just having it short would not be enough to get my hair back on the right track.</li>
            <li>She had some bald areas that started to show over the last few years that now those bald areas have completely filled in.</li>
            <li>I figured I would be optimistic after reading the reviews - I am now on my 2nd 90 day purchase of DasGro and in day 145, I must say unfortunately, no improvement or any noticeable changes -  I understand each person will receive different results, and I haven&#x27;t finished my second 90 day regiment -</li>
            <li>I finally found a natural product that works!</li>
            <li>This product does the job like no other.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and have had thinning hair since giving birth in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I am a 63 year old female with thining hair at temples.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned about potential side effects but so far there hasn’t been any to report.</li>
            <li>My hair is mostly just thin</li>
            <li>second week I feel my hair is thicker, third week I can tell I’m no longer rapidly losing my hair and by the fourth week I see tiny new hairs near my temples and on my receding hairline!!</li>
            <li>In my case, it wasn&#x27;t until the 3rd bottle that I noticed any new hair growth but it did finally start to happen.</li>
            <li>About 20 days in, I noticed my receding hair line started to show new activity… little new hairs!</li>
            <li>I have very stubborn hair loss and have tried at least a dozen different products… I wasn’t expecting much with this one</li>
            <li>After using it my hair is thick and full and I am still seeing improvement every week.</li>
            <li>My wife and hair stylist say they see new growth, but I would say it&#x27;s minimal at this point.</li>
            <li>I have natural kinky hair and after two children I was faced with what we Jamaicans call ‘pick out hair, dry head syndrome’.</li>
            <li>The hair shedding is nearly gone and tiny little new hairs popping up on my scalp everywhere.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that was beginning to thin at the crown.</li>
            <li>I have been told my hair appears thicker which would be noticeable  because I have baby fine thin hair</li>

            <li> Started my 4th bottle and honestly I wish I was noticing results.  </li>
            <li> Okay, not as good as what I thought.</li>
            <li> She is very happy with the results and really wanted me to pass that on to the folks at dasgro.</li>
            <li> After 2 months my hair has stopped falling out and has thickened up quite nicely.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> I started my first month and the results have been incredible.</li>
            <li> After reading their customers&#x27; reviews I decided to order three bottles and was impressed with the early delivery.</li>
            <li> have used many of the popular hair growth products on the market.</li>
            <li> The growth is coming out so nice and lovely.</li>
            <li> I’m amazed and could cry tears of joy right now</li>
            <li> I am hoping for the best but so far I am just glad I am seeing something happening.</li>
            <li> so if you’re thinking of trying it then give it a fair shot and do the full 3 months.</li>
            <li> so I tried this product based on the great positive feedback.</li>
            <li> What a huge confidence boost!</li>
            <li> but I gotta say that I am very happy with the results especially because my hair is now thicker than it used to be and</li>
            <li> I love it and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have been balding at the top of my head for years and decided to try this product since it was recommended to me by a friend.</li>
            <li> so much more TRIED TO GET THE REBATE</li>
            <li> The vitamins in it seem to give me more energy too...</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Not yet seen any change need more time.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t able to return since I&#x27;ve had a while.</li>
            <li> I really want this product to work as there are so many people with great things to say</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not even sure about that.  </li>
            <li> Stand by  :)  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t create more hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try, though.</li>
            <li> I have tried many solutions for hair loss, combs, treatments, oils, you name</li>
            <li> but I’ve had great hair my whole life</li>
            <li> I am very happy to see something finally work for me</li>
            <li> I am now on week 6 and can feel my hair getting thicker, as if it is retaining more moisture.</li>
            <li> have used for a week but no control in my hair loss, probably it needs some more time to work for my hair loss.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this product and he is completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far… it’s a good quality product and the company seems to care about its customers which is rather rare these days.</li>
            <li> I’ll admit and say I am not the healthiest person and my hair has been receding for many years</li>
            <li> I did read many reviews</li>
            <li> but as I started using this it began to have more volume and it did look MUCH better this way.</li>
            <li> well satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad to have found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair had a bit more shine to it, felt thicker and softer.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> so I wasn’t sure if it would work for me</li>
            <li> but I missed the refund date as I was trying to use all the product to make sure it worked to give it the benefit of doubt.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product are very good and have helped me tremendously with reducing my hair loss and helping me regrow healthy new hair.</li>
            <li> I read that these are all factors and it is important to maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle to get the most out of a product like this.</li>
            <li> If you are having troubles with your hair and it&#x27;s health or growth, I urge you to give these a try and to go for the full 3 month deal!</li>
            <li> I need more time to really put an honest review up.</li>
            <li> If you are born with fine hair, that is in your DNA.</li>
            <li> You cannot change the structure of your hair, but you can improve on the quality, health, and strength of fine hair by using this product.</li>
            <li> so it was fine.</li>
            <li> but I must be one of the lucky ones because 10 days in my hair started to change for the better.</li>
            <li> I reordered from amazon because their shipping  is quick!</li>
            <li> I have used the product for 3 weeks and my hair has improved in texture and length, but best of all I see some new hair growth happening near a thinned-out area of my scalp.</li>
            <li> Well,  I made a huge mistake of stopping and started taking a prenatal.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, she has been using DasGro Hair Formula for 6 months and has been seeing some fantastic results.</li>
            <li> To be honest I didn’t really think a tablet would work</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure the product would work, but after reading the ingredient list I thought it would be worth a try just for the vitamins.  </li>
            <li> purchased for my self and daughter her bald patch has filled in within a 2 week period</li>
            <li> It was a great decision, only 2 weeks after using the product my hair stopped falling out.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I am very grateful to have found such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good natural product and I highly recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li> but once it did I quickly noticed a change (for the better) and can say that the improvement has been worth the 3 months of using this product.</li>
            <li> For me it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> That was good since I was anxious to try it based on a large number of great reviews.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, at the end of the three months I&#x27;ll have a more positive review.  </li>
            <li> my first bottle was good most of second bottle looks like this.</li>
            <li> but I’m thrilled with these early signs of progress.</li>
            <li> At this point I am pleased that my hair loss has been noticeably reduced for which I am very thankful.  </li>
            <li> I think I am now her favorite grandchild because she absolutely loves the results.</li>
            <li> but surprisingly her hair has seen a night and day improvement since starting.</li>
            <li> The hair was doing fairly well until I went to the salon last week</li>
            <li> and I can’t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> My friend recently asked what I had been doing to improve my hairline, it felt good to have someone notice.</li>
            <li> It really is a fantastic product and worth the try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m praying every day that I will get the full benefits of these hair vitamins.  </li>
            <li> It has done a lot of good for my hair and in a short period of time too.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think much of it, kept telling myself i need to order more, until 2 weeks went by</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best hair loss solution for me.</li>
            <li> Now, the hair at my crown is back and better, thicker, and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I know not everyone is this lucky to have something work for them</li>
            <li> I am lucky that I had a lot of hair to begin with otherwise</li>
            <li> During this time I made sure to keep a healthy lifestyle to make sure I wasn’t hindering my chances by drinking, smoking or getting too little sleep.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I have not been taking them long to give a good report.</li>
            <li> My hair is being treated to the maxium amount of vitamins and minerals needed to maintain a fresh head full of hair</li>
            <li> Well, 2 months in and the bald spot on the top of my head is growing new peach fuzz hair that seems to be getting longer.</li>
            <li> this is the product you need -- It really works!!</li>
            <li> I started taking them the second week in January and already the result is amazing.  </li>
            <li> What I can say is that this has alot of fillers and may not be worth it.  </li>
            <li> so I knew that overnight results are rare</li>
            <li> I decided I needed to try something more natural and</li>
            <li> I researched many hair loss products on the market, some seemed good but what drew me to this product was that it was natural and didn’t contain the fillers, chemicals and preservatives like some other products.</li>
            <li> My hair has fully stopped falling out and the new hair growth has continued and is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Not sure if anyone else experienced this &amp;#34;side affect&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The roots are coming out so shiny and healthy that I can hardly recognize my own hair</li>
            <li> Most exciting was the new hair growth that started on my third week,, my most problematic areas started to grow new</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did because I am finally seeing results.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s working , though slowly</li>
            <li> i have alopecia and tried many different treatments…….</li>
            <li> Give it the full 3 months and really let the product work and who knows, it may work much faster for you.</li>
            <li> Finished my first 3-month supply.</li>
            <li> I did notice on the first day of taking this, my urine color changed dramatically.</li>
            <li> bought a three month supply and still haven&#x27;t finished the first bottle.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Just about finished the first of three bottles and do not see any difference.  </li>
            <li> I just finished the first bottle today.</li>
            <li> First week</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping for the same type of results and even better.</li>
            <li> but I had to because they really do work!</li>
            <li> At first I thought nothing was growing</li>
            <li> I learned that many of the ingredients found in this product do indeed have the potential to regrow hair.</li>
            <li> I have been losing my hair for years, mostly from stress and not getting enough nutrients from my diet.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that the product worked much better at the end of the 2nd month</li>
            <li> Right now I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> but I read so many positive reviews on DasGro that I decided to try it and see if it actually did anything.</li>
            <li> I see new growth in the temple areas after the first bottle , I think it&#x60;s working !</li>
            <li> This is definitely a product worth trying if you’re someone who needs an effective and natural way to deal with hair loss or if you just want healthier hair in general.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this from the company direct, after a month of using it I noticed I wasn&#x27;t losing as much hair, after a couple months I noticed the hair I had lost was coming back in, very exciting!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to do much</li>
            <li> I was really hoping.</li>
            <li> It took about 6 weeks to really see any difference in my hair volume and texture.</li>
            <li> but I have not seen much hair growth.</li>
            <li> and I still have not seen much hair growth.</li>
            <li> This product really works and I can’t see myself without it.</li>
            <li> will be hearing from my lawyer very soon</li>
            <li> I have very stubborn hair loss</li>
            <li> and this has been working better than expected.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to give it a real chance to work</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really think it&#x27;s helping as I had thyroid cancer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> Some cost me thousands of dollars and did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> It wasn’t much</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m my 4th bottle in and haven&#x27;t noticed any real results.  </li>
            <li> so I didn’t really think anything could help much (given her age)</li>
            <li> I haven’t had this much hair since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> My hair has been restored to a much healthier state</li>
            <li> so I do recommend being patient and allowing it time to really kick in.</li>
            <li> I was really upset that I had to cut all off all my hair.</li>
            <li> Just finished my first bottle &amp; New hair growth  has begun at the hair line.</li>
            <li> It’s been slow and steady but any progress is good progress.</li>
            <li> I will come back and update once I am done a full 3 months.</li>
            <li> I decided I would finish a full 90 days but to my utter astonishment I started seeing progress on my 4th week of using it.</li>
            <li> I used it for the full 3 months and my biggest leap was towards the end of my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I am excited to say that new hairs are growing around my receding hairline after only 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> If new growth begins I will change my rating to five stars!  </li>
            <li> after using it for one month I see improvement in hair growth and condition, and my hairdresser, who recommended it because my hair had become dry and thinning, confirmed it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> After using DasGro Hair Formula I am noticing less hair loss and better texture.  </li>
            <li> , some are lucky enough to get it</li>
            <li> but it was better than what I was getting with much more expensive treatments.</li>
            <li> Still using with decent results.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest this for those looking for something that works without the side effects.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations and hopes for those products</li>
            <li> how many things I have tried with little to no results.</li>
            <li> Hopeful that it may take a little more to jump start the process.  </li>
            <li> At the end of my first month I barely noticed any hair loss at all!</li>
            <li> I have not seen any side effects in the time I&#x27;ve been using it and find it easy to take compared to some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> so expecting it to grow back that fast is not being very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I really owe it to DasGro Hair Formula, a big thanks!</li>
            <li> My husband even noticed all the new little hairs on top of my head.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any indication yet that new growth has begun.  </li>
            <li> I see new hair growth.</li>
            <li> The thinning areas are getting thicker and my hair line is showing new growth.  </li>
            <li> Am hoping to continue to see improvement with new hair growth,</li>
            <li> and I had alot of new growth all around my front hairline.</li>
            <li> I am seeing some new hair growth, coming in darker</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product if you need a natural hair growth solution that delivers results.</li>
            <li> Give it at least 60 days, that seemed to do the trick for me, the first month was a bit slow but it seemed to work better and better</li>
            <li> After my first 3 months of using this product I&#x27;ve noticed new hair growth especially around the hairline area.</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle of this formula and will continue using it at a maintenance level, once I am confident that my hair is back to a constant growing mode.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I&#x27;m not pleased with is that many of the tablets are cracked.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying WOW!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend giving Das Gro a try if you need a product that delivers fast results!</li>
            <li> It has completely stopped falling out and is growing in thicker and longer!</li>
            <li> I began taking them right away but not consistently and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in hair fall or new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Guessing the old dormant hair is falling out and new hair is growing from the roots.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of hard to see the top of my head to see new growth</li>
            <li> I am a black female with hair thinning on the sides and top.  </li>
            <li> sure enough my hair actually felt thicker and looked much fuller, I also noticed less hair in the shower drain.</li>
            <li> here’s another one but after doing some research I decided to give it a try because of the natural ingredients and lack of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I chose this because of the review rating and the natural non-chemical blend.  </li>
            <li> Will complete sixty day supply.</li>
            <li> and I thought maybe a natural product like this might help.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using DasGro for 3 months I completely stopped losing my hair.</li>
            <li> I had devoted all of my time and energy into my 3 year old, my hair health had started to faulter.</li>
            <li> I honestly don’t understand some of the negative reviews complaining after only having used the product for a week or two, after all, your hair didn’t fall out in a week</li>
            <li> I have been on it for 3 months and my hair does look better AND no more hair in the sink!</li>
            <li> I had a small bald spot on the top of my head forming and this helped recover most of the hair in only a few short months.</li>
            <li> Long story short I have been using DasGro Hair Formula for 90 days and a lot of the thin areas have filled in and the rest of my hair has thickened up to the point where I can feel confident again.</li>
            <li> The tablets in two of the three bottles were swollen and cracked as if they had been in a very humid environment and not in dry Arizona where I live.</li>
            <li> I was initially going to give up after only the first month</li>
            <li> In the last 6 months my hair started to fall out more than usual.</li>
            <li> I was losing a little hair, my jacket was always full of hair.</li>
            <li> It is still too early to know if the new hair will stick around or grow further</li>
            <li> No more clogging the drain and my hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> When I read about this hair supplement, I was estacic because I knew just having it short would not be enough to get my hair back on the right track.</li>
            <li> She had some bald areas that started to show over the last few years that now those bald areas have completely filled in.</li>
            <li> I figured I would be optimistic after reading the reviews - I am now on my 2nd 90 day purchase of DasGro and in day 145, I must say unfortunately, no improvement or any noticeable changes -  I understand each person will receive different results, and I haven&#x27;t finished my second 90 day regiment -</li>
            <li> I finally found a natural product that works!</li>
            <li> This product does the job like no other.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and have had thinning hair since giving birth in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am a 63 year old female with thining hair at temples.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned about potential side effects but so far there hasn’t been any to report.</li>
            <li> My hair is mostly just thin</li>
            <li> second week I feel my hair is thicker, third week I can tell I’m no longer rapidly losing my hair and by the fourth week I see tiny new hairs near my temples and on my receding hairline!!</li>
            <li> In my case, it wasn&#x27;t until the 3rd bottle that I noticed any new hair growth but it did finally start to happen.</li>
            <li> About 20 days in, I noticed my receding hair line started to show new activity… little new hairs!</li>
            <li> I have very stubborn hair loss and have tried at least a dozen different products… I wasn’t expecting much with this one</li>
            <li> After using it my hair is thick and full and I am still seeing improvement every week.</li>
            <li> My wife and hair stylist say they see new growth, but I would say it&#x27;s minimal at this point.</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky hair and after two children I was faced with what we Jamaicans call ‘pick out hair, dry head syndrome’.</li>
            <li> The hair shedding is nearly gone and tiny little new hairs popping up on my scalp everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that was beginning to thin at the crown.</li>
            <li> I have been told my hair appears thicker which would be noticeable  because I have baby fine thin hair</li>
            <li> - I was looking for less fall out, and new hair growth, and a possible thickness increase -  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact it has natural ingredients that don’t cause side effects like the other products out there.</li>
            <li> I noticed less shedding and new growth around my temples.</li>
            <li> I’m noticing new hair growth on my scalp which previously wasn’t there.</li>
            <li> I lost all hope until I started on DasGro, after 22 days I found little new hairs on my bald spots but actually felt it working even before.</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> to haven&#x27;t been taking long enough.</li>
            <li> I used it for a month and the hair on my head is GROWING and little new hairs are popping up in areas that haven’t seen hair in years.</li>
            <li> I am only on my 4th month of taking these, so I think it is a little too early to say they are or are not having an effect on my hair yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go bold soon since I already have baby thin hair on some spots.</li>
            <li> All the tablets are broken open and I&#x27;m not sure they are safe to use....</li>
            <li> BACK ADDRESS UNKNOWN</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep ordering as long as it keeps working.</li>
            <li> I felt my hair loss reduced and after a week I could physically see less hair in all the places I mentioned earlier.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I will continue with the treatment, but once this last bottle is empty I may try a different, less costly, formulation.  </li>
            <li> but I would highly recommend at least trying this before spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on some of the harsher treatments out there.</li>
            <li> After using DasGro for only two days, I noticed that I was only getting a few strands out during my morning brushing!</li>
            <li> I have only been taking this less than a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go ahead and finish out the course, but not very hopeful at this point.</li>
            <li> Dasgro arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> My hair is a bit stronger, not really fuller.</li>
            <li> My hair have not seen much difference will give it time I must say I do have peach fuzz in my thin areas that is a start, and my nails are stronger.</li>
            <li> I have a number of little hairs that seem to be new growth, but not sure if they will grow or fall out.  </li>
            <li> ordered this because other products have given me horrible reactions and a natural product seemed like the next plausible step.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommed this for people with thin hair and of course hair loss.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing thinning hair as a woman at 40 due to hormonal issues.  </li>
            <li> My grandma wanted me to share her experience with this product due to her inability to use the computer all too well.</li>
            <li> and I can’t even be around other people because I have no confidence anymore.</li>
            <li> I was having a lot of hair loss due to stress and hormones.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment yet due</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been juicing organic Mung sprouts and other vegetables to fight this diagnosis as well.</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> Usually my hair looks very flat</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I know everyone is different so for some it might work faster and for some slower but considering all the garbage out there at least this does something.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but within two weeks I could see tiny hairs growing in previously bare areas on my head.  </li>
            <li> Hair continued to fall out, with no stoping/slowing down of process.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my grandma, she is 73 and has been a bit down about losing her hair.</li>
            <li> if you have hair loss, whether it’s genetic or caused by stress or some other cause then give it a try!</li>
            <li> work half</li>
            <li> Maybe less hair shedding</li>
            <li> Not Showing one sign of working 1 and a half bottles in</li>
            <li> Before it was a nappy, frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> Hair maybe a little softer, and hair seems to fall less.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait until a few months down the line when my hair will be thicker as it grows.</li>
            <li> I also thought it might cause me some issues with my stomach due to past complications</li>
            <li> I can’t wait to see what will happen after a few months.</li>
            <li> My hair is still parsed in the back and thin.  </li>
            <li> She has thinning African ethnic hair that breaks easily especially during cold weather but also year round.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to try it, but after using it for a few months I can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I will update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I just ordered another supply and I don’t think I’ll ever stop using it because I can’t go back to my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I work a stressful job and over the years, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has started to thin out and even fall out as a result of the constant stress.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on this product if I were you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked to see that within the first 10 days I felt and saw a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> That being said, I don&#x27;t believe overnight solutions exist, at least not for hair loss, so the slow progress was to be expected.</li>
            <li> i ordered this on a whim because at this point I was desperate for some type of solution and this was relatively cheaper than the other stuff I was trying.</li>
            <li> It has helped restore my hair, used to be very dry and horribly thin and now has stopped falling out, and improved in thickness.</li>
            <li> It worked to prevent hair loss, and it helped my nails grow, but after 3 months I saw very little hair growth.</li>
            <li> Seen very little change.  </li>
            <li> pills are expensive and do next to nothing to promote the stoppage of hair loss and hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> FAKE PHONE NUMBER DOES NOT ANSWER DISCONNECTED.SHIPPED BACK TO THEM FOR REBATE CAME</li>
            <li> I am a big believer in dasgro and ill continue using it.</li>
            <li> I lost count of how many products I have used to help me with my terrible thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I am totally floored by these results and don’t have a single bad thing to say about it.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical when it comes to anything organic or natural because it usually is just a bunch of hype</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time swallowing pills</li>
            <li> I order 3 months at a time and wish they were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> (30 days)  since my hair is thinning but no bald spots yet, hard to tell.</li>
            <li> At least one bottle had all cracked pills in it, though I don&#x27;t think that should&#x27;ve affected their usefulness.</li>
            <li> Up until that time it was rather slow to kick in</li>
            <li> Although I went to a few hair expert&#x27;s and used their recommended products which were expensive, they didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I had to do a double take because I was so shocked at what I was seeing.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced side effects or anything that would concern me.</li>
            <li> Not hopeful at this time, hope I&#x27;m wrong.</li>
            <li> .. sorry...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Then menopause kicked and made things so much worse!</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m afraid</li>
            <li> I know it’s crazy because it’s just hair</li>
            <li> after i done taking my 9 month course my hair started to fall like crazy again.</li>
            <li> Got sick 4 days into it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen anything :(</li>
            <li> but a reduction of my wallet 99.00 x 2  :(  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am excited to say that new hairs are growing around my receding hairline after only 4 weeks. I can’t wait to see what will happen after a few months.</li>
            <li> Effective without side effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this because other products have given me horrible reactions and a natural product seemed like the next plausible step. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to do much but I gotta say that I am very happy with the results especially because my hair is now thicker than it used to be and no side effects this time!!</li>
            <li> Not only was my hair lost, but also the $120 plus for a 3 month supply. I was really hoping.</li>
            <li> DasGro Hair Formula has worked well for me. It took about 6 weeks to really see any difference in my hair volume and texture. I have fine hair that was beginning to thin at the crown. Now, the hair at my crown is back and better, thicker, and more manageable. If you are born with fine hair, that is in your DNA. You cannot change the structure of your hair, but you can improve on the quality, health, and strength of fine hair by using this product. I am on my third bottle of this formula and will continue using it at a maintenance level, once I am confident that my hair is back to a constant growing mode.</li>
            <li> I like that it has stopped my hair from falling out but I have not seen much hair growth. I emailed you one time before and you said to up my protein so I did and I still have not seen much hair growth. Is there anything else I can do?</li>
            <li> I started my first month and the results have been incredible. I noticed less shedding and new growth around my temples. I’m very happy I decided to buy.</li>
            <li> After a ton of research I decided on dasgro hair formula and have not looked back since. The product has exceeded my expectations in every way. I thought it would take months to work but within a week I started seeing results. I also thought it might cause me some issues with my stomach due to past complications but NOPE, nothing at all except hair growth! This product really works and I can’t see myself without it.</li>
            <li> I lost all hope until I started on DasGro, after 22 days I found little new hairs on my bald spots but actually felt it working even before. Amazing product that provides amazing results!!!</li>
            <li> It worked to prevent hair loss, and it helped my nails grow, but after 3 months I saw very little hair growth. I will not continue using this product. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Dasgro has been working for my hair, it&#x27;s thicker, stronger and growing like never before. I love it and will be ordering more. I have not seen any side effects in the time I&#x27;ve been using it and find it easy to take compared to some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have been balding at the top of my head for years and decided to try this product since it was recommended to me by a friend. Well, 2 months in and the bald spot on the top of my head is growing new peach fuzz hair that seems to be getting longer. I am hoping for the best but so far I am just glad I am seeing something happening.</li>
            <li> Got sick 4 days into it</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product are very good and have helped me tremendously with reducing my hair loss and helping me regrow healthy new hair. I like that the product is made in the united states and not somewhere overseas. I also like the fact it has natural ingredients that don’t cause side effects like the other products out there. DasGro Hair Formula works and if you have hair loss, whether it’s genetic or caused by stress or some other cause then give it a try!</li>
            <li> I only gave this one star for the moment,  will monitor it and will update my review.  I must say I have not seen any improvement in my hair.  What I can say is that this has alot of fillers and may not be worth it.  Stay tuned for my update at which time if it is necessary I will raise the stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks and I’m starting to notice some results. I know it can take some time but honestly, I’m happy to see some progress with DasGrogiven how many things I have tried with little to no results. I will come back and update once I am done a full 3 months. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I’ve been getting AMAZING results using this and haven’t noticed any side effects when on it. I would highly suggest this for those looking for something that works without the side effects.</li>
            <li> When I came across this product I thought, yeah here’s another one but after doing some research I decided to give it a try because of the natural ingredients and lack of chemicals. I have natural kinky hair and after two children I was faced with what we Jamaicans call ‘pick out hair, dry head syndrome’. My hair line was none existent and after experimenting with all types of products, I had chemical damage which resulted in the dryness. DasGro not only gave me back my shine but after two months I saw my hair line growing back, now people may expect an overnight result, some are lucky enough to get it but with any good thing it is a process and I am happy to say after continuous use, I no longer have the dryness and I can actually pull my hair back and not be self-conscious about my hairline. It is an amazing product that works well and I would recommend it to anyone who had similar problems with hair loss. I introduced it to my friend who had the scalp condition Folliculitis and it works for her as well.</li>
            <li> I have very stubborn hair loss and have tried at least a dozen different products… I wasn’t expecting much with this one but I decided to try it out and now on my third week I’m noticing new hair growth on my scalp which previously wasn’t there. It is still too early to know if the new hair will stick around or grow further but I’m thrilled with these early signs of progress.</li>
            <li> Been on dash to for 1 month.  Seen very little change.  Hair maybe a little softer, and hair seems to fall less.  I&#x27;m going finish my 3 months, since that is the recommended time for best results.  Not hopeful at this time, hope I&#x27;m wrong.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. Hair continued to fall out, with no stoping/slowing down of process. pills are expensive and do next to nothing to promote the stoppage of hair loss and hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> nothing so far.expected so much more TRIED TO GET THE REBATE THEY PROMISED.TRIED CALLING THERE FAKE PHONE NUMBER DOES NOT ANSWER DISCONNECTED.SHIPPED BACK TO THEM FOR REBATE CAME BACK ADDRESS UNKNOWN..dont do it it is a scam.they will be hearing from my lawyer very soon</li>
            <li> I was worried that if my hair didn’t stop falling out that I would soon need a wig!!! I used this and within weeks my hair started to grow again! I didn’t change anything else in my daily routine so I know it’s dasgro that is doing it. This is the best thing I have ever used for my hair and highly recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell.  I ordered three bottles, a three month supply.  I am into the second month.  I have a number of little hairs that seem to be new growth, but not sure if they will grow or fall out.  I will probably give it a six month trial.</li>
            <li> As a hairdresser I take it myself and recommend it to a lot of clients that are looking for an effective supplement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good product. My hair getting fuller. No side effect.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to see results you must be on this formula for 90 days.  I&#x27;ve just passed the 90 days and see no improvement at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DasGro as recommended for seven weeks.  I will continue to use it for the entire three months.  At this point I am pleased that my hair loss has been noticeably reduced for which I am very thankful.  I have not seen any indication yet that new growth has begun.  If new growth begins I will change my rating to five stars!  I realize that each individual is different and for some it takes longer.  The one thing that I&#x27;m not pleased with is that many of the tablets are cracked.  Hopefully, at the end of the three months I&#x27;ll have a more positive review.  I did take a photo before beginning DasGro which I hopefully can submit for comparison later.</li>
            <li> I found the product works best when given time even though I did see progress in my first month with it. However, it wasn’t until the third bottle that I started to see the biggest changes in hair growth. My friends and family took note and started complimenting me. A few others are wondering if I did some sort of hair transplant hahaha.</li>
            <li> This formula has definitely improved my hair and hair growth</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my grandma, she is 73 and has been a bit down about losing her hair. I think I am now her favorite grandchild because she absolutely loves the results. I did notice her hair has become thicker and she mentioned to me that it has stopped falling out. She seems quite a bit happier too! I really owe it to DasGro Hair Formula, a big thanks!</li>
            <li> I tried rogaine and it didn’t work for me – I switched to this and noticed results. It’s been slow and steady but any progress is good progress. I have very stubborn hair loss and this has been working better than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for just over 3 months and it did take some time to see results. That being said, I don&#x27;t believe overnight solutions exist, at least not for hair loss, so the slow progress was to be expected. In my case, it wasn&#x27;t until the 3rd bottle that I noticed any new hair growth but it did finally start to happen. I was initially going to give up after only the first month but I wanted to give it a real chance to work and I am glad I did because I am finally seeing results. I know everyone is different so for some it might work faster and for some slower but considering all the garbage out there at least this does something. I&#x27;ll keep ordering as long as it keeps working. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to see some results with some hair regrowth. I&#x27;m almost finished my third bottle and no difference yet but I can tell you my hair is still falling out. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars only because of the price. I order 3 months at a time and wish they were a little less expensive. I took the bottle to my doctor to see what she thought. She said it looked like a very good vitamin to her and liked everything in them. I am only on my 4th month of taking these, so I think it is a little too early to say they are or are not having an effect on my hair yet. I have noticed my nails are stronger though.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. It works for me. Just finished my first bottle &amp; New hair growth  has begun at the hair line. Got two more bottles to go !  The vitamins in it seem to give me more energy too...great side benefit.  :)</li>
            <li> Not yet seen any change need more time.</li>
            <li> I really think it&#x27;s helping as I had thyroid cancer. I&#x27;m on my 4 th bottle. Wish me luck but I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s working , though slowly</li>
            <li> I see new growth in the temple areas after the first bottle , I think it&#x60;s working !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if&lt;br /&gt;These work half my first bottle was good most of second bottle looks like this. My stomach gets upset taking the cracked ones. Wasn&#x27;t able to return since I&#x27;ve had a while.</li>
            <li> I chose this because of the review rating and the natural non-chemical blend.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I was experiencing thinning hair as a woman at 40 due to hormonal issues.  This has already started growing hair on my receding hairline in just two weeks!  Can&#x27;t wait to see what 3 months will bring!</li>
            <li> Right now I really don&#x27;t know. I have not been taking them long to give a good report.</li>
            <li> At this point (I have been using it for 30 days) I really don&#x27;t see any difference. Still finding hair in the sink that has come out. I&#x27;ll go ahead and finish out the course, but not very hopeful at this point.</li>
            <li> All the tablets are broken open and I&#x27;m not sure they are safe to use.... I have to question this product. Are the tablets supposed to look that way? As it is now, I would never order them again.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many clients order this product and they seem to be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> After my first 3 months of using this product I&#x27;ve noticed new hair growth especially around the hairline area. It&#x27;s sort of hard to see the top of my head to see new growth but I figured if it&#x27;s growing in one area why not the rest! I decided to purchase another 3 month supply, and also told my sister about this product too.</li>
            <li> i have alopecia and tried many different treatments……. Some cost me thousands of dollars and did absolutely nothing. i ordered this on a whim because at this point I was desperate for some type of solution and this was relatively cheaper than the other stuff I was trying. I decided I would finish a full 90 days but to my utter astonishment I started seeing progress on my 4th week of using it. It wasn’t much but it was better than what I was getting with much more expensive treatments. I am writing this after finishing my third bottle and can see that my bald spots are actually filling in….. I am seeing a visible difference that my family has already made comments on. I am a big believer in dasgro and ill continue using it.</li>
            <li> Started my 4th bottle and honestly I wish I was noticing results.  My hair is still parsed in the back and thin.  I really want this product to work as there are so many people with great things to say but I&#x27;m my 4th bottle in and haven&#x27;t noticed any real results.  Maybe less hair shedding but I&#x27;m not even sure about that.  Hoping by the 6th bottle that I will notice something.</li>
            <li> I figured I would be optimistic after reading the reviews - I am now on my 2nd 90 day purchase of DasGro and in day 145, I must say unfortunately, no improvement or any noticeable changes -  I understand each person will receive different results, and I haven&#x27;t finished my second 90 day regiment - but at this point, I&#x27;m not an ecstatic happy customer -  I changed the way i take the pills each day - I used to do 2 in the morning, and then after my second shipment, I changed to 1 in the morning and one at night -  So we shall see, I will report my results after my second 90 day supply ends -  And by the way, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to grow a ton of hair - I was looking for less fall out, and new hair growth, and a possible thickness increase -  I haven&#x27;t seen anything :( but a reduction of my wallet 99.00 x 2  :(  Stand by  :)  I&#x27;ve got 45 days to go -</li>
            <li> Not Showing one sign of working 1 and a half bottles in</li>
            <li> after using it for one month I see improvement in hair growth and condition, and my hairdresser, who recommended it because my hair had become dry and thinning, confirmed it&#x27;s working so I plan to continue.</li>
            <li> I see new hair growth. I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> No problems.  Arrived on time.  No damage to package.  Haven&#x27;t tried it yet</li>
            <li> This is not a product you should buy and judge in a week. I honestly don’t understand some of the negative reviews complaining after only having used the product for a week or two, after all, your hair didn’t fall out in a week so expecting it to grow back that fast is not being very reasonable. If you keep that in mind then I honestly think you will see some good results. I used it for the full 3 months and my biggest leap was towards the end of my second bottle. Up until that time it was rather slow to kick in but once it did I quickly noticed a change (for the better) and can say that the improvement has been worth the 3 months of using this product. Give it the full 3 months and really let the product work and who knows, it may work much faster for you.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for three weeks and have not notice a change as of yet. Except the color in my urine.</li>
            <li> In the last 6 months my hair started to fall out more than usual. I started using this and after 2 months my hair has stopped falling out. What a relief!!!</li>
            <li> Dasgro arrived sooner than I expected. That was good since I was anxious to try it based on a large number of great reviews. I have been taking Dasgro x 2 weeks &amp; my hair keeps falling out. I &#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to go bold soon since I already have baby thin hair on some spots. I go back &amp; read the reviews to encourage me to keep taking dasgro. I will come back &amp; post whatever results.&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
            <li> Okay, not as good as what I thought.</li>
            <li> Finished my first 3-month supply. At least one bottle had all cracked pills in it, though I don&#x27;t think that should&#x27;ve affected their usefulness. My wife and hair stylist say they see new growth, but I would say it&#x27;s minimal at this point. Going to give it another 90 days to see if anything changes.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s caregiver asked us to order this for her. She has thinning African ethnic hair that breaks easily especially during cold weather but also year round. She says it has helped to strengthen her hair and to make it grow. It also stops her hair from breaking. She has a hairweave now but we will see, once she moves the weave, if her hair has grown underneath.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical when it comes to anything organic or natural because it usually is just a bunch of hype but I read so many positive reviews on DasGro that I decided to try it and see if it actually did anything. My hair is mostly just thin and I wanted to see if it would thicken up back to how it used to be years ago. Well, 2 weeks into using it and I start noticing a difference and sure enough my hair actually felt thicker and looked much fuller, I also noticed less hair in the shower drain. I am still in awe that it actually worked for me. Thank you so much for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I took the product for 3 months and I did not notice and change.</li>
            <li> My grandma wanted me to share her experience with this product due to her inability to use the computer all too well. Anyways, she has been using DasGro Hair Formula for 6 months and has been seeing some fantastic results. She is 72 so I didn’t really think anything could help much (given her age) but surprisingly her hair has seen a night and day improvement since starting. She had some bald areas that started to show over the last few years that now those bald areas have completely filled in. She is very happy with the results and really wanted me to pass that on to the folks at dasgro.</li>
            <li> Its only been a week, no difference yet. I will continue to take it until my 1 month supply order is over. I did notice on the first day of taking this, my urine color changed dramatically. Not sure if anyone else experienced this &amp;#34;side affect&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and have had thinning hair since giving birth in my early 20&#x27;s. I got to the point where I was getting clumps of hair out while brushing in the morning. After using DasGro for only two days, I noticed that I was only getting a few strands out during my morning brushing! Amazing is all I can say about this product! Have found the answer to my prayers and will use this forever! Can&#x27;t wait until a few months down the line when my hair will be thicker as it grows.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to try it, but after using it for a few months I can tell the difference. My hair is now thicker, fuller and looks healthier. The shedding has stopped.. WHAT A RELIEF. I am very grateful to have found such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing at stopping hair loss. I was initially told about it from my doctor who suggested I use it before trying any radical treatments. To be honest I didn’t really think a tablet would work but since it was my doctor I trusted him and gave it a go. Long story short the product exceeded my expectations and stopped my hair loss within 2 months. I am totally floored by these results and don’t have a single bad thing to say about it. I should also mention that these results didn’t happen overnight so if you’re thinking of trying it then give it a fair shot and do the full 3 months.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time and on the day specified Das Gro has shown improvement in my hair I have been told my hair appears thicker which would be noticeable  because I have baby fine thin hair I would recommend this product to anyone seeking a product for hair growth or hair improvement</li>
            <li> Not really. I have been taking this product since November last year and I do not see any improvement.. sorry...</li>
            <li> I must submit this post - IT ACTUALLY WORKS! It won&#x27;t create more hair but my hair has stopped falling out, thus my hair is thicker. I think my nails are stronger but the verdict is still out on that. The shower floor is definitely not getting all my hair anymore!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but within two weeks I could see tiny hairs growing in previously bare areas on my head.  I am taking 1/2 the recommended dosage now each day and will continue to do so indefinitely.  My hair has thickened and is glossy.</li>
            <li> Nothing yet. bought a three month supply and still haven&#x27;t finished the first bottle.  I need more time to really put an honest review up. My hair is a bit stronger, not really fuller. It still falls out here and there like after a shower or when i pass a comb through it. Guessing the old dormant hair is falling out and new hair is growing from the roots.  I will update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I am a black female with hair thinning on the sides and top.  I wasn&#x27;t sure the product would work, but after reading the ingredient list I thought it would be worth a try just for the vitamins.  I&#x27;ve been taking it now for nearly 3 months, and their seems to be some minimal improvement in my hair.  The hair was doing fairly well until I went to the salon last week and the stylist damaged my hair, pulling more of my thinning hair out!  Nevertheless, I will continue with the treatment, but once this last bottle is empty I may try a different, less costly, formulation.  I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try, though.</li>
            <li> Have taken it for 30 days.  I am a 63 year old female with thining hair at temples.  No change yet.  Will complete sixty day supply.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a product that could help me as my hair was getting thinner each day.  Although I went to a few hair expert&#x27;s and used their recommended products which were expensive, they didn&#x27;t help. I came across Dasgro during my search but I was a bit hesitant.  After reading their customers&#x27; reviews I decided to order three bottles and was impressed with the early delivery. I started taking them the second week in January and already the result is amazing.  The thinning areas are getting thicker and my hair line is showing new growth.  I can&#x27;t wait to finish the entire three bottles.  This is a good product that I would recommend to anyone who is experiencing hair loss.  I am happy that I found Dasgro just in time.</li>
            <li> I finally found a natural product that works! The hair shedding is nearly gone and tiny little new hairs popping up on my scalp everywhere. Give it at least 60 days, that seemed to do the trick for me, the first month was a bit slow but it seemed to work better and better the longer I stayed on it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any hair growth yet.</li>
            <li> I was noticing hair on my clothing and in my combs in excess.  After using DasGro Hair Formula I am noticing less hair loss and better texture.  Am hoping to continue to see improvement with new hair growth,</li>
            <li> I have tried many solutions for hair loss, combs, treatments, oils, you name and I have probably used it. During that time I stumbled on DasGro hair formula and gave it a try. Let me start by saying WOW! This product does the job like no other. I used it for a month and the hair on my head is GROWING and little new hairs are popping up in areas that haven’t seen hair in years. I’m amazed and could cry tears of joy right now… I&#x27;ve been telling everyone I know to give it try!</li>
            <li> After 2 months my hair has stopped falling out and has thickened up quite nicely. What a huge confidence boost! This is a very good natural product and I highly recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li> purchased for my self and daughter her bald patch has filled in within a 2 week period hair came in.  My hair have not seen much difference will give it time I must say I do have peach fuzz in my thin areas that is a start, and my nails are stronger.</li>
            <li> I lost count of how many products I have used to help me with my terrible thinning hair. All I do is worry about my scalp which started to show earlier this year. I lose sleep over it and I can’t even be around other people because I have no confidence anymore. I know it’s crazy because it’s just hair but I’ve had great hair my whole life and so when I started losing it I didn’t know how to handle the change. Long story short I have been using DasGro Hair Formula for 90 days and a lot of the thin areas have filled in and the rest of my hair has thickened up to the point where I can feel confident again. I just ordered another supply and I don’t think I’ll ever stop using it because I can’t go back to my thin hair. I am very happy to see something finally work for me and I can’t say enough good things about this product. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Just about finished the first of three bottles and do not see any difference.  Hopeful that it may take a little more to jump start the process.  Fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I work a stressful job and over the years, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has started to thin out and even fall out as a result of the constant stress. I wanted to do something about this so I tried this product based on the great positive feedback. It was a great decision, only 2 weeks after using the product my hair stopped falling out. I am now on week 6 and can feel my hair getting thicker, as if it is retaining more moisture. I am very happy with the results and would recommend this to anyone that is looking for an effective hair loss treatment.</li>
            <li> Send this to me again.  I just finished the first bottle today. (30 days)  since my hair is thinning but no bald spots yet, hard to tell. My friend swears by it so I&#x27;m hanging in there and will use all 90 days according to instructions.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in my hair and  this is a good multi vitiamin</li>
            <li> have used for a week but no control in my hair loss, probably it needs some more time to work for my hair loss.</li>
            <li> It has done wonders for stopping my hair loss! No more clogging the drain and my hair looks fantastic. This is definitely a product worth trying if you’re someone who needs an effective and natural way to deal with hair loss or if you just want healthier hair in general.</li>
            <li> Gave me back my hair in 3 months! I haven’t had this much hair since I was a teenager. Initial results came in at 2 weeks and continued on from there. I have not experienced side effects or anything that would concern me. Finally a product that has worked for me, I recommend it to anyone with hair loss!</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this product and he is completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I have been on it for 3 months and my hair does look better AND no more hair in the sink! My friend recently asked what I had been doing to improve my hairline, it felt good to have someone notice. My confidence is through the roof. It really is a fantastic product and worth the try. I hope it works for others as well as it has for me.</li>
            <li> Great vitamins and herbs for stopping hair loss… has been working for me! I’m a happy customer and will order more.</li>
            <li> First week and I start noticing the texture of my hair improving, second week I feel my hair is thicker, third week I can tell I’m no longer rapidly losing my hair and by the fourth week I see tiny new hairs near my temples and on my receding hairline!! I am now on my second bottle and I am still seeing results. I definitely recommend giving Das Gro a try if you need a product that delivers fast results!</li>
            <li> I came across Dasgro last year in March and ordered it out of desperation.  I was having a lot of hair loss due to stress and hormones.  I began taking them right away but not consistently and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in hair fall or new hair growth. I decided to try them again in January because of all the great reviews. But this time I took them regularly in the morning with food and water then again in the  afternoon with food and water.  Well about into the end of my second bottle and the beginning of my third my hair was starting to thicken up and I had alot of new growth all around my front hairline. My husband even noticed all the new little hairs on top of my head. Well,  I made a huge mistake of stopping and started taking a prenatal.  Idk what I was thinking but now my hair is back to square one. I just started up again last week and I&#x27;m hoping for the same type of results and even better. I&#x27;m praying every day that I will get the full benefits of these hair vitamins.  Trust me.. I never write reviews but I had to because they really do work!</li>
            <li> I have used the product for 3 weeks and my hair has improved in texture and length, but best of all I see some new hair growth happening near a thinned-out area of my scalp. I am very impressed and will continue to take it every day.</li>
            <li> It has helped restore my hair, used to be very dry and horribly thin and now has stopped falling out, and improved in thickness. Now my hair feels great when I run my hand through it!</li>
            <li> DasGro Hair Formula tablets did nothing to thicken my hair.  The tablets in two of the three bottles were swollen and cracked as if they had been in a very humid environment and not in dry Arizona where I live.</li>
            <li> It has done a lot of good for my hair and in a short period of time too. No complaints so far… it’s a good quality product and the company seems to care about its customers which is rather rare these days.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment yet due to haven&#x27;t been taking long enough.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice any change in my hair at all.  I can still feel the dht build up in my hair and my hair is still thinning. I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on this product if I were you. If I could do it over, I would have just ordered a months supply to see if it had an effect on repairing and regrowing my hair. I was very disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with scarring alopecia and was told by my dermatologist that there was nothing that I could do to improve my hair loss. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months and have noticed results. I&#x27;ve also been juicing organic Mung sprouts and other vegetables to fight this diagnosis as well. I&#x27;ve ordered another 90-day supply of this product for continued results.</li>
            <li> I have been trying all kinds of product to make my hair grow and this is the best. At first I thought nothing was growing then my hair dresser noticed that I was getting growth in the front of my hair. I have only been taking this less than a month. I would highly recommed this for people with thin hair and of course hair loss. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on this product and the ingredients in it. I learned that many of the ingredients found in this product do indeed have the potential to regrow hair. I’ll admit and say I am not the healthiest person and my hair has been receding for many years and I thought maybe a natural product like this might help. Before this, I looked into doing a hair transplant but my jaw dropped when I saw the price and realized that it would require me to continue to come in regularly to maintain the hair. No thanks! Anyways, so I bought this and started to take 2 pills per day with my lunch. I usually have a hard time swallowing pills so I was a bit worried, but these aren&#x27;t horse sized so it was fine. I did read many reviews so I knew that overnight results are rare but I must be one of the lucky ones because 10 days in my hair started to change for the better. The thickness was noticeable and my hair felt heavier to the touch. Usually my hair looks very flat but as I started using this it began to have more volume and it did look MUCH better this way. About 20 days in, I noticed my receding hair line started to show new activity… little new hairs! I had to do a double take because I was so shocked at what I was seeing. It didn&#x27;t stop there; I continued to see progress each and every day. I was looking in the mirror every morning and I could see the length and thickness increasing over time. I know not everyone is this lucky to have something work for them but I would highly recommend at least trying this before spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on some of the harsher treatments out there. For me it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, my hair stopped falling after two weeks!!! I def recommend this product to anyone. I did all kinds of treatment even joined hair club but it was tooo pricey 1,000s of dollars, after i done taking my 9 month course my hair started to fall like crazy again. I then did research and found dasgrow. Dasgrow is affordable and it def works!!!</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this from the company direct, after a month of using it I noticed I wasn&#x27;t losing as much hair, after a couple months I noticed the hair I had lost was coming back in, very exciting!  I ran out and I didn&#x27;t think much of it, kept telling myself i need to order more, until 2 weeks went by and I was losing gobs of hair again. I reordered from amazon because their shipping  is quick! And now after a week my hair loss has slowed up again. I probably will be taking this vitamin for the rest of my life, because it works for me!</li>
            <li> This product really works. I was losing a little hair, my jacket was always full of hair. I don&#x27;t have any pets. It took about 2 wks before I notice big change. I&#x27;m on the 3rd bottle I am seeing some new hair growth, coming in darker too!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m well satisfied. Will order more !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billy J Wallace</li>
            <li> Product and service was as described. Still using with decent results.</li>
            <li> I took this medicine for a month but I did not see any improvement yet but I bought for another three month  to see if there is a effect or not on my hair growth and loss.</li>
            <li> This the end of my second month taking these and I see no change. I think it would have been cheaper to just buy vitamins containing Biotin.</li>
            <li> I will never go without using this product again. I have been losing my hair for years, mostly from stress and not getting enough nutrients from my diet.  Then menopause kicked and made things so much worse! I am lucky that I had a lot of hair to begin with otherwise I would have probably been bald by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using DasGro for 3 months I completely stopped losing my hair. My hair has been restored to a much healthier state and it&#x27;s still improving!! I did notice that the product worked much better at the end of the 2nd month so I do recommend being patient and allowing it time to really kick in. I am very satisfied and I would recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I discovered dasgro hair formula when searching for a solution to my horrid hair loss situation and I am so glad to have found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many of the popular hair growth products on the market. All the big name brands that everyone has heard of... I had high expectations and hopes for those products but they didn&#x27;t provide me with any results and I seemed to have all sorts of side effects to them like itchy scalp, nausea and headaches. I decided I needed to try something more natural and thats when I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked to see that within the first 10 days I felt and saw a difference in my hair. My hair had a bit more shine to it, felt thicker and softer. I noticed by the second week that the amount of hair I was losing when showering reduced drastically. Most exciting was the new hair growth that started on my third week,, my most problematic areas started to grow new hairs!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away I ordered a 3 month supply and I am now on my 3rd bottle. My hair has fully stopped falling out and the new hair growth has continued and is still going strong. I am very impressed and happy to see the results I&#x27;ve been getting. Before I found this I was so discouraged that I almost didn&#x27;t use it. If you&#x27;re like me and have tried everything and nothing has worked then this is the product you need -- It really works!!</li>
            <li> Girl happy.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> I’m always finding hair, on my pillow, sheets, shower curtain, carpets, it’s basically everywhere. I researched many hair loss products on the market, some seemed good but what drew me to this product was that it was natural and didn’t contain the fillers, chemicals and preservatives like some other products. As soon as I started using DasGro I felt my hair loss reduced and after a week I could physically see less hair in all the places I mentioned earlier. At the end of my first month I barely noticed any hair loss at all! I just started my second bottle and my hair is really starting to thicken up and is growing faster than ever. I’m very happy with my experience and I highly recommend this product if you need a natural hair growth solution that delivers results.</li>
            <li> I have been taking the product for 4 months, 2 pills per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. There has been an incredible transformation in my hair! It has completely stopped falling out and is growing in thicker and longer! No adverse effects either! I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best hair loss solution for me. I wanted something to help with my thinning hair and this product delivered! After using it my hair is thick and full and I am still seeing improvement every week. I was concerned about potential side effects but so far there hasn’t been any to report. Overall I am very satisfied with this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product about a month ago and have seen no results yet. I currently use Rogaine as well and the customer service said i could use this product instead of it. However, i have seen no improvement using this product whatsoever, even with the Rogaine. Some people mentioned it takes a couple of months to see any results so i will wait and see what happens within the next couple of months.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of reviews from women on here so I wasn’t sure if it would work for me but it did! I had a small bald spot on the top of my head forming and this helped recover most of the hair in only a few short months. During this time I made sure to keep a healthy lifestyle to make sure I wasn’t hindering my chances by drinking, smoking or getting too little sleep. I read that these are all factors and it is important to maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle to get the most out of a product like this.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all.  I wanted my money back but I missed the refund date as I was trying to use all the product to make sure it worked to give it the benefit of doubt.  What a rip off.  I am out $100.00.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I was really upset that I had to cut all off all my hair. I had devoted all of my time and energy into my 3 year old, my hair health had started to faulter. I could not maintain it all and raise 2 kids so it had to be done. When I read about this hair supplement, I was estacic because I knew just having it short would not be enough to get my hair back on the right track. Before it was a nappy, frizzy mess. Now, It has been growing faster than ever before. The roots are coming out so shiny and healthy that I can hardly recognize my own hair and I find myself stroking it. The growth is coming out so nice and lovely. I can not wait to update with before and after pictures of this amazing transformation. My hair is being treated to the maxium amount of vitamins and minerals needed to maintain a fresh head full of hair and I&#x27;m loving it. I am sooo happy that I bought myself these to try. I went with the 3 month supply and I can&#x27;t be prouder of my growing hair. If you are having troubles with your hair and it&#x27;s health or growth, I urge you to give these a try and to go for the full 3 month deal!</li>
            <li> on my  second bottle ,cannot see any difference in hair volume</li>
