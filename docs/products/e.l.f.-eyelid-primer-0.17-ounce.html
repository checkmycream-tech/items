            <li>AMAZINGLY!!!!</li>
            <li>It stood up to what i threw at it and my eyeshadow stayed beautiful!!!</li>
            <li>This is awesome.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful satiny, powdery feel to it.</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>I bought this primer over others because of the great price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a win.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li>By far the best of the best in primer for eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>On top of that, it really is a great product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>this primer is ok, not my favorite though!</li>
            <li>This primer makes ur eyshadow pop its really nice goes on nice and smooth and</li>
            <li>But I went to a Streetlight Manifesto concert the week I bought this, and my makeup stayed perfectly throughout a long concert and a four hour drive on a rather warm day.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; eye primer instead of the cream</li>
            <li>If you wear cream shadows or pigmented powder shadows pass on this and go for a more pricier one.</li>
            <li>so for those who dont want sparkle primers then make sure it doesn&#x27;t have \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; in it. :)</li>
            <li>but I love this primer.</li>
            <li>I wanted my eyeshadow to pop more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my eyeshadow pop any more than it doesn&#x27;t when I don&#x27;t use it, either.</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing it away and going to the dollar tree and finding a better one.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully, and helps my eyeshadow last longer.</li>
            <li>Overall, great price &amp; product!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I could use more I guess for a whiter color, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>so you can return it easily if there&#x27;s a problem.</li>
            <li>Sometimes this looks cakey with eyeshadow under it, and the \\&quot;Pearl\\&quot; color has a bit more of a pinkish undertone than I would like since my skin has a golden undertone.</li>
            <li>like the light pearl effect you get with this</li>
            <li>When I bought this at first it was okay.</li>
            <li>But on a good note the white color does make eyeshadow look brighter.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly as well.</li>
            <li>the delivery was quick and was well packaged</li>
            <li>First time user for a eyelid primer!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware it had a sparkle to it until I got it, that should be more clearly</li>
            <li>I like this primer because it really helps keep the eye shadow on, but mostly when you stay dry, I&#x27;ve realized if you wanna party and get sweaty, it does rub off a little too easily, but for a regular day, this is the perfect primer.</li>
            <li>It makes my makeup stick a lot better and last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I put this stuff on first and the eyeshadow didn&#x27;t crease.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really work at all, eye makeup still smeared and came off in the creases of the eyelids.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its too much water in the product</li>
            <li>and you really do get what you pay for with this one.</li>
            <li>The product its self works really well.</li>
            <li>&amp; I would suggest those who enjoy using eyeshadow makeups to buy this maybe buy a extra to keep stock.</li>
            <li>I use highly pigmented colors and this really helped them to stay put.</li>
            <li>i probably should have gotten in clear!</li>
            <li>Then apply eye shadow as you normally do and it will last until removed at night.</li>
            <li>I found this primer to be a little more difficult to use and you have to use a lot of it to actually see it, but if you want something a little more sheer, this one might work for you.</li>

            <li> I used all of it up in less than a month because it dried out so quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought it in white which has sparkles in it, which isn&#x27;t bad but would have liked to know that beforehand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale and it lightens my eyelids slightly.</li>
            <li> I did find that it made my other eye shadow last a lot longer</li>
            <li> Lasted maybe a month, it&#x27;s a little bit more expensive but buy the two faced brand, omw bottle lasted me 2 years</li>
            <li> It lasted a very long time with no reapplying.</li>
            <li> The product came it, and the primer was really dry.</li>
            <li> Like, REALLY REALLY dry.</li>
            <li> I can do my makeup at 8 in the morning and will last all day long even with everyday wear and tear.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some on the brush but the bottle is mostly empty.</li>
            <li> but I was kinda heavy feeling on my eyes... and later started looking a little crusty.</li>
            <li> This was just a let down.</li>
            <li> but I was noticing some people didn&#x27;t notice it had a slight sparkle</li>
            <li> I used this eye primer for Thankgiving make-up because i didn&#x27;t want the heat in the kitchen to mess up anything...</li>
            <li> I looked inside the container and all the primer was dried up.</li>
            <li> When I received this primer it was completely dried out and chunky.</li>
            <li> This primer was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The secret is to allow to dry after applying sparingly with the sponge applicator.</li>
            <li> To those who don&#x27;t know, usually when something that has \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; in it means that it might have sparkle to it.</li>
            <li> waste of my money!</li>
            <li> When I recived this the package was opened and I am not sure if the wand was used or not.</li>
            <li> It came totally dried out and works very poorly</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t expensive make up.</li>
            <li> I guess for the price its not that bad</li>
            <li> Awful product.</li>

            <li> I got this because of the price. I was looking for a more \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; eye primer instead of the cream but this one is too liquidy. It just feels like I&#x27;m applying water to my eyelids. It doesn&#x27;t hold my eyeshadow at all, it actually makes it run and glob up. I thought maybe the white was a different consistancy then the nude so I also purchased the nude one but it did the same thing. If you wear cream shadows or pigmented powder shadows pass on this and go for a more pricier one. This was just a let down.</li>
            <li> I use this as an all over eyelid color. I&#x27;m pretty pale and it lightens my eyelids slightly. I could use more I guess for a whiter color, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I used this eye primer for Thankgiving make-up because i didn&#x27;t want the heat in the kitchen to mess up anything... IT WORKS AMAZINGLY!!!! It stood up to what i threw at it and my eyeshadow stayed beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> To those who don&#x27;t know, usually when something that has \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; in it means that it might have sparkle to it. I just ordered this and havn&#x27;t gotten it yet but I was noticing some people didn&#x27;t notice it had a slight sparkle so for those who dont want sparkle primers then make sure it doesn&#x27;t have \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; in it. :)</li>
            <li> This primer makes ur eyshadow pop its really nice goes on nice and smooth and oh its a lil shimmery but I love this primer.</li>
            <li> When I bought this at first it was okay. After using it two times it it seemed as though there wasn&#x27;t anything in the bottle. I looked inside the container and all the primer was dried up. Good thing this isn&#x27;t expensive make up. But on a good note the white color does make eyeshadow look brighter.</li>
            <li> I wanted my eyeshadow to pop more so I bought this, inexpensive. I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about it. Maybe I misread the description. Pearl is iridescent...this is just sparkly. It doesn&#x27;t make my eyeshadow pop any more than it doesn&#x27;t when I don&#x27;t use it, either.</li>
            <li> This is awesome. I bought Shany 96 and Shany 40 color makeup pallets and this. It makes my makeup stick a lot better and last a lot longer. I can do my makeup at 8 in the morning and will last all day long even with everyday wear and tear. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I like this primer because it really helps keep the eye shadow on, but mostly when you stay dry, I&#x27;ve realized if you wanna party and get sweaty, it does rub off a little too easily, but for a regular day, this is the perfect primer.</li>
            <li> When I received this primer it was completely dried out and chunky. I ended up throwing it away and going to the dollar tree and finding a better one.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware it had a sparkle to it until I got it, that should be more clearly stated.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t really work at all, eye makeup still smeared and came off in the creases of the eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say pass up on this color primer, get the Nude shade instead.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, and helps my eyeshadow last longer. Shipped quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Works great! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> waste of my money! please don&#x27;t buy! its too much water in the product and it dont cover fully as needed for makeup application.</li>
            <li> Awful product. Does not work how primer should.</li>
            <li> I bought this primer over others because of the great price. On top of that, it really is a great product. I bought it in white which has sparkles in it, which isn&#x27;t bad but would have liked to know that beforehand. Overall, great price &amp; product!</li>
            <li> I found this primer to be a little more difficult to use and you have to use a lot of it to actually see it, but if you want something a little more sheer, this one might work for you. I did find that it made my other eye shadow last a lot longer but I was kinda heavy feeling on my eyes... and later started looking a little crusty. I guess for the price its not that bad but I probably won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> Sometimes this looks cakey with eyeshadow under it, and the \\&quot;Pearl\\&quot; color has a bit more of a pinkish undertone than I would like since my skin has a golden undertone. But I went to a Streetlight Manifesto concert the week I bought this, and my makeup stayed perfectly throughout a long concert and a four hour drive on a rather warm day. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a win.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I got it at Target for $2. I never wear makeup except concealer and occasionally eyeliner. Eyeshadow always creases shortly after I put it on because I have oily skin and my eyelids are especially oily. I put this stuff on first and the eyeshadow didn&#x27;t crease. After 5 hours, I just had the tiniest line in the crease. It lasted a very long time with no reapplying. I took the wand and put some on and spread it with my ring finger. It has a wonderful satiny, powdery feel to it. Not oily or lotiony or anything like that. It&#x27;s very nice. I will definitely buy this again. I got it in pearl. I like it. You could even wear it without eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This primer was a waste of money. I used all of it up in less than a month because it dried out so quickly. It still didn&#x27;t help my eyeshadow last longer. This product is about $1 at Target and you really do get what you pay for with this one.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use highly pigmented colors and this really helped them to stay put.</li>
            <li> It came totally dried out and works very poorly</li>
            <li> By far the best of the best in primer for eyeshadow.  The secret is to allow to dry after applying sparingly with the sponge applicator. Then apply eye shadow as you normally do and it will last until removed at night.</li>
            <li> eye shadow primer works well.&lt;br /&gt;i like the light pearl effect you get with this product.&lt;br /&gt;item does not crease or flake off.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the sparkle and such but it works I guess.</li>
            <li> The product came it, and the primer was really dry. Like, REALLY REALLY dry. I also put it on, and it cause my eczema to flare up in my left eyes.</li>
            <li> Lasted maybe a month, it&#x27;s a little bit more expensive but buy the two faced brand, omw bottle lasted me 2 years</li>
            <li> The product its self works really well. The only problem is that there was almost no product in the bottle. There&#x27;s some on the brush but the bottle is mostly empty. So I would recommend you buy it from a store so you can return it easily if there&#x27;s a problem.</li>
            <li> Perfect. First time user for a eyelid primer! &amp; I would suggest those who enjoy using eyeshadow makeups to buy this maybe buy a extra to keep stock. I love it. No smudges at all. Eyeshadow stayed in place all evening.</li>
            <li> this primer is ok, not my favorite though! the white doesnt soak in, you can see it through your eye shadow! i probably should have gotten in clear! i like the e.l.f brand though so i will definitely buy from them again! the delivery was quick and was well packaged</li>
            <li> When I recived this the package was opened and I am not sure if the wand was used or not.</li>
