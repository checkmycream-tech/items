            <li> the nail ends are too long and big for my fingers.</li>
            <li> I will order these again, and have recomended to other local salons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not that big of a fan of half tips</li>
            <li> Now lets be clear don&#x27;t get theses nail tips and then leave a negative review for them.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet due to the fact that i discovered nails forms, but delivery took about a month.</li>
            <li> Not the salon style half nails</li>
            <li> im just not used to half well nails</li>
            <li> these are supposed to be half well tips</li>
            <li> I was looking for the half position.</li>
            <li> It comes in little bags labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.</li>
            <li> Nails are a little thin feeling, but I only bought them for practice (not for peoples hands).  </li>
            <li> some of the nails are a bit unevenly shaped but for the price and all things considered i will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I do nails a lot and was tired of paying for only 100 nails.  </li>
            <li> and they are well less they showed up almost an entire week late not happy</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed when they finally arrived.</li>
            <li> They were flemsy and easily broken.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that i waited 31/2 weeks for the wrong item!!</li>

            <li> These nails are perfect! I do nail art and wanted to stop paying over $20 for a pack of 30 nails. This might even be better! It comes in little bags labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. I don&#x27;t think that the sizes are smallest to greatest. I think it&#x27;s for each finger (0 is pinky, 1 is ring finger etc).</li>
            <li> i really like these.  they are a bit thicker which i like for the way i do my nails, they hold up better.  i like receiving each size in its own bag.  some of the nails are a bit unevenly shaped but for the price and all things considered i will continue to order.</li>
            <li> Nails are a little thin feeling, but I only bought them for practice (not for peoples hands).  Great deal, would recommend.</li>
            <li> Not the salon style half nails I was looking for</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in great condition.  The nails appear to be strong and sturdy.  I work a lot with my hands and need strong tips that won&#x27;t split under pressure.  These look as if they will work out just fine.  I will update if problems present at a later date.</li>
            <li> These are NOT tips!!! They are full length nails. Very disappointed that i waited 31/2 weeks for the wrong item!!</li>
            <li> hello everyone if you are into nail art like me and want a sturdy and grade A quality product well these nails are it. omg these are the best nail tips money can buy. Now lets be clear don&#x27;t get theses nail tips and then leave a negative review for them.  people when you are doing acrylic nails at home or a salon remember this the tip only adds length not strength too the nail. please make sure your bead consistency is right not too dry and not too wet and research on how to apply acrylic too the nails you do not apply it like nail polish. there are three zones the nail its the tip then the stress point also called smile line then the top get some practice wheels from amazon and practice making the proper bead consistency first and how too use acrylic nail brush. my friends if you learn these steps you will be amazed at your skill level in doing your own nails</li>

            <li> It Looks Nothing Like The PiC. I Need Nails To Do ACRlyC Nails. This So WasNt It.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and it gets costly so 500 psc for cheap like this is wonderful.. must buy</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for.. the nail ends are too long and big for my fingers.</li>
            <li> Excellent price. I do nails a lot and was tired of paying for only 100 nails.  Yiu can&#x27;t beat a deal like this</li>
            <li> Will rate again when issue is fixed these are supposed to be half well tips and they are well less they showed up almost an entire week late not happy right this second</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I thought it was going to be.  Instead of getting nail tips, got got full nails. Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> It was ok. . The nail was blended. I was looking for the half position. Only used them once..</li>
            <li> These work great, but I had to trim them a lot to get them to the length I wanted</li>
            <li> there ok nott so goof</li>
            <li> Im a nail tyech in florida and these were not any good. They were flemsy and easily broken. D- .</li>
            <li> It took them 4 months to ship this to me...I was a little disappointed when they finally arrived. They look as advertised, but are on the flimsy side. I make do because I know how to apply the acrylic to make it last.</li>
            <li> Very nice tips, it is very easy to work with them. Best for beginners. I recommend everyone to buy them even if only for pricing.</li>
            <li> For the price, these were excellent. I&#x27;m not that big of a fan of half tips but they were very easy to file into real nails. The color for \\&quot;natural nails\\&quot; was amazing, they have a slight off white cast to them instead of the transparent white. I will order these again, and have recomended to other local salons</li>
