            <li>I am very impressed with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It is NOT a Lithium Ion, so it&#x27;s best not to leave it always on the charger.  </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s best power.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how Oral-B manages the power in the toothbrush, but from my experience it&#x27;s best to charge it after 3-4 days of use.  </li>
            <li>This One is the best yet.</li>
            <li>My orthodonist is also impressed with the results I have achieved through use of the Sonicare Elite e9500.</li>

            <li>It does a great job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>They work great.</li>
            <li>I still rate it great for it&#x27;s purpose and will continue to use it, but..........</li>
            <li>Pricing on Amazon was great</li>
            <li>Sonicare is a great product, great company,</li>
            <li>, I know it&#x27;ll be great,</li>
            <li>The product works great.</li>
            <li>Absolutely a great purchase.</li>
            <li>I was totally impressed with the effective cleaning ability and the smoothness it created on my skin.  </li>

            <li>I love this toothbrush!!  </li>
            <li>He told me this toothbrush has done a wonderful job on his gums and his teeth look much better.</li>
            <li>the features are great and the end result was amazing.  </li>
            <li>how good it works.</li>
            <li>If, however, you already own the Philips Sonicare Elite, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that the Sonicare Elite works just as well as the Sonicare FlexCare.</li>
            <li>If, however, you already own the Philips Sonicare Elite, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that the Sonicare Elite works just as well as the Sonicare FlexCare.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush thinking it&#x27;s going to be good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>it looked good.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good for a month&#x27;s vacation.</li>
            <li>But I had no idea how good this product could be.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for about five weeks and rate it as good, but not \\&quot;elite\\&quot; as the product name indicates.</li>
            <li>I can replace the rechargeable batteries and Consumer Reports rated it almost as good as the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I can replace the rechargeable batteries and Consumer Reports rated it almost as good as the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>This is a really good power toothbrush (the e9500).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still doing good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Batteries are still about as good as it was on day 1.  </li>
            <li>good by battery.  </li>
            <li>It felt good in my hand</li>
            <li>- Good and ergonomic shape of the brushes    </li>
            <li>So here I am with amalgam in my tooth and a good wake up call.  </li>
            <li>The material is a good breeding ground for mould pores.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;If price is the concern preventing you from using Sonicare&#x27;s superior technology</li>
            <li>then you are being penny wise and pound foolish.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good way to get out ahead.</li>
            <li>Good investment for the health of your teeth.</li>
            <li>The best way to clean and care for your teeth.</li>
            <li>If this were not the case I would have loved to give this toothbrush a five, because it did do an exceptional job.</li>
            <li>My turn-of-the-century Sonicare would run a *good* two weeks on a charge with just me using it, and this one does too (more like three!).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great quality and works very smoothly.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>but I am very pleased with the results from Sonicare.</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter and the dentist was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is lighter, holds a better charge, and feels like it&#x27;s doing a great job.  </li>
            <li>Great tooth brushes, we had gone the cheap route before, DON&#x27;T DO IT!</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush, no doubt, but I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s any more effective at cleaning teeth than the less-expensive e7300 model.  </li>
            <li>I got this about a month ago and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I bought this at target about 5 years ago and love it!</li>
            <li>(well, most of them!)</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>THIS TOOTHBRUSH IS EASY TO USE AND FEELS GREAT ON THE GUMLINE.</li>
            <li>My teeth look amazing, and I&#x27;ve been an electric toothbrush user for years.</li>
            <li>It works amazing well.  </li>
            <li>This one is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare is simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I saw that The Sharper Image carried this toothbrush and it looked nice</li>
            <li>I own the e9500 while my roommate has the e7300</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it, but it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s an option.      </li>
            <li>I own both the Philips Sonicare Elite e9500 and the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Sonicare is that some kind of slimy gunk builds up in the head of the brush.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush takes some getting use to (it chewed up my lower lip in the very beginning)  but, once you get the hang of it, it is so great!  </li>
            <li>I got this for Christmas and it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>The Braun was nice, but did not give me that sense of having my teeth cleaned by a Dental Tech.</li>
            <li>Expense but nice for me.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely THE BEST TOOTHBRUSH ON THE MARKET for home use!!!</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is extremely effective in cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li>heck, I may even buy him one of his own.  </li>
            <li>- Nice design, practical settings (2-minute-clock)  </li>
            <li>i found the timer feature in this toothbrush highly effective in aiding consistancy of teeth brushing.</li>
            <li>the two speed feature is also a handy tool.</li>
            <li>you can see why this toothbrush as a whole with accessories and design flaw of not being waterproof does not earn perfect 5</li>
            <li>So you can see why this toothbrush as a whole with accessories and design flaw of not being waterproof does not earn perfect 5 stars.    </li>
            <li>THe brush head has to be cleaned every wk (kind of according to instructions).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had kind of a tooth fetish.  </li>
            <li>Also, would be nice to have a one piece head</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>Nice electronic features also.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Sonicare Elite system about two months ago and have been thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to give you the best toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that this toothbrush does not deserve a higher rating because basically it does a a very good job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>True, it does a great job when it works.  </li>
            <li>The sonic power is what delivers the punch to get those teeth sparking clean!!</li>
            <li>I do not believe that strong brushing &#x3D; good brushing.</li>
            <li>This brushing system is very easy to use</li>
            <li>sleek design, speed can be adjusted very easily</li>
            <li>Very easy to use also.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The clean feeling is amazing!  </li>
            <li>PRO:  - Very good sonic power, cleaning your teeth really thouroughly.  </li>
            <li>Many years ago I bought a Sonicare before it was popular.</li>
            <li>This one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>This by far was the best design from Philips.</li>
            <li>I owned an original Sonicare, but it died after seven years of faithful service and good dental checkups.</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a great smile and healthy gums!</li>
            <li>All-in-all, a very good unit, and would recommend to anyone who wants to maintain healthy teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It honestly could be more ergonomic and better shaped.  </li>
            <li>This isnt cheap and the battery isnt as good as the latest model.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully in every way, but there is a major design flaw:  </li>
            <li>I thought i couldn&#x27;t do better than the manual method which i&#x27;ve used with great success most of my life (i&#x27;m 57)</li>
            <li>I have had great checkups with the dentist since I first began using it so replacing it with another sonicare</li>
            <li>Its features are very impressive and I am sure you can read other reviews to find out what is good about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean, so I can recommend it to anyone looking for great clean teeth!</li>
            <li>This was a gift for our son-he reports that it is a super good item and is more than pleased with it.</li>
            <li>So far it has been a very good product that I purchased.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product,quite pricey though but it sure beats the old fashion brush just buy one you will not regret it I garuntee.</li>
            <li>I found that I wanted more than 2 minutes brushing.</li>
            <li>After buying one for myself, I purchased 2 more to give to my grown children for Christmas.</li>
            <li>and I love the quadrant timer feature.</li>
            <li>Making life in the morning that much more tolerable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good buy, worth the money</li>
            <li>But in a cluttered bathroom in means keeping the charger out more often than not.    </li>
            <li>I love the Quad Pacer and the 2 minute auto shutoff, but I tend to brush for 2:30 or 3:00 minutes.</li>
            <li>I now follow the manufacturer&#x27;s advice, after cleaning face, glasses, and mirror for most of a week.</li>
            <li>Sonicare FlexCare]] is the latest incarnation of Sonicare&#x27;s Power Toothbrush.</li>

            <li>what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your teeth!</li>
            <li>My favorite feature is the customizable brushing timer.  </li>
            <li>(I need to get out more...</li>
            <li>I have used many electronic items in Europe - always of course  using a voltage regulator.</li>
            <li>Seems to do a better job</li>
            <li>Sure, the brush heads can be pricey</li>
            <li>My Mom congenitally has way too many teeth and is age 71.  </li>
            <li>I love how it divides your mouth into four sections so that you know you are brushing your teeth for the correct amount of time</li>
            <li>and we just love them---</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure it&#x27;s topped off</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>My sister has raved about hers for years, and she is going to buy this latest model for the adjustable speed option.  </li>
            <li>My gums look healthier and I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>and I had herd how much better these were for your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>I use this along with the Waterpik Power Flosser and my teeth and gums have never felt or looked better.</li>
            <li>I had it for many years.     </li>
            <li>It cleans better</li>
            <li>Fast shipping; I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li>Now I love the thing.  </li>
            <li>The audible timer is more beneficial than I would have thought.</li>
            <li>I still love this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much more power, smaller head excellent battery life.  </li>
            <li>During the last six years I have used this product and it does an excellent job, but it&#x27;s life</li>
            <li>I feel my teeth are in much better condition since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>Gum massage is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This one has more \\&quot;bells and whistles.\\&quot;  Adjustable power output</li>
            <li>the thinner brush heads a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush but found I could have bought it alot cheaper at costco, alot cheaper</li>
            <li>It was a no brainer gift idea when my daughter hinted she would love to get one someday.  </li>
            <li>many people make the mistake of brushing while using this</li>
            <li>It shipped on the 15th and it arrived on the 17th with free shipping from Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li>Now I love it.  </li>
            <li>more words.</li>
            <li>I have updated to the e9500 and love it.</li>
            <li>Nothing better for your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>love this toothbrush...</li>
            <li>However, the price of the Sonicare is very, very attractive these days especially since they introduced the latest FlexCare line which is supposed to be more elite than this Elite model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally, it&#x27;s still best to condition the battery by fully charging and discharging - which the manual suggests users do every once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The problem has got to do more with me and my eating habits.  </li>
            <li>I was used to the Oral-B FlossAction head which was more pronounced and bulky.  </li>
            <li>It may appear more cumbersome, but it&#x27;s easier to let water run thru both each and every time than to wait for residue to build up and for foul odor to occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>course the solution was solved with the introduction of their latest FlexCare line which imitates the construction of Oral-B, but still maintaining the sonic ability.  </li>
            <li>And as we&#x27;ve seen they always lower the price, introduce an upgraded line and with more accessories.  </li>
            <li>in case you have more than two people sharing the handles.  </li>
            <li>They should be able to provide a travel case that case house 1 handle and 2 brush heads.  </li>

            <li>I have bought the latest Flexcare series under Sonicare</li>
            <li>It also fights stains in between the teeth better than its oralb counterpart.</li>
            <li>Love this power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Hoever, you need to come up with a better way to store excess electric cord.  </li>
            <li>I am a Elite usere myself and just love the money it is saving me from having to do additional dental work besides the annual cleanings for me.</li>
            <li>I have been nothing but pleased at it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>But i love it.</li>
            <li>I love mine already, and it hasn&#x27;t yet been 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>A great step up for not too much money.</li>
            <li>I really love everything about this toothbrush, except for the fact that the vibrations sometimes irritate and tickle my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Not too many places to hide and build a home.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare e9500 cleans the surface of my teeth better (slicker) than a tooth brush.</li>
            <li>:)  As I said before; it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li>My dentist is pleased that I use it, too.</li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth very effectively, much better than Oral-B product.  </li>
            <li>Why they don&#x27;t offer the top of the line to replace what was there top of the line is beyond me.</li>
            <li>At first it took some getting used to as the feeling of the vibrating head accidentally touching the teeth wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Fresh from the dentist clean after EVERY brush and it feels GREAT on the gums.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much better design, more powerful, effective motion, and better brushes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s got an awesome ultra sonic-like action that is super efficient.</li>
            <li>My teeth FEEL very clean after use.  </li>
            <li>7/20/14 - this toothbrush is still going strong, and I still love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, travels well, lasts forever and cleans my teeth better than any powered or non-powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you would rather, you could also wait until it only shows one light, but waiting for it to stop is best.</li>
            <li>Plus,function wise, its much stronger than the latest series.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to be kept clean, I do this once a week.  </li>
            <li>You never knew your teeth could feel so clean!</li>
            <li>AND IN THIS CASE ,,, IT IS SO VERY TRUE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks and it is clearly a very superior product.  </li>
            <li>The sonicare is a great product and I was very pleasantly surprised at the service level of amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was just diagnosed with advanced periodontal disease which probably means I&#x27;m going to lose most of my teeth, but I plan on donating this to my husband...</li>
            <li>My husband has confirmed that most of the pain caused by te sensitivity has gone away.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I was especially impressed with the 2-week battery life which gave a constant output from full charge to the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>New one came with more directions for cleaning and taking apart  which is good.</li>
            <li>I am sure I would still be using that original model except that somebody knocked it over and it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Have fun! :-)</li>
            <li>It is easy to understand the directions for using it.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this product to better clean my teeth and to improve gum health.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s well designed, easy to use lasts for about 2 weeks without charging and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product is quite easy to use and does the job well.</li>
            <li>and there are more advanced models of Sonicare available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy for someone with developmental disabilities to understand that they need to brush their teeth until the toothbrush shuts off after 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My toothbrush remains charged for more than 2 weeks at a time and this model has a great feature that beeps at you when the battery is low, so you can keep it off of the charger until then.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Since I switched to Sonicare, my gums have been perfectly healthy and my teeth are so clean that I am out of my semi-annual hygienist&#x27;s appointment in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s practically light versus Oral-B Triumph that a kid would be more comfortable in using the Sonicare handle than any other.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, my teeth stain easily to coffee, so</li>
            <li>I had used a cybersonic toothbrush for many years, convinced that it was the most powerful and efficient electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I love the timer because it gets my mouth fabulously clean in just 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>But Sonicare makes that easy.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and the design makes it easy to remove the brush head.</li>
            <li>The slimmer models are damaged easily after repeated removal of the head.</li>
            <li>Purchased this model from my dentist at his strong recommendation.</li>
            <li>The brush has improved the health of my gums enormously, I strongly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>and I will strongly advise people to buy that, if u are going to choose this.</li>
            <li>Strong brushing can lead to residing gums too.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Bought this toothbrush for my partner for his birthday in 2008 and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve generally been happy</li>
            <li>I would also like to say that I&#x27;m very pleased with your fast and reliable service.</li>
            <li>You can get two full weeks of use in between charging and this may help condition the battery better as well as save electricity by not having to leave the cord</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is comfortable, easy to use and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It works just fine</li>
            <li>I talked with the dental hygienist about it (she recommended the product) and she said her&#x27;s was fine.   </li>
            <li>The advanced design makes for easy access to all areas of your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>and my gums are doing fine</li>
            <li>Overall great brush, I am getting one for my girlfriend</li>
            <li>It does a great job overall</li>
            <li>what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your teeth!s.</li>
            <li>What a cheaply made device.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is set for 2 minutes and makes a sound at 30-second increments.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheaper than duty free shop.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so smooth now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny in my opinion, since teeth are one of our most valuable assets.</li>
            <li>Worth the price of the toothbrush for better dental health.  </li>
            <li>Great product, if looking to purchase through amazon wait for rebates as this will save you an extra 20-30 bucks over department stores.</li>
            <li>Replacement brushes are available in drug stores, Wal Marts, Target, and some grocery stores.  </li>
            <li>You will enjoy this.</li>
            <li>and so was the free shipping.  </li>
            <li>So until then I will enjoy my Sonicare purchase at an price unimaginable a year ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So until then I will enjoy my Sonicare purchase at an price unimaginable a year ago.      </li>
            <li>Comparing this with Oral-B, Sonicare is more powerful, giving you versitility to move around the mouth.</li>
            <li>Regardless I&#x27;m happy just using a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li>Seems cheap to me.</li>
            <li>Great features, such as interval timed brushing and the ability to change the speed.</li>
            <li>We got ours free from the dentist years ago and it&#x27;s lasted and lasted and still works fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with my Oral B for several years but this is a superior product.  </li>
            <li>If it lasts as long as my first Sonicare, I will be very happy.</li>
            <li>After 5 years our old Sonicare has given up, a good run in my book.</li>
            <li>but this Sonicare Elite is far superior.</li>
            <li>We are very pleased with the new model.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my new purchase.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You would think they would use a better method to turn product on and off if they really wanted an effective first class product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth and glossy and CLEAN all the time now.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean and smooth, like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>This was my first power toothbrush and I am pleasantly surprised how great it is.</li>
            <li>a couple time for no other reason than it feels good.    </li>
            <li>The construction is sturdy and the toothbrush heads are super easy to change and to clean.</li>
            <li>teeth get super clean, and the sonicare is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Optiva Corp. (the original maker of Sonicare) in 2000.</li>
            <li>My Granddaughter (6 years old) was captivated by it and tried using the smaller brush that fit her mouth perfectly.  </li>
            <li>But when I turned it on that first time  (touching my teeth at the designated 45 degree angle)</li>
            <li>Holds the charge for a long time and is great for traveling.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, each charge lasts a long time--about 1-2 weeks--still after owning for about a year.  </li>
            <li>Anyone out there who&#x27;s looking into an electric toothbrush, if you can afford this, it is so totally worth the investment!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time using an electric toothbrush and the way it cleans your teeth is much better then the manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>controls are simple and the light indicator couldn&#x27;t be more effective.  </li>
            <li>The clean sensation is something different: it really gives a wonderful fresh and clean feeling to your teeth.</li>
            <li>They are amazed at how clean their teeth feel even hours after brushing.</li>
            <li>Also, taking apart the head once a week to clean it as recommended by the manufacturer is a bit of a headache.</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel extremely clean.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>What a difference a toothbrush makes, my teeth have never felt this clean.</li>
            <li>The effect is amazingly clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The charge last for many days, which is handy for taking it on vacations if you don&#x27;t want to take the charger along (although it is</li>
            <li>But teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and powerful, I would buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li>I also recommend using a Butler Proxabrush to clean between the teeth after every meal.</li>
            <li>- Insanitary brush heads, which you cannot clean (after three months use,    </li>
            <li>and he did commend how clean my teeth were.  </li>
            <li>good thing about this light is that it will come on only when it needs to thus helping lengthen in-between charges.  </li>
            <li>so you down&#x27;t have to take it apart to clean it all the time.  </li>
            <li>(the 7400 model about $70), and this one trumps it in terms of the clean feeling i get when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I used to brush a lot longer with a manual toothbrush and still didn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean.</li>
            <li>I use this toothbrush, my teeth feel extremely clean.  </li>
            <li>and I think it does clean well between the teeth.</li>
            <li>Plus, it gives you that &#x27;just from the dentist&#x27; clean feeling every time you brush.</li>
            <li>No bad breath even after coffee, and my teeth feel clean all day.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean...might be better to rinse with listerine also as the toothbrush holds lil&#x27; toothpaste and doesn&#x27;t give an entirely clean mouth feel like the manual ones.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product and would reccommend it if you are in the market for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best Sonicare so far and it really does the job well.  </li>
            <li>I will know if it has done any good after my next trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li>With the Sonicare, I&#x27;ve been able to reduce my brushing time to 2 minutes (using the built-in timing program of the Elite e9500), and yet have a much cleaner mouth than before.  </li>
            <li>Thereafter, it delivers full intensity.  </li>
            <li>THIS MAY BE TRUE FOR SOMEONE WHO BRUSHES ONCE A DAY.</li>
            <li>one gets used to the full power gradually.  </li>
            <li>This one is much stronger and more vigorous.  </li>
            <li>At full power it feels like it&#x27;s blasting away dirt particles that may have gotten stuck on the tooth.  </li>
            <li>However after the Sonicare started to gain full power, I understood why it was designed as such.&lt;br</li>
            <li>brush heads - 2 full size heads and 1 compact.&lt;br</li>
            <li>3 brush heads - 2 full size heads and 1 compact.    </li>
            <li>It still seems a tad over energetic even on the gentle cycle, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any worsening of recession.  </li>
            <li>It no longer feels like you are putting the whole machine in your mouth which is better for cleaning as well.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s probably an effective brush assuming you don&#x27;t have any sensitive gums.    </li>
            <li>It came with two brushes which is good for 1 or 2 people but if buying for family use you need to get extra brushes.  </li>
            <li>I was therefore happy to purchase a new, though upgraded, version of my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;easy start\\&quot; feature, enabled out of the box, gradually increases power over the first fourteen brushings.      </li>
            <li>She then told me that the new Sonicare e9500 is a great brush and that Sonicare upgraded their features on the brush- better design, easier to reach to teeth that are lodged way in the back of your mouth, better bristle action.  </li>
            <li>This thing is capable of slinging a fine mist of toothpaste up to the light fixture.</li>
            <li>Gives teeth and mouth a fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I received my toothbrush yesterday and quickly got it onto the charger.</li>
            <li>Sure, the price for brush heads is steep - so the question is: How much is oral hygiene worth to you?</li>
            <li>Sure, the price for brush heads is steep - so the question is: How much is oral hygiene worth to you?</li>
            <li>One quick pass in the morning was it.</li>
            <li>Even my wife has commented on how quickly I&#x27;m finished with my night-time routine.  </li>
            <li>Although it does tickle my lips, it gets the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li>This model is much better than the older models.</li>
            <li>However, when I spend $119.99 for a product, it had better last more than five months.</li>
            <li>Has many more features that I haven&#x27;t tried such as reducing power, changing the cycle times, etc.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums fell vibrant and healthy.</li>
            <li>The only thing better would be to have a free teeth cleaning once a week!</li>
            <li>Even if you&#x27;re loyal to the Braun line, please give the Sonicare a try.</li>
            <li>and right away my teeth felt so much cleaner, and my gums felt more massaged than with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I purchased this just a little more than a month ago and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>All in all a very worthy and wise purchase especially if you are able to grab one from warehouse clubs (or hopefully here if they decide to match or lower the price even further).</li>
            <li>This is the lazy person&#x27;s ideal mouthcare device.  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement for one of the very first versions...that lasted for years.    </li>
            <li>My last Sonicare electric toothbrush lasted over six years, and I was very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this model that I use every day now, not like my other original model that was not as comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>These have a good old fashioned nickel-cadmium battery and they only have so many charge cycles.  </li>
            <li>the more normal \\&quot;brush\\&quot; shape is more what one is accustomed to with normal toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise this would be a very good toothbrush but with this major flaw, I am only giving it two stars.</li>
            <li>The clean feeling you get after each use is amazing, and after about a month, I started to notice my teeth actually turning whiter.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean and smooth, and I really feel like I get the food of the day out of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Price is fine on Amazon and as usual shipping was great.</li>
            <li>Also since it comes with a large and small brush, I am alternating to see which one works best.</li>
            <li>Really easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.  </li>
            <li>We bought our first Sonicare Elite year before last and have been pleased with the effectiveness it has in keeping our teeth and gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>However, with it&#x27;s current price point I would rather not be the first to invest this time and just wait until even more kinks are sorted out and a better offer is brought to the market.  </li>
            <li>However, with it&#x27;s current price point I would rather not be the first to invest this time and just wait until even more kinks are sorted out and a better offer is brought to the market.  </li>
            <li>is the same that i read in other review, perfect, you fell your mouth clean after use it.</li>
            <li>becuase little bits fly out.</li>
            <li>Get that great &#x27;just from the hygienist&#x27; feeling everyday.</li>
            <li>&quot; I couldn&#x27;t stand it for more than 30 seconds,but I got used to it and now my gums aren&#x27;t as tickled, but I did notice that (and this may sound gross)</li>
            <li>I liked them enough, but after giving the Sonicare a try</li>
            <li>Elite e9500 includes a nice travel case, a regular and compact brush head, a timer, 2-speeds, and a battery charge status display.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a great toothbrush, it is worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure she would really like it as much as she does.  </li>
            <li>She thought I did my flossing more frequently.  </li>
            <li>This product is even better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely let the head touch my teeth.  </li>
            <li>but this one is worth it.</li>
            <li>The 2min timer is really useful</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost, you&#x27;ll wonder why you didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.</li>
            <li>but well worth every penny now</li>
            <li>I took it on a 10 day trip, used it twice a day and the battery was still charged and the brush still powerful when I returned.      </li>
            <li>and they are worth ever penny.</li>
            <li>and I liked it until the charge only held for three days.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>We liked it so much we bought it for each of our 3 adult children</li>
            <li>This was a great upgrade able to use two different head types and different gentle settings for brushing.  </li>
            <li>Expect it will be worth the price ...</li>
            <li>While it certainly does clean under your gums some, and non-flossers will notice a difference, it will not prevent gum disease by itself.</li>
            <li>More important, how much is your general health and wellbeing worth to you?</li>
            <li>More important, how much is your general health and wellbeing worth to you?</li>
            <li>It actually makes me want to brush more often because you just get a really clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>Advanced research in comparison to Oral B was proven accurate and this is a great toothbrush, with powerful cleaning action, alternate brush heads and great features like gradually increasing brush action strength the first several uses to allow time for adjustment and the 30 second per quadrant timer.</li>
            <li>Decided to take the dentist&#x27;s advise and he was right.</li>
            <li>Combined with the right toothpaste you will notice the difference.</li>
            <li>I got this toothbrush right after I got my teeth cleaned</li>
            <li>and he was right...</li>
            <li>While it seems to do an outstanding job of cleaning teeth, the vibration is strong and very disconcerting when the handle or back of the brush hits your teeth.</li>
            <li>power is more constant from full charge up to the time it needs charging.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, it needs to be cleaned very often in order for it to be clean.</li>
            <li>I actually brush for the full 2 minutes now, which I am sure makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Full power right at the start would be too much.</li>
            <li>However, if you simply unscrew the top and rinse it out with water then give it a quick bang against the sink that problem goes</li>
            <li>He experienced a tingling feeling at first, but that went away after the first few uses.    </li>
            <li>I have had 2 others over the past 6 years and Sonicare continues to improve on a great product.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge fairly well-I charge it once weekly on average.</li>
            <li>Oral-B was smart enough to supply me with this kind of case for my Triumph purchase.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B was smart enough to supply me with this kind of case for my Triumph purchase.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and after brushing, my teeth feel very clean similar to the way they feel after the Dental Hygienist finishes the polishing.    </li>
            <li>Even so these very popular electric toothbrushes don&#x27;t last more than two-years in my experience, and I have purchased quite a few.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the transition pauses that tell me when to move on to another part of my mouth, and the brush head changes color when it&#x27;s time for a new head.</li>
            <li>I only had about 10 days to use it before my next cleaning, and she said my teeth were great-</li>
            <li>The brush heads are smaller; more maneuverable and much, much easier to clean after use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few surprise cavities after years of regular brushing and flossing, I bought two of these brushes (one for spouse) and hoped for the best.</li>
            <li>The brush vibrates very fast and brushes your teeth in a way that you cannot emulate by hand.  </li>
            <li>When I explained the problem and that the initial order was made in plenty of time for 5-9 day delivery, Amazon was very kind and sent another Sonicare Next Day Delivery.</li>
            <li>We had the original Sonicare for years and it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>I was an old school gal, using my manual toothbrush, and thought I was doing a decent job of keeping my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>This is my first electronic toothbrush</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my gums were \\&quot;tickled.\\</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works pretty well.    </li>
            <li>However, I went to Costco to purchase this instead for 124.99, which came with TWO handles, 2 Regular brush heads, and 1 compact brush head. :)</li>
            <li>This is my first Sonicare, and I truly can tell a difference in the way my teeth look.    </li>
            <li>Both of these are actually minor complaints considering what a great job the toothbrush actually does cleaning one&#x27;s teeth.      </li>
            <li>The brush itself I recommend without reservation, just be aware that it does NOT replace flossing.</li>
            <li>When Optiva first introduced the Philips Sonicare Advance circa 1992, it was unlike any electric toothbrushes on the market.</li>
            <li>The first time it fell out</li>
            <li>This was my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really gentle and powerful.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my first Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It sprayed toothpaste all over the place the first time I tried using it</li>
            <li>it is very noise first time when I use it, it is powerful, it&#x27;s like you have a massage device in your hand when you are brushing, it takes times to get used to it.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare toothbrush for more than 2 years with total satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>Philips is always first choice and Amazon first source.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products to everyone!!  </li>
            <li>This is the first power toothbrush I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Once I turned off the toothbrush and subsequently cleaned splattered toothpaste from my face, clothes, mirror, and counter top</li>
            <li>I am not sure how good the lower versions (also cheaper) of sonicare are but this product has been totally worth it.</li>
            <li>have been able to see improvement in the last 4 months i have been using this model.</li>
            <li>First, I had an Interplac.</li>
            <li>just used for the first time..  </li>
            <li>The 30 seconds per tooth area, i.e., top outside, lower inside helps me brush longer like dentists recommend.  </li>
            <li>This product has been discontinued most likely because the on/off button keeps falling off.</li>
            <li>so I can consistently brush each surface of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money for how much use I got out of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money for how much use</li>
            <li>I bought my first Sonicare years ago under advice from my dental surgeon.  </li>
            <li>I had a dental cleaning this morning, and the individual tooth pockets I&#x27;ve been battling all my life were dramatically better.  </li>
            <li>The warrantees are also longer which indicating the product is of higher quality.</li>
            <li>After useing this toothbrush for about a week I went to a dentist apointment and for the first time ever he told me there was not any plack buildup in my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty effortless to reach everywhere in your mouth and my teeth look whiter from using it for a while now.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been an Oral-B Braun power toothbrush user for years constantly upgrading every two years for their latest toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The feeling left me wanting more power.  </li>
            <li>Then I remembered that toothbrush is meant to increase in power gradually within the first 14 uses in order to sit in and get used to the sonic brushing experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No need for a constant battery drain which could be used more toward powering the toothbrush head than the display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>appreciate how gentle yet powerful it can act.  </li>
            <li>This way me and my wife are able to bring only one travel case.  </li>

            <li>So yea, pls check out the Flexcare series first.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>and I told her the first version of the Sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li>Well, I went home charged it for 24 hours and then tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>It is very portable too!  </li>
            <li>This Sonicare is much better than the last model.  </li>
            <li>The beeps at 30 second intervals is a help to make sure you are brushing all teeth evenly.  </li>
            <li>The quick vibration and the small brush head make for a real clean teeth brushing - gets the gums clean, too.  </li>
            <li>I like the timer, the brush is easy to grip and use, and the battery really does last a full 2 weeks between charges.</li>
            <li>It is much improved over the older versions and is easer to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>The spray is fine but profuse, so you really need to close your mouth almost completely to prevent the spray from covering everything within a foot or two.</li>
            <li>I was impressed they could design one to last twice as long as regular competitor heads.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed they could design one to last twice as long as regular competitor heads.  </li>
            <li>the inaccessible cavity of the large brush was full of fungal dirt,     despite my cleaning and drying of the brush after every use)  - Therefore, you need to buy a new brush after every some weeks.     </li>
            <li>Seems simple, but the turning it off thing took almost more vigilence than I&#x27;m capable of in the morning.</li>
            <li>My old toothbrush wasn&#x27;t effective enough to worry about over use.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that it brushes significantly harder/more powerfully the first brush after a charge than subsequent brushes.  </li>
            <li>The reviews I had seen about this suggested it was worth the slightly high price tag.</li>
            <li>especially like the \\&quot;easy start\\&quot; feature, which for the first 14 times the brush is used,</li>
            <li>At first use I didnt like it, but it took sometime to get used to the speed and sensation of the toothbrush and now I really like how well it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li>I also love the feature where it times how long you brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I actually upgraded from the original Sonicare when they first came out to the most recent Sonicare-</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a big deal because it&#x27;s easy to recharge.  </li>
            <li>was the only thing that works for me, because it is easy and convenient.    </li>
            <li>It easily reaches all the way to the back teeth and on the underside.  </li>
            <li>(My husband was able to get one to last that long through the use of plastic and super glues, but the result was something only an engineer could love.)</li>
            <li>This brushing action is fantastic, just like the new one, but this design stinks...literally.</li>
            <li>I had an earlier version of this toothbrush, which was satisfactory, but this new one is better.</li>
            <li>in all a very worthy and wise purchase especially if you are able to grab one from warehouse clubs (or hopefully here if they decide to match or lower the price even further).form versus a simple bright green led light which comes on to alert you for a few seconds only after every use.  Simple and ingenius.  </li>
            <li>This is great news actually since less maintenance is required.  </li>
            <li>This is great news actually since less maintenance is required.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare is great - used a &#x27;spin brush&#x27; previously but Sonicare is head &amp; shoulders (or maybe teeth &amp; gums) above.</li>
            <li>It uses an internal magnet so the motor is perfectly sealed (As opposed to the Oral B)and impervious to the water and paste which regularly slides down a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The NEW brush that I bought is even better than the old one, which was about 7-8 years old.</li>
            <li>Both will clean your teeth very well and for general oral hygiene I would recommend ANY Sonicare model without hesitation.  </li>
            <li>problem with Oral-B Triumph and their older line of power toothbrush is that at full charge the brush action is at</li>
            <li>Furthermore, this same led light will tell you the charge indicator status as well as how much power is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have ever heard of is that it is so powerful it irritates the gums, but this has a gentle setting, so this thing is great.</li>
            <li>The battery is very efficient, too.</li>
            <li>: &lt;br /&gt;Powerful but gentle &lt;</li>
            <li>I tried tons of stuff to keep this from happening, but nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>My last dentist visit confirmed my fervent hope, this toothbrush may well keep me out of the periodontist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really have to try the Sonicare Elite Power Toothbrush to see for yourself</li>
            <li>You really have to try the Sonicare Elite Power Toothbrush to see for yourself</li>
            <li>Another feature, after the intial charging, it is always ready to be used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product helps you to improve behaviour and works really well.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t so much of a chore brushing anymore, and I find myself grabbing the brush while just sitting in my chair and running over my teeth</li>
            <li>The last visit to the dentist has confirmed that she saw a differance.     </li>
            <li>I really do encourage others to buy this product.</li>
            <li>(Do you think China would really do that?)    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended...five star product!</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter than before because it removes the yellowing stain and the difference is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>What can I say it works very well.</li>
            <li>As soon as I got it and charged it up it starts on the gentle cycle (works</li>
            <li>very small).&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing really Elite about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The two minute timer is very helpful.  </li>
            <li>It cleans the teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The whole family uses them.</li>
            <li>Eventually, the whole thing gives way leaving a gapping hole.</li>
            <li>This brush really gets in between your teeth, and moves the toothpaste in the crevices.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Sonicare products!</li>
            <li>The two different heads are great, especially the smaller one.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have been using the Sonicare system and really believe in their effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>After I finish brushing my teeth, I always give my gum a gentle massage with Sonicare.</li>
            <li>If you want to program the toothbrush, you simply use those two buttons and watch the led indicator light to tell you what mode you are at based on it&#x27;s position.  </li>
            <li>This product really helps to satisfy it.  </li>
            <li>Teeth are extremely important to overall health, and I never want to have to get dentures.  </li>
            <li>He really is amazed on how well it really cleans his teeth.</li>
            <li>Thanks Sonicare...   </li>
            <li>I am very unsatisfied with this item as I feel that I should not be cleaning the inside of the holder.</li>
            <li>Very soon after purchasing it, we went out of town for a week, and even with two people using it, the battery lasted just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Another feature which I really like is a built-in timer, which \\&quot;beeps\\&quot; every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>and she said the problem might have been because I used too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>Its works very well</li>
            <li>Way more energy in that toothbrush than I had ever expected.  </li>
            <li>The e9500 has a replacable battery so when this one wears out, I can replace just the battery (provided the cost is reasonable).</li>
            <li>31,000 BSPM is, patently, many many more brush strokes per minute than what any mere human is capable of producing with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I brushed my teeth twice a day but to be honest perhaps 1 minute in total.</li>
            <li>nice standard brand name solid toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>woozing and buzzing sound gave me a headache during my first few times, but I adapted to it quickly</li>
            <li>Arrived in new packaging, exactly as I ordered it and much sooner than anticipated.  </li>
            <li>I know that sounds strange but it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>like the timer and the &#x27;break-in&#x27; feature which keeps those new to this type brush from overdoing it at first.  </li>
            <li>Additionally it increases the brushing for the first 20 uses and this helps you get accustomed to the new sensations.</li>
            <li>I was re-introduced to the Soincare when I went to my new dentist for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>One power the toothbrush and the other to switch between a more gentle cycle.  </li>
            <li>I cannot compare it with other brands on the market, but honestly, I do not care, this one is excellent.</li>
            <li>After 24 hours of initial charge and first month of use, I must say it&#x27;s a different cleaning experience that feels more gentle to my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very silent and gentle with your gums, it will clean your mouth thoroughly.</li>
            <li>This is the second power toothbrush that I have used, and it is so much more effective than the previous one (a different brand) for what it does.  </li>
            <li>need to clean the connection between the head and the handle regularly as water gets in</li>
            <li>dentist recommended a Sonicare toothbrush to me as a way to keep my teeth as clean as possible between 6 month checkups.  </li>
            <li>The only thing i would improve is the ability to clean inside the unit.</li>
            <li>Length of time required to brush (and actually get your teeth clean)  </li>
            <li>Easy to use straight out of the box- two settings for vigorous and gentle brushing, 30 sec beeps after each quadrant-</li>
            <li>Consequently, my teeth didn&#x27;t really feel clean until it finally got to the final full power stage - just a warning for</li>
            <li>Considering the very high price of new brushes (20+ USD, which of course    is much too high), this system gets very costly.</li>
            <li>Good clean design, so far not a single complaint.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this unit as I think it can really help you maintain the health of you teeth to the highest level.</li>
            <li>- the performance of Sonicare starts to degrade and the cleaning action of the Sonicare becomes noticeably less effective.</li>
            <li>Never thought much about my gums, but they are nice &amp; pink &amp; clean &amp; tight, like in the ad photos.  </li>
            <li>For me, that is amazing because every time I&#x27;ve gone in the past I&#x27;d had to have SOMETHING drilled and filled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After having read others complain about battery life and keeping the Sonicare clean, I&#x27;ve made sure to only put the unit in the charger when needed (about every 2-3 weeks or so), and I keep it angled up slightly</li>
            <li>If you brush carefully and gently, they will longer and clear better.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase for an adult electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I initially tried to use the Sonicare in a similar fashion to a regular brush, but ended up with some abrasions on my gum - yes, you CAN get too much of a good thing.</li>
            <li>THE MANUAL SAYS A FULL CHARGE CAN LAST FOR UP TO 2 WEEKS.</li>
            <li>The first 2 weeks my gums were a bit sensitive to the motion of the brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true once you use this product you will never go back.</li>
            <li>Also even at home you would want to make full use of the fact that it&#x27;s a rechargeable toothbrush that will help you charge once and save on electricity by constantly charging it after every use.  </li>
            <li>However after the Sonicare started to gain full power, I understood why it was designed as such.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a lil&#x27; getting used to and some spraying is surely bound to happen the first few times if you are new to electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using an Oral B and really didn&#x27;t see the need for a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>the realization that they need to make more money in half the time, or that people were complaining of bacteria build-up and foul odor from collecting water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the realization that they need to make more money in half the time, or that people were complaining of bacteria build-up and foul odor from collecting water.      </li>
            <li>Although this is pretty expensive for a toothbrush, it works exactly as described, is easy to use and does a fantastic job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>Fast vibrating action that gets in between teeth and gums very well.</li>
            <li>I upgraded from an older one that after 7 years would not work anymore.</li>
            <li>use the 2-minute Smartimer (actually, I use the 2 minute 30 second timer option so that I can brush the top of my molars) and the 30-second Quadpacer interval timer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dental exams have been steadily improving since I started using this.</li>
            <li>We have owned an older Sonicare for years--replaced it with the newer model on our Dentist&#x27;s advice.  </li>
            <li>I had an older model Sonicare that lasted years.</li>
            <li>This replace an older Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I had an older model (which lasted about 8 years).  </li>
            <li>I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING THIS PARTICULAR POWER BRUSH, AND DECIDED ON THIS ONE,</li>
            <li>compact travel case which is okay for only 1 person since it holds 1 handle and only 1 brush head.  </li>
            <li>1 compact travel case which is okay for only 1 person since it holds 1 handle and only 1 brush head.  </li>
            <li>-Same problem with Sonicare products, most toothpastes will cause the white residue on the brush heads and the metal piece where u slot the brushhead into the handle.</li>
            <li>Hygienist is now double checking to make sure my current appointment was not made prematurely.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and was very prone to cavities</li>
            <li>(I brush for the whole two minutes and he recommendsnot doing that more than once per day and with a gentle, ordinary toothpaste as opposed to a whitener.)  </li>
            <li>or so it will take firmer tightening to put it on the holder without having it make a vibrating loose sound.</li>
            <li>It came highly recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>I only use it once a day (using my regular brush in the morning), and find that&#x27;s more than enough to keep that &#x27;fresh from the dentist&#x27; feeling.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I always get high praise for my teeth and gum care, but seldom floss--</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>No complaints and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This Sonicare was highly recommended by my dentist</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend the sonicare elite 9000...</li>
            <li>You expect high performance from the newest generation Sonicare</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>More importantly, that&#x27;s where I place the brush head everyday to keep them separate from the handle while I air dry both after every brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More importantly, that&#x27;s where I place the brush head everyday to keep them separate from the handle while I air dry both after every brushing.    </li>
            <li>It works like a dream - sure, more expensive than a regular toothbrush, but you&#x27;ll save much more in the long run.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating bristles provide an itchy sensation the first few brushings, but it&#x27;s fine after you get accustomed to the feeling.  </li>
            <li>Having had full periodontal surgery in the past, I needed something to keep the roots clean and this does the job.  </li>
            <li>I only hope I will get my money&#x27;s worth and will be able to keep this brush well maintained for a few years.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if this is normal for an electronic toothbrush</li>
            <li>Normally I can hold it all in using a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am normally a bit of a purist, but by the recommendation of my dental hygienist I purchased this product about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>I still doubt the effectiveness of the FlossAction now and the ability to actually get in between the teeth in a powerful manner versus just grabbing a floss.  </li>
            <li>It was a b-day gift and a normal reorder wouldn&#x27;t have gotten to me on time.</li>
            <li>The buttons on these things disintegrate in about 7 months of normal use.</li>
            <li>The two different size brush heads is very nice as I have a small mouth and the smaller brush works very well.  </li>
            <li>One nice thing about these new-generation Sonicares:  smaller brushes and dramatically less splatter.  </li>
            <li>I also decided on my own that the FlossAction brush head of Oral-B helped me actually floss less than twice every day.  </li>
            <li>I mean 5 years ago it was amazing</li>
            <li>And the dental hygienist who urged me to switch to an electric toothbrush noticed right away on my next visit.    </li>
            <li>While my first use felt a little strange (ticklish), my teeth came out super clean.  </li>
            <li>recently discovered my Mom has been using this exact same toothbrush for a few years too &amp; has been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get toothpaste down the handle (easily prevented).  </li>
            <li>I used it last night for the first time, it does feel very strange but my teeth feel and look really clean when done.</li>
            <li>Also, it is pretty cool how it eases you in to using it by keeping the spped slow for your first 10 uses or so and adjusts by itself.  </li>
            <li>and that was before she even knew I had the new brush.  </li>
            <li>The new heads do not address the problem of water and tooth paste running inside the head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this was done on purpose so you would have to buy a new one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new design eliminates all that slew of slime.</li>
            <li>oh well live and learn.</li>
            <li>I can live with both of these items, but it would be nicer.</li>
            <li>and I got a new one.  </li>
            <li>All it needs is a new toothbrush head every 3 months</li>
            <li>No seriously this was a problem with my old sonic care.  </li>
            <li>I find that the brush head starts to show signs of wear after only 3 months - the performance of Sonicare starts to degrade and the cleaning action of the Sonicare becomes noticeably less effective.</li>
            <li>It may be expensive, but keeping your teeth healthy is important.</li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t complain much as any electric toothbrush is definitely a step up from manual.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a lazy person it is great because I don&#x27;t have to move my hand up and down.</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive teeth, so the dentist recommended the Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The batteries on our two brushes are still going strong and last a surprisingly long time between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to push this particular part down and then clean the &#x27;inside&#x27; of the area thats attached to the brush head.</li>
            <li>I actually use my fabric case pretty often</li>
            <li>My original SonicCare lasted for several years and I am on my 2nd one.</li>
            <li>The diameter of the brush handle of the Sonicare FlexCare is smaller and provides a more confortable grip, especially if you have smaller hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The diameter of the brush handle of the Sonicare FlexCare is smaller and provides a more confortable grip, especially if you have smaller hands.    </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems at my regular 6 month dental cleanings for exactly 5 years now.  </li>
            <li>This is our second Sonicare, as the battery died after 3 years in the first one.  </li>
            <li>And the feeling on my teeth WOW!</li>
            <li>After using it, I agree with the rave reviews it had gotten so far!   </li>
            <li>With its initial ramp up (over the first 14 brush cycles I believe)</li>
            <li>My significant other recommended this to me (she&#x27;d been using it for years).  </li>
            <li>1 small plastic container to hold two brush heads in case you have more than two people sharing the handles.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel squeaky clean that I&#x27;m only hoping this is what the dentist will also see on my next visit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth feel squeaky clean that I&#x27;m only hoping this is what the dentist will also see on my next visit.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to take care of not only their teeth, but also their gum.</li>
            <li>Oral bacteria and gum disease has been conclusively linked with a whole host of health problems including heart disease, pancreatic cancer and other bodily ills - Sound far-fetched?</li>
            <li>Oral bacteria and gum disease has been conclusively linked with a whole host of health problems including heart disease, pancreatic cancer and other bodily ills - Sound far-fetched?</li>
            <li>A FULL CHARGE WOULD ONLY LAST ABOUT 4 DAYS.</li>
            <li>The only issue I&#x27;ve had with the unit is the charge lights have slowly failed, so that the only lights that light up now are the fully charged top light and the next lower one.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel like I just had a professional cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office all the time and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pain to have to bring the charger along, but then I am away for over a week at a time, even though my battery lasts for nearly a week.      </li>
            <li>Sonicare Advance used a piezoelectric multimorph transducer, which was a patented technology developed by</li>
            <li>I had one and the soft plastic</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums</li>
            <li>This was an unexpected result but clearly a benefit.</li>
            <li>She really feels like she has had a deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li>After about 5 uses though brushing with it becomes natural</li>
            <li>My old unit did not have this.    </li>
            <li>the noise and violence of the toothbrush surprised me to the extent that I removed it from my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Having used the Oral B Professional toothbrush, I find the Sonicare e9500 to be quieter, a lttle measier to manipulate, and equivalent in cleaning efficiency.</li>
            <li>its everything it says it is  makes it seem like i just went for a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>I had the old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Puts my old Oral-B to shame.  </li>
            <li>THE OLD SAYING IS</li>
            <li>My dentist is always amazed with how young my gum stays.</li>
            <li>I became more daring and started to eat sticky sweets and neglected brushing until late in the day.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s really that gross.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s really that gross.  </li>
            <li>This product far exceeds expectations.  </li>
            <li>After about a month they go too soft.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare Elite was a bit strange at first.  </li>
            <li>I really like the 30 second intervals when the brush would beep so that you can move to another quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this Sonicare Elite for my son whom is 19 yrs old and hates the dentist.</li>
            <li>I even bought 2nd one for a friend&#x27;s birthday and he also really like it too.  </li>
            <li>To solve this problem I cut off the old brush,&lt;br</li>
            <li>few more dentist visits later</li>
            <li>the Triumph handle will display the battery status in monocrhome-hard-to-see graphic form versus a simple bright green led light which comes on to alert you for a few seconds only after every use.  </li>
            <li>admit, I&#x27;m late in the game in switching to this particular model as there is now the more expensive FlexCare line with a more compact brush head and supposedly more powerful sonic brushing action.  </li>
            <li>I am using my Sonicare toothbrush at least once a day and certainly like the clean feeling it leaves in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I never thought that an electric toothbrush would clean my teeth any better than I could with a regular toothbrush, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li>This hasn&#x27;t caused me a problem but makes me a little worried when I periodically go to clean the gunk out in holder under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new head design enables me to get to the back teeth so much easier than the last model.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t sure that I was going to like this rather expensive toothbrush.      </li>
            <li>The only down side was that I was promised free gift wrapping</li>
            <li>This brush is highly recommended by my dentist and especially by my peridontist.</li>
            <li>With a little practice, you can pucker your mouth just enough that the mirror and sink don&#x27;t receive a fine spray of toothpaste twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Dentists usually give them out free after your teethcleaning.</li>
            <li>Grab  the same model from your local warehouse shopping club for the deluxe package and you will have an extra handle, an extra brush head and a compact plastic travel case at less than the price</li>
            <li>Having bought a slew of other electric toothbrushes and being disgusted by the slime that easily accumulates, looking for an easy to hold and effective product that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of crevaces to hold onto bacteria.  </li>
            <li>My only gripe is that the battery can not be replaced so that when it goes, you have to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li>The new, Elite models, are a big improvement.</li>
            <li>My point is we need to floss anyway as part of the brushing habit, so why will I need to spend extra on the ubber expensive FlossAction brush head, when I need to spend on purchasing a good floss</li>
            <li>After about 7 days, several of my teeth/gums became very sensitive and I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li>My first Sonicare toothbrush lasted 5-6 years before the battery needed a charge every other day.</li>
            <li>Since I have never used a decent power toothbrush before, it is taking quite a long time to adjust.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I feel my teeth are cleaner, they are slightly whiter (I have only been using it for 2 months), and my gums get adequately massaged as well.  </li>
            <li>I doubt very much that a German, Japanese or Korean electronics producer would be selling a major product for personal use which is unsuitable for use outside its country of purchase.</li>
            <li>The brushes have a LITTLE colored band on them that is good for identifying your brush but the colors are close, so in dim light or poor eyesight its hard to see which is which.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product, you will never go back to the regular toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li>Other dental cleaning systems work well but not nearly as efficiently and quickly as this one.</li>
            <li>The battering in the brush will last longer if it is allowed to rundown completely before it is recharged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes so far have lasted only about 3 months each</li>
            <li>The fact that the brushes needed to be replaced as frequently as they do is the only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>The 30 second intervals help me brush each quadrant completely.</li>
            <li>The timed beeps result in complete brushing coverage, something I was lax with using a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>(Versus Oral-B&#x27;s simple design of having a metal rod stick out from the body and have the brush head insert into that rotating rod to create the brushing action.)    </li>
            <li>I have used it for years - my old one finally wore out</li>
            <li>Wow... I thought I knew how to brush my teeth, but I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ve been doing my entire life, for that was not brushing my teeth as Sonicare does...</li>
            <li>first few uses made me and my wife wonder if there was any effectiveness to the brushing action.  </li>
            <li>A slow start to allow acceptance of the sound and vibration lasts two weeks.  </li>
            <li>O&#x27;yea the first one broke down (Sonicare not</li>
            <li>The first two times, they were accusatory and said their research showed toothpaste was breaking down the rubber.</li>
            <li>The shape of the brush also makes it easy to get to the back of back teeth, barely possible with round brush heads.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the previous Sonicare elite for a few years now and it wasn&#x27;t as powerful as when i first got it, so i decided to upgrade to this newest model.  </li>
            <li>The only difference I can see between my new 9500 and the 7500/7300 models (about $20 cheaper if you can still find one) is that it comes with two different brush sizes.  </li>
            <li>The brush is great at getting to the spots in the back of your mouth that can be difficult to reach with a conventional brush.</li>
            <li>i have seen a big inprovement in my gums and teeth in general, way better than any other toothbrush i have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>After a few days, you can tell how much the battery is getting drained and how weak the spinning action is becoming.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that it only took 2 minutes to brush and how short two minutes goes by.  </li>
            <li>My second unit which was replaced by Philips just developed the same problem as the unit it replaced.</li>
            <li>that of 7500 series is far more difficult to be maintained.</li>
            <li>must admit it was a little turn off at first to feel it so flimsy on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I must admit it was a little turn off at first to feel it so flimsy on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>As a man and as a regular guy who has been using the regular tooth bush since childhood, I couln&#x27;t help moving any electronic tools up and down and left and right in the mouth.</li>
            <li>Works well and really makes my teeth feel cleaner than regular or even other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>By the way Philips sets the toothbrush at a lower setting for the first few brushings to make it easier on you.    </li>
            <li>It will slowly increase the speed of the vibration over the first few days until it reaches full vibration power.</li>
            <li>after few mths of usage, it tend to turn black or mouldy and its tough to clean those off even with magic sponge.</li>
            <li>No other brand of electric toothbrush has been able to rival its performance before or since (sorry, [[ASIN:B000U08ZN4 Oral B Triumph]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The brushes work well, although I wish they would last a little longer but first pair lasted almost 3 months.</li>
            <li>I can reach behind my back molars so easily.</li>
            <li>Quick disconnect for the brush if more than one person would like to use the base</li>
            <li>On the other hand if you can avoid another visit to the dentist to get a new crown or filling it saves you some cost.</li>

            <li> I have been extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush but</li>
            <li> wife)but sonicare sent me a great replacment(that&#x27;s Sonicare not wife).</li>
            <li> It does a great job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> They work great.</li>
            <li> I still rate it great for it&#x27;s purpose and will continue to use it, but..........</li>
            <li> Pricing on Amazon was great</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a great product, great company,</li>
            <li> , I know it&#x27;ll be great,</li>
            <li> The product works great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I was totally impressed with the effective cleaning ability and the smoothness it created on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> A great product.</li>
            <li> Tooth brush works great.  </li>
            <li> They work great and are sold here.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!!  </li>
            <li> He told me this toothbrush has done a wonderful job on his gums and his teeth look much better.</li>
            <li> the features are great and the end result was amazing.  </li>
            <li> how good it works.</li>
            <li> If, however, you already own the Philips Sonicare Elite, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that the Sonicare Elite works just as well as the Sonicare FlexCare.</li>

            <li> I bought this toothbrush thinking it&#x27;s going to be good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> it looked good.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good for a month&#x27;s vacation.</li>
            <li> But I had no idea how good this product could be.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about five weeks and rate it as good, but not \\&quot;elite\\&quot; as the product name indicates.</li>
            <li> I can replace the rechargeable batteries and Consumer Reports rated it almost as good as the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I can replace the rechargeable batteries and Consumer Reports rated it almost as good as the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This is a really good power toothbrush (the e9500).  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still doing good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Batteries are still about as good as it was on day 1.  </li>
            <li> good by battery.  </li>
            <li> It felt good in my hand</li>
            <li> - Good and ergonomic shape of the brushes    </li>
            <li> So here I am with amalgam in my tooth and a good wake up call.  </li>
            <li> The material is a good breeding ground for mould pores.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;If price is the concern preventing you from using Sonicare&#x27;s superior technology</li>
            <li> then you are being penny wise and pound foolish.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good way to get out ahead.</li>
            <li> Good investment for the health of your teeth.</li>
            <li> The best way to clean and care for your teeth.</li>
            <li> If this were not the case I would have loved to give this toothbrush a five, because it did do an exceptional job.</li>
            <li> My turn-of-the-century Sonicare would run a *good* two weeks on a charge with just me using it, and this one does too (more like three!).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great quality and works very smoothly.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> but I am very pleased with the results from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter and the dentist was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is lighter, holds a better charge, and feels like it&#x27;s doing a great job.  </li>
            <li> Great tooth brushes, we had gone the cheap route before, DON&#x27;T DO IT!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush, no doubt, but I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s any more effective at cleaning teeth than the less-expensive e7300 model.  </li>
            <li> I got this about a month ago and LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I bought this at target about 5 years ago and love it!</li>
            <li> (well, most of them!)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> THIS TOOTHBRUSH IS EASY TO USE AND FEELS GREAT ON THE GUMLINE.</li>
            <li> My teeth look amazing, and I&#x27;ve been an electric toothbrush user for years.</li>
            <li> It works amazing well.  </li>
            <li> This one is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare is simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I saw that The Sharper Image carried this toothbrush and it looked nice</li>
            <li> I own the e9500 while my roommate has the e7300</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it, but it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s an option.      </li>
            <li> I own both the Philips Sonicare Elite e9500 and the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Sonicare is that some kind of slimy gunk builds up in the head of the brush.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush takes some getting use to (it chewed up my lower lip in the very beginning)  but, once you get the hang of it, it is so great!  </li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas and it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> The Braun was nice, but did not give me that sense of having my teeth cleaned by a Dental Tech.</li>
            <li> Expense but nice for me.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely THE BEST TOOTHBRUSH ON THE MARKET for home use!!!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is extremely effective in cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li> heck, I may even buy him one of his own.  </li>
            <li> - Nice design, practical settings (2-minute-clock)  </li>
            <li> i found the timer feature in this toothbrush highly effective in aiding consistancy of teeth brushing.</li>
            <li> the two speed feature is also a handy tool.</li>
            <li> you can see why this toothbrush as a whole with accessories and design flaw of not being waterproof does not earn perfect 5</li>
            <li> So you can see why this toothbrush as a whole with accessories and design flaw of not being waterproof does not earn perfect 5 stars.    </li>
            <li> THe brush head has to be cleaned every wk (kind of according to instructions).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had kind of a tooth fetish.  </li>
            <li> Also, would be nice to have a one piece head</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> Nice electronic features also.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sonicare Elite system about two months ago and have been thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready to give you the best toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that this toothbrush does not deserve a higher rating because basically it does a a very good job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> True, it does a great job when it works.  </li>
            <li> The sonic power is what delivers the punch to get those teeth sparking clean!!</li>
            <li> I do not believe that strong brushing &#x3D; good brushing.</li>
            <li> This brushing system is very easy to use</li>
            <li> sleek design, speed can be adjusted very easily</li>
            <li> Very easy to use also.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The clean feeling is amazing!  </li>
            <li> PRO:  - Very good sonic power, cleaning your teeth really thouroughly.  </li>
            <li> Many years ago I bought a Sonicare before it was popular.</li>
            <li> This one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> This by far was the best design from Philips.</li>
            <li> I owned an original Sonicare, but it died after seven years of faithful service and good dental checkups.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a great smile and healthy gums!</li>
            <li> All-in-all, a very good unit, and would recommend to anyone who wants to maintain healthy teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It honestly could be more ergonomic and better shaped.  </li>
            <li> This isnt cheap and the battery isnt as good as the latest model.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully in every way, but there is a major design flaw:  </li>
            <li> I thought i couldn&#x27;t do better than the manual method which i&#x27;ve used with great success most of my life (i&#x27;m 57)</li>
            <li> I have had great checkups with the dentist since I first began using it so replacing it with another sonicare</li>
            <li> Its features are very impressive and I am sure you can read other reviews to find out what is good about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and clean, so I can recommend it to anyone looking for great clean teeth!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for our son-he reports that it is a super good item and is more than pleased with it.</li>
            <li> So far it has been a very good product that I purchased.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product,quite pricey though but it sure beats the old fashion brush just buy one you will not regret it I garuntee.</li>
            <li> I found that I wanted more than 2 minutes brushing.</li>
            <li> After buying one for myself, I purchased 2 more to give to my grown children for Christmas.</li>
            <li> and I love the quadrant timer feature.</li>
            <li> Making life in the morning that much more tolerable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good buy, worth the money</li>
            <li> But in a cluttered bathroom in means keeping the charger out more often than not.    </li>
            <li> I love the Quad Pacer and the 2 minute auto shutoff, but I tend to brush for 2:30 or 3:00 minutes.</li>
            <li> I now follow the manufacturer&#x27;s advice, after cleaning face, glasses, and mirror for most of a week.</li>
            <li> Sonicare FlexCare]] is the latest incarnation of Sonicare&#x27;s Power Toothbrush.</li>

            <li> what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your teeth!</li>
            <li> My favorite feature is the customizable brushing timer.  </li>
            <li> (I need to get out more...</li>
            <li> I have used many electronic items in Europe - always of course  using a voltage regulator.</li>
            <li> Seems to do a better job</li>
            <li> Sure, the brush heads can be pricey</li>
            <li> My Mom congenitally has way too many teeth and is age 71.  </li>
            <li> I love how it divides your mouth into four sections so that you know you are brushing your teeth for the correct amount of time</li>
            <li> and we just love them---</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure it&#x27;s topped off</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> My sister has raved about hers for years, and she is going to buy this latest model for the adjustable speed option.  </li>
            <li> My gums look healthier and I could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> and I had herd how much better these were for your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I use this along with the Waterpik Power Flosser and my teeth and gums have never felt or looked better.</li>
            <li> I had it for many years.     </li>
            <li> It cleans better</li>
            <li> Fast shipping; I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li> Now I love the thing.  </li>
            <li> The audible timer is more beneficial than I would have thought.</li>
            <li> I still love this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much more power, smaller head excellent battery life.  </li>
            <li> During the last six years I have used this product and it does an excellent job, but it&#x27;s life</li>
            <li> I feel my teeth are in much better condition since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> Gum massage is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This one has more \\&quot;bells and whistles.\\&quot;  Adjustable power output</li>
            <li> the thinner brush heads a lot better.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush but found I could have bought it alot cheaper at costco, alot cheaper</li>
            <li> It was a no brainer gift idea when my daughter hinted she would love to get one someday.  </li>
            <li> many people make the mistake of brushing while using this</li>
            <li> It shipped on the 15th and it arrived on the 17th with free shipping from Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li> Now I love it.  </li>
            <li> more words.</li>
            <li> I have updated to the e9500 and love it.</li>
            <li> Nothing better for your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush...</li>
            <li> However, the price of the Sonicare is very, very attractive these days especially since they introduced the latest FlexCare line which is supposed to be more elite than this Elite model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, it&#x27;s still best to condition the battery by fully charging and discharging - which the manual suggests users do every once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem has got to do more with me and my eating habits.  </li>
            <li> I was used to the Oral-B FlossAction head which was more pronounced and bulky.  </li>
            <li> It may appear more cumbersome, but it&#x27;s easier to let water run thru both each and every time than to wait for residue to build up and for foul odor to occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> course the solution was solved with the introduction of their latest FlexCare line which imitates the construction of Oral-B, but still maintaining the sonic ability.  </li>
            <li> And as we&#x27;ve seen they always lower the price, introduce an upgraded line and with more accessories.  </li>
            <li> in case you have more than two people sharing the handles.  </li>
            <li> They should be able to provide a travel case that case house 1 handle and 2 brush heads.  </li>

            <li> -Brushing is more rough/strong than Flexcare    </li>
            <li> I have bought the latest Flexcare series under Sonicare</li>
            <li> It also fights stains in between the teeth better than its oralb counterpart.</li>
            <li> Love this power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Hoever, you need to come up with a better way to store excess electric cord.  </li>
            <li> I am a Elite usere myself and just love the money it is saving me from having to do additional dental work besides the annual cleanings for me.</li>
            <li> I have been nothing but pleased at it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> But i love it.</li>
            <li> I love mine already, and it hasn&#x27;t yet been 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> A great step up for not too much money.</li>
            <li> I really love everything about this toothbrush, except for the fact that the vibrations sometimes irritate and tickle my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Not too many places to hide and build a home.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare e9500 cleans the surface of my teeth better (slicker) than a tooth brush.</li>
            <li> :)  As I said before; it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> My dentist is pleased that I use it, too.</li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth very effectively, much better than Oral-B product.  </li>
            <li> Why they don&#x27;t offer the top of the line to replace what was there top of the line is beyond me.</li>
            <li> At first it took some getting used to as the feeling of the vibrating head accidentally touching the teeth wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Fresh from the dentist clean after EVERY brush and it feels GREAT on the gums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much better design, more powerful, effective motion, and better brushes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s got an awesome ultra sonic-like action that is super efficient.</li>
            <li> My teeth FEEL very clean after use.  </li>
            <li> 7/20/14 - this toothbrush is still going strong, and I still love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, travels well, lasts forever and cleans my teeth better than any powered or non-powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you would rather, you could also wait until it only shows one light, but waiting for it to stop is best.</li>
            <li> Plus,function wise, its much stronger than the latest series.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to be kept clean, I do this once a week.  </li>
            <li> You never knew your teeth could feel so clean!</li>
            <li> AND IN THIS CASE ,,, IT IS SO VERY TRUE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks and it is clearly a very superior product.  </li>
            <li> The sonicare is a great product and I was very pleasantly surprised at the service level of amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was just diagnosed with advanced periodontal disease which probably means I&#x27;m going to lose most of my teeth, but I plan on donating this to my husband...</li>
            <li> My husband has confirmed that most of the pain caused by te sensitivity has gone away.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I was especially impressed with the 2-week battery life which gave a constant output from full charge to the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> New one came with more directions for cleaning and taking apart  which is good.</li>
            <li> I am sure I would still be using that original model except that somebody knocked it over and it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Have fun! :-)</li>
            <li> It is easy to understand the directions for using it.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this product to better clean my teeth and to improve gum health.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s well designed, easy to use lasts for about 2 weeks without charging and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is quite easy to use and does the job well.</li>
            <li> and there are more advanced models of Sonicare available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy for someone with developmental disabilities to understand that they need to brush their teeth until the toothbrush shuts off after 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My toothbrush remains charged for more than 2 weeks at a time and this model has a great feature that beeps at you when the battery is low, so you can keep it off of the charger until then.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Since I switched to Sonicare, my gums have been perfectly healthy and my teeth are so clean that I am out of my semi-annual hygienist&#x27;s appointment in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s practically light versus Oral-B Triumph that a kid would be more comfortable in using the Sonicare handle than any other.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, my teeth stain easily to coffee, so</li>
            <li> I had used a cybersonic toothbrush for many years, convinced that it was the most powerful and efficient electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I love the timer because it gets my mouth fabulously clean in just 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> But Sonicare makes that easy.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and the design makes it easy to remove the brush head.</li>
            <li> The slimmer models are damaged easily after repeated removal of the head.</li>
            <li> Purchased this model from my dentist at his strong recommendation.</li>
            <li> The brush has improved the health of my gums enormously, I strongly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> and I will strongly advise people to buy that, if u are going to choose this.</li>
            <li> Strong brushing can lead to residing gums too.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush for my partner for his birthday in 2008 and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve generally been happy</li>
            <li> I would also like to say that I&#x27;m very pleased with your fast and reliable service.</li>
            <li> You can get two full weeks of use in between charging and this may help condition the battery better as well as save electricity by not having to leave the cord</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is comfortable, easy to use and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It works just fine</li>
            <li> I talked with the dental hygienist about it (she recommended the product) and she said her&#x27;s was fine.   </li>
            <li> The advanced design makes for easy access to all areas of your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> and my gums are doing fine</li>
            <li> Overall great brush, I am getting one for my girlfriend</li>
            <li> It does a great job overall</li>
            <li> what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your teeth!s.</li>
            <li> What a cheaply made device.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is set for 2 minutes and makes a sound at 30-second increments.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheaper than duty free shop.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so smooth now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny in my opinion, since teeth are one of our most valuable assets.</li>
            <li> Worth the price of the toothbrush for better dental health.  </li>
            <li> Great product, if looking to purchase through amazon wait for rebates as this will save you an extra 20-30 bucks over department stores.</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are available in drug stores, Wal Marts, Target, and some grocery stores.  </li>
            <li> You will enjoy this.</li>
            <li> and so was the free shipping.  </li>
            <li> So until then I will enjoy my Sonicare purchase at an price unimaginable a year ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So until then I will enjoy my Sonicare purchase at an price unimaginable a year ago.      </li>
            <li> Comparing this with Oral-B, Sonicare is more powerful, giving you versitility to move around the mouth.</li>
            <li> Regardless I&#x27;m happy just using a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> Seems cheap to me.</li>
            <li> Great features, such as interval timed brushing and the ability to change the speed.</li>
            <li> We got ours free from the dentist years ago and it&#x27;s lasted and lasted and still works fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with my Oral B for several years but this is a superior product.  </li>
            <li> If it lasts as long as my first Sonicare, I will be very happy.</li>
            <li> After 5 years our old Sonicare has given up, a good run in my book.</li>
            <li> but this Sonicare Elite is far superior.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with the new model.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new purchase.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You would think they would use a better method to turn product on and off if they really wanted an effective first class product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth feel smooth and glossy and CLEAN all the time now.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean and smooth, like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> This was my first power toothbrush and I am pleasantly surprised how great it is.</li>
            <li> a couple time for no other reason than it feels good.    </li>
            <li> The construction is sturdy and the toothbrush heads are super easy to change and to clean.</li>
            <li> teeth get super clean, and the sonicare is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Optiva Corp. (the original maker of Sonicare) in 2000.</li>
            <li> My Granddaughter (6 years old) was captivated by it and tried using the smaller brush that fit her mouth perfectly.  </li>
            <li> But when I turned it on that first time  (touching my teeth at the designated 45 degree angle)</li>
            <li> Holds the charge for a long time and is great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, each charge lasts a long time--about 1-2 weeks--still after owning for about a year.  </li>
            <li> Anyone out there who&#x27;s looking into an electric toothbrush, if you can afford this, it is so totally worth the investment!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time using an electric toothbrush and the way it cleans your teeth is much better then the manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> controls are simple and the light indicator couldn&#x27;t be more effective.  </li>
            <li> The clean sensation is something different: it really gives a wonderful fresh and clean feeling to your teeth.</li>
            <li> They are amazed at how clean their teeth feel even hours after brushing.</li>
            <li> Also, taking apart the head once a week to clean it as recommended by the manufacturer is a bit of a headache.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel extremely clean.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> What a difference a toothbrush makes, my teeth have never felt this clean.</li>
            <li> The effect is amazingly clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The charge last for many days, which is handy for taking it on vacations if you don&#x27;t want to take the charger along (although it is</li>
            <li> But teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and powerful, I would buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li> I also recommend using a Butler Proxabrush to clean between the teeth after every meal.</li>
            <li> - Insanitary brush heads, which you cannot clean (after three months use,    </li>
            <li> and he did commend how clean my teeth were.  </li>
            <li> good thing about this light is that it will come on only when it needs to thus helping lengthen in-between charges.  </li>
            <li> so you down&#x27;t have to take it apart to clean it all the time.  </li>
            <li> (the 7400 model about $70), and this one trumps it in terms of the clean feeling i get when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I used to brush a lot longer with a manual toothbrush and still didn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean.</li>
            <li> I use this toothbrush, my teeth feel extremely clean.  </li>
            <li> and I think it does clean well between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Plus, it gives you that &#x27;just from the dentist&#x27; clean feeling every time you brush.</li>
            <li> No bad breath even after coffee, and my teeth feel clean all day.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean...might be better to rinse with listerine also as the toothbrush holds lil&#x27; toothpaste and doesn&#x27;t give an entirely clean mouth feel like the manual ones.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product and would reccommend it if you are in the market for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Sonicare so far and it really does the job well.  </li>
            <li> I will know if it has done any good after my next trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> With the Sonicare, I&#x27;ve been able to reduce my brushing time to 2 minutes (using the built-in timing program of the Elite e9500), and yet have a much cleaner mouth than before.  </li>
            <li> Thereafter, it delivers full intensity.  </li>
            <li> THIS MAY BE TRUE FOR SOMEONE WHO BRUSHES ONCE A DAY.</li>
            <li> one gets used to the full power gradually.  </li>
            <li> This one is much stronger and more vigorous.  </li>
            <li> At full power it feels like it&#x27;s blasting away dirt particles that may have gotten stuck on the tooth.  </li>
            <li> However after the Sonicare started to gain full power, I understood why it was designed as such.&lt;br</li>
            <li> brush heads - 2 full size heads and 1 compact.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 3 brush heads - 2 full size heads and 1 compact.    </li>
            <li> It still seems a tad over energetic even on the gentle cycle, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any worsening of recession.  </li>
            <li> It no longer feels like you are putting the whole machine in your mouth which is better for cleaning as well.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s probably an effective brush assuming you don&#x27;t have any sensitive gums.    </li>
            <li> It came with two brushes which is good for 1 or 2 people but if buying for family use you need to get extra brushes.  </li>
            <li> I was therefore happy to purchase a new, though upgraded, version of my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;easy start\\&quot; feature, enabled out of the box, gradually increases power over the first fourteen brushings.      </li>
            <li> She then told me that the new Sonicare e9500 is a great brush and that Sonicare upgraded their features on the brush- better design, easier to reach to teeth that are lodged way in the back of your mouth, better bristle action.  </li>
            <li> This thing is capable of slinging a fine mist of toothpaste up to the light fixture.</li>
            <li> Gives teeth and mouth a fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I received my toothbrush yesterday and quickly got it onto the charger.</li>
            <li> Sure, the price for brush heads is steep - so the question is: How much is oral hygiene worth to you?</li>
            <li> Sure, the price for brush heads is steep - so the question is: How much is oral hygiene worth to you?</li>
            <li> One quick pass in the morning was it.</li>
            <li> Even my wife has commented on how quickly I&#x27;m finished with my night-time routine.  </li>
            <li> Although it does tickle my lips, it gets the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li> This model is much better than the older models.</li>
            <li> However, when I spend $119.99 for a product, it had better last more than five months.</li>
            <li> Has many more features that I haven&#x27;t tried such as reducing power, changing the cycle times, etc.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums fell vibrant and healthy.</li>
            <li> The only thing better would be to have a free teeth cleaning once a week!</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re loyal to the Braun line, please give the Sonicare a try.</li>
            <li> and right away my teeth felt so much cleaner, and my gums felt more massaged than with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this just a little more than a month ago and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> All in all a very worthy and wise purchase especially if you are able to grab one from warehouse clubs (or hopefully here if they decide to match or lower the price even further).</li>
            <li> This is the lazy person&#x27;s ideal mouthcare device.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for one of the very first versions...that lasted for years.    </li>
            <li> My last Sonicare electric toothbrush lasted over six years, and I was very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this model that I use every day now, not like my other original model that was not as comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> These have a good old fashioned nickel-cadmium battery and they only have so many charge cycles.  </li>
            <li> the more normal \\&quot;brush\\&quot; shape is more what one is accustomed to with normal toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise this would be a very good toothbrush but with this major flaw, I am only giving it two stars.</li>
            <li> The clean feeling you get after each use is amazing, and after about a month, I started to notice my teeth actually turning whiter.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean and smooth, and I really feel like I get the food of the day out of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Price is fine on Amazon and as usual shipping was great.</li>
            <li> Also since it comes with a large and small brush, I am alternating to see which one works best.</li>
            <li> Really easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.  </li>
            <li> We bought our first Sonicare Elite year before last and have been pleased with the effectiveness it has in keeping our teeth and gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> However, with it&#x27;s current price point I would rather not be the first to invest this time and just wait until even more kinks are sorted out and a better offer is brought to the market.  </li>
            <li> However, with it&#x27;s current price point I would rather not be the first to invest this time and just wait until even more kinks are sorted out and a better offer is brought to the market.  </li>
            <li> is the same that i read in other review, perfect, you fell your mouth clean after use it.</li>
            <li> becuase little bits fly out.</li>
            <li> Get that great &#x27;just from the hygienist&#x27; feeling everyday.</li>
            <li> &quot; I couldn&#x27;t stand it for more than 30 seconds,but I got used to it and now my gums aren&#x27;t as tickled, but I did notice that (and this may sound gross)</li>
            <li> I liked them enough, but after giving the Sonicare a try</li>
            <li> Elite e9500 includes a nice travel case, a regular and compact brush head, a timer, 2-speeds, and a battery charge status display.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a great toothbrush, it is worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure she would really like it as much as she does.  </li>
            <li> She thought I did my flossing more frequently.  </li>
            <li> This product is even better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> and I rarely let the head touch my teeth.  </li>
            <li> but this one is worth it.</li>
            <li> The 2min timer is really useful</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost, you&#x27;ll wonder why you didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.</li>
            <li> but well worth every penny now</li>
            <li> I took it on a 10 day trip, used it twice a day and the battery was still charged and the brush still powerful when I returned.      </li>
            <li> and they are worth ever penny.</li>
            <li> and I liked it until the charge only held for three days.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> We liked it so much we bought it for each of our 3 adult children</li>
            <li> This was a great upgrade able to use two different head types and different gentle settings for brushing.  </li>
            <li> Expect it will be worth the price ...</li>
            <li> While it certainly does clean under your gums some, and non-flossers will notice a difference, it will not prevent gum disease by itself.</li>
            <li> More important, how much is your general health and wellbeing worth to you?</li>
            <li> More important, how much is your general health and wellbeing worth to you?</li>
            <li> It actually makes me want to brush more often because you just get a really clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> Advanced research in comparison to Oral B was proven accurate and this is a great toothbrush, with powerful cleaning action, alternate brush heads and great features like gradually increasing brush action strength the first several uses to allow time for adjustment and the 30 second per quadrant timer.</li>
            <li> Decided to take the dentist&#x27;s advise and he was right.</li>
            <li> Combined with the right toothpaste you will notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush right after I got my teeth cleaned</li>
            <li> and he was right...</li>
            <li> While it seems to do an outstanding job of cleaning teeth, the vibration is strong and very disconcerting when the handle or back of the brush hits your teeth.</li>
            <li> power is more constant from full charge up to the time it needs charging.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, it needs to be cleaned very often in order for it to be clean.</li>
            <li> I actually brush for the full 2 minutes now, which I am sure makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Full power right at the start would be too much.</li>
            <li> However, if you simply unscrew the top and rinse it out with water then give it a quick bang against the sink that problem goes</li>
            <li> He experienced a tingling feeling at first, but that went away after the first few uses.    </li>
            <li> I have had 2 others over the past 6 years and Sonicare continues to improve on a great product.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge fairly well-I charge it once weekly on average.</li>
            <li> Oral-B was smart enough to supply me with this kind of case for my Triumph purchase.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B was smart enough to supply me with this kind of case for my Triumph purchase.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and after brushing, my teeth feel very clean similar to the way they feel after the Dental Hygienist finishes the polishing.    </li>
            <li> Even so these very popular electric toothbrushes don&#x27;t last more than two-years in my experience, and I have purchased quite a few.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the transition pauses that tell me when to move on to another part of my mouth, and the brush head changes color when it&#x27;s time for a new head.</li>
            <li> I only had about 10 days to use it before my next cleaning, and she said my teeth were great-</li>
            <li> The brush heads are smaller; more maneuverable and much, much easier to clean after use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few surprise cavities after years of regular brushing and flossing, I bought two of these brushes (one for spouse) and hoped for the best.</li>
            <li> The brush vibrates very fast and brushes your teeth in a way that you cannot emulate by hand.  </li>
            <li> When I explained the problem and that the initial order was made in plenty of time for 5-9 day delivery, Amazon was very kind and sent another Sonicare Next Day Delivery.</li>
            <li> We had the original Sonicare for years and it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> I was an old school gal, using my manual toothbrush, and thought I was doing a decent job of keeping my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my gums were \\&quot;tickled.\\</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works pretty well.    </li>
            <li> However, I went to Costco to purchase this instead for 124.99, which came with TWO handles, 2 Regular brush heads, and 1 compact brush head. :)</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare, and I truly can tell a difference in the way my teeth look.    </li>
            <li> Both of these are actually minor complaints considering what a great job the toothbrush actually does cleaning one&#x27;s teeth.      </li>
            <li> The brush itself I recommend without reservation, just be aware that it does NOT replace flossing.</li>
            <li> When Optiva first introduced the Philips Sonicare Advance circa 1992, it was unlike any electric toothbrushes on the market.</li>
            <li> The first time it fell out</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really gentle and powerful.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It sprayed toothpaste all over the place the first time I tried using it</li>
            <li> it is very noise first time when I use it, it is powerful, it&#x27;s like you have a massage device in your hand when you are brushing, it takes times to get used to it.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrush for more than 2 years with total satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> Philips is always first choice and Amazon first source.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these products to everyone!!  </li>
            <li> This is the first power toothbrush I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Once I turned off the toothbrush and subsequently cleaned splattered toothpaste from my face, clothes, mirror, and counter top</li>
            <li> I am not sure how good the lower versions (also cheaper) of sonicare are but this product has been totally worth it.</li>
            <li> have been able to see improvement in the last 4 months i have been using this model.</li>
            <li> First, I had an Interplac.</li>
            <li> just used for the first time..  </li>
            <li> The 30 seconds per tooth area, i.e., top outside, lower inside helps me brush longer like dentists recommend.  </li>
            <li> This product has been discontinued most likely because the on/off button keeps falling off.</li>
            <li> so I can consistently brush each surface of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money for how much use I got out of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money for how much use</li>
            <li> I bought my first Sonicare years ago under advice from my dental surgeon.  </li>
            <li> I had a dental cleaning this morning, and the individual tooth pockets I&#x27;ve been battling all my life were dramatically better.  </li>
            <li> The warrantees are also longer which indicating the product is of higher quality.</li>
            <li> After useing this toothbrush for about a week I went to a dentist apointment and for the first time ever he told me there was not any plack buildup in my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty effortless to reach everywhere in your mouth and my teeth look whiter from using it for a while now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been an Oral-B Braun power toothbrush user for years constantly upgrading every two years for their latest toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The feeling left me wanting more power.  </li>
            <li> Then I remembered that toothbrush is meant to increase in power gradually within the first 14 uses in order to sit in and get used to the sonic brushing experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No need for a constant battery drain which could be used more toward powering the toothbrush head than the display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> appreciate how gentle yet powerful it can act.  </li>
            <li> This way me and my wife are able to bring only one travel case.  </li>

            <li> This way me and my wife are able to bring only one travel case.  </li>
            <li> So yea, pls check out the Flexcare series first.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> and I told her the first version of the Sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li> Well, I went home charged it for 24 hours and then tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> It is very portable too!  </li>
            <li> This Sonicare is much better than the last model.  </li>
            <li> The beeps at 30 second intervals is a help to make sure you are brushing all teeth evenly.  </li>
            <li> The quick vibration and the small brush head make for a real clean teeth brushing - gets the gums clean, too.  </li>
            <li> I like the timer, the brush is easy to grip and use, and the battery really does last a full 2 weeks between charges.</li>
            <li> It is much improved over the older versions and is easer to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> The spray is fine but profuse, so you really need to close your mouth almost completely to prevent the spray from covering everything within a foot or two.</li>
            <li> I was impressed they could design one to last twice as long as regular competitor heads.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed they could design one to last twice as long as regular competitor heads.  </li>
            <li> the inaccessible cavity of the large brush was full of fungal dirt,     despite my cleaning and drying of the brush after every use)  - Therefore, you need to buy a new brush after every some weeks.     </li>
            <li> Seems simple, but the turning it off thing took almost more vigilence than I&#x27;m capable of in the morning.</li>
            <li> My old toothbrush wasn&#x27;t effective enough to worry about over use.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that it brushes significantly harder/more powerfully the first brush after a charge than subsequent brushes.  </li>
            <li> The reviews I had seen about this suggested it was worth the slightly high price tag.</li>
            <li> especially like the \\&quot;easy start\\&quot; feature, which for the first 14 times the brush is used,</li>
            <li> At first use I didnt like it, but it took sometime to get used to the speed and sensation of the toothbrush and now I really like how well it cleans my teeth.</li>
            <li> I also love the feature where it times how long you brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I actually upgraded from the original Sonicare when they first came out to the most recent Sonicare-</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a big deal because it&#x27;s easy to recharge.  </li>
            <li> was the only thing that works for me, because it is easy and convenient.    </li>
            <li> It easily reaches all the way to the back teeth and on the underside.  </li>
            <li> (My husband was able to get one to last that long through the use of plastic and super glues, but the result was something only an engineer could love.)</li>
            <li> This brushing action is fantastic, just like the new one, but this design stinks...literally.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier version of this toothbrush, which was satisfactory, but this new one is better.</li>
            <li> in all a very worthy and wise purchase especially if you are able to grab one from warehouse clubs (or hopefully here if they decide to match or lower the price even further).form versus a simple bright green led light which comes on to alert you for a few seconds only after every use.  Simple and ingenius.  </li>
            <li> This is great news actually since less maintenance is required.  </li>
            <li> This is great news actually since less maintenance is required.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare is great - used a &#x27;spin brush&#x27; previously but Sonicare is head &amp; shoulders (or maybe teeth &amp; gums) above.</li>
            <li> It uses an internal magnet so the motor is perfectly sealed (As opposed to the Oral B)and impervious to the water and paste which regularly slides down a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The NEW brush that I bought is even better than the old one, which was about 7-8 years old.</li>
            <li> Both will clean your teeth very well and for general oral hygiene I would recommend ANY Sonicare model without hesitation.  </li>
            <li> problem with Oral-B Triumph and their older line of power toothbrush is that at full charge the brush action is at</li>
            <li> Furthermore, this same led light will tell you the charge indicator status as well as how much power is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have ever heard of is that it is so powerful it irritates the gums, but this has a gentle setting, so this thing is great.</li>
            <li> The battery is very efficient, too.</li>
            <li> : &lt;br /&gt;Powerful but gentle &lt;</li>
            <li> I tried tons of stuff to keep this from happening, but nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> My last dentist visit confirmed my fervent hope, this toothbrush may well keep me out of the periodontist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really have to try the Sonicare Elite Power Toothbrush to see for yourself</li>
            <li> You really have to try the Sonicare Elite Power Toothbrush to see for yourself</li>
            <li> Another feature, after the intial charging, it is always ready to be used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product helps you to improve behaviour and works really well.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t so much of a chore brushing anymore, and I find myself grabbing the brush while just sitting in my chair and running over my teeth</li>
            <li> The last visit to the dentist has confirmed that she saw a differance.     </li>
            <li> I really do encourage others to buy this product.</li>
            <li> (Do you think China would really do that?)    </li>
            <li> Highly recommended...five star product!</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter than before because it removes the yellowing stain and the difference is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> What can I say it works very well.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got it and charged it up it starts on the gentle cycle (works</li>
            <li> very small).&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing really Elite about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The two minute timer is very helpful.  </li>
            <li> It cleans the teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The whole family uses them.</li>
            <li> Eventually, the whole thing gives way leaving a gapping hole.</li>
            <li> This brush really gets in between your teeth, and moves the toothpaste in the crevices.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Sonicare products!</li>
            <li> The two different heads are great, especially the smaller one.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using the Sonicare system and really believe in their effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> After I finish brushing my teeth, I always give my gum a gentle massage with Sonicare.</li>
            <li> If you want to program the toothbrush, you simply use those two buttons and watch the led indicator light to tell you what mode you are at based on it&#x27;s position.  </li>
            <li> This product really helps to satisfy it.  </li>
            <li> Teeth are extremely important to overall health, and I never want to have to get dentures.  </li>
            <li> He really is amazed on how well it really cleans his teeth.</li>
            <li> Thanks Sonicare...   </li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied with this item as I feel that I should not be cleaning the inside of the holder.</li>
            <li> Very soon after purchasing it, we went out of town for a week, and even with two people using it, the battery lasted just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Another feature which I really like is a built-in timer, which \\&quot;beeps\\&quot; every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> and she said the problem might have been because I used too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> Its works very well</li>
            <li> Way more energy in that toothbrush than I had ever expected.  </li>
            <li> The e9500 has a replacable battery so when this one wears out, I can replace just the battery (provided the cost is reasonable).</li>
            <li> 31,000 BSPM is, patently, many many more brush strokes per minute than what any mere human is capable of producing with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I brushed my teeth twice a day but to be honest perhaps 1 minute in total.</li>
            <li> nice standard brand name solid toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> woozing and buzzing sound gave me a headache during my first few times, but I adapted to it quickly</li>
            <li> Arrived in new packaging, exactly as I ordered it and much sooner than anticipated.  </li>
            <li> I know that sounds strange but it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> like the timer and the &#x27;break-in&#x27; feature which keeps those new to this type brush from overdoing it at first.  </li>
            <li> Additionally it increases the brushing for the first 20 uses and this helps you get accustomed to the new sensations.</li>
            <li> I was re-introduced to the Soincare when I went to my new dentist for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> One power the toothbrush and the other to switch between a more gentle cycle.  </li>
            <li> I cannot compare it with other brands on the market, but honestly, I do not care, this one is excellent.</li>
            <li> After 24 hours of initial charge and first month of use, I must say it&#x27;s a different cleaning experience that feels more gentle to my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very silent and gentle with your gums, it will clean your mouth thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This is the second power toothbrush that I have used, and it is so much more effective than the previous one (a different brand) for what it does.  </li>
            <li> need to clean the connection between the head and the handle regularly as water gets in</li>
            <li> dentist recommended a Sonicare toothbrush to me as a way to keep my teeth as clean as possible between 6 month checkups.  </li>
            <li> The only thing i would improve is the ability to clean inside the unit.</li>
            <li> Length of time required to brush (and actually get your teeth clean)  </li>
            <li> Easy to use straight out of the box- two settings for vigorous and gentle brushing, 30 sec beeps after each quadrant-</li>
            <li> Consequently, my teeth didn&#x27;t really feel clean until it finally got to the final full power stage - just a warning for</li>
            <li> Considering the very high price of new brushes (20+ USD, which of course    is much too high), this system gets very costly.</li>
            <li> Good clean design, so far not a single complaint.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this unit as I think it can really help you maintain the health of you teeth to the highest level.</li>
            <li> - the performance of Sonicare starts to degrade and the cleaning action of the Sonicare becomes noticeably less effective.</li>
            <li> Never thought much about my gums, but they are nice &amp; pink &amp; clean &amp; tight, like in the ad photos.  </li>
            <li> For me, that is amazing because every time I&#x27;ve gone in the past I&#x27;d had to have SOMETHING drilled and filled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After having read others complain about battery life and keeping the Sonicare clean, I&#x27;ve made sure to only put the unit in the charger when needed (about every 2-3 weeks or so), and I keep it angled up slightly</li>
            <li> If you brush carefully and gently, they will longer and clear better.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase for an adult electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I initially tried to use the Sonicare in a similar fashion to a regular brush, but ended up with some abrasions on my gum - yes, you CAN get too much of a good thing.</li>
            <li> THE MANUAL SAYS A FULL CHARGE CAN LAST FOR UP TO 2 WEEKS.</li>
            <li> The first 2 weeks my gums were a bit sensitive to the motion of the brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true once you use this product you will never go back.</li>
            <li> Also even at home you would want to make full use of the fact that it&#x27;s a rechargeable toothbrush that will help you charge once and save on electricity by constantly charging it after every use.  </li>
            <li> However after the Sonicare started to gain full power, I understood why it was designed as such.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a lil&#x27; getting used to and some spraying is surely bound to happen the first few times if you are new to electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using an Oral B and really didn&#x27;t see the need for a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the realization that they need to make more money in half the time, or that people were complaining of bacteria build-up and foul odor from collecting water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the realization that they need to make more money in half the time, or that people were complaining of bacteria build-up and foul odor from collecting water.      </li>
            <li> Although this is pretty expensive for a toothbrush, it works exactly as described, is easy to use and does a fantastic job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> Fast vibrating action that gets in between teeth and gums very well.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from an older one that after 7 years would not work anymore.</li>
            <li> use the 2-minute Smartimer (actually, I use the 2 minute 30 second timer option so that I can brush the top of my molars) and the 30-second Quadpacer interval timer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dental exams have been steadily improving since I started using this.</li>
            <li> We have owned an older Sonicare for years--replaced it with the newer model on our Dentist&#x27;s advice.  </li>
            <li> I had an older model Sonicare that lasted years.</li>
            <li> This replace an older Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I had an older model (which lasted about 8 years).  </li>
            <li> I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING THIS PARTICULAR POWER BRUSH, AND DECIDED ON THIS ONE,</li>
            <li> compact travel case which is okay for only 1 person since it holds 1 handle and only 1 brush head.  </li>
            <li> 1 compact travel case which is okay for only 1 person since it holds 1 handle and only 1 brush head.  </li>
            <li> -Same problem with Sonicare products, most toothpastes will cause the white residue on the brush heads and the metal piece where u slot the brushhead into the handle.</li>
            <li> Hygienist is now double checking to make sure my current appointment was not made prematurely.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and was very prone to cavities</li>
            <li> (I brush for the whole two minutes and he recommendsnot doing that more than once per day and with a gentle, ordinary toothpaste as opposed to a whitener.)  </li>
            <li> or so it will take firmer tightening to put it on the holder without having it make a vibrating loose sound.</li>
            <li> It came highly recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I only use it once a day (using my regular brush in the morning), and find that&#x27;s more than enough to keep that &#x27;fresh from the dentist&#x27; feeling.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I always get high praise for my teeth and gum care, but seldom floss--</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> No complaints and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare was highly recommended by my dentist</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend the sonicare elite 9000...</li>
            <li> You expect high performance from the newest generation Sonicare</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> More importantly, that&#x27;s where I place the brush head everyday to keep them separate from the handle while I air dry both after every brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More importantly, that&#x27;s where I place the brush head everyday to keep them separate from the handle while I air dry both after every brushing.    </li>
            <li> It works like a dream - sure, more expensive than a regular toothbrush, but you&#x27;ll save much more in the long run.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating bristles provide an itchy sensation the first few brushings, but it&#x27;s fine after you get accustomed to the feeling.  </li>
            <li> Having had full periodontal surgery in the past, I needed something to keep the roots clean and this does the job.  </li>
            <li> I only hope I will get my money&#x27;s worth and will be able to keep this brush well maintained for a few years.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if this is normal for an electronic toothbrush</li>
            <li> Normally I can hold it all in using a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am normally a bit of a purist, but by the recommendation of my dental hygienist I purchased this product about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> I still doubt the effectiveness of the FlossAction now and the ability to actually get in between the teeth in a powerful manner versus just grabbing a floss.  </li>
            <li> It was a b-day gift and a normal reorder wouldn&#x27;t have gotten to me on time.</li>
            <li> The buttons on these things disintegrate in about 7 months of normal use.</li>
            <li> The two different size brush heads is very nice as I have a small mouth and the smaller brush works very well.  </li>
            <li> One nice thing about these new-generation Sonicares:  smaller brushes and dramatically less splatter.  </li>
            <li> I also decided on my own that the FlossAction brush head of Oral-B helped me actually floss less than twice every day.  </li>
            <li> I mean 5 years ago it was amazing</li>
            <li> And the dental hygienist who urged me to switch to an electric toothbrush noticed right away on my next visit.    </li>
            <li> While my first use felt a little strange (ticklish), my teeth came out super clean.  </li>
            <li> recently discovered my Mom has been using this exact same toothbrush for a few years too &amp; has been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get toothpaste down the handle (easily prevented).  </li>
            <li> I used it last night for the first time, it does feel very strange but my teeth feel and look really clean when done.</li>
            <li> Also, it is pretty cool how it eases you in to using it by keeping the spped slow for your first 10 uses or so and adjusts by itself.  </li>
            <li> and that was before she even knew I had the new brush.  </li>
            <li> The new heads do not address the problem of water and tooth paste running inside the head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe this was done on purpose so you would have to buy a new one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new design eliminates all that slew of slime.</li>
            <li> oh well live and learn.</li>
            <li> I can live with both of these items, but it would be nicer.</li>
            <li> and I got a new one.  </li>
            <li> All it needs is a new toothbrush head every 3 months</li>
            <li> No seriously this was a problem with my old sonic care.  </li>
            <li> I find that the brush head starts to show signs of wear after only 3 months - the performance of Sonicare starts to degrade and the cleaning action of the Sonicare becomes noticeably less effective.</li>
            <li> It may be expensive, but keeping your teeth healthy is important.</li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t complain much as any electric toothbrush is definitely a step up from manual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a lazy person it is great because I don&#x27;t have to move my hand up and down.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive teeth, so the dentist recommended the Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The batteries on our two brushes are still going strong and last a surprisingly long time between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to push this particular part down and then clean the &#x27;inside&#x27; of the area thats attached to the brush head.</li>
            <li> I actually use my fabric case pretty often</li>
            <li> My original SonicCare lasted for several years and I am on my 2nd one.</li>
            <li> The diameter of the brush handle of the Sonicare FlexCare is smaller and provides a more confortable grip, especially if you have smaller hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The diameter of the brush handle of the Sonicare FlexCare is smaller and provides a more confortable grip, especially if you have smaller hands.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems at my regular 6 month dental cleanings for exactly 5 years now.  </li>
            <li> This is our second Sonicare, as the battery died after 3 years in the first one.  </li>
            <li> And the feeling on my teeth WOW!</li>
            <li> After using it, I agree with the rave reviews it had gotten so far!   </li>
            <li> With its initial ramp up (over the first 14 brush cycles I believe)</li>
            <li> My significant other recommended this to me (she&#x27;d been using it for years).  </li>
            <li> 1 small plastic container to hold two brush heads in case you have more than two people sharing the handles.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel squeaky clean that I&#x27;m only hoping this is what the dentist will also see on my next visit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth feel squeaky clean that I&#x27;m only hoping this is what the dentist will also see on my next visit.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to take care of not only their teeth, but also their gum.</li>
            <li> Oral bacteria and gum disease has been conclusively linked with a whole host of health problems including heart disease, pancreatic cancer and other bodily ills - Sound far-fetched?</li>
            <li> Oral bacteria and gum disease has been conclusively linked with a whole host of health problems including heart disease, pancreatic cancer and other bodily ills - Sound far-fetched?</li>
            <li> A FULL CHARGE WOULD ONLY LAST ABOUT 4 DAYS.</li>
            <li> The only issue I&#x27;ve had with the unit is the charge lights have slowly failed, so that the only lights that light up now are the fully charged top light and the next lower one.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I just had a professional cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office all the time and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pain to have to bring the charger along, but then I am away for over a week at a time, even though my battery lasts for nearly a week.      </li>
            <li> Sonicare Advance used a piezoelectric multimorph transducer, which was a patented technology developed by</li>
            <li> I had one and the soft plastic</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums</li>
            <li> This was an unexpected result but clearly a benefit.</li>
            <li> She really feels like she has had a deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li> After about 5 uses though brushing with it becomes natural</li>
            <li> My old unit did not have this.    </li>
            <li> the noise and violence of the toothbrush surprised me to the extent that I removed it from my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Having used the Oral B Professional toothbrush, I find the Sonicare e9500 to be quieter, a lttle measier to manipulate, and equivalent in cleaning efficiency.</li>
            <li> its everything it says it is  makes it seem like i just went for a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> I had the old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Puts my old Oral-B to shame.  </li>
            <li> THE OLD SAYING IS</li>
            <li> My dentist is always amazed with how young my gum stays.</li>
            <li> I became more daring and started to eat sticky sweets and neglected brushing until late in the day.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s really that gross.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s really that gross.  </li>
            <li> This product far exceeds expectations.  </li>
            <li> After about a month they go too soft.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Elite was a bit strange at first.  </li>
            <li> I really like the 30 second intervals when the brush would beep so that you can move to another quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Sonicare Elite for my son whom is 19 yrs old and hates the dentist.</li>
            <li> I even bought 2nd one for a friend&#x27;s birthday and he also really like it too.  </li>
            <li> To solve this problem I cut off the old brush,&lt;br</li>
            <li> few more dentist visits later</li>
            <li> the Triumph handle will display the battery status in monocrhome-hard-to-see graphic form versus a simple bright green led light which comes on to alert you for a few seconds only after every use.  </li>
            <li> admit, I&#x27;m late in the game in switching to this particular model as there is now the more expensive FlexCare line with a more compact brush head and supposedly more powerful sonic brushing action.  </li>
            <li> I am using my Sonicare toothbrush at least once a day and certainly like the clean feeling it leaves in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I never thought that an electric toothbrush would clean my teeth any better than I could with a regular toothbrush, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t caused me a problem but makes me a little worried when I periodically go to clean the gunk out in holder under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new head design enables me to get to the back teeth so much easier than the last model.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t sure that I was going to like this rather expensive toothbrush.      </li>
            <li> The only down side was that I was promised free gift wrapping</li>
            <li> This brush is highly recommended by my dentist and especially by my peridontist.</li>
            <li> With a little practice, you can pucker your mouth just enough that the mirror and sink don&#x27;t receive a fine spray of toothpaste twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Dentists usually give them out free after your teethcleaning.</li>
            <li> Grab  the same model from your local warehouse shopping club for the deluxe package and you will have an extra handle, an extra brush head and a compact plastic travel case at less than the price</li>
            <li> Having bought a slew of other electric toothbrushes and being disgusted by the slime that easily accumulates, looking for an easy to hold and effective product that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of crevaces to hold onto bacteria.  </li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the battery can not be replaced so that when it goes, you have to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li> The new, Elite models, are a big improvement.</li>
            <li> My point is we need to floss anyway as part of the brushing habit, so why will I need to spend extra on the ubber expensive FlossAction brush head, when I need to spend on purchasing a good floss</li>
            <li> After about 7 days, several of my teeth/gums became very sensitive and I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> My first Sonicare toothbrush lasted 5-6 years before the battery needed a charge every other day.</li>
            <li> Since I have never used a decent power toothbrush before, it is taking quite a long time to adjust.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I feel my teeth are cleaner, they are slightly whiter (I have only been using it for 2 months), and my gums get adequately massaged as well.  </li>
            <li> I doubt very much that a German, Japanese or Korean electronics producer would be selling a major product for personal use which is unsuitable for use outside its country of purchase.</li>
            <li> The brushes have a LITTLE colored band on them that is good for identifying your brush but the colors are close, so in dim light or poor eyesight its hard to see which is which.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product, you will never go back to the regular toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li> Other dental cleaning systems work well but not nearly as efficiently and quickly as this one.</li>
            <li> The battering in the brush will last longer if it is allowed to rundown completely before it is recharged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes so far have lasted only about 3 months each</li>
            <li> The fact that the brushes needed to be replaced as frequently as they do is the only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The 30 second intervals help me brush each quadrant completely.</li>
            <li> The timed beeps result in complete brushing coverage, something I was lax with using a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> (Versus Oral-B&#x27;s simple design of having a metal rod stick out from the body and have the brush head insert into that rotating rod to create the brushing action.)    </li>
            <li> I have used it for years - my old one finally wore out</li>
            <li> Wow... I thought I knew how to brush my teeth, but I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ve been doing my entire life, for that was not brushing my teeth as Sonicare does...</li>
            <li> first few uses made me and my wife wonder if there was any effectiveness to the brushing action.  </li>
            <li> A slow start to allow acceptance of the sound and vibration lasts two weeks.  </li>
            <li> O&#x27;yea the first one broke down (Sonicare not</li>
            <li> The first two times, they were accusatory and said their research showed toothpaste was breaking down the rubber.</li>
            <li> The shape of the brush also makes it easy to get to the back of back teeth, barely possible with round brush heads.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the previous Sonicare elite for a few years now and it wasn&#x27;t as powerful as when i first got it, so i decided to upgrade to this newest model.  </li>
            <li> The only difference I can see between my new 9500 and the 7500/7300 models (about $20 cheaper if you can still find one) is that it comes with two different brush sizes.  </li>
            <li> The brush is great at getting to the spots in the back of your mouth that can be difficult to reach with a conventional brush.</li>
            <li> i have seen a big inprovement in my gums and teeth in general, way better than any other toothbrush i have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> After a few days, you can tell how much the battery is getting drained and how weak the spinning action is becoming.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that it only took 2 minutes to brush and how short two minutes goes by.  </li>
            <li> My second unit which was replaced by Philips just developed the same problem as the unit it replaced.</li>
            <li> that of 7500 series is far more difficult to be maintained.</li>
            <li> must admit it was a little turn off at first to feel it so flimsy on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I must admit it was a little turn off at first to feel it so flimsy on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> As a man and as a regular guy who has been using the regular tooth bush since childhood, I couln&#x27;t help moving any electronic tools up and down and left and right in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Works well and really makes my teeth feel cleaner than regular or even other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> By the way Philips sets the toothbrush at a lower setting for the first few brushings to make it easier on you.    </li>
            <li> It will slowly increase the speed of the vibration over the first few days until it reaches full vibration power.</li>
            <li> after few mths of usage, it tend to turn black or mouldy and its tough to clean those off even with magic sponge.</li>
            <li> No other brand of electric toothbrush has been able to rival its performance before or since (sorry, [[ASIN:B000U08ZN4 Oral B Triumph]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The brushes work well, although I wish they would last a little longer but first pair lasted almost 3 months.</li>
            <li> I can reach behind my back molars so easily.</li>
            <li> Quick disconnect for the brush if more than one person would like to use the base</li>
            <li> On the other hand if you can avoid another visit to the dentist to get a new crown or filling it saves you some cost.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a curious omission for a Dutch-owned company but is consistent with previous Sonicare products.</li>
            <li> I was told in the past to use only soft brushes, which is why my manual toothbrushes wouldn&#x27;t last very long - at least they were cheap to replace.</li>
            <li> You have not experienced the feeling of clean teeth until you use a sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The first button (the one you use to turn it on and off) partially caved in after a few months, as another reviewer noted.</li>
            <li> It helps a little bit but not that much and obvious as we expected.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s terrific and my teeth and mouth feel cleaner in general.</li>
            <li> I usually lied to my dentist about how much I really was brushing, but, somehow I think he knew.    </li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare in the past, and it really helped improve the state of my gums.  </li>
            <li> Also the brushheads dont last long either.</li>
            <li> I had another \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush back in the 90s, which long ago found its way to Goodwill.  </li>
            <li> I used to spend at least 10 minutes meticulously brushing my teeth with a regular toothbrush, but still had plaque build-up in certain areas.</li>
            <li> As someone whose gums are prone to recession, the oralb power toothbrush was always too rough and the round heads too large to avoid my gums.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m absolutely comfortable with the size of the regular head.</li>
            <li> I only found one other that was the same price</li>
            <li> I have read the other reviews and was concerned about several issues, such as the fungal growth or battery life.</li>
            <li> However, after only a year&#x27;s use every other day the plastic threads of the brush have turned a disgustingly yellow color, like they have been  smoking, despite the fact that the product was thorougly cleaned after every use.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I run my tongue across the surfaces of my teeth after every brushing, it feels like I&#x27;ve just had my teeth professionally cleaned by a dentist - no more gritty tooth surfaces resulting from the buildup of plaque</li>
            <li> to let you know where &amp; how long to brush, which is a help in the morning when I am not awake yet.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, thirteen months after purchase it won&#x27;t work properly because the brush gets jammed after it is tightened on the handle.</li>
            <li> I had my old one for a few years before the button wore out.</li>
            <li> ; I think that&#x27;s why it lasted so long.  </li>
            <li> I suspect the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t want that getting around because their revenue stream would atrophy if everyone went this long before buying a replacement.    </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my 36 year old son who was having trouble with his gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by my hygenist, to cut down on the amount of cleaning she needs to do on me, and just to keep the plaque down between visits.  </li>
            <li> (Note that ACT Restoring x2 is actually diluted down from regular ACT restoring if you are thinking of adding it to your dental routine)&lt;br</li>
            <li> the shaft with a file, got a new regular toothbrush with a thick handle, cut it in the thickest part,&lt;br /&gt;drilled</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used the Braun line of electric brushes, my most expensive one being about $30.</li>
            <li> I have been getting better reviews from my dentist, although he does point out that nothing takes the place of flossing (which is a lot less expensive).   </li>
            <li> (August, 2006:  Note that there is now a 9800 model with the same features as this one currently selling on Amazon for LESS.  </li>
            <li> However, less than a year later, our replacement unit did the same thing.  </li>
            <li> Being lazy and a congenital procrastinator, I blew off buying a new one and returned to the manual method of dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> This may only be a problem for me because I use the standard head for the main brushing, and then switch to the compact head to brush behind my rear molars.</li>
            <li> may only be a problem for me because I use the standard head for the main brushing, and then switch to the compact head to brush behind my rear molars.</li>
            <li> The other is that the buyer should note that it comes with two different kinds of heads -- not heads for two people.    </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see what justifies the price other than lack of competition - need to get some Chinese manufacturers into this space.</li>
            <li> My previous 7000 series toothbrush died (battery) after three years which was a little disappointing, but the new model is much better.</li>
            <li> I suggest you immediately wipe the toothbrush with a dry cloth after rinsing it.</li>
            <li> The newer e9500 seems to last only a few months before the power button seal breaks.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the same base, but with his own brush head</li>
            <li> Only bad thing I noticed is that I have more loose plaque in between my teeth now</li>
            <li> off right next to change speed button and sometimes press the wrong one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found I use much less toothpaste due to the smaller &#x27;regular&#x27; head.  </li>
            <li> And as usual, Amazon came through with timely direct shipping to them.  </li>
            <li> and I usually like to give gifts that can be used frequently.  </li>
            <li> I just move the brush over my teeth and the internal motor pushes the brush up and down.</li>
            <li> I have been following the advice of a previous reviewer to not return the unit to the charger after each use because my husband, an electronic engineer, says that reviewer is correct.</li>
            <li> I learned quickly to never have the toothbrush running outside of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> She said that it was a technical improvement over previous models and not just a cosmetic makeover.</li>
            <li> My biggest concern when looking at this brand previously was the seemingly enormous size of the brush head.</li>
            <li> We have been using the sonicare electric brush for several years, and have much less plaque, etc.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve previously owned an electric toothbrush and been disappointed, I heartily recommend this system and promise you will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> The same is true with the heads which are incredibly expensive!</li>
            <li> Hardly any effort on your part is required other than moving the brush head around from time to time to new areas.  </li>
            <li> only disadvantage I see is the cost of the head replacements, which is a little steep.</li>
            <li> The first mouth sensation is a bit weird (the brush vibrates in a quite different way than other electrical brushes), but after two or three times you&#x27;re used to it.</li>
            <li> Our old Advance died after 5 years of working hard.  </li>
            <li> It pauses for 1/2 sec.</li>
            <li> every 30 sec.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money for this toothbrush (HX9500).  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I spent the money on it</li>
            <li> This one is operating as expected:  </li>
            <li> In fact, I stopped using one a few years back</li>
            <li> I have only had my toothbrush for a few weeks, and let me say...</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve only had the toothbrush for a few weeks, I can&#x27;t speak to that.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive but worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job the way I expected it.</li>
            <li> Money well spent --I</li>
            <li> But this is not always possible because I bring it with me when I travel for a few days and it would be cumbersome to bring even the charger when I want to save on space.  </li>
            <li> sonic brushing did get stronger and stronger as expected.  </li>
            <li> There has been no drop in function in that time, though the rubber power button has disintegrated partially.</li>
            <li> Of course I&#x27;ll update this review with any negative/positive i find after a few weeks regular use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a while back for myself and used it a few times</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to brush my front outside teeth without coating the sink and mirror with toothpaste, hopefully practice will help here.</li>
            <li> some other reviewers have pointed out, the ridge between the head and the power unit tend to collect junk which needs to be cleaned periodically (I soak in hydrogen peroxide).  </li>
            <li> (I usually have to pause it after the second section to spit and reapply toothpaste, otherwise I look like a horror flick with foam coming out of my mouth!!).  </li>
            <li> and maybe there should be instructions on how to disinfect, other than investing in an additional accessory.</li>
            <li> I have not used any other electric tooth brush to compare</li>
            <li> The small head gets those back teeth.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush comes with 2 size heads-1 small and 1 regular sized.</li>
            <li> and it is probably one of the reasons I am lured into brushing my teeth at night regularly (i used be lazy with the manual ones).</li>
            <li> Not pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only thing I am not pleased with is the Battery.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, you could go to Costco and purchase a set with two handles, one charger and other accessory for $99 after coupon rebate.</li>
            <li> I gave the other one to my grandchildren.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was my 2nd Sonicare toothbrush in 3 years that failed, and I didn&#x27;t feel like wasting more money on Philips.</li>
            <li> I had changed from my messy, clumsy, old Sonicare to an Oral-B Triumph.</li>
            <li> I spent $150 on this unit and then they replace it with one that costs $40 less.</li>
            <li> The second time I succeeded but experience was not very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> With Oral-B, you can&#x27;t do that, you feel it&#x27;s not right doing it.</li>
            <li> The product can be a bit rough on your gums (per dentist, my gums receded a little)</li>
            <li> Thats what happened when I brush too hard last time.</li>
            <li> I suspect the battery went bad but since it is sealed into the unit I couldn&#x27;t get at it to replace it (assuming a replacement battery is available).</li>

            <li> The only thing this Sonicare has in common with an Oral B is purpose.</li>
            <li> only negative for this model</li>
            <li> downside is the cost of the replacement heads (average $23.00), but you get a package of 2</li>
            <li> This is my third model and I will never own another toothbrush again.  </li>

            <li> I must have tried at least six or seven different brands of electric brushers of teeth and this one beats the others hands down.  </li>
            <li> This model has a hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the hand piece and pool up in a really disgusting way and requires you to take it apart and clean off inner crevices made up of metal and plastic parts.</li>
            <li> As I continued to use the toothbrush I acclimated to the device&#x27;s ways and even got my timing down with the use of their beep.  </li>
            <li> Cons:  Charge time (24 hours if the battery is run down)  </li>
            <li> The instructions (then and now) say to leave it in the charger when not in use, but I always unplugged it to run the battery all the way down before re-charging</li>
            <li> Despite using the Oral-B, it seemed like I was needing fillings for little cavities, having a lot of plaque, or needing crowns (from decades&#x27; old broken fillings)</li>
            <li> I had this less than a year when the rubber that covers the on/off button ripped and exposed the interior to water.  </li>
            <li> less because of the price.</li>
            <li> but since owning this, I have had less cavities, whiter teeth</li>
            <li> I previously owned a Sonicare toothbrush.</li>

            <li> Replacement and yet, less than 2yrs damaged again.</li>
            <li> As its a replacement, I cannot get it replaced even though its less than 1yr before it decided to say byebye.    </li>
            <li> -The end of the handle turned black because of mould issues.</li>
            <li> This has caused formation of fungal dirt and black spots.</li>

            <li> After the preset two minute brushing time is up, the toothbrush stops, and it is not convenient to restart it if one wishes to brush a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Thought it was a little pricey going in</li>
            <li> I would recommend brushing a little longer than the two minutes they recommend, though.</li>
            <li> (they don&#x27;t sell singles)and live with a lesser product because Sonicare makes bad products and doesn&#x27;t honor their warranty.</li>
            <li> On the other hand Oral-B Triumph has this fun, but ridiculous display which is constantly on even if it isn&#x27;t docked at the base.  </li>
            <li> The replacement set last no more than 1yr and its damaged again!?!</li>
            <li> It simply doesnt charge and when I bring my 7500 to philips center, nothing is wrong with my charger.</li>
            <li> I had an electric toothbrush as a teenager and then tried another briefly a few years ago.</li>
            <li> After that, the bottom 3 do not light up, so</li>
            <li> I had been Over Brushing my teeth with a regular toothbrush for years, irritating my gums and wasting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom and even though the charging base stations are small, its more counter space to give</li>
            <li> But after twelve to eighteen months the green plastic over the on/off switch starts to separate from the body.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m a convert, and may work on my husband in a few years when his Braun has quit.</li>
            <li> We had it in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to replace Oral B brushes every few months at least, not because they&#x27;d wear down, but because they&#x27;d break down.</li>
            <li> It seems expensive but the money you will save on fillings and batteries used for other electronic toothbrushes (this is rechargeable) is going to actually save you money!</li>
            <li> My teeth were dirty for months until I saved money for the new fancy one.</li>
            <li> My teeth are much cleaner close to the gum where it is needed and impossible with a manual or battery-operated brush.  </li>
            <li> make the investment and see what a difference a little technology makes!</li>
            <li> one of you will have to use the small for-tough-to-reach spaces head.    </li>

            <li> Thus, it&#x27;s difficult to keep the handle or back of the brush from hitting the teeth.</li>
            <li> so not sure if it is all the Sonicare.  </li>

            <li> -Small</li>
            <li> However, the only comment I want to share is that this item has a poor/ flawed design.</li>
            <li> The few negative reviews are whiners.</li>
            <li> (I hated it when the old one ran out mid brushing!).</li>
            <li> big complaint is how expensive the brush heads are.</li>
            <li> I know this toothbrush is expensive but it works wonders and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The R710 has only one brush head, no cord storage in the base, and no sensitive setting.</li>
            <li> Plus, it hardly weighs anything at all; it&#x27;s like holding a spoon.    </li>
            <li> and sometimes they do it so hard</li>
            <li> The replacement toothbrush heads are a little expensive but a family member has a warehouse shopping membership and I save a little there.</li>
            <li> WHEN BRUSHING AT LEAST TWICE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush at least five years.</li>
            <li> Need to change the brush heads at least once a year and sometimes twice.</li>
            <li> but slowly I became use to it.</li>
            <li> The brush is held at a 45-degree angle and the operator slowly moves the brush over the teeth/gum areas.  </li>
            <li> The other concern for me with this brand was the seemingly expensive brush heads.</li>
            <li> The head is really small on this toothbrush though, and I have no problem getting behind my molars with it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of less expensive electric toothbrushes and there is no comparison to how well this brush works.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads are a little expensive, but I use them for 6 months.  </li>
            <li> so while not cheap, that is not prohibitively expensive either.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning was a lot less uncomfortable too!      </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike Oral-B&#x27;s design, Philips  Sonicare design is poor in terms of maintenance.  </li>
            <li> Unlike Oral-B&#x27;s design, Philips  Sonicare design is poor in terms of maintenance.  </li>
            <li> I see that when switching brushes because I was using the smaller for hard to reach place, the inside of the handle and the inside of the brush attachment held slimy liquid with a horrible odor.  </li>
            <li> The difference is dramatic.</li>
            <li> However, the brush attachment frequently comes loose from the base while brushing the teeth -- which is particularly annoying!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t notice any waning brushing power unlike with Oral-B Triumph (which really is disappointing to feel as it loses it&#x27;s charge).  </li>
            <li> The rubber seal for the on/off switch fails in approximately 12 - 14 months.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to disassemble and then reassemble.  </li>
            <li> I judge  products by how they perform and how the manufacturer treats the purchaser  when things go wrong.</li>
            <li> (Before I got this, I obsessed with brushing my teeth</li>

            <li> Lousy.</li>
            <li> Way to time your products to fail, Phillips.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that nasty stuff ends up inside the bottom of the inside part where the brush attaches to the handle.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if this part failed when the batteries died.</li>
            <li> I was quite unhappy with the Oral-B as it just did not have the zip and zoom as this Sonicare Elite e9500 has.  </li>
            <li> Footprint of the recharging base is very small and it has cord management built into the base.  </li>
            <li> the power button was made very poor!</li>
            <li> Refills are very expensive (kinda like inkjet refills), so you may wanna disregard the recommended changing interval.</li>

            <li> 2) UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> If you charge it up overnight, then unplug the base, the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month.  </li>
            <li> Then, when it signals or stops, plug the base in to charge it.     </li>
            <li> If you keep the base plugged in all the time, these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.    </li>
            <li> No plug, it charges through induction in its base  Reminder beep that lets you know its time to locate your brush to a another quadrant of your mouth    </li>
            <li> I like the way you leave the tooth brush in the charger base to keep it fully charged at all times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We found that we have to take the brush heads off the toothbrush after use because some funky stuff grows inside the base.  </li>
            <li> charging base to share among the two</li>
            <li> 1 charging base to share among the two provided handles.    </li>

            <li> I made the switch to the Sonicare toothbrush over 3 years ago and am very happy with the product. I like the 30 second beeps that remind you to move to the next section of teeth. Have never had issues with the batteries. Battery lasts for 4 day trips without charging. I use the compact toothbrush head and the lowest power setting. The product can be a bit rough on your gums (per dentist, my gums receded a little) so had to change brushing technique and stay away from gums. Hope this continues to do the great job that it has been!</li>
            <li> We really like this toothbrush.  My teeth are much cleaner close to the gum where it is needed and impossible with a manual or battery-operated brush.  This brush is highly recommended by my dentist and especially by my peridontist. And by my husband and myself.</li>
            <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush so I don&#x27;t know if this is normal for an electronic toothbrush so that&#x27;s why I just gave it 5 stars. The first time I used it my gums were \\&quot;tickled.\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t stand it for more than 30 seconds,but I got used to it and now my gums aren&#x27;t as tickled, but I did notice that (and this may sound gross) my saliva kept coming out of my mouth, while I was brushing and you can&#x27;t walk around while brushing your teeth becuase little bits fly out. Normally I can hold it all in using a normal toothbrush. I think this is the only drawback to this toothbrush. Other than that, it&#x27;s terrific and my teeth and mouth feel cleaner in general.</li>
            <li> I received my toothbrush yesterday and quickly got it onto the charger. I used it last night for the first time, it does feel very strange but my teeth feel and look really clean when done. I found that I wanted more than 2 minutes brushing. I am not sure how to brush my front outside teeth without coating the sink and mirror with toothpaste, hopefully practice will help here. My plan is to not say anything for my next dental cleaning in May and see if my dentist notices a difference, I bet he will!</li>
            <li> Sonic makes a great product! It uses an internal magnet so the motor is perfectly sealed (As opposed to the Oral B)and impervious to the water and paste which regularly slides down a toothbrush. Your teeth feel cleaner after every use. It pauses for 1/2 sec. every 30 sec. to let you know where &amp; how long to brush, which is a help in the morning when I am not awake yet. The only complaint I have ever heard of is that it is so powerful it irritates the gums, but this has a gentle setting, so this thing is great.</li>
            <li> This brush was recommended by my dental hygienist. After buying one for myself, I purchased 2 more to give to my grown children for Christmas. They are amazed at how clean their teeth feel even hours after brushing. This brushing system is very easy to use and I love the quadrant timer feature. The battery is very efficient, too. I can use the toothbrush for almost two weeks between charges. This is a great toothbrush and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a great smile and healthy gums!</li>
            <li> Since I started using this, my trips to the dentists have reduced.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is an excellent product.  It has lots of power and the timer allows you to brush for the dentist recommended 2 minutes with 30 second intervals for the quadrants of your mouth.  Making life in the morning that much more tolerable.  The head is smaller allowing it to reach the back teeth without rattling my fillings out. No seriously this was a problem with my old sonic care.  Overall great brush, I am getting one for my girlfriend</li>
            <li> Since I have never used a decent power toothbrush before, it is taking quite a long time to adjust. I have had a recent recurrence of peridontal disease, so my dentist recommended this brush along with the Oral B.I have sinus drainage especially in the morning, and that creates problems getting to my corner teeth, upper and lower - I tend to gag. Also since it comes with a large and small brush, I am alternating to see which one works best. I will know if it has done any good after my next trip to the dentist. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This was my boyfriend&#x27;s Christmas gift (no offense, but he loves it!)but I use it from time to time (of course, with different head.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;Powerful but gentle &lt;br /&gt;It sits well on the sink, doesn&#x27;t roll around and drop the toothpaste &lt;br /&gt;Very sleek design, speed can be adjusted very easily &lt;br /&gt;Keeps charges well (one review said the battery lasted for several years, so I will see. &lt;br /&gt;Adjustable speed to suit your need &lt;br /&gt;Built-in timer to ensure you spend enough time brushing &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;It does splash, but only because I left it unattended &lt;br /&gt;The woozing and buzzing sound gave me a headache during my first few times, but I adapted to it quickly &lt;br /&gt;I need to clean the connection between the head and the handle regularly as water gets in and it may stink &lt;br /&gt;Heads can be costly &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good buy, worth the money</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works pretty well.    And the dental hygienist who urged me to switch to an electric toothbrush noticed right away on my next visit.    Two quibbles: the battery life could be longer.  This isn&#x27;t a big deal because it&#x27;s easy to recharge.  But in a cluttered bathroom in means keeping the charger out more often than not.    The other is that the buyer should note that it comes with two different kinds of heads -- not heads for two people.    So if you&#x27;re buying it for a couple, you&#x27;ll need to buy a second set of heads OR one of you will have to use the small for-tough-to-reach spaces head.    Otherwise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I got this about a month ago and LOVE it! It blows my mind how good it works. I didn&#x27;t do a ton of research before buying this so I was shocked by the results it produced. My teeth feel like I just had a professional cleaning at the dentist&#x27;s office all the time and my last check up was 5 months ago. My teeth feel smooth and glossy and CLEAN all the time now. Even after using this for a month, I still find myself running my tongue along my teeth in amazement throughout the day.    I had been using a Crest Spinbrush for the last 4 or 5 years, but water kept getting in the battery compartment which was beyond gross. I tried tons of stuff to keep this from happening, but nothing really worked. I saw that The Sharper Image carried this toothbrush and it looked nice so I used my Discover Card Cashback Bonus to get it.    The features this toothbrush has are great. I love the Quad Pacer and the 2 minute auto shutoff, but I tend to brush for 2:30 or 3:00 minutes. The construction is sturdy and the toothbrush heads are super easy to change and to clean. My husband has been using the same base, but with his own brush head and he loves it too. He experienced a tingling feeling at first, but that went away after the first few uses.    If you want to have the cleanest teeth of your life, BUY THIS TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the previous Sonicare elite for a few years now and it wasn&#x27;t as powerful as when i first got it, so i decided to upgrade to this newest model.  This product is excellent and I highly recommend it.  However, I went to Costco to purchase this instead for 124.99, which came with TWO handles, 2 Regular brush heads, and 1 compact brush head. :)</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! My teeth look amazing, and I&#x27;ve been an electric toothbrush user for years. This is my first Sonicare, and I truly can tell a difference in the way my teeth look.    I would have given this product five stars except for two annoying factors. After the preset two minute brushing time is up, the toothbrush stops, and it is not convenient to restart it if one wishes to brush a little longer.  Also, taking apart the head once a week to clean it as recommended by the manufacturer is a bit of a headache. It is difficult to disassemble and then reassemble.  Both of these are actually minor complaints considering what a great job the toothbrush actually does cleaning one&#x27;s teeth.      I have been following the advice of a previous reviewer to not return the unit to the charger after each use because my husband, an electronic engineer, says that reviewer is correct. The battering in the brush will last longer if it is allowed to rundown completely before it is recharged. The manufacturer is also correct in stating that the toothbrush will run for two weeks on one charge.  Seems like a win-win situation to me!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush, no doubt, but I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s any more effective at cleaning teeth than the less-expensive e7300 model.  I own the e9500 while my roommate has the e7300 and they are identical in operation and battery life.  Both will clean your teeth very well and for general oral hygiene I would recommend ANY Sonicare model without hesitation.  If you&#x27;re looking for the smallest head and quietest operation, the e7300 and e9500 are the way to go.  The only difference is that you spend $20+ extra on a tiny head and a prettier case.     I actually use my fabric case pretty often and I think the Sonicare travels well.  You simply unscrew the head and tuck both neatly in the bag.  It&#x27;s a pain to have to bring the charger along, but then I am away for over a week at a time, even though my battery lasts for nearly a week.      The clean feeling is amazing!  Definitely buy a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Purchased this model from my dentist at his strong recommendation. I&#x27;d been using an Oral B and really didn&#x27;t see the need for a new toothbrush. Decided to take the dentist&#x27;s advise and he was right. The only thing this Sonicare has in common with an Oral B is purpose. It&#x27;s a much better design, more powerful, effective motion, and better brushes. I&#x27;d have to replace Oral B brushes every few months at least, not because they&#x27;d wear down, but because they&#x27;d break down. Even with the lightest pressure. Sonicare recommends replacing brushes every 6 months. The shape of the brush also makes it easy to get to the back of back teeth, barely possible with round brush heads.    And then there&#x27;s the spatter issue. This thing is capable of slinging a fine mist of toothpaste up to the light fixture. I now follow the manufacturer&#x27;s advice, after cleaning face, glasses, and mirror for most of a week. They recommend putting it in your mouth before turning it on. Then turning it off before taking it out of your mouth. Seems simple, but the turning it off thing took almost more vigilence than I&#x27;m capable of in the morning. Took about 5 days, after rereading the manual, to get the hang of it. Now it&#x27;s habit, spatter problem solved.     I like the 30 second interval timer. Keeps me from losing track and over doing a section. My old toothbrush wasn&#x27;t effective enough to worry about over use.    The manual says that the handle can go in the dishwasher. Not the brush head or base, just the handle. Haven&#x27;t tried it, but it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s an option.      My last dentist visit confirmed my fervent hope, this toothbrush may well keep me out of the periodontist&#x27;s office. After a couple of months of use, my gums were healthier than they&#x27;ve been in years. Hooray!</li>
            <li> My original SonicCare lasted for several years and I am on my 2nd one. While it certainly does clean under your gums some, and non-flossers will notice a difference, it will not prevent gum disease by itself. I was a non-flosser because my hands are simply too big. I&#x27;ve finally found that a flossing stick (not the short ones but similar to a standard plastic toothbrush only instead of bristles you use replaceable floss-bows) was the only thing that works for me, because it is easy and convenient.    The brush itself I recommend without reservation, just be aware that it does NOT replace flossing.</li>
            <li> This is a very good toothbrush..It came highly recommended by my dentist.  It makes my teeth feel extremely clean.</li>
            <li> Very silent and gentle with your gums, it will clean your mouth thoroughly. Combined with the right toothpaste you will notice the difference. I recommend Crest Night, it can be used three times a day and it noticeably makes a difference in the cleanliness of your mouth.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I&#x27;m no spring chicken so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but the Sonicare 9500 is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the timer and the &#x27;break-in&#x27; feature which keeps those new to this type brush from overdoing it at first.  It does a great job overall and my teeth have never been cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like some other reviewers have pointed out, the ridge between the head and the power unit tend to collect junk which needs to be cleaned periodically (I soak in hydrogen peroxide).  Another reviewer has posted a like to a silicon cover for this area which supposedly corrects this but I haven&#x27;t tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes so far have lasted only about 3 months each but I can buy them in 3-packs at Sams for just over $30 so while not cheap, that is not prohibitively expensive either.  The fact that the brushes needed to be replaced as frequently as they do is the only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been a long-time Sonicare user of 13 years. I own both the Philips Sonicare Elite e9500 and the [[ASIN:B00008BFXG Sonicare Advance 4100]] Sonic Power Toothbrush. The Sonicare Advance 4100 finally conked out on me after 13 years (I suspect that its Nickel Cadmium battery has finally used up its recharge cycles since Nickel Cadmium batteries have a finite number of recharge cycles (about 1000)). I have had my Sonicare Elite for 2 years and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History 101&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;Philips acquired the Seattle-based company Optiva Corp. (the original maker of Sonicare) in 2000. When Optiva first introduced the Philips Sonicare Advance circa 1992, it was unlike any electric toothbrushes on the market. Sonicare Advance used a piezoelectric multimorph transducer, which was a patented technology developed by Optiva Corp. The technology allows the Sonicare Advance to produce a dizzying 31,000 brush strokes per minute (BSPM)! No other brand of electric toothbrush has been able to rival its performance before or since (sorry, [[ASIN:B000U08ZN4 Oral B Triumph]] and [[ASIN:B00170KCXC Crest Spinbrush]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does It Work?&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;YES! 31,000 BSPM is, patently, many many more brush strokes per minute than what any mere human is capable of producing with a manual toothbrush. Whenever I run my tongue across the surfaces of my teeth after every brushing, it feels like I&#x27;ve just had my teeth professionally cleaned by a dentist - no more gritty tooth surfaces resulting from the buildup of plaque and/or tartar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacing The Brush Head&lt;br /&gt;------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Replace your brush head every 3-6 months with the [[ASIN:B00008BFXL E-Series (Elite series) Brush Head Replacment]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stress this enough:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Change That Brush Head, Change That Brush Head, Change That Brush Head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare performs only as well as the brush head allows it to! Don&#x27;t try to stint on brush head replacements. Philips recommends replacing the brush head every 6 months. I find that the brush head starts to show signs of wear after only 3 months - the performance of Sonicare starts to degrade and the cleaning action of the Sonicare becomes noticeably less effective. I&#x27;d say change the brush head every 3-6 months. Sure, the price for brush heads is steep - so the question is: How much is oral hygiene worth to you? More important, how much is your general health and wellbeing worth to you? Oral bacteria and gum disease has been conclusively linked with a whole host of health problems including heart disease, pancreatic cancer and other bodily ills - Sound far-fetched? Don&#x27;t believe me? Google it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newer Model&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Sonicare FlexCare]] is the latest incarnation of Sonicare&#x27;s Power Toothbrush. If, however, you already own the Philips Sonicare Elite, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that the Sonicare Elite works just as well as the Sonicare FlexCare. The differences are (i) The Sonicare FlexCare comes with a UV sanitizer for sanitizing the brush head. (ii) The diameter of the brush handle of the Sonicare FlexCare is smaller and provides a more confortable grip, especially if you have smaller hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Verdict&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;You really have to try the Sonicare Elite Power Toothbrush to see for yourself what a FANTASTIC job it does of cleaning your teeth!s.

            <li> I am using my Sonicare toothbrush at least once a day and certainly like the clean feeling it leaves in my mouth.  It is easy to understand the directions for using it.  Another feature, after the intial charging, it is always ready to be used.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money for this toothbrush (HX9500).  Now, after about a year of use, the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.  You can&#x27;t replace the battery.  If it doesn&#x27;t work, throw it away.  Don&#x27;t invest in this dud.</li>
            <li> I had this less than a year when the rubber that covers the on/off button ripped and exposed the interior to water.  What a cheaply made device.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I had an electric toothbrush as a teenager and then tried another briefly a few years ago. they just chugged along. I thought i couldn&#x27;t do better than the manual method which i&#x27;ve used with great success most of my life (i&#x27;m 57) but now that i&#x27;ve started using the SoniCare i&#x27;ll never go back.  it&#x27;s got an awesome ultra sonic-like action that is super efficient. buy it! (on sale if you can).</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing the Sonicare I had a handful of Braun Oral-B power toothbrushes.  I liked them enough, but after giving the Sonicare a try I know I will not be going back to Oral-B anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Elite e9500 includes a nice travel case, a regular and compact brush head, a timer, 2-speeds, and a battery charge status display.  My favorite feature is the customizable brushing timer.  I set my for a 2:30 brush.  It pulses every 30 seconds to let me know to move onto another section of my mouth, and when the \\&quot;dentist recommend\\&quot; 2 minutes are up I use the remaining 30 seconds to lower the speed and massage my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative for this model Sonicare is that some kind of slimy gunk builds up in the head of the brush.  The first time it fell out I was both grossed out and fascinated by it (I need to get out more... I know).  However, if you simply unscrew the top and rinse it out with water then give it a quick bang against the sink that problem goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... It may be expensive, but keeping your teeth healthy is important.</li>
            <li> I judge  products by how they perform and how the manufacturer treats the purchaser  when things go wrong. Philips don&#x27;t care about Sonicare.    A toothbrush is an item that is used every day so when I vist Europe  - my toothbrush come with me.    I have used many electronic items in Europe - always of course  using a voltage regulator. Philips Sonicare products are  damaged. The charger ceased to function - there and back in the USA  I contacted Philips and was told to purchase something else.    I assume that this is an attitude that  their product advisers are taught      Goodbye Philips  the \\&quot;don&#x27;t care corporation.</li>
            <li> I know this toothbrush is expensive but it works wonders and lasts a long time. My teeth have never felt cleaner or my breath fresher for the entire day, and I brush twice a day. No bad breath even after coffee, and my teeth feel clean all day. I enjoy the transition pauses that tell me when to move on to another part of my mouth, and the brush head changes color when it&#x27;s time for a new head. I really enjoy this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush.  I had one and the soft plastic start button split.  I had had it for  several years and decided to order another one.  New one came with more directions for cleaning and taking apart  which is good. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Still using it today.  The brush heads are a little expensive, but I use them for 6 months.  If you brush carefully and gently, they will longer and clear better.</li>
            <li> Despite using the Oral-B, it seemed like I was needing fillings for little cavities, having a lot of plaque, or needing crowns (from decades&#x27; old broken fillings) everytime I went to dentist for a cleaning until I bought this Sonicare.  (Before I got this, I obsessed with brushing my teeth so much I actually was causing damage to my enamel &amp; gums so I had to stop excessively brushing &amp; excessively flossing).  I have sensitive gums so I use Sensodyne toothpaste.  This electric toothbrush doesn&#x27;t bother my gums at all.  Seems to do a better job &amp; I only brush &amp; floss in morning &amp; night. I haven&#x27;t had any problems at my regular 6 month dental cleanings for exactly 5 years now.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Sure, the brush heads can be pricey (I change them every 6 months) but I buy in bulk &amp; it&#x27;s worth it. Battery is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently discovered my Mom has been using this exact same toothbrush for a few years too &amp; has been very satisfied.  We both have small mouths.  My Mom congenitally has way too many teeth and is age 71.  I congenitally have only 22 teeth and I&#x27;m age 42.  My point being that whether you have a lot of crammed in teeth or not, it works well.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with my Oral B for several years but this is a superior product.  Leaves you feeling as if you just walked out of a cleaning with a dental hygienist every time.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase for an adult electronic toothbrush. With the S.E. 9500 your tongue can feel the post brushing smoothness that an ordinary brush lacks. This is a win-win purchase for teeth longevity.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product to better clean my teeth and to improve gum health. &lt;br /&gt;What I like about the product is the ease of use and the 2 minutes of brushing the teeth with 4 intervals of 30 seconds. &lt;br /&gt;Before using the Sonicare I brushed my teeth twice a day but to be honest perhaps 1 minute in total. &lt;br /&gt;The product helps you to improve behaviour and works really well. &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well designed, easy to use lasts for about 2 weeks without charging and I would recommend it. &lt;br /&gt;The only disadvantage I see is the cost of the head replacements, which is a little steep. On the other hand if you can avoid another visit to the dentist to get a new crown or filling it saves you some cost. &lt;br /&gt;So overall I say it is a question of perspective. &lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is our second Sonicare, as the battery died after 3 years in the first one.  The brush has improved the health of my gums enormously, I strongly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!!  I can&#x27;t believe that I spent the money on it (I am a cheapskate) but, I have never regretted it.  The toothbrush takes some getting use to (it chewed up my lower lip in the very beginning)  but, once you get the hang of it, it is so great!  I love how it divides your mouth into four sections so that you know you are brushing your teeth for the correct amount of time (I usually have to pause it after the second section to spit and reapply toothpaste, otherwise I look like a horror flick with foam coming out of my mouth!!).  Every morning and evening it feels like my teeth were cleaned by the dentist!!</li>
            <li> Have always used SoniCare systems...last one finally died after 6-years.  This one is operating as expected:  Great!  Don&#x27;t know how I brushed without it for 4 months...</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush. At first use I didnt like it, but it took sometime to get used to the speed and sensation of the toothbrush and now I really like how well it cleans my teeth. I also like the option of the different size heads that come with it. I would recommend purchasing the tootbrush.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush right after I got my teeth cleaned and it does a great job cleaning teeth.  It&#x27;s been 2 months and they still feel like it was yesterday.  I also love the feature where it times how long you brush your teeth.  It is set for 2 minutes and makes a sound at 30-second increments.  This allows me to spend equal amounts of time on each section of my teeth.  It has made a great difference in the health of my mouth.  I have tried a couple of less expensive electric toothbrushes and there is no comparison to how well this brush works.  I also did a lot of comparison between price on the web and various discount stores and the price at Amazon was the lowest.  I only found one other that was the same price and it was on sale at a local discount chain.  I think this is a great value for the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really gentle and powerful.  Moreover, i like the price! it&#x27;s cheaper than duty free shop.</li>
            <li> I have never been one for brushing my teeth. One quick pass in the morning was it. I usually lied to my dentist about how much I really was brushing, but, somehow I think he knew.    I started using the Sonicare and things have changed. It isn&#x27;t so much of a chore brushing anymore, and I find myself grabbing the brush while just sitting in my chair and running over my teeth a couple time for no other reason than it feels good.    The last visit to the dentist has confirmed that she saw a differance.     I still hate flossing though.</li>
            <li> Gives teeth and mouth a fresh clean feeling. Fast vibrating action that gets in between teeth and gums very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush thinking it&#x27;s going to be good toothbrush. But when I frist use it, and then looked at my teeth, man it looked good. And the feeling on my teeth WOW! that&#x27;s clean. It&#x27;s not just a toothbrush it&#x27;s investment for your teeth.</li>
            <li> We have multiples in my home and we just love them---In fact, I stopped using one a few years back and my periodontist said to start using it again--so here I am and it&#x27;s great&gt;</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dentist and I love it.  My Granddaughter (6 years old) was captivated by it and tried using the smaller brush that fit her mouth perfectly.  She now looks forward to brushing.  This was an unexpected result but clearly a benefit.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so smooth now. The 30 second intervals help me brush each quadrant completely. I really do encourage others to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. Makes my teeth feel cleaner and that is what i wanted from a toothbrush. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a great toothbrush, it is worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> Here are two things Phillips will not tell you about their Sonicare toothbrushes and heads.     1) The collar that holds the toothbrush to the handle will disintegrate in a couple of months. That&#x27;s what prompted this review, because they would not replace mine after it fell apart two weeks after purchasing a replacement.     They manufacturer these things to disintegrate so you will continue to buy replacements - planned obsolescence. However, I suspect their China supplier is skimping on the plastic specifications and they fall apart in weeks instead of months. (Do you think China would really do that?)    2) UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush.  If you charge it up overnight, then unplug the base, the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month.  Then, when it signals or stops, plug the base in to charge it.     This method will allow your toothbrush to work for five years or longer. If you keep the base plugged in all the time, these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.    A bonus, if you travel a lot as I do, you don&#x27;t have to pack the charger.  Just make sure it&#x27;s topped off and you&#x27;re good for a month&#x27;s vacation.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing the job of getting rid of plaque but I won&#x27;t know this until my next periodontal visit.      I see that when switching brushes because I was using the smaller for hard to reach place, the inside of the handle and the inside of the brush attachment held slimy liquid with a horrible odor.  Why does this happen? and maybe there should be instructions on how to disinfect, other than investing in an additional accessory.</li>
            <li> **Update 7/20/14 - this toothbrush is still going strong, and I still love it. The battery still holds a charge for almost 2 weeks of use. The only issue I&#x27;ve had with the unit is the charge lights have slowly failed, so that the only lights that light up now are the fully charged top light and the next lower one.  After that, the bottom 3 do not light up, so I just wait for the \\&quot;I need to be charged\\&quot; beeping to alert me to when it needs to be charged up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended a Sonicare toothbrush to me as a way to keep my teeth as clean as possible between 6 month checkups.  What a difference this toothbrush makes!  I used to spend at least 10 minutes meticulously brushing my teeth with a regular toothbrush, but still had plaque build-up in certain areas. With the Sonicare, I&#x27;ve been able to reduce my brushing time to 2 minutes (using the built-in timing program of the Elite e9500), and yet have a much cleaner mouth than before.  Even my wife has commented on how quickly I&#x27;m finished with my night-time routine.  I initially tried to use the Sonicare in a similar fashion to a regular brush, but ended up with some abrasions on my gum - yes, you CAN get too much of a good thing. :)  At that point, I decided to trust the built-in timing program, and use it as a guide.  I&#x27;m still amazed at how well it works.  I&#x27;ve also found I use much less toothpaste due to the smaller &#x27;regular&#x27; head.  I haven&#x27;t tried the compact head, since the regular head is smallish, but the regular head provides just enough coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having read others complain about battery life and keeping the Sonicare clean, I&#x27;ve made sure to only put the unit in the charger when needed (about every 2-3 weeks or so), and I keep it angled up slightly so I don&#x27;t get toothpaste down the handle (easily prevented).  I only use it once a day (using my regular brush in the morning), and find that&#x27;s more than enough to keep that &#x27;fresh from the dentist&#x27; feeling.</li>
            <li> The reviews I had seen about this suggested it was worth the slightly high price tag. After using it, I agree with the rave reviews it had gotten so far!   Easy to use straight out of the box- two settings for vigorous and gentle brushing, 30 sec beeps after each quadrant- the features are great and the end result was amazing.  Highly recommended...five star product!</li>
            <li> Arrived in new packaging, exactly as I ordered it and much sooner than anticipated.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare toothbrush.  It was recommended to me by a dental hygienist.  It works just fine and I feel that my teeth are getting a thorough cleaning.  The vibrating bristles provide an itchy sensation the first few brushings, but it&#x27;s fine after you get accustomed to the feeling.  Battery life is 10 days to two weeks between charges.  Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with the product and would reccommend it if you are in the market for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  My dentist suggested I try this to overcome some periodontal issues and it worked great.  My teeth are whiter than before because it removes the yellowing stain and the difference is very noticeable. The brush vibrates very fast and brushes your teeth in a way that you cannot emulate by hand.  I have been using this for only a couple of months and it is worth the money.  I have not used any other electric tooth brush to compare but I am very pleased with the results from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The sonicare is a great product and I was very pleasantly surprised at the service level of amazon.  The check out said it would be shipped in 5 or 6 days in fact it was shipped the next day and arrived well before christmas.  The only down side was that I was promised free gift wrapping so I didn&#x27;t open the mailer until christmas eve only to find I had to wrap it before placing it under the tree.</li>
            <li> What can I say it works very well. Way expensive but I bought it anyway. It sprayed toothpaste all over the place the first time I tried using it but that comes from not reading the instructions. The small head gets those back teeth. So I give it a 5 star on performance but 1  less because of the price.</li>
            <li> it is very noise first time when I use it, it is powerful, it&#x27;s like you have a massage device in your hand when you are brushing, it takes times to get used to it. I still use traditional tooth brush in the morning.</li>
            <li> Initially, I thought this was a lot to pay for a toothbrush.  But I had no idea how good this product could be.  The clean feeling you get after each use is amazing, and after about a month, I started to notice my teeth actually turning whiter.  My sister has raved about hers for years, and she is going to buy this latest model for the adjustable speed option.  I like the quad-pacer feature which tells you when you should switch to the next quadrant of your mouth.  All-in-all, a very good unit, and would recommend to anyone who wants to maintain healthy teeth.  But don&#x27;t forget to floss!  ;)</li>
            <li> What a difference a toothbrush makes, my teeth have never felt this clean. &lt;br /&gt;I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Thankfully you have two speed settings, I always have it on comfort when cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my sister.  I wasn&#x27;t sure she would really like it as much as she does.  She was impressed with the quality.  She is looking forward to her next dentist apointment to see if her dentist notices a difference.  She said she couldn&#x27;t believe that the toothbrush would beep to tell her it was time to switch sides.  She really feels like she has had a deep cleaning.  I decided on this toothbrush after reading the consumer guides.  I guess it is a great choice.</li>
            <li> We had the original Sonicare for years and it was time for a new one.  We are very pleased with the new model.  We especially like that there are different sized heads.  Our last one lasted for almost 7 years.</li>
            <li> I was an old school gal, using my manual toothbrush, and thought I was doing a decent job of keeping my teeth healthy. That was of course before I had a friend suggest that I use the Sonic toothbrush. I have only had my toothbrush for a few weeks, and let me say...it is the greatest invention for teeth! My teeth feel so clean and smooth, and I really feel like I get the food of the day out of my teeth. The frist time I used it I had popcorn kernels I had eaten from days ago come out!!! I was amazed! My gums look healthier and I could not be more pleased. I have read the other reviews and was concerned about several issues, such as the fungal growth or battery life. Since I&#x27;ve only had the toothbrush for a few weeks, I can&#x27;t speak to that. I only hope I will get my money&#x27;s worth and will be able to keep this brush well maintained for a few years. It&#x27;s worth every penny in my opinion, since teeth are one of our most valuable assets.</li>
            <li> is the same that i read in other review, perfect, you fell your mouth clean after use it. 100% recome...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that this toothbrush does not deserve a higher rating because basically it does a a very good job of cleaning your teeth.  However, after only a year&#x27;s use every other day the plastic threads of the brush have turned a disgustingly yellow color, like they have been  smoking, despite the fact that the product was thorougly cleaned after every use.  Furthermore, thirteen months after purchase it won&#x27;t work properly because the brush gets jammed after it is tightened on the handle.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrush for more than 2 years with total satisfaction.  The E series has desirable features. A slow start to allow acceptance of the sound and vibration lasts two weeks.  Thereafter, it delivers full intensity.  A timer sounds beep after 30 seconds to encourage treating each of four quadrants of the mouth thoroughly.  The effect is amazingly clean teeth.  My hygenist reports lower plaque buildup,  even after 12 months.  This purchase was for the double head model as gifts for my son and daughter-in-law.  They like it.  And as usual, Amazon came through with timely direct shipping to them.  Philips is always first choice and Amazon first source.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new toothbrush.  My dental hygeniest recommended I purchase this one.  I only had about 10 days to use it before my next cleaning, and she said my teeth were great-and that was before she even knew I had the new brush.  She thought I did my flossing more frequently.  Worth the price of the toothbrush for better dental health.  Very easy to use also.</li>
            <li> THIS TOOTHBRUSH IS EASY TO USE AND FEELS GREAT ON THE GUMLINE. I NOTICED THE MANUAL SAYS A FULL CHARGE CAN LAST FOR UP TO 2 WEEKS. THIS MAY BE TRUE FOR SOMEONE WHO BRUSHES ONCE A DAY. WHEN BRUSHING AT LEAST TWICE A DAY A FULL CHARGE WOULD ONLY LAST ABOUT 4 DAYS. THIS COULD BE HELPFUL FOR TRAVELERS.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare in the past, and it really helped improve the state of my gums.  They no longer bleed when I brush them.  This product is even better than my old one.  Highly recommended.  My only gripe is that the battery can not be replaced so that when it goes, you have to purchase a new one.  Mine lasted about 6 years.</li>
            <li> Works the same as the origianl Sonicare.  This newer model seems lighter.  Also has a charge indicator which lets you know if a recharge will be required soon.  The new heads do not address the problem of water and tooth paste running inside the head.  This does not affect operation of the unit itself, which is sealed.  If it lasts as long as my first Sonicare, I will be very happy.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive but worth every cent.  My teeth FEEL very clean after use.  The timed beeps result in complete brushing coverage, something I was lax with using a regular toothbrush.  I wish I had brought this product sooner.</li>
            <li> I had my old one for a few years before the button wore out. Great product so i bought it again. The only thing i would improve is the ability to clean inside the unit.</li>
            <li> I got one of these for me, and a month later got one for my daughter. I had been using an electric toothbrush for quite some time and had seen the reviews for this Sonic toothbrush and I had herd how much better these were for your teeth and gums.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, I wish I had gotten one sooner! As soon as I got it and charged it up it starts on the gentle cycle (works it&#x27;s way up to get you used to it) and right away my teeth felt so much cleaner, and my gums felt more massaged than with an electric toothbrush. I use this along with the Waterpik Power Flosser and my teeth and gums have never felt or looked better. I highly recommend these products to everyone!!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The downside is the cost of the replacement heads (average $23.00), but you get a package of 2 and you only have to replace them every 6 months-so 1 pkg will last you a year. The toothbrush comes with 2 size heads-1 small and 1 regular sized. You can reduce the wear of your brush heads by NOT pressing hard when you brush-it&#x27;s a hard habit to break after using standard and regular electric toothbrushes, but I&#x27;ve learned (slowly). The sonic power is what delivers the punch to get those teeth sparking clean!!</li>
            <li> I have had this for a couple of weeks. My previous 7000 series toothbrush died (battery) after three years which was a little disappointing, but the new model is much better. I particularly like that it splashes a lot less and the battery indicator is helpful (I hated it when the old one ran out mid brushing!).</li>
            <li> This product is quite easy to use and does the job well. Although it does tickle my lips, it gets the job done quickly.  I recommend this toothbrush to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I bought a Sonicare before it was popular. I am sure I would still be using that original model except that somebody knocked it over and it stopped working.  I had it for many years.     This is the lazy person&#x27;s ideal mouthcare device.  It does all the work.  I always get high praise for my teeth and gum care, but seldom floss--it&#x27;s all because of the Sonicare. If you want the battery to last forever, do NOT keep the charger plugged in.  In fact, keep the toothbrush in the charger (with power unplugged) but do not recharge until the thing stops.  If you would rather, you could also wait until it only shows one light, but waiting for it to stop is best.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas and it&#x27;s nice. I used it already and my teeth felt incredible. I would totally recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s great quality and works very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for a couple of months now, and wouldn&#x27;t consider going to a manual again.  I never tried the oral-b but what drew me to the sonicare was its small head that can reach the back teeth pretty well.  At first it took some getting used to as the feeling of the vibrating head accidentally touching the teeth wasn&#x27;t pleasant.  After about 5 uses though brushing with it becomes natural and I rarely let the head touch my teeth.  With its initial ramp up (over the first 14 brush cycles I believe) one gets used to the full power gradually.  Great product, if looking to purchase through amazon wait for rebates as this will save you an extra 20-30 bucks over department stores.</li>
            <li> Simply put this does it&#x27;s job the way I expected it. I upgraded from an older one that after 7 years would not work anymore.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for our son-he reports that it is a super good item and is more than pleased with it. This was recommended by his dentist.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for daughter, so I called her for review.  She has been using sonicare brushes for years and she is very happy with this one.</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd one. 1st I bought from my dentist, on/off button split, then I bought the set of 2 from costco. Second one split, now the third one is splitting. There is a design defect on this model.</li>
            <li> I bought this at target about 5 years ago and love it! It cleans better then I could have ever imagined! I have very sensitive teeth and was very prone to cavities but since owning this, I have had less cavities, whiter teeth and it feels so good to brush your teeth! It massages and cleans so well that after using, you feel like you just left the dentist! And the 2 min timer is awesome! I recommend this to everyone! It seems expensive but the money you will save on fillings and batteries used for other electronic toothbrushes (this is rechargeable) is going to actually save you money! You will not regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> SELLER: Fast shipping; I&#x27;m happy.  PRODUCT: Sonicare is the standard of the industry. This is a replacement for one of the very first versions...that lasted for years.    Very impressed that it came with two heads and a travel case.  Upon arrival, I charged it. It still has plenty of juice after twice a day use for two weeks.    Also like it self timer function. My old unit did not have this.    CONCLUSION: Just buy it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about five weeks and rate it as good, but not \\&quot;elite\\&quot; as the product name indicates. In fact, I&#x27;ve even considered returning it. While it seems to do an outstanding job of cleaning teeth, the vibration is strong and very disconcerting when the handle or back of the brush hits your teeth. The spray is fine but profuse, so you really need to close your mouth almost completely to prevent the spray from covering everything within a foot or two. Thus, it&#x27;s difficult to keep the handle or back of the brush from hitting the teeth. I haven&#x27;t encountered the build-up of fluid and debris in the toothbrush. However, the brush attachment frequently comes loose from the base while brushing the teeth -- which is particularly annoying! I&#x27;ve used an Oral-B for years and am likely to return to their toothbrushes rather than Phillips.</li>
            <li> My gum health has improved and my teeth are cleaner after using this toothbrush. I have owned it for just over a year now, using it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the 2-minute Smartimer (actually, I use the 2 minute 30 second timer option so that I can brush the top of my molars) and the 30-second Quadpacer interval timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge last for many days, which is handy for taking it on vacations if you don&#x27;t want to take the charger along (although it is very small).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way the toothbrush puts you through a start-up procedure when you start using the toothbrush. It will slowly increase the speed of the vibration over the first few days until it reaches full vibration power. Full power right at the start would be too much. Consequently, my teeth didn&#x27;t really feel clean until it finally got to the final full power stage - just a warning for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flaws that I found, which will probably still not prevent me from buying the same unit when this one breaks, are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Replacement brush heads are expensive. I know, they are supposed to last three months, but still paying a total of $56 for a set of two regular heads and two compact heads every six months puts a dent in my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The first button (the one you use to turn it on and off) partially caved in after a few months, as another reviewer noted. This hasn&#x27;t caused me a problem but makes me a little worried when I periodically go to clean the gunk out in holder under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The heads last three months because I believe they would be classified as \\&quot;medium\\&quot; or \\&quot;hard\\&quot;. I was told in the past to use only soft brushes, which is why my manual toothbrushes wouldn&#x27;t last very long - at least they were cheap to replace. Since my periodontist hygienist recommended this product and my gums have not been damaged, I suppose the stiffer bristles are okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- After using the brush head a month or so it will take firmer tightening to put it on the holder without having it make a vibrating loose sound. This may only be a problem for me because I use the standard head for the main brushing, and then switch to the compact head to brush behind my rear molars. So, I change heads a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 11/12/2011&lt;br /&gt;I was reviewing my reviews and saw I gave this five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to drop it to three stars because my unit only lasted 14 months - it just stopped working. I suspect the battery went bad but since it is sealed into the unit I couldn&#x27;t get at it to replace it (assuming a replacement battery is available). I emailed the company and since it failed after the warranty period they wouldn&#x27;t do anything. Pretty expensive if this is common. I talked with the dental hygienist about it (she recommended the product) and she said her&#x27;s was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got a bad unit but now I&#x27;m using a Crest Spinbush ($15-$20) and it&#x27;s been great. I can replace the rechargeable batteries and Consumer Reports rated it almost as good as the Sonicare. I&#x27;ve been using it since for years and haven&#x27;t had to replace the unit.s may only be a problem for me because I use the standard head for the main brushing, and then switch to the compact head to brush behind my rear molars.

            <li> This is the first power toothbrush I have ever owned.  I am normally a bit of a purist, but by the recommendation of my dental hygienist I purchased this product about a month ago.  The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t sure that I was going to like this rather expensive toothbrush.      I learned quickly to never have the toothbrush running outside of your mouth.  I read the directions that warned me to have the toothbrush in my mouth anytime it is running.  But when I turned it on that first time  (touching my teeth at the designated 45 degree angle) the noise and violence of the toothbrush surprised me to the extent that I removed it from my mouth.  Once I turned off the toothbrush and subsequently cleaned splattered toothpaste from my face, clothes, mirror, and counter top I tried it again.  By the way Philips sets the toothbrush at a lower setting for the first few brushings to make it easier on you.    The second time I succeeded but experience was not very pleasant.  I was surprised that it only took 2 minutes to brush and how short two minutes goes by.  With my manual toothbrush I worked about 5 minutes.  As I continued to use the toothbrush I acclimated to the device&#x27;s ways and even got my timing down with the use of their beep.  Now I love the thing.  It&#x27;s quick and after brushing, my teeth feel very clean similar to the way they feel after the Dental Hygienist finishes the polishing.    Pros:  It works amazing well.  Length of time required to brush (and actually get your teeth clean)  Lightweight  No plug, it charges through induction in its base  Reminder beep that lets you know its time to locate your brush to a another quadrant of your mouth    Cons:  Charge time (24 hours if the battery is run down)  Quick disconnect for the brush if more than one person would like to use the base</li>
            <li> Having used the Oral B Professional toothbrush, I find the Sonicare e9500 to be quieter, a lttle measier to manipulate, and equivalent in cleaning efficiency. The Sonicare battery takes several hours to recharge, but then lasts two weeks. The audible timer is more beneficial than I would have thought. I just purchased another for my girlfriend. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> No BS. My dental exams have been steadily improving since I started using this. I&#x27;ve had it now for several years and it&#x27;s still going strong. Get one. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> We have owned an older Sonicare for years--replaced it with the newer model on our Dentist&#x27;s advice.  This one is much stronger and more vigorous.  When I&#x27;m done I feel like I&#x27;ve had a cleaning, not just brushed my teeth.  This one is amazing.  Never thought I&#x27;d praise a hundred dollar toothbrush but this one is worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush as an upgrade after using battery operated toothbrushes. Advanced research in comparison to Oral B was proven accurate and this is a great toothbrush, with powerful cleaning action, alternate brush heads and great features like gradually increasing brush action strength the first several uses to allow time for adjustment and the 30 second per quadrant timer.</li>
            <li> I switched to an electric toothbrush after a lifetime with manual ones. After doing a lot of research, I picked this one....I am not sure how good the lower versions (also cheaper) of sonicare are but this product has been totally worth it. I have been extremely happy with it. &lt;br /&gt;It takes a lil&#x27; getting used to and some spraying is surely bound to happen the first few times if you are new to electric toothbrushes. &lt;br /&gt;It holds charge for abt 1.5 weeks(manual says 2) if you brush twice/day. The 2min timer is really useful and it is probably one of the reasons I am lured into brushing my teeth at night regularly (i used be lazy with the manual ones). &lt;br /&gt;I have been able to see improvement in the last 4 months i have been using this model. My teeth feel really clean...might be better to rinse with listerine also as the toothbrush holds lil&#x27; toothpaste and doesn&#x27;t give an entirely clean mouth feel like the manual ones. But teeth feel really clean. &lt;br /&gt;Take care when you rinse the toothbrush as water can enter the holder through the seal. This leaves a bad smell over a period of time. I suggest you immediately wipe the toothbrush with a dry cloth after rinsing it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Excellent product overall!!</li>
            <li> The only difference I can see between my new 9500 and the 7500/7300 models (about $20 cheaper if you can still find one) is that it comes with two different brush sizes.  Replacement brushes are available in drug stores, Wal Marts, Target, and some grocery stores.  It has two power settings.  By default, it beeps at 30-second intervals and shuts off after two minutes so you can \\&quot;do\\&quot; your teeth by quadrants.  All the \\&quot;programmable timer\\&quot; feature amounts to is the option of running for an extra 30-second interval, or turning the timer off entirely so that it&#x27;s just on/off.  The \\&quot;easy start\\&quot; feature, enabled out of the box, gradually increases power over the first fourteen brushings.      (August, 2006:  Note that there is now a 9800 model with the same features as this one currently selling on Amazon for LESS.  That is the one to get.)    My turn-of-the-century Sonicare would run a *good* two weeks on a charge with just me using it, and this one does too (more like three!).  The instructions (then and now) say to leave it in the charger when not in use, but I always unplugged it to run the battery all the way down before re-charging; I think that&#x27;s why it lasted so long.  These have a good old fashioned nickel-cadmium battery and they only have so many charge cycles.  I suspect the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t want that getting around because their revenue stream would atrophy if everyone went this long before buying a replacement.    One nice thing about these new-generation Sonicares:  smaller brushes and dramatically less splatter.  The brush of my Y2K model looked like a standard manual toothbrush and some splatter was inevitable with that thing; I would remove my shirt or drape a towel over my shoulders to avoid getting festooned with micro-flecks of toothpaste.  But not with this one!  Plus, it hardly weighs anything at all; it&#x27;s like holding a spoon.    My dentist turned me on and still recommends this brand today.  (I brush for the whole two minutes and he recommendsnot doing that more than once per day and with a gentle, ordinary toothpaste as opposed to a whitener.)  Money well spent --I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in all those years.  Never thought much about my gums, but they are nice &amp; pink &amp; clean &amp; tight, like in the ad photos.  Sonicare gives you 60 days to send it back if you don&#x27;t like it.    Tip for newbies: Stand in the shower so that you don&#x27;t splatter toothpaste all over the bathroom!  Have fun! :-)</li>
            <li> First, I had an Interplac. Then I replaced it with a Sonicare. The Sonicare wore out and I bought a Braun. The Braun was nice, but did not give me that sense of having my teeth cleaned by a Dental Tech. After looking around for a while, I found the best price on Amazon and bought the Sonicare Elite e9500. Nothing else will do - this is the unit to use.</li>
            <li> Just what the dentist ordered!  He said this would give the best cleaning and he was right...</li>
            <li> I previously owned a Sonicare toothbrush. The new, Elite models, are a big improvement. The brush heads are smaller; more maneuverable and much, much easier to clean after use. I had changed from my messy, clumsy, old Sonicare to an Oral-B Triumph. When I last visited my dental hygienist, she told me that I should change to the improved Sonicare Elite. She said that it was a technical improvement over previous models and not just a cosmetic makeover. Well, she made a believer out of me. Two stars deducted for failing to include a multi-voltage or dual-voltage charger so that the Sonicare could be charged when traveling overseas. That&#x27;s a curious omission for a Dutch-owned company but is consistent with previous Sonicare products. I guess that travelers must hope that one day Philips will wake up to the fact that people cross oceans regularly and will review this penny-pinching philosophy. I&#x27;ll bet that they don&#x27;t save even $2 on each toothbrush. I doubt very much that a German, Japanese or Korean electronics producer would be selling a major product for personal use which is unsuitable for use outside its country of purchase. The option is to also buy a 220v Sonicare in Europe or elsewhere. I balk at the additional cost.</li>
            <li> Lesson: Just let the toothbrush fully drain of power before setting back in charger - otherwise you decrease battery life... because these use (guessing) NiCd batteries, like cellphones before NiMh.</li>
            <li> just used for the first time..  its everything it says it is  makes it seem like i just went for a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush but the power button was made very poor! It breaks the seal and pushes in over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this was done on purpose so you would have to buy a new one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would think they would use a better method to turn product on and off if they really wanted an effective first class product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing really Elite about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go figure.</li>
            <li> I had the old Sonicare.  When my wife gave me walking papers she lost my charger or tossed it. My teeth were dirty for months until I saved money for the new fancy one. Expense but nice for me. Now I have cleaner teeth and no wife. O&#x27;yea the first one broke down (Sonicare not wife)but sonicare sent me a great replacment(that&#x27;s Sonicare not wife). I do recommend a Sonicare not Wife.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this system. Have had it for 3 weeks and I&#x27;m amazed by the cleaning that it does.   Only wish that I would have gotten it sooner.</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by my hygenist, to cut down on the amount of cleaning she needs to do on me, and just to keep the plaque down between visits.  It is different than a regular toothbrush, but it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare toothbrush lasted 5-6 years before the battery needed a charge every other day. This model is much better than the older models. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This brush worked great...for only five months.  I bought this five montns ago and then it just quit working.  If you are in the market for a power toothbrush, choose a different brand.  True, it does a great job when it works.  However, when I spend $119.99 for a product, it had better last more than five months.</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter and my gums are in excellent condition.  The 30 seconds per tooth area, i.e., top outside, lower inside helps me brush longer like dentists recommend.  Holds the charge for a long time and is great for traveling.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely THE BEST TOOTHBRUSH ON THE MARKET for home use!!! Fresh from the dentist clean after EVERY brush and it feels GREAT on the gums.</li>
            <li> I used an oral b toothbrush forever and didn&#x27;t think I would like this one because of the rectangular head.  The head is really small on this toothbrush though, and I have no problem getting behind my molars with it.  After brushing my teeth with this tooth brush, I felt as if I had just left the dentist&#x27;s office.  This is the best toothbrush EVER!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me. I was wary about spending this much on a toothbrush, but I&#x27;m a firm believer in \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;, and this lives up to the hype. I like the timer, the brush is easy to grip and use, and the battery really does last a full 2 weeks between charges. It actually makes me want to brush more often because you just get a really clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, each charge lasts a long time--about 1-2 weeks--still after owning for about a year.  Works well and really makes my teeth feel cleaner than regular or even other electric toothbrushes.  Well worth the cost, you&#x27;ll wonder why you didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.</li>
            <li> I had an older model Sonicare that lasted years. The newer e9500 seems to last only a few months before the power button seal breaks. This has happened twice. My second unit which was replaced by Philips just developed the same problem as the unit it replaced. Otherwise this would be a very good toothbrush but with this major flaw, I am only giving it two stars. See the photo I uploaded that shows this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, on another note... water gets into the brush head. It builds-up \\&quot;junk\\&quot; after awhile. Not pretty.</li>
            <li> This product has been discontinued most likely because the on/off button keeps falling off. I have had to replace three under warranty. The first two times, they were accusatory and said their research showed toothpaste was breaking down the rubber. Huh?    The last time, they sent the R710 to replace it, which is not comparable to the 9500. The R710 has only one brush head, no cord storage in the base, and no sensitive setting. The R732 has the extras including two brush heads, but Sonicare refused to send it.    So I have to go out and buy three brush heads (they don&#x27;t sell singles)and live with a lesser product because Sonicare makes bad products and doesn&#x27;t honor their warranty. I&#x27;ll never buy a Sonicare again.</li>
            <li> This is a really good power toothbrush (the e9500).  My dentist sold me one, then I bought one for my mother.  I like the 30-sec increment timer so I can consistently brush each surface of my teeth.  Refills are very expensive (kinda like inkjet refills), so you may wanna disregard the recommended changing interval.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product,quite pricey though but it sure beats the old fashion brush just buy one you will not regret it I garuntee.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare power toothbrush is the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.  I have had 2 others over the past 6 years and Sonicare continues to improve on a great product.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is very easy to use.  It does a great job of cleaning your teeth.  I like the 30 second intervals so I can divide my teeth cleaning in 4 parts for a thourough job.  I like the way you leave the tooth brush in the charger base to keep it fully charged at all times.  It is very easy to be kept clean, I do this once a week.  So far it has been a very good product that I purchased.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the Sonicare. I&#x27;m finding that my teeth are cleaner and whiter as a result of using this daily. It holds a charge fairly well-I charge it once weekly on average. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> because of non- delivery the product was returned to amazon with the promise of crediting my account for the returned item. i still have not been credited but my account has been debited again. please correct the problem immediately &lt;br /&gt;hamid ladjevardi</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is simply amazing.  I never thought that an electric toothbrush would clean my teeth any better than I could with a regular toothbrush, but I was wrong.  My teeth feel cleaner and are cleaner according to my hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few surprise cavities after years of regular brushing and flossing, I bought two of these brushes (one for spouse) and hoped for the best. The two minute timer is very helpful.  I had been Over Brushing my teeth with a regular toothbrush for years, irritating my gums and wasting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I am not pleased with is the Battery.  It is NOT a Lithium Ion, so it&#x27;s best not to leave it always on the charger.  I have a small bathroom and even though the charging base stations are small, its more counter space to give up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- UPDATE 4/03/2008---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries on our two brushes are still going strong and last a surprisingly long time between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found that we have to take the brush heads off the toothbrush after use because some funky stuff grows inside the base.  If you take the brush head off, then it can air out and nothing \\&quot;grows.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few more dentist visits later and I&#x27;m still doing good.  For me, that is amazing because every time I&#x27;ve gone in the past I&#x27;d had to have SOMETHING drilled and filled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using ACT restoring, so not sure if it is all the Sonicare.  (Note that ACT Restoring x2 is actually diluted down from regular ACT restoring if you are thinking of adding it to your dental routine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----- Update 2/25/09 ----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batteries are still about as good as it was on day 1.  Still no cavities.  I&#x27;ve noticed that it brushes significantly harder/more powerfully the first brush after a charge than subsequent brushes.  I still love this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----- Update 5/06/11 ----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It finally died a slow death.  The batteries need to be swapped out.  I&#x27;m not going to bother doing it because the case is getting sort of worn out and there are more advanced models of Sonicare available. Well worth the money for how much use I got out of this toothbrush.  Still no cavities!able. Well worth the money for how much use I got out of this toothbrush.  Still no cavities!</li>
            <li> I have always wanted an electric toothbrush but didn&#x27;t want to blow all that money on something I could do myself with a $2 toothbrush. I WISH I HADN&#x27;T WAITED! You never knew your teeth could feel so clean! I know that sounds strange but it&#x27;s true! My gums are healthier, my breath fresher, and my teeth whiter! This toothbrush is comfortable, easy to use and easy to travel with. Don&#x27;t wait any longer...make the investment and see what a difference a little technology makes!</li>
            <li> I bought my first Sonicare years ago under advice from my dental surgeon.  This is my third model and I will never own another toothbrush again.  It&#x27;s easy to use, travels well, lasts forever and cleans my teeth better than any powered or non-powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like using this toothbrush alot.  It cleans the teeth very well.  Seems easier to use than a manual one.</li>
            <li> Our old Advance died after 5 years of working hard.  Total use for that thing was 4 times a day, 4 minutes each time, and 7 days/week or 365 days/year.  After countless of head replacement, the battery finally died.  So when it come to get a replacement, we don&#x27;t even have to think about what brand.  Sonicare is the only brand for us.  Sometimes, you could go to Costco and purchase a set with two handles, one charger and other accessory for $99 after coupon rebate. That was how we got our.  You will enjoy this.</li>
            <li> Best dental hygiene device since the invention of the toothbrush.  Puts my old Oral-B to shame.  Having had full periodontal surgery in the past, I needed something to keep the roots clean and this does the job.  Thought it was a little pricey going in but well worth every penny now that I&#x27;m using it.  Highly recommended! Pay the price and have \\&quot;clean\\&quot; teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchase a number of these beauties over the last several years. They work great. The whole family uses them. But after twelve to eighteen months the green plastic over the on/off switch starts to separate from the body. Eventually, the whole thing gives way leaving a gapping hole. And then, of course, water gets into the unit and soon you get the opportunity to help Philips&#x27; bottom line again.    It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if this part failed when the batteries died. That seems to happen around the three year mark. (My husband was able to get one to last that long through the use of plastic and super glues, but the result was something only an engineer could love.)</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this brush over the Braun I had.  I purchased this just a little more than a month ago and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  The two different size brush heads is very nice as I have a small mouth and the smaller brush works very well.  I took it on a 10 day trip, used it twice a day and the battery was still charged and the brush still powerful when I returned.      I had a dental cleaning this morning, and the individual tooth pockets I&#x27;ve been battling all my life were dramatically better.  My teeth are whiter and the dentist was very pleased with the results.  The cleaning was a lot less uncomfortable too!      This brush really gets in between your teeth, and moves the toothpaste in the crevices.  I am a Sonicare convert, and will never go back to my Braun.</li>
            <li> This replace an older Sonicare.  The difference is dramatic. Much more power, smaller head excellent battery life.  Has many more features that I haven&#x27;t tried such as reducing power, changing the cycle times, etc.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product, you will never go back to the regular toothbrush again.  My teeth and gums fell vibrant and healthy.</li>
            <li> I had an older model (which lasted about 8 years).  This toothbrush is lighter, holds a better charge, and feels like it&#x27;s doing a great job.  No complaints and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> During the last six years I have used this product and it does an excellent job, but it&#x27;s life is rather short for the cost. I am now on unit #4, the prior three failing in the same manner. The rubber seal for the on/off switch fails in approximately 12 - 14 months. Once it fails and water gets inside ... good by battery.  I am not sure what the life expectancy should be, but for a system that exceeds $100 I would anticipate a longer life. I still rate it great for it&#x27;s purpose and will continue to use it, but..........</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy the Sonicare FlexCare. The newer FlexCare models are an upgrade without the screw-on design flaw of this Sonicare model. This model has a hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the hand piece and pool up in a really disgusting way and requires you to take it apart and clean off inner crevices made up of metal and plastic parts. The new design eliminates all that slew of slime. This brushing action is fantastic, just like the new one, but this design stinks...literally.</li>
            <li> I must have tried at least six or seven different brands of electric brushers of teeth and this one beats the others hands down.  I was quite unhappy with the Oral-B as it just did not have the zip and zoom as this Sonicare Elite e9500 has.  The battery last for just about forever.  I feel my teeth are in much better condition since I started using this product.  I have to admit that I have four of them, one in each of my bathrooms and they are worth ever penny.</li>
            <li> Gum massage is outstanding.  My dental hygienist noticed a difference after 30 days.  The 30 second timer keeps you on track, but can also be turned off.  With a little practice, you can pucker your mouth just enough that the mirror and sink don&#x27;t receive a fine spray of toothpaste twice a day.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare power toothbrush.  I gave the other one to my grandchildren.  This one has more \\&quot;bells and whistles.\\&quot;  Adjustable power output and I like the thinner brush heads a lot better.  I can testify that these babies DO work.  I had numerous \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; during a dental checkup a couple of years ago and was told I would have to have a \\&quot;deep cleaning\\&quot; at my next visit.  After using the Sonicare brush and skipping an entire year before returning to the dentist, the pockets were GONE and I did NOT need a \\&quot;deep cleaning.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m sold!  I highly recommend Sonicare products!</li>
            <li> Once you get an Elite, you will never want anything else. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush but found I could have bought it alot cheaper at costco, alot cheaper oh well live and learn.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is extremely effective in cleaning teeth.  It encourages longer brushing.  It&#x27;s easy for someone with developmental disabilities to understand that they need to brush their teeth until the toothbrush shuts off after 2 minutes.  The toothbrush leaves our teeth looking and feeling cleaner.</li>
            <li> Sonicare was recommended by my dentist five years ago and I have used it ever since.  This is the third Sonicare toothbrush I have owned and I am very pleased with my new purchase.  It is much improved over the older versions and is easer to keep clean.  The warrantees are also longer which indicating the product is of higher quality.</li>
            <li> My last Sonicare electric toothbrush lasted over six years, and I was very pleased with it.  I was therefore happy to purchase a new, though upgraded, version of my old Sonicare.  The shipper, shipment, and delivery schedule were great, and I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING THIS PARTICULAR POWER BRUSH, AND DECIDED ON THIS ONE, EVEN THOUGH IS WAS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN SOME OF THE OTHERS. THE OLD SAYING IS \\&quot;YOU GET WAHT YOU PAY FOR\\&quot; AND IN THIS CASE ,,, IT IS SO VERY TRUE. GREAT TOOTHBRUSH! THE BEST</li>
            <li> After spending about 2 weeks shopping around and reading reviews of every power toothbrush out there (well, most of them!), I finally decided to go with the Philips Sonicare Elite e9500. The first 2 weeks my gums were a bit sensitive to the motion of the brush but slowly I became use to it. The two different heads are great, especially the smaller one. My toothbrush remains charged for more than 2 weeks at a time and this model has a great feature that beeps at you when the battery is low, so you can keep it off of the charger until then. Easy to clean and powerful, I would buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using the Sonicare system and really believe in their effectiveness.  It was a no brainer gift idea when my daughter hinted she would love to get one someday.  Her birthday was coming up and I usually like to give gifts that can be used frequently.  Pricing on Amazon was great and so was the free shipping.  My daughter is estatic with the Sonicare Elite e9500 and is now a believer.  Best dental care investment you can make.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re going to splurge on a oral hygeine product, this is the one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my dentist reminded me that with this, you are not supposed to \\&quot;brush\\&quot;, you simply  let the brush head do it for you. many people make the mistake of brushing while using this and sometimes they do it so hard, it causes gum damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you will feel results after one use--your teeth will feel slicker! conversely, if you travel and forget to bring it, you will notice the fuzz growing on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a fear of dentists and I didn&#x27;t go for 4 years. I finally went and NO CAVITIES! Use this and floss regularly, you&#x27;re set!</li>
            <li> It felt good in my hand and I liked it until the charge only held for three days. I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> It shipped on the 15th and it arrived on the 17th with free shipping from Amazon.com!  After letting it charge for the required 24 hours I finally got to try it out and I have to say it is THE BEST TOOTHBRUSHING I&#x27;VE EVER HAD!  I was just diagnosed with advanced periodontal disease which probably means I&#x27;m going to lose most of my teeth, but I plan on donating this to my husband...heck, I may even buy him one of his own.  Anyone out there who&#x27;s looking into an electric toothbrush, if you can afford this, it is so totally worth the investment!  The only thing better would be to have a free teeth cleaning once a week! &lt;br /&gt;Denise/Scottsburg IN</li>
            <li> Great tooth brushes, we had gone the cheap route before, DON&#x27;T DO IT! Sonicare is a great product, great company, come on they make the best LCD&#x27;s as well. After 5 years our old Sonicare has given up, a good run in my book. (charge won&#x27;t last anymore)It&#x27;s time to step up again, just ordered it, I know it&#x27;ll be great, I mean 5 years ago it was amazing so I can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> Get that great &#x27;just from the hygienist&#x27; feeling everyday. Good clean design, so far not a single complaint.</li>
            <li> After reading all about Sonicare on their web site I decided to take the plunge and invest in one.  It took a couple of days to get used to the experience of brushing with a power brush. Now I love it.  I talked with my dentist about it and he uses a Sonicare too.</li>
            <li> I let my dendist be the judge.  After useing this toothbrush for about a week I went to a dentist apointment and for the first time ever he told me there was not any plack buildup in my teeth.  He asked me what I was doing diferant.</li>
            <li> The product works great. It&#x27;s the first time using an electric toothbrush and the way it cleans your teeth is much better then the manual toothbrush. It&#x27;s true once you use this product you will never go back. The product is easy to use. This Sonicare was highly recommended by my dentist and now I see why. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t try this, order it now. &lt;br /&gt;No more words.</li>
            <li> This is the second power toothbrush that I have used, and it is so much more effective than the previous one (a different brand) for what it does.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My significant other recommended this to me (she&#x27;d been using it for years).  While my first use felt a little strange (ticklish), my teeth came out super clean.  After 60 days of use, I&#x27;m hooked.  It&#x27;s like going to a dentist&#x27;s office for a cleaning...twice each day!  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever go back to a regular toothbrush again.  Absolutely a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for 15 years. I have updated to the e9500 and love it. Before I started using the Sonicare, my gums were receding badly. Since I switched to Sonicare, my gums have been perfectly healthy and my teeth are so clean that I am out of my semi-annual hygienist&#x27;s appointment in 15 minutes. Nothing better for your teeth and gums. They should be issued by Medicare. I also recommend using a Butler Proxabrush to clean between the teeth after every meal. You can find them in any drugstore. I keep one in every room and another in my purse. Dentists usually give them out free after your teethcleaning. Proxabrush is a tiny bristle brush that gets the debris out from between the teeth.</li>
            <li> We bought our first Sonicare Elite year before last and have been pleased with the effectiveness it has in keeping our teeth and gums healthy.  After a while, the rubberized button over the on/off switch wore away and tore off, leaving a hole to the inside of the unit.  Water would get inside the unit and we literally had to stick our finger inside of it to turn it on and off.  Well, Phillips has excellent customer service and replaced the unit.  However, less than a year later, our replacement unit did the same thing.  We give up.  We&#x27;re going to give the Oral-B Triumph a try.    Overall:  A+ on customer service, A+ on product effectiveness, F on durability and quality.</li>
            <li> After four months of use, I have to announce my PRO&#x27;s and CON&#x27;s of the sonicare elite system:    PRO:  - Very good sonic power, cleaning your teeth really thouroughly.  - Nice design, practical settings (2-minute-clock)  - Good and ergonomic shape of the brushes    CON:  - Insanitary brush heads, which you cannot clean (after three months use,    the inaccessible cavity of the large brush was full of fungal dirt,     despite my cleaning and drying of the brush after every use)  - Therefore, you need to buy a new brush after every some weeks.     Considering the very high price of new brushes (20+ USD, which of course    is much too high), this system gets very costly.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive teeth, so the dentist recommended the Sonicare toothbrush.  My husband has confirmed that most of the pain caused by te sensitivity has gone away. (Yey!) We recommend it.</li>
            <li> i found the timer feature in this toothbrush highly effective in aiding consistancy of teeth brushing. the two speed feature is also a handy tool. only regret is not geting a sonicare toothbrush sooner than now.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean and smooth, like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist.  Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> After I finish brushing my teeth, I always give my gum a gentle massage with Sonicare. My dentist is always amazed with how young my gum stays. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to take care of not only their teeth, but also their gum.</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush...i have seen a big inprovement in my gums and teeth in general, way better than any other toothbrush i have tried in the past.  i highly recommend the sonicare elite 9000...awesome toothbrush</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Sonicare so far and it really does the job well.  It is pretty effortless to reach everywhere in your mouth and my teeth look whiter from using it for a while now.  I just bought one as a gift for my mom as I think it will make it easier for her at her age.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a tip.  Grab  the same model from your local warehouse shopping club for the deluxe package and you will have an extra handle, an extra brush head and a compact plastic travel case at less than the price this single-brush head model is being offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit, I&#x27;m late in the game in switching to this particular model as there is now the more expensive FlexCare line with a more compact brush head and supposedly more powerful sonic brushing action.  However, the price of the Sonicare is very, very attractive these days especially since they introduced the latest FlexCare line which is supposed to be more elite than this Elite model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been an Oral-B Braun power toothbrush user for years constantly upgrading every two years for their latest toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve generally been happy and I really can&#x27;t complain much as any electric toothbrush is definitely a step up from manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after two solid years of using the Oral-B Triumph model with exclusive use of their FlossAction brush head, I&#x27;ve decided to finally give in to the Philips Sonicare Elite side.  Why did I make the switch?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was drawn into the Sonicare line because I&#x27;ve been using a similar sonic product called Clarisonic for almost a year already.  I was totally impressed with the effective cleaning ability and the smoothness it created on my skin.  Furthermore, I was especially impressed with the 2-week battery life which gave a constant output from full charge to the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPARED TO ORAL-B:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with Oral-B Triumph and their older line of power toothbrush is that at full charge the brush action is at it&#x27;s best power.  After a few days, you can tell how much the battery is getting drained and how weak the spinning action is becoming.  The only solution of course is to keep it charged.  But this is not always possible because I bring it with me when I travel for a few days and it would be cumbersome to bring even the charger when I want to save on space.  Also even at home you would want to make full use of the fact that it&#x27;s a rechargeable toothbrush that will help you charge once and save on electricity by constantly charging it after every use.  Finally, it&#x27;s still best to condition the battery by fully charging and discharging - which the manual suggests users do every once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how Oral-B manages the power in the toothbrush, but from my experience it&#x27;s best to charge it after 3-4 days of use.  Otherwise, you won&#x27;t get the same brushing speed and effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw my dentist recently and he did commend how clean my teeth were.  He even thanked me for making his job easier.  HOWEVER, the problem he had was that he discovered two cavities.  Two!  After years of brushing with a power toothbrush,  I finally get two cavities.  The problem has got to do more with me and my eating habits.  I became more daring and started to eat sticky sweets and neglected brushing until late in the day.  I also decided on my own that the FlossAction brush head of Oral-B helped me actually floss less than twice every day.  So here I am with amalgam in my tooth and a good wake up call.  Still, even with it being my fault I still doubt the effectiveness of the FlossAction now and the ability to actually get in between the teeth in a powerful manner versus just grabbing a floss.  My point is we need to floss anyway as part of the brushing habit, so why will I need to spend extra on the ubber expensive FlossAction brush head, when I need to spend on purchasing a good floss anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENTER SONICARE...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the dental check up and cavity work, I decided to also invest in Sonicare this time.  After 24 hours of initial charge and first month of use, I must say it&#x27;s a different cleaning experience that feels more gentle to my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first few uses made me and my wife wonder if there was any effectiveness to the brushing action.  The feeling left me wanting more power.  Then I remembered that toothbrush is meant to increase in power gradually within the first 14 uses in order to sit in and get used to the sonic brushing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sonic brushing did get stronger and stronger as expected.  At full power it feels like it&#x27;s blasting away dirt particles that may have gotten stuck on the tooth.  Unlike the Oral-B Triumph brush, there is the tingling sensation especially when the plastic part of the brush head comes into contact with your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power is more constant from full charge up to the time it needs charging.  You won&#x27;t notice any waning brushing power unlike with Oral-B Triumph (which really is disappointing to feel as it loses it&#x27;s charge).  You can get two full weeks of use in between charging and this may help condition the battery better as well as save electricity by not having to leave the cord constantly plugged.  (Although as a  convenience and with two included handles, I leave one at the base full charged and alternate them every week.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SONICARE ELITE 9000 HANDLE...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It honestly could be more ergonomic and better shaped.  However, it&#x27;s practically light versus Oral-B Triumph that a kid would be more comfortable in using the Sonicare handle than any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls are simple and the light indicator couldn&#x27;t be more effective.  You have two buttons.  One power the toothbrush and the other to switch between a more gentle cycle.  If you want to program the toothbrush, you simply use those two buttons and watch the led indicator light to tell you what mode you are at based on it&#x27;s position.  Furthermore, this same led light will tell you the charge indicator status as well as how much power is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this light is that it will come on only when it needs to thus helping lengthen in-between charges.  On the other hand Oral-B Triumph has this fun, but ridiculous display which is constantly on even if it isn&#x27;t docked at the base.  24/7 the Triumph handle will display the battery status in monocrhome-hard-to-see graphic form versus a simple bright green led light which comes on to alert you for a few seconds only after every use.  Simple and ingenius.  No need for a constant battery drain which could be used more toward powering the toothbrush head than the display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ELITE BRUSH HEAD...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit it was a little turn off at first to feel it so flimsy on my teeth.  I was used to the Oral-B FlossAction head which was more pronounced and bulky.  However after the Sonicare started to gain full power, I understood why it was designed as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate how gentle yet powerful it can act.  My teeth feel squeaky clean that I&#x27;m only hoping this is what the dentist will also see on my next visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips used to advertise to change brush heads every 6 months.  I was impressed they could design one to last twice as long as regular competitor heads.  And then suddenly with the release of their FlexCare line all packaging including the Elite replacement heads state to replace every 3 months.  So I don&#x27;t know if this was a marketing gimmick, the realization that they need to make more money in half the time, or that people were complaining of bacteria build-up and foul odor from collecting water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HERE&#x27;S THE PROBLEM...(especially why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Oral-B&#x27;s design, Philips  Sonicare design is poor in terms of maintenance.  Water and toothpaste can and will enter the crevices of the head and handle.  The brush and handle don&#x27;t screw in together to form a water proof experience.  (Versus Oral-B&#x27;s simple design of having a metal rod stick out from the body and have the brush head insert into that rotating rod to create the brushing action.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens is that if you don&#x27;t disassemble one from the other, you get build-up of old and stale water, saliva and toothpaste.Yes, it&#x27;s really that gross.  So the solution is to disassemble the head from the body periodically.  My personal solution is to just keep the head and body disassembled and cleaned after every brushing.  It may appear more cumbersome, but it&#x27;s easier to let water run thru both each and every time than to wait for residue to build up and for foul odor to occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the solution was solved with the introduction of their latest FlexCare line which imitates the construction of Oral-B, but still maintaining the sonic ability.  This is great news actually since less maintenance is required.  However, with it&#x27;s current price point I would rather not be the first to invest this time and just wait until even more kinks are sorted out and a better offer is brought to the market.  And as we&#x27;ve seen they always lower the price, introduce an upgraded line and with more accessories.  So until then I will enjoy my Sonicare purchase at an price unimaginable a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INCLUDED ACCESSORIES...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 brush handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 brush heads - 2 full size heads and 1 compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 charging base to share among the two provided handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 small plastic container to hold two brush heads in case you have more than two people sharing the handles.  More importantly, that&#x27;s where I place the brush head everyday to keep them separate from the handle while I air dry both after every brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 compact travel case which is okay for only 1 person since it holds 1 handle and only 1 brush head.  They should be able to provide a travel case that case house 1 handle and 2 brush heads.  Oral-B was smart enough to supply me with this kind of case for my Triumph purchase.  This way me and my wife are able to bring only one travel case.  The Sonicare case doesn&#x27;t allow for another head which makes me end up purchasing yet another compact travel case, thus making the experience not compact anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can see why this toothbrush as a whole with accessories and design flaw of not being waterproof does not earn perfect 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after experiencing the sonic brushing method.  I don&#x27;t think I will end up coming back to Oral-B&#x27;s products with it&#x27;s inefficient power-hungry display and short battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only wait a year later until the FlexCare lowers in price and then I will upgrade within the Philips line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a very worthy and wise purchase especially if you are able to grab one from warehouse clubs (or hopefully here if they decide to match or lower the price even further).form versus a simple bright green led light which comes on to alert you for a few seconds only after every use.  Simple and ingenius.  No need for a constant battery drain which could be used more toward powering the toothbrush head than the display.      THE ELITE BRUSH HEAD...    I must admit it was a little turn off at first to feel it so flimsy on my teeth.  I was used to the Oral-B FlossAction head which was more pronounced and bulky.  However after the Sonicare started to gain full power, I understood why it was designed as such.    I appreciate how gentle yet powerful it can act.

(Versus Oral-B&#x27;s simple design of having a metal rod stick out from the body and have the brush head insert into that rotating rod to create the brushing action.)    What happens is that if you don&#x27;t disassemble one from the other, you get build-up of old and stale water, saliva and toothpaste.  Yes, it&#x27;s really that gross.  So the solution is to disassemble the head from the body periodically.  My personal solution is to just keep the head and body disassembled and cleaned after every brushing.  It may appear more cumbersome, but it&#x27;s easier to let water run thru both each and every time than to wait for residue to build up and for foul odor to occur.    Of course the solution was solved with the introduction of their latest FlexCare line which imitates the construction of Oral-B, but still maintaining the sonic ability.  This is great news actually since less maintenance is required.  However, with it&#x27;s current price point I would rather not be the first to invest this time and just wait until even more kinks are sorted out and a better offer is brought to the market.  And as we&#x27;ve seen they always lower the price, introduce an upgraded line and with more accessories.  So until then I will enjoy my Sonicare purchase at an price unimaginable a year ago.      INCLUDED ACCESSORIES...    2 brush handles.    3 brush heads - 2 full size heads and 1 compact.    1 charging base to share among the two provided handles.    1 small plastic container to hold two brush heads in case you have more than two people sharing the handles.  More importantly, that&#x27;s where I place the brush head everyday to keep them separate from the handle while I air dry both after every brushing.    1 compact travel case which is okay for only 1 person since it holds 1 handle and only 1 brush head.  They should be able to provide a travel case that case house 1 handle and 2 brush heads.   Oral-B was smart enough to supply me with this kind of case for my Triumph purchase.  This way me and my wife are able to bring only one travel case.  The Sonicare case doesn&#x27;t allow for another head which makes me end up purchasing yet another compact travel case, thus making the experience not compact anymore.      CONCLUSION...    So you can see why this toothbrush as a whole with accessories and design flaw of not being waterproof does not earn perfect 5 stars.    However, after experiencing the sonic brushing method.  I don&#x27;t think I will end up coming back to Oral-B&#x27;s products with it&#x27;s inefficient power-hungry display and short battery life.    I can only wait a year later until the FlexCare lowers in price and then I will upgrade within the Philips line.    All in all a very worthy and wise purchase especially if you are able to grab one from warehouse clubs (or hopefully here if they decide to match or lower the price even further).</li>
            <li> Although this is pretty expensive for a toothbrush, it works exactly as described, is easy to use and does a fantastic job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my boyfriend who has a lot bleeding when he brush his teeth. It helps a little bit but not that much and obvious as we expected.</li>
            <li> This product far exceeds expectations.  I have owned a Sonic Care ToothBrush since 2001.  This One is the best yet.</li>
            <li> I have this as a replacement of the recalled 7500 series. Disappointing! The replacement set last no more than 1yr and its damaged again!?! Lousy. Same thing as what the 7500. It simply doesnt charge and when I bring my 7500 to philips center, nothing is wrong with my charger. Its the handle/main part thats having the problem. Replacement and yet, less than 2yrs damaged again. As its a replacement, I cannot get it replaced even though its less than 1yr before it decided to say byebye.    Pro  -Brush stand to air the brush and handle.    -Small convenient charger    -Battery indicator        Cons  -Battery is not lasting!!! Different type of battery compared to Flexcare series.    -Brushing is more rough/strong than Flexcare    -The end of the handle turned black because of mould issues. My country is humid. The material is a good breeding ground for mould pores.     -Same problem with Sonicare products, most toothpastes will cause the white residue on the brush heads and the metal piece where u slot the brushhead into the handle. Almost impossible to be removed.    -The toothbrush or brush head of this and that of 7500 series is far more difficult to be maintained. plus when u removed the brushead, the handle will be like a cup collecting dirts etc. after few mths of usage, it tend to turn black or mouldy and its tough to clean those off even with magic sponge. THe brush head has to be cleaned every wk (kind of according to instructions). You have to push this particular part down and then clean the &#x27;inside&#x27; of the area thats attached to the brush head. Its gross because of the toothpaste residue ... and maybe the saliva etc stuck inside.     -The price of this isnt much different from that of Flexcare. So instead of buying this, pls go n buy Flexcare instead.    I have bought the latest Flexcare series under Sonicare and I will strongly advise people to buy that, if u are going to choose this. This isnt cheap and the battery isnt as good as the latest model. Plus,function wise, its much stronger than the latest series. I do not believe that strong brushing &#x3D; good brushing. Strong brushing can lead to residing gums too. Thats what happened when I brush too hard last time. So yea, pls check out the Flexcare series first.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Works great.</li>
            <li> After 6 month use. broke already. email to the company. no respond. what should I do?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush at least five years. There has been no drop in function in that time, though the rubber power button has disintegrated partially. I have recently switched to a newer Sonicare model, because I prefer a smaller brush head fixture. I also don&#x27;t like the way water accumulates and gets gross under the screw-on brush head.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works well for about a year. Then the rubber over the on/off button tear exposing the machine to water. The machine then dies. Also the brushheads dont last long either. After about a month they go too soft. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> As someone whose gums are prone to recession, the oralb power toothbrush was always too rough and the round heads too large to avoid my gums.  Even using the \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; head caused me problems.  However, my teeth stain easily to coffee, so I like that power toothbrushes minimize stain buildup between dental visits.  I tried this after seeing it at a friend&#x27;s house. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Verdict: the more normal \\&quot;brush\\&quot; shape is more what one is accustomed to with normal toothbrushes.  It still seems a tad over energetic even on the gentle cycle, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any worsening of recession.  It also fights stains in between the teeth better than its oralb counterpart.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Elite was a bit strange at first.  The built in timer helps to insure you to brush your teeth for 2 minutes.  Additionally it increases the brushing for the first 20 uses and this helps you get accustomed to the new sensations.</li>
            <li> Hygienist is now double checking to make sure my current appointment was not made prematurely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had kind of a tooth fetish.  This product really helps to satisfy it.  It works like a dream - sure, more expensive than a regular toothbrush, but you&#x27;ll save much more in the long run.  Teeth are extremely important to overall health, and I never want to have to get dentures.  Using this will help to ensure that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Your teeth get super clean, and the sonicare is really easy to use.  Hardly any effort on your part is required other than moving the brush head around from time to time to new areas.  I would recommend brushing a little longer than the two minutes they recommend, though.</li>
            <li> Love this power toothbrush. The only thing I dislike it runs for over 2 minutes which I believe it overdoes it for cleaning your teeth. Otherwise it cleans your your teeth and gums fllawlessly. Need to change the brush heads at least once a year and sometimes twice.</li>
            <li> A great product. The best way to clean and care for your teeth.</li>
            <li> Let me just say that this brush is one incredible tooth brush.  I actually upgraded from the original Sonicare when they first came out to the most recent Sonicare- the e9500.  I was re-introduced to the Soincare when I went to my new dentist for the first time.  The hygenist asked me what tooth brush I use and I told her the first version of the Sonicare brush.  She then told me that the new Sonicare e9500 is a great brush and that Sonicare upgraded their features on the brush- better design, easier to reach to teeth that are lodged way in the back of your mouth, better bristle action.  I decided to purchase one from her which was at wholesale price PLUS they didn&#x27;t charge me any tax.  Well, I went home charged it for 24 hours and then tried it for the first time.  I really like the 30 second intervals when the brush would beep so that you can move to another quadrant of your mouth.  After my 2 minutes of brushing, my teeth felt like they were when I got them cleaned at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to upgrade your Sonicare, nows the time to do so.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see what justifies the price other than lack of competition - need to get some Chinese manufacturers into this space.</li>
            <li> I prefer this model to the Sonicare Advance.  It has the timer and an indicator for each section. Easy to use and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Tooth brush works great.  Hoever, you need to come up with a better way to store excess electric cord.  I can&#x27;t keep it level, and cleaning ladies always get it tangled.  Also, would be nice to have a one piece head so you down&#x27;t have to take it apart to clean it all the time.  I can live with both of these items, but it would be nicer.</li>
            <li> You expect high performance from the newest generation Sonicare and you get it.  The advanced design makes for easy access to all areas of your teeth and gums.  My dental health is vastly improved becase of this device.  My orthodonist is also impressed with the results I have achieved through use of the Sonicare Elite e9500.</li>
            <li> I bought this Sonicare Elite for my son whom is 19 yrs old and hates the dentist. He really is amazed on how well it really cleans his teeth. I am a Elite usere myself and just love the money it is saving me from having to do additional dental work besides the annual cleanings for me. I recomend this product to everyone.     Thanks Sonicare...   Cynda</li>
            <li> I had used a cybersonic toothbrush for many years, convinced that it was the most powerful and efficient electric toothbrush but this Sonicare Elite is far superior. I have been nothing but pleased at it&#x27;s performance. The brushes work well, although I wish they would last a little longer but first pair lasted almost 3 months. Brushing one&#x27;s teeth is effortless.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  I use this toothbrush in combination with my regular toothbrush, Waterpik, and mouthwash. Makes a big difference in plaque buildup.  This toothbrush takes a week or two to get used to it.  The four timer beeps tracks the time. Programmable. The brush is held at a 45-degree angle and the operator slowly moves the brush over the teeth/gum areas.  It easily reaches all the way to the back teeth and on the underside.  Somehow the unit is recharged with an antenna as there are no visible electrical contacts.  Footprint of the recharging base is very small and it has cord management built into the base.  Somewhat expensive, but the same product is at KMart for a lot more money.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Sonicare e9500. Absolutely love it! Wish I would have boought it years ago. Never had a power toothbrush before. My son uses an Oral B and there is simply no comparison. Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once. But i love it. I&#x27;ve previously used the Braun line of electric brushes, my most expensive one being about $30. But i bought a Braun for my husband last February (the 7400 model about $70), and this one trumps it in terms of the clean feeling i get when I&#x27;m done. My biggest concern when looking at this brand previously was the seemingly enormous size of the brush head. I decided to pull the trigger on this one when i saw the compact head, and the incredible price. Needless to say, I&#x27;m absolutely comfortable with the size of the regular head. So I&#x27;ll be going with those since they are cheaper. The other concern for me with this brand was the seemingly expensive brush heads. However, I&#x27;m now realizing that the brush heads are designed to last 6 months instead of 3. that seals the deal. I think I&#x27;m a convert, and may work on my husband in a few years when his Braun has quit. Even if you&#x27;re loyal to the Braun line, please give the Sonicare a try. I love mine already, and it hasn&#x27;t yet been 24 hours. Of course I&#x27;ll update this review with any negative/positive i find after a few weeks regular use.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I would also like to say that I&#x27;m very pleased with your fast and reliable service.</li>
            <li> This was my first power toothbrush and I am pleasantly surprised how great it is. The feeling after I brushed my teeth is like from dentist. I usualy like to run the cycle twice for the absolutely perfect feeling. I cannot compare it with other brands on the market, but honestly, I do not care, this one is excellent.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Sonicare toothbrush at the suggestion of my dentist.  If only I could have had one of these decades ago!  My teeth feel like they were just cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office every time I brush.  I love the timer because it gets my mouth fabulously clean in just 2 minutes.  I used to brush a lot longer with a manual toothbrush and still didn&#x27;t get my teeth as clean.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  Its like sex for your teeth.  Definitely lives up to what it says.</li>
            <li> I have used this item since May 2007. Its features are very impressive and I am sure you can read other reviews to find out what is good about it. However, the only comment I want to share is that this item has a poor/ flawed design. I recently realized that there can be water retention in between the holder of the toothbrush and the brush head. This has caused formation of fungal dirt and black spots. Therefore, it needs to be cleaned very often in order for it to be clean. I am very unsatisfied with this item as I feel that I should not be cleaning the inside of the holder. I have decided to purchase an ORAL B toothbrush to replace this product.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully in every way, but there is a major design flaw:  The rubber seal over the power button breaks, leading to breakdown and allowing water to enter the unit, where it can&#x27;t be cleaned and bacteria can grow.  Mine lasted about one year.  I recommend the unit only if the manufacturer fixes this problem.</li>
            <li> We have been using the sonicare electric brush for several years, and have much less plaque, etc. The NEW brush that I bought is even better than the old one, which was about 7-8 years old. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this model after the origianl SoniCare I owned. I can reach behind my back molars so easily. The few negative reviews are whiners. The one with the torn on off button must have dug his finger nail into it to tear it the way it was torn in his picture. I&#x27;m very pleased with this model that I use every day now, not like my other original model that was not as comfortable to use. Nice electronic features also.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product recommended by our dentist.  We liked it so much we bought it for each of our 3 adult children</li>
            <li> I had the Phillips Sonicare Elite 5300 for four years.  This was a great upgrade able to use two different head types and different gentle settings for brushing.  Comes with two heads and a carry case.  A great step up for not too much money.</li>
            <li> I owned an original Sonicare, but it died after seven years of faithful service and good dental checkups. Being lazy and a congenital procrastinator, I blew off buying a new one and returned to the manual method of dental hygiene.  It was a big mistake that cost me dearly at the dentist.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If price is the concern preventing you from using Sonicare&#x27;s superior technology then you are being penny wise and pound foolish.  You can either pay now or pay later.  It&#x27;s that simple.</li>
            <li> I really love everything about this toothbrush, except for the fact that the vibrations sometimes irritate and tickle my teeth.  Otherwise, I feel my teeth are cleaner, they are slightly whiter (I have only been using it for 2 months), and my gums get adequately massaged as well.  I would definitely recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my 36 year old son who was having trouble with his gums and teeth. He told me this toothbrush has done a wonderful job on his gums and his teeth look much better. This has not cured his gum disease but he went to the dentist after one month of use and they saw a difference in his gums.</li>
            <li> Comparing this with Oral-B, Sonicare is more powerful, giving you versitility to move around the mouth. As a man and as a regular guy who has been using the regular tooth bush since childhood, I couln&#x27;t help moving any electronic tools up and down and left and right in the mouth. With Oral-B, you can&#x27;t do that, you feel it&#x27;s not right doing it. But Sonicare makes that easy. I love it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a regular tea drinker, my teeth look brigher after using it comparing 5 years using the Oral-B.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier version of this toothbrush, which was satisfactory, but this new one is better. I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> You have not experienced the feeling of clean teeth until you use a sonicare.  Now that I have used it, I will never go back!  It is very portable too!  I have taken it out of town several times.</li>
            <li> Having bought a slew of other electric toothbrushes and being disgusted by the slime that easily accumulates, looking for an easy to hold and effective product that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of crevaces to hold onto bacteria.  This one is the best so far.  Not too many places to hide and build a home.  Really easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.  Holds a charge for 2 weeks (just travelled with it and put it through the paces).  Buttons can flumox as on/off right next to change speed button and sometimes press the wrong one.</li>
            <li> After having some problems with my gums, I decided to invest in this product.  I have been getting better reviews from my dentist, although he does point out that nothing takes the place of flossing (which is a lot less expensive).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I use this toothbrush, my teeth feel extremely clean.  I find myself brushing longer because of the timing aspect.  I actually brush for the full 2 minutes now, which I am sure makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the Sonicare elite 9500 to replace an Advance model I have had for three years. The Elite is definitely an upgrade! I replaced the old brush because the battery died, which is a little disappointing after only three years. When I queried Philips, they said they batteries should last up to five years. oh well, we&#x27;ll see with this one.The brush is great at getting to the spots in the back of your mouth that can be difficult to reach with a conventional brush. This brush also has settings that allow you to \\&quot;ramp up\\&quot; if you are not accustomed to a power brush so your gums and teeth aren&#x27;t sore. It also has a system (which you can also disable if you want) that times brushing in each area of you mouth so you can devote the dentist-recommended attention to each quadrant of your mouth! Overall, since I have begun using Sonicare brushes, my gums are healthier and I have had NO cavities in three years of dental visits! I would recommend this to all!</li>
            <li> This Sonicare is much better than the last model.  This new head design enables me to get to the back teeth so much easier than the last model.  It no longer feels like you are putting the whole machine in your mouth which is better for cleaning as well.  I can already see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth after 3 weeks.  Also, it is pretty cool how it eases you in to using it by keeping the spped slow for your first 10 uses or so and adjusts by itself.  I highly recommend this unit as I think it can really help you maintain the health of you teeth to the highest level.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks and it is clearly a very superior product.  Other dental cleaning systems work well but not nearly as efficiently and quickly as this one.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare e9500 cleans the surface of my teeth better (slicker) than a tooth brush. Only bad thing I noticed is that I have more loose plaque in between my teeth now so I have to floss everytime after I use the sonicare.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sonicare Elite system about two months ago and have been thrilled with it.  Very soon after purchasing it, we went out of town for a week, and even with two people using it, the battery lasted just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the \\&quot;easy start\\&quot; feature, which for the first 14 times the brush is used, runs at a bit gentler speed.  It made getting used to the sonic cleaning a lot easier.  Another feature which I really like is a built-in timer, which \\&quot;beeps\\&quot; every 30 seconds.  The toothbrush is automatically programmed to run for 2 minutes.  The 30 second alerts allow you to ensure that you are brushing all parts of your mouth for the same amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This great system makes excellent home dental care a breeze.  I had another \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush back in the 90s, which long ago found its way to Goodwill.  If you&#x27;ve previously owned an electric toothbrush and been disappointed, I heartily recommend this system and promise you will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> My wife &amp; I used this product for a little less than a month.  After about 7 days, several of my teeth/gums became very sensitive and I stopped using it.  About 20 days later, my wife also started noticing increased sensitivity.  At that point I returned the brush.    I think it&#x27;s probably an effective brush assuming you don&#x27;t have any sensitive gums.    I spoke to my dentist and she said the problem might have been because I used too much pressure.  Regardless I&#x27;m happy just using a regular toothbrush and my gums are doing fine :)  As I said before; it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are very happy with our Sonicare toohbrush.  Its works very well and I think it does clean well between the teeth. The beeps at 30 second intervals is a help to make sure you are brushing all teeth evenly.  It came with two brushes which is good for 1 or 2 people but if buying for family use you need to get extra brushes.  The brushes have a LITTLE colored band on them that is good for identifying your brush but the colors are close, so in dim light or poor eyesight its hard to see which is which. Price is fine on Amazon and as usual shipping was great. We had it in just a few days.  Amazon is definitely the way to go!!!!!</li>
            <li> There was lots of power.  Way more energy in that toothbrush than I had ever expected.  Like it lots!</li>
            <li> The rechargeble battery wore out on my last Sonicare toothbrush after 4 years of daily use.  I have had great checkups with the dentist since I first began using it so replacing it with another sonicare was a no brainer.  The e9500 has a replacable battery so when this one wears out, I can replace just the battery (provided the cost is reasonable).</li>
            <li> Sonicare is the best toothbrush!  I have used it for years - my old one finally wore out and I got a new one.  The quick vibration and the small brush head make for a real clean teeth brushing - gets the gums clean, too.  For the best dental health, this is the best toothbrush.  My dentist is pleased that I use it, too.</li>
            <li> I had to update this product&#x27;s review. I purchased this a while back for myself and used it a few times then I purchased the thinner model. This by far was the best design from Philips. I travel a lot and the design makes it easy to remove the brush head. The slimmer models are damaged easily after repeated removal of the head.</li>
            <li> Wow... I thought I knew how to brush my teeth, but I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ve been doing my entire life, for that was not brushing my teeth as Sonicare does... The first mouth sensation is a bit weird (the brush vibrates in a quite different way than other electrical brushes), but after two or three times you&#x27;re used to it. The clean sensation is something different: it really gives a wonderful fresh and clean feeling to your teeth. It&#x27;s easy to use and clean, so I can recommend it to anyone looking for great clean teeth!</li>
            <li> Sonicare is great - used a &#x27;spin brush&#x27; previously but Sonicare is head &amp; shoulders (or maybe teeth &amp; gums) above. Expect it will be worth the price ... hope it lasts several years (as others indicated is their reviews).  Had a problem (why? - unknown)with initial delivery. UPS said they tried to deliver it but the customer refused delivery - but I DIDN&#x27;T ... UPS never came to the house. SO UPS sent it back. It was a b-day gift and a normal reorder wouldn&#x27;t have gotten to me on time. When I explained the problem and that the initial order was made in plenty of time for 5-9 day delivery, Amazon was very kind and sent another Sonicare Next Day Delivery. EXCELLENT PRODUCT - EXCELLENT SERVICE,</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends this product and I finally bought it.  It is amazing.  It cleans your teeth very effectively, much better than Oral-B product.  I even bought 2nd one for a friend&#x27;s birthday and he also really like it too.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The buttons on these things disintegrate in about 7 months of normal use. You can keep using it until enough water (and mold!) gets inside and shorts out the unit. I have had two replaced, under warranty, for this reason and now they send me a chintzy 710 because they are killing the elite line. I spent $150 on this unit and then they replace it with one that costs $40 less. Why they don&#x27;t offer the top of the line to replace what was there top of the line is beyond me. Actually it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s a good way to get out ahead. Seems cheap to me.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. Great features, such as interval timed brushing and the ability to change the speed. Good investment for the health of your teeth. Plus, it gives you that &#x27;just from the dentist&#x27; clean feeling every time you brush.</li>
            <li> Even so these very popular electric toothbrushes don&#x27;t last more than two-years in my experience, and I have purchased quite a few. The same is true with the heads which are incredibly expensive! Still, if you want to prolong your dental health then Sonicare is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Way to time your products to fail, Phillips. If this were not the case I would have loved to give this toothbrush a five, because it did do an exceptional job. Unfortunately this was my 2nd Sonicare toothbrush in 3 years that failed, and I didn&#x27;t feel like wasting more money on Philips.</li>
            <li> A truly quality product that will save your teeth and your money. Buy it are one of it&#x60;s lesser brothers now.</li>
            <li> When you finish using it, it almost feels like you just got your teeth cleaned at the dentist! The replacement toothbrush heads are a little expensive but a family member has a warehouse shopping membership and I save a little there. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that nasty stuff ends up inside the bottom of the inside part where the brush attaches to the handle. I would totally recommend getting some of The Sonic Seal silicone protectors to prevent saliva, toothpaste and water from building up inside. They work great and are sold here.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare tooth brush for years. As a lazy person it is great because I don&#x27;t have to move my hand up and down. I just move the brush over my teeth and the internal motor pushes the brush up and down.</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush for my partner for his birthday in 2008 and it is still going strong. All it needs is a new toothbrush head every 3 months and it&#x27;s ready to give you the best toothbrush. Your teeth will thank you after you start using this. Sonicare is the BEST electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  works well, nice standard brand name solid toothbrush.  yes, I would buy this again.  no problems</li>
            <li> We got ours free from the dentist years ago and it&#x27;s lasted and lasted and still works fine.&lt;br /&gt;My big complaint is how expensive the brush heads are. To solve this problem I cut off the old brush,&lt;br /&gt;tapered the shaft with a file, got a new regular toothbrush with a thick handle, cut it in the thickest part,&lt;br /&gt;drilled a hole in it then used glue and stuck it onto the Sonicare brush head shaft. That works fine.&lt;br /&gt;[...]/ and if that link doesn&#x27;t come through look on flickr and search for&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare brush how to  for some pictures.</li>
