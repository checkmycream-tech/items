            <li>These are really cute and well made.</li>
            <li>The nice assortment of crystals sparkle and are secure in their settings.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to try them out yet tho</li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re still cute.</li>

            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my nose rings</li>

            <li>the stone size is very cute stone size is just right</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool how many colors there are.</li>
            <li>Kinda cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I thnk that they area fantastic.</li>
            <li>Love totally worth the money</li>
            <li>love them I am wearing the blue one at the moment does not fall and is good with alcohol.</li>
            <li>True to what the description says</li>
            <li>Falls out nose so quick I have lost 2 already</li>
            <li>These arrived WAY before the scheduled delivery date, they&#x27;re really pretty!</li>
            <li>they wwre way to large for my nose they didnt fit</li>
            <li>then yes this is colorful.</li>
            <li>Those are the only ones I have ever used and liked</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even bother, there&#x27;s so many other brands selling better looking nose rings.</li>
            <li>Not as big around as I thought they would be from the looks of the pic but pretty nice in all</li>
            <li>Product seems to be good quality reasonable shipping time how ever wish the description was a little more clear</li>
            <li>And fast shipping!</li>
            <li>So many different colors!</li>
            <li>look exactly like pic.</li>
            <li>Several of the stones fell out in the package and more fell out after I opened it</li>
            <li>so it hurt getting it through the first time,</li>
            <li>what I got exactly was exactly what was described</li>
            <li>Also I knew they would be a bit large but the end of the bone is a 16 gauge.</li>
            <li>There weren&#x27;t as many colors as I expected, but they are good nose rings, they last a really long time compared to any I&#x27;ve bought from a store.</li>
            <li>Came soon than expected, really cute</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and it stays put better than other nose rings I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Price is decent, but damn guys.</li>
            <li>Had to super glue back in.</li>
            <li>Far to large to put in your nose.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>They are true to size or maybe just a tiny bit smaller than 18 gauge.</li>
            <li>Arrived early.</li>
            <li>Because I was previously wearing a 18g hoop, the hole in my nose had to adjust to this smaller size, so like others I also had some problems with the stud coming out easily</li>
            <li>I think for $4 they totally get a high five.</li>
            <li>But 7 of them are yellow, only one clear crystal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bummed cause they have a decent sized ball on the back to keep it from falling out unlike other nose bones.</li>
            <li>however the bar itself was a little large which is a downfall for me because it hurt putting it thru my piercing.</li>
            <li>They are super short and thick though.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any clear ones and there is tons of pink in mine.</li>

            <li> If by colorful they mean 2/3 of the package is all the same blue color</li>
            <li> is a bit longer than my other bone but no problems so far.</li>
            <li> The jewel itself is small, which I really like ..</li>
            <li> The bar is pretty thick</li>
            <li> I recieved them awhile ago, long before the estimated delivery.</li>
            <li> I typically go through nose rings fast because the little jewel falls out, but in the last few weeks none of them have fell out.</li>
            <li> Also if you chose to order be aware that some will come broken.</li>
            <li> I loose my nose jewelry all the time.</li>
            <li> I wish the stone was a little bigger</li>
            <li> ALL THE STUDS WERE LOOSE IN THE BAG NOT EVEN CONNECTED TO THE STUDS!</li>
            <li> The end has yet to jab me in the center of my schnaz.</li>
            <li> Received before expected.</li>
            <li> Not as shiny as i expected, but i got what i payed for.</li>
            <li> It took forever for me to finally get them in the mail, I got all I bought expect they are really small</li>
            <li> These are small enough to to slip out and change with outfits.</li>
            <li> these are at least 16 gauge if not bigger</li>
            <li> what gauge they are but mine were small like standard earring small.</li>
            <li> I just wish it took a little less time to get here</li>
            <li> I wish the post was a little shorter too.</li>
            <li> 2 arrived with the gym missing.</li>
            <li> I gave this item one star because no starr is not available.  </li>
            <li> The crystals are a little small, but still noticeable.</li>
            <li> Way to small</li>
            <li> These are 22G which are small.  </li>
            <li> The nose rings came before time, but the length of the ring was too small.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made, may of the colors are not in the pack and may of the stones are glued in crooked or not at all</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t hardly feel it through the bottom of my piercing.</li>
            <li> I only received 1 out of 20 and received it in a dirty zip lock bag that a phone charger went in.</li>
            <li> Despite all the negative comments I decided to order these.</li>
            <li> To thick for my nose</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> The gems were still intact and none were broken.</li>
            <li> I wound&#x27;t say there was anything wrong with the item itself.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that after wearing one for about 2 weeks, the gem fell off of the setting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like them they actually got to me earlier</li>
            <li> To tiny for my nose can&#x27;t even see it.  Way to small</li>
            <li> they dont go through all the way in your nose , only to the end of the pirecing</li>
            <li> Came soon than expected, really cute</li>
            <li> crappy was way too big for my nose</li>
            <li> Falls out nose so quick I have lost 2 already and it&#x27;s been a week</li>
            <li> I give it a two star rating. While shipping was 10days ahead of schedule I have 22 nose rings. They&#x27;re should of only been twenty not that I mind. But 7 of them are yellow, only one clear crystal. I think you need to learn to count and organize colors better.</li>
            <li> These worked wonderfully for me, after reading the reviews I was a bit worried (I ordered before reading)but I was very pleasantly surprised! All the jems were in the studs, I got the variety of colors shown in the picture and they are the same gauge as the bone I already had in my nose. The post it&#x27;s self is a bit longer than my other bone but no problems so far. Would totally buy again! And fast shipping!</li>
            <li> If by colorful they mean 2/3 of the package is all the same blue color then yes this is colorful. Aside from that, I personally liked the ticker gauge of the stud. It didn&#x27;t bother me going through the hole and it stays put better than other nose rings I&#x27;ve used. I wish the post was a little shorter too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m changing from 4 to 2 stars!&lt;br /&gt;The stones fall out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice color assortment. These are 22G which are small.  Fell out while sleeping. Delivery was earlier than estimated.</li>
            <li> These are really cute and well made. The nice assortment of crystals sparkle and are secure in their settings. They are true to size or maybe just a tiny bit smaller than 18 gauge.</li>
            <li> Thanks. There everything you described.</li>
            <li> Great quality great product for the money..so many colors to chose from very happy I ordered them</li>
            <li> After reading some iffy reviews I decided to take the chance and purchase these. Like some of the reviews stated, some of the gems were glued on crooked and I got a total of 12 different colors with some repeats to make 20 studs in total. The ones that I got were 20 guage. I was disappointed to find that after wearing one for about 2 weeks, the gem fell off of the setting. Because I was previously wearing a 18g hoop, the hole in my nose had to adjust to this smaller size, so like others I also had some problems with the stud coming out easily ( if I would scratch my nose), but after the hole adjusted, I stopped having this problem, so I wound&#x27;t say there was anything wrong with the item itself.</li>
            <li> No bc there so tiny they won&#x27;t stay in</li>
            <li> So many different colors! Love them!</li>
            <li> These fit in my nose perfectly. No irritation. Nice colors.</li>
            <li> the stone size is very cute stone size is just right</li>
            <li> It was short a few nose rings, all reviews are very inconsistent. Price is decent, but damn guys.</li>
            <li> I want what I  order a 20pc nose rings set.I only received 1 out of 20 and received it in a dirty zip lock bag that a phone charger went in. I would like what I order</li>
            <li> Kinda cheaply made. One of the gem stones in the nose ring fell out when I got them. I haven&#x27;t been able to try them out yet tho</li>
            <li> Product seems to be good quality reasonable shipping time how ever wish the description was a little more clear these are at least 16 gauge if not bigger I can&#x27;t get them threw my nose hole almost made two holes in one trying to get it thru so I stoped</li>
            <li> These arrived WAY before the scheduled delivery date, they&#x27;re really pretty! The jewel itself is small, which I really like .. however the bar itself was a little large which is a downfall for me because it hurt putting it thru my piercing. There&#x27;s 5 of the diamond colored jewel, the others are miscellaneous colors. I would recommend this product, but advice to the seller maybe a smaller bar!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool how many colors there are. It&#x27;s good to have options. They are super short and thick though. But they&#x27;re still cute.</li>
            <li> It took forever for me to finally get them in the mail, I got all I bought expect they are really small but it&#x27;s okay because I go through nose rings like.crazy lol</li>
            <li> The nose rings came before time, but the length of the ring was too small. I couldn&#x27;t hardly feel it through the bottom of my piercing.</li>
            <li> look exactly like pic. lots of color variation</li>
            <li> Loved them, THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t even flush with your skin. It looks like there&#x27;s a dent in my nose when I wear these, or a blemish, something along those lines. Don&#x27;t even bother, there&#x27;s so many other brands selling better looking nose rings. I&#x27;m bummed cause they have a decent sized ball on the back to keep it from falling out unlike other nose bones. I&#x27;ll probably use these to sleep and swim in.</li>
            <li> These are not what I thought I was ordering. I thought they were the ones that did the L shape. Those are the only ones I have ever used and liked but I like these even mire. I have not seen any clear ones and there is tons of pink in mine.</li>
            <li> I thnk that they area fantastic. I have no idea what gauge they are but mine were small like standard earring small. All the colors were bring and well attached to the post. The end has yet to jab me in the center of my schnaz. I think for $4 they totally get a high five.</li>
            <li> True to what the description says</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Several of the stones fell out in the package and more fell out after I opened it</li>
            <li> These are very cute! The crystals are a little small, but still noticeable. The bar is pretty thick so it hurt getting it through the first time, but now its just fine!! Very happy with my order!</li>
            <li> There weren&#x27;t as many colors as I expected, but they are good nose rings, they last a really long time compared to any I&#x27;ve bought from a store.</li>
            <li> Love totally worth the money</li>
            <li> The Gage on these are to big so I can&#x27;t use them and the product does not specify Gage details so I assumed it was standard Gage when purchased</li>
            <li> I love ordering off of amazon!</li>
            <li> Very poorly made, may of the colors are not in the pack and may of the stones are glued in crooked or not at all</li>
            <li> Great rings. 2 arrived with the gym missing. Had to super glue back in. Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> Received before expected. To thick for my nose but I should have known that. I&#x27;m satisied with what I paid for though.</li>
            <li> Very cute and very cheap. Arrived early. Love them</li>
            <li> I gave this item one star because no starr is not available.  I ordered this at the start of October and they arrived two weeks before they were estimated to arrive. I can say I was happy with that. But all the colors were not in my package and I received duplicates of all the colors I received. Also I knew they would be a bit large but the end of the bone is a 16 gauge. The bar itself is almost 16  or 18 gauge aswell. Far to large to put in your nose. The gems are also very tiny. Also if you chose to order be aware that some will come broken. Five of mine did.</li>
            <li> I typically go through nose rings fast because the little jewel falls out, but in the last few weeks none of them have fell out. These are small enough to to slip out and change with outfits. Overall I very happy happy with this purchase and the amount of rings for the price.</li>
            <li> Despite all the negative comments I decided to order these. I recieved them awhile ago, long before the estimated delivery. They came perfectly packaged with no damage. The gems were still intact and none were broken. For the price, they are certainly great quality. Thank you!</li>
            <li> These are great. I just wish it took a little less time to get here</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my nose rings it fit my nose perfect.. I wish the stone was a little bigger but you can still see it so I have no complaints what I got exactly was exactly what was described so I&#x27;m beyond happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> love them I am wearing the blue one at the moment does not fall and is good with alcohol.</li>
            <li> They are amazing, I love them!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Not as big around as I thought they would be from the looks of the pic but pretty nice in all</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get here but they are perfect!! Not to big!!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors but they&#x27;re big. When i put em on it hurts.</li>
            <li> they wwre way to large for my nose they didnt fit</li>
            <li> im happy with my nose rings</li>
            <li> Very nice colors are great!</li>
            <li> Good variation of colors and all the correct size</li>
            <li> Not as shiny as i expected, but i got what i payed for.</li>
            <li> I loose my nose jewelry all the time. These are very handy to have.</li>
            <li> ALL THE STUDS WERE LOOSE IN THE BAG NOT EVEN CONNECTED TO THE STUDS!</li>
