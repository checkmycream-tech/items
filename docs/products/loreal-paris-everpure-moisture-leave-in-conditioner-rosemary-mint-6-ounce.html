            <li>This product is light and very effective.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels awesome since I replaced my normal gel/mousse/hairspray with this stuff.</li>
            <li>My hair is normally frizzy, and poofy, unmanagable, but this stuff makes it wonderful!  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me as it is intended for color treated hair, but I am glad I tried it!</li>
            <li>I bought it at a very good sale price, so throwing it in the trash won&#x27;t really hurt my feelings.</li>
            <li>I did not like this product because of the strong smell!</li>
            <li>This is best kind to help your hair not fizz, and so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>I LOVE  this product</li>
            <li>I love this product and take it with me on travel too.</li>
            <li>I tried it many times, and it did not improve my hair at all</li>
            <li>I love, LOVE, LOOOOOOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>, I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the fragrance as does my husband.</li>
            <li>and I love it  </li>
            <li>so it is safe to use for colored hair)</li>
            <li>I just love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love this gel.</li>
            <li>I love the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure products.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a runny gel than a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and although I love Amazon, I need this</li>
            <li>Glad Amazon carries it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>When I travel to more humid climates, I increase the amount quite a bit</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and this is one of the first products I have loved for after searching for many years.  </li>
            <li>Then all I have to do is run my hand through my hair right quick, \\&quot;gel\\&quot; gone, hair looks great.</li>
            <li>This product is the best thing that I have ever found for my curly (dry) hair.  </li>
            <li>To me it is uniquely clean, sophisticated, and gender neutral.</li>
            <li>BUT after one  hour of using this product I had to re-wash my hair because the fragrance was so strong I could no longer stand to smell it.</li>
            <li>After the first use I could feel my hair getting drier, but I thought it was a one - off kind of thing.</li>
            <li>This stuff made my hair so soft and so nice!  </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy to curly hair</li>
            <li>Quick ship!</li>
            <li>Thanks, and God Bless if you are a person, and if  not--even computers need love!</li>
            <li>it smells like cheap men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li>I also use the Sulfate free L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Moisture Conditioner and Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Despite the claim to smell of rosemary and mint, it smells like a cheap men&#x27;s aftershave.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my daughter who also bought this on line from your &amp;#34;store&amp;#34;  as it is no longer available anywhere else.</li>
            <li>sulfate free    </li>
            <li>Silky smooth hair.</li>
            <li>Helps hold the style but my hair moves freely without being too flyaway.</li>
            <li>Someone else commented that it smelled like cheap men&#x27;s aftershave -</li>
            <li>and although it is sulfate free and still dries your hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if it is a good hair moisturizer, because the smell was so repulsing that I had to wash it off at the end of the day after the first use.</li>
            <li>My hair is a rich looking brunette.</li>
            <li>and it gives me this extremely rich looking hair.  </li>
            <li>My absolute favorite wash and go curling solution.</li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t used this product a ton, but from what I have seen so far it works.</li>
            <li>and it looks cool.</li>
            <li>And , of course, it leaves his hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all</li>
            <li>but its a great leave in conditioner for those of us who have dry hair!!</li>
            <li>that description made me laugh, because it&#x27;s soooo true.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>and I love how this product tames my hair, but my husband and I both intensely dislike the fragrance and there is way too much perfume in it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and moisturizer I just love it.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anyone having a different experience to my own.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and rosemary helps fight dandruff (I have found this with the shampoo of the same line work well</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s useful</li>
            <li>I put it on right after I get out of the shower and helps control frizz better than most other things I have used.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice, which is a plus, but I&#x27;m used to thicker, more emollient-feeling leave-in creams and am again not sure if this is doing the trick yet.</li>
            <li>Another tip for achieving great hair - no more bottled synthetic color.  </li>
            <li>If you are a natural girl this is the best conditioner for your curls or at least mine.</li>
            <li>feels like silk, soft, easy to style and gives volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Moisture Repair Leave-in Treatment leaves my curls defined, frizz free, soft to the touch and lasts all day and sometimes two.  </li>
            <li>First of all the texture of the product is slimy and gel-like.</li>
            <li>It seems to curb static and frizzies for the entire day.</li>
            <li>I see no real significant difference, and it&#x27;s kind of sticky.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I can use every day or every other day with absolute amazing results.  </li>
            <li>The positive reviews on this product appear to be from people with curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I first used two pumps on my shoulder length hair but that was waaay too much.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few years and love everything about it!</li>
            <li>Did not expect such great product for a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>You so much.</li>
            <li>but it really does the job.</li>
            <li>I can style my hair while wet after applying the conditioner and the results are most satisfacory.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>you have straight hair, try something else</li>
            <li>hair really changed a lot since I used it</li>
            <li>The smell is rather strong and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>However, I have really fine, long, straight hair which on humid days turns rather frizzy.</li>
            <li>Smooth in the L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Moisture Repair Leave-in Treatment and let your hair air dry.  </li>
            <li>- it works for me, so many expensive products I have tried, who knew this one would be so much better.</li>
            <li>; it is a little strong when you first apply</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feeling very soft and manageable and keeps my colored hair on longer!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for colored hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is really overpowering, I could only use it once or twice before the smell became too much for me.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling natural and soft, not crunchy or stiff as many products do.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, not too heavy for my hair and does the job.</li>
            <li>I bought it recently following a positive review, I was looking for something to replace my pantene product that they don&#x27;t make anymore.</li>
            <li>I bought it recently following a positive review online.</li>
            <li>It gives a little hold to his hair, like a light gel, but doesn&#x27;t make his scalp itch like</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s completely gone before I leave the house (not a trace).</li>
            <li>This leave-in conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Just natural shine.</li>
            <li>, it left it more dried out and crunchy.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact too, that this product does not weigh my hair down and does not leave an oily or wet look which can happen with fine hair.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair with the shampoo, leave the EverPure Conditioner in my hair (do not rinse), then towel dry gently.  </li>
            <li>My husband, who is a musician and has very curly, dyed hair (yes, we&#x27;re weird) may be able to use it, so I&#x27;ll see what he thinks before I trash</li>
            <li>and I thank you very much the above company that sent the above tool  that I could repair what I needed to do as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>time I used one half of a pump and it seemed to be the right amount.  </li>
            <li>Also, be careful not to use too much or it will make your hair look greasy and feel crispy.</li>
            <li>I went as far as trying it for the second time today</li>
            <li>i have natural mixed race curly hair.</li>
            <li>This product has the right combination of moisturizer and treatment without feeling heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight, medium to long, dyed dark brown hair (been dying my hair for years).</li>

            <li> Silky smooth hair.</li>
            <li> Helps hold the style but my hair moves freely without being too flyaway.</li>

            <li> but its a great leave in conditioner for those of us who have dry hair!!</li>
            <li> that description made me laugh, because it&#x27;s soooo true.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> and I love how this product tames my hair, but my husband and I both intensely dislike the fragrance and there is way too much perfume in it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and moisturizer I just love it.</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone having a different experience to my own.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and rosemary helps fight dandruff (I have found this with the shampoo of the same line work well</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useful</li>
            <li> I put it on right after I get out of the shower and helps control frizz better than most other things I have used.</li>
            <li> It does smell nice, which is a plus, but I&#x27;m used to thicker, more emollient-feeling leave-in creams and am again not sure if this is doing the trick yet.</li>
            <li> Another tip for achieving great hair - no more bottled synthetic color.  </li>
            <li> If you are a natural girl this is the best conditioner for your curls or at least mine.</li>
            <li> feels like silk, soft, easy to style and gives volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Moisture Repair Leave-in Treatment leaves my curls defined, frizz free, soft to the touch and lasts all day and sometimes two.  </li>
            <li> First of all the texture of the product is slimy and gel-like.</li>
            <li> It seems to curb static and frizzies for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I see no real significant difference, and it&#x27;s kind of sticky.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I can use every day or every other day with absolute amazing results.  </li>
            <li> The positive reviews on this product appear to be from people with curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I first used two pumps on my shoulder length hair but that was waaay too much.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and love everything about it!</li>
            <li> Did not expect such great product for a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> You so much.</li>
            <li> but it really does the job.</li>
            <li> I can style my hair while wet after applying the conditioner and the results are most satisfacory.</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> you have straight hair, try something else</li>
            <li> hair really changed a lot since I used it</li>
            <li> The smell is rather strong and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> However, I have really fine, long, straight hair which on humid days turns rather frizzy.</li>
            <li> Smooth in the L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Moisture Repair Leave-in Treatment and let your hair air dry.  </li>
            <li> - it works for me, so many expensive products I have tried, who knew this one would be so much better.</li>
            <li> ; it is a little strong when you first apply</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feeling very soft and manageable and keeps my colored hair on longer!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for colored hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is really overpowering, I could only use it once or twice before the smell became too much for me.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling natural and soft, not crunchy or stiff as many products do.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, not too heavy for my hair and does the job.</li>
            <li> I bought it recently following a positive review, I was looking for something to replace my pantene product that they don&#x27;t make anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought it recently following a positive review online.</li>
            <li> It gives a little hold to his hair, like a light gel, but doesn&#x27;t make his scalp itch like</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s completely gone before I leave the house (not a trace).</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Just natural shine.</li>
            <li> , it left it more dried out and crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact too, that this product does not weigh my hair down and does not leave an oily or wet look which can happen with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with the shampoo, leave the EverPure Conditioner in my hair (do not rinse), then towel dry gently.  </li>
            <li> My husband, who is a musician and has very curly, dyed hair (yes, we&#x27;re weird) may be able to use it, so I&#x27;ll see what he thinks before I trash</li>
            <li> and I thank you very much the above company that sent the above tool  that I could repair what I needed to do as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> time I used one half of a pump and it seemed to be the right amount.  </li>
            <li> Also, be careful not to use too much or it will make your hair look greasy and feel crispy.</li>
            <li> I went as far as trying it for the second time today</li>
            <li> i have natural mixed race curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product has the right combination of moisturizer and treatment without feeling heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have very straight, medium to long, dyed dark brown hair (been dying my hair for years).</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way - very nourishing for your hair.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; affect keeps my hair in my place just long enough for it to set.</li>
            <li> Last a Long time for one bottle.</li>
            <li> I live in a generally dry climate, so the one little squirt works well daily.</li>
            <li> I have coarse curly color-treated hair that tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing on my thin, shedding natural hair.</li>
            <li> I do have very curly, thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It is light weight versus heavy and thick</li>
            <li> Buy something a little more expensive (which is what I&#x27;m now going to do - sigh).</li>
            <li> I also tried it both on damp hair and dry.  </li>
            <li> It made the ends dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meant as a leave-in conditioner, but will dry semi-crunchy.</li>
            <li> no greasy feeling that I&#x27;ve had with other products, like Smoothe Operator from Got2B and Frizz Ease.  </li>
            <li> I use this product quite a bit since my hair tends to go extremely frizzy in any type of moisture laden weather</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered and expected !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and am very unhappy</li>
            <li> I have blonde thick hair that I get partial highlights with bleach every few months</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or leave it looking as if it needs a shampoo.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hinder styling by weighing hair down.  </li>
            <li> I think L&#x27;Oreal should tone down the smell.</li>
            <li> so my curls don&#x27;t get weighed down.  </li>
            <li> and I usually let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Other products are just to heavy.  </li>
            <li> This is thinner consistency than I thought it would have, and I can&#x27;t tell if its helping yet after trying it for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sweet or flowery.</li>
            <li> Once dry, my hair was stiffened, with the ends looking like straw, and dull looking.</li>
            <li> It dries a little bit like gel which is why I like it.</li>
            <li> This is all I buy; I wasted a lot of money just trying a lot of junk.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, it was in a plastic zip bag, with goo all around the pump and dried on the tip of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> My hair stayed goopy until it dried.  </li>
            <li> After a few minutes I wanted to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I like this product and  it is not available in the discount stores any longer around here..</li>
            <li> And the reason I bought it was to prevent breakage - it actually has made the breakage even worse.</li>
            <li> Also the smell is so bad and last way to long</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the conditioning properties yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update after a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed to receive it like this, but I contacted Amazon and they refunded my money very</li>
            <li> I have a ridiculously frizzy mop.</li>
            <li> Only problem is almost impossible to find elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> ordered 6 and when the shipment arrived, one of the container lids was broken off and the contents had spilled all over everything.</li>
            <li> I had to throw out the broken one and ended up with just five. :</li>
            <li> I am ordering online, because it has become very difficult to find this in stores lately.  </li>
            <li> Then, it made my hair difficult to comb through after application.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with the Rosemary Mint fragrance.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s almost impossible to find in the store.  </li>
            <li> too bad I had to buy in 2 separate packages to take advantage of its price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores anymore :(  </li>
            <li> and now it is very difficult to find!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because I would be a repeat customer except that I hate how it makes me smell!   </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE  this product but it&#x27;s almost impossible to find in the store.  I was thrilled to see it on Amazon.  I did pay a good 40% more here than I used to at Target but it&#x27;s well worth every penny.  I have blonde thick hair that I get partial highlights with bleach every few months and this stuff keeps my hair shiny, smooth and beautiful.  I get compliments on my hair all the time and this product has ALOT to do with it.  As with any product it&#x27;s not going to work the same on every hair type, but give it a shot and hopefully you will be as thrilled with your results as I am.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and am very unhappy L&#x27;Oreal no longer sells it.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 6 and when the shipment arrived, one of the container lids was broken off and the contents had spilled all over everything. I had to throw out the broken one and ended up with just five. :(&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if Amazon could ship me another one for free???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have coarse curly color-treated hair that tends to be dry.  This is the first product that I can use every day or every other day with absolute amazing results.  Curls are held together and no frizzy fly aways.  I love this product and take it with me on travel too.</li>
            <li> I bought it recently following a positive review, I was looking for something to replace my pantene product that they don&#x27;t make anymore. Ii does not work I tried it many times, and it did not improve my hair at all, it left it more dried out and crunchy.  I also tried it both on damp hair and dry.  Also the smell is so bad and last way to long it smells like cheap men&#x27;s cologne.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love, LOVE, LOOOOOOVE this product.  I also use the Sulfate free L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Moisture Conditioner and Shampoo.  L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Moisture Repair Leave-in Treatment leaves my curls defined, frizz free, soft to the touch and lasts all day and sometimes two.  I wash my hair with the shampoo, leave the EverPure Conditioner in my hair (do not rinse), then towel dry gently.  Smooth in the L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Moisture Repair Leave-in Treatment and let your hair air dry.  I am so thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizzy hair and I love how this product tames my hair, but my husband and I both intensely dislike the fragrance and there is way too much perfume in it. It&#x27;s too bad because I would be a repeat customer except that I hate how it makes me smell!   Also, be careful not to use too much or it will make your hair look greasy and feel crispy.</li>
            <li> I bought it recently following a positive review online. I can&#x27;t really tell if it is a good hair moisturizer, because the smell was so repulsing that I had to wash it off at the end of the day after the first use. I went as far as trying it for the second time today and I just cannot bring myself to use it anymore. Despite the claim to smell of rosemary and mint, it smells like a cheap men&#x27;s aftershave. The smell is rather strong and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> 8/20/13 This was a gift for my daughter who also bought this on line from your &amp;#34;store&amp;#34;  as it is no longer available anywhere else. Thanks, and God Bless if you are a person, and if  not--even computers need love! C. Ryan.</li>
            <li> This product is the best thing that I have ever found for my curly (dry) hair.  It helps my curls stay defined without making it feel crunchy like gel does.  I absolutely love this stuff.  I am ordering online, because it has become very difficult to find this in stores lately.  Wonder why?</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive,\\&quot;Must have.\\&quot;  I can&#x27;t believe how great my hair looks after using this product. I bought this yesterday &amp; used it last night. No sulfates! I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5-stars because it works for me, not everyone likes it&#x27;s affects though. It dries a little bit like gel which is why I like it. I have a ridiculously frizzy mop. I comb my hair with this and the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; affect keeps my hair in my place just long enough for it to set. Then all I have to do is run my hand through my hair right quick, \\&quot;gel\\&quot; gone, hair looks great. My hair looks and feels awesome since I replaced my normal gel/mousse/hairspray with this stuff. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of complaints about the smell but I don&#x27;t mind it; it is a little strong when you first apply but it&#x27;s completely gone before I leave the house (not a trace). This is all I buy; I wasted a lot of money just trying a lot of junk.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my colored hair twice. Returning now.    Pros: sulfate free    Cons: This product works in reverse to what it should be doing: it DRIES hair out instead of putting moisture back in. After the first use I could feel my hair getting drier, but I thought it was a one - off kind of thing. After the next use, my hair dried out so much that it started breaking. It also has a repulsive smell. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My only regret I have is that I didn&#x27;t discover this product much earlier.  I have great hair now and my hair doesn&#x27;t break any more once I use this product. I have beautiful girls with gorgeous hair commenting that they love my hair! Another tip for achieving great hair - no more bottled synthetic color.  My hair is a rich looking brunette. To get this I go to a salon and they mix henna with indigo (both organic wood dyes) and it gives me this extremely rich looking hair.  It&#x27;s amazing, I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy to curly hair and I usually let it air dry. This is the best product I have used to enhance curls and waves and leave it healthy looking, and I have tried many products. It leaves my hair feeling natural and soft, not crunchy or stiff as many products do. It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or leave it looking as if it needs a shampoo. Also, I love the fragrance as does my husband. It reminds me of the rosemary mint Aveda products. It&#x27;s not sweet or flowery. To me it is uniquely clean, sophisticated, and gender neutral. I don&#x27;t color my hair so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me as it is intended for color treated hair, but I am glad I tried it! L&#x27;Oreal, please keep making it!</li>
            <li> Silky smooth hair. Not bad at all</li>
            <li> Received the above item in great conditions, I am very happy and I thank you very much the above company that sent the above tool  that I could repair what I needed to do as soon as possible. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair great body while still feeling light.  Helps hold the style but my hair moves freely without being too flyaway.</li>
            <li> This product is light and very effective.  It doesn&#x27;t hinder styling by weighing hair down.  Highly recommend it for colored hair.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite wash and go curling solution. Only problem is almost impossible to find elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You so much. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!  They don&#x27;t sell it at our local stores anymore but its a great leave in conditioner for those of us who have dry hair!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the similar Loreal product that is in stores for curly hair.  This product has the right combination of moisturizer and treatment without feeling heavy or greasy.  The one in the orange bottle doesn&#x27;t seem as nourishing as this one.</li>
            <li> This is best kind to help your hair not fizz, and so smooth and soft and I love it  smell good</li>
            <li> My mother loves this stuff. She says it makes her hair easier to comb and it also adds shine to it. (by the way she dies her hais so it is safe to use for colored hair)</li>
            <li> This is thinner consistency than I thought it would have, and I can&#x27;t tell if its helping yet after trying it for about a week and a half. It does smell nice, which is a plus, but I&#x27;m used to thicker, more emollient-feeling leave-in creams and am again not sure if this is doing the trick yet.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair so soft and so nice!  My hair is normally frizzy, and poofy, unmanagable, but this stuff makes it wonderful!  I love it!  no greasy feeling that I&#x27;ve had with other products, like Smoothe Operator from Got2B and Frizz Ease.  The smell is also amazing.  Its a really wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I use this product quite a bit since my hair tends to go extremely frizzy in any type of moisture laden weather and I like it. It is easy to use, not too heavy for my hair and does the job.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, it was in a plastic zip bag, with goo all around the pump and dried on the tip of the bottle.  There was no product on the inside of the plastic bag, so it must have happened before it was packaged.  I was really disappointed to receive it like this, but I contacted Amazon and they refunded my money very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is good-although I&#x27;ve only used it twice now.  It&#x27;s very...goopy.  I first used two pumps on my shoulder length hair but that was waaay too much.  My hair stayed goopy until it dried.  It didn&#x27;t feel like it soaked in at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I used one half of a pump and it seemed to be the right amount.  No slimy hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the conditioning properties yet.  I&#x27;ll update after a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and love everything about it! The texture, the smell! and now it is very difficult to find! why I don&#x27;t know but atleast I can find it online!</li>
            <li> I do have very curly, thick, coarse hair. This product does do what it says--soft and controls frizz. BUT after one  hour of using this product I had to re-wash my hair because the fragrance was so strong I could no longer stand to smell it. I think L&#x27;Oreal should tone down the smell. I did not like this product because of the strong smell!</li>
            <li> Very soothing on my thin, shedding natural hair.</li>
            <li> If you are a natural girl this is the best conditioner for your curls or at least mine. It makes my hair so soft and moisturizer I just love it. The consistency is like a gel but it really does the job. I just love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Very good product,wonderful smell, Makes your hair feel wonderful, another product  I would purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it that help my hair wonderful my hair. Coworker like it awesome will buy kind l&#x27;Oreal  shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way - very nourishing for your hair.</li>
            <li> I was dissapointed with this product. It made the ends dry. The product is leave in. After a few minutes I wanted to wash it off.</li>
            <li> Love this gel. It&#x27;s the only thing that works to de-frizz and define my curls.  Other products are just to heavy.  I shampoo with Wen and apply L&#x27;Oreal Everpure Moisture leave-in conditioner while my hair is damp.  The seller also took great care in packaging the product (no leaks).</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t used this product a ton, but from what I have seen so far it works. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> Makes you look like a greased back mobster!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Quick ship!</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I can style my hair while wet after applying the conditioner and the results are most satisfacory.</li>
            <li> bought two of them because they are an add-on item, and let me tell you..those two bottles will LAST. you only need about a quarter sized to run through your hair. after you get outta the shower, brush your hair, then add the leave in conditioner, then brush again. a definite MUST buy!!</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered and expected ! I&#x27;ll be ordering more !</li>
            <li> I like this product and  it is not available in the discount stores any longer around here.. Last a Long time for one bottle. works well</li>
            <li> I love the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure products. I wish the Leave-in Conditioner, Rosemary Mint would not be discontinued!!! Wonder why?</li>
            <li> Love it and so happy I can still purchase it from Amazon thank you so much</li>
            <li> wife thinks it is the best ever thank you bill</li>
            <li> I really love how it works for me! Did not expect such great product for a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels like silk, soft, easy to style and gives volume.&lt;br /&gt;again - it works for me, so many expensive products I have tried, who knew this one would be so much better.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel i will put in my hair. It&#x27;s meant as a leave-in conditioner, but will dry semi-crunchy. Best used as a hair gel. There are no sulfates in this product and is recommended for color-treated or damaged hair.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews on this product appear to be from people with curly or wavy hair. I have very straight, medium to long, dyed dark brown hair (been dying my hair for years). I&#x27;m in my mid forties and I recently have had some breakage start. This product is from L&#x27;Oreal so I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m really disappointed. First of all the texture of the product is slimy and gel-like. Someone else commented that it smelled like cheap men&#x27;s aftershave - it totally DOES - that description made me laugh, because it&#x27;s soooo true. Then, it made my hair difficult to comb through after application. Once dry, my hair was stiffened, with the ends looking like straw, and dull looking. And the reason I bought it was to prevent breakage - it actually has made the breakage even worse. I bought it at a very good sale price, so throwing it in the trash won&#x27;t really hurt my feelings. My husband, who is a musician and has very curly, dyed hair (yes, we&#x27;re weird) may be able to use it, so I&#x27;ll see what he thinks before I trash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have straight hair, try something else - I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll like it. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone having a different experience to my own. Buy something a little more expensive (which is what I&#x27;m now going to do - sigh).</li>
            <li> This is great. I massage it in and crunch my hair and it looks cool. Love it.</li>
            <li> The smell is really overpowering, I could only use it once or twice before the smell became too much for me. It sort of smells like men&#x27;s cologne. In terms of how it works, I didn&#x27;t find that it helped with my hair&#x27;s dryness. It&#x27;s more of a runny gel than a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and although I love Amazon, I need this so often I wish I could find it in stores.  Glad Amazon carries it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair and this is one of the first products I have loved for after searching for many years.  It is light weight versus heavy and thick so my curls don&#x27;t get weighed down.  It has a nice scent and rosemary helps fight dandruff (I have found this with the shampoo of the same line work well and I don&#x27;t have to use harsher products).  I put it on right after I get out of the shower and helps control frizz better than most other things I have used.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores anymore :(  so I&#x27;m glad I found it here!  It makes my hair feeling very soft and manageable and keeps my colored hair on longer!  I&#x27;m just really glad I found it, buying a couple of these!!!  :D</li>
            <li> I love this product. too bad I had to buy in 2 separate packages to take advantage of its price</li>
            <li> Smells good and ok....</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the hope of it helping my hair from tangling throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;After a month of use I see no real significant difference, and it&#x27;s kind of sticky.</li>
            <li> I debated whether to give the product 4 or 5 stars. I am not impressed with the Rosemary Mint fragrance. However, I have really fine, long, straight hair which on humid days turns rather frizzy. I literally only use a squirt about the size of a dime, rub it through my hands and then through my hair. It seems to curb static and frizzies for the entire day. I live in a generally dry climate, so the one little squirt works well daily. When I travel to more humid climates, I increase the amount quite a bit and it does the job. I really like the fact too, that this product does not weigh my hair down and does not leave an oily or wet look which can happen with fine hair. Just natural shine. I wish they would bring in another fragrence!</li>
            <li> i have natural mixed race curly hair. It leaves a sticky gel like residue that flakes out with time. I didn&#x27;t like it but it smell really great. and although it is sulfate free and still dries your hair.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it.  It gives a little hold to his hair, like a light gel, but doesn&#x27;t make his scalp itch like a gel would.  And , of course, it leaves his hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s useful&lt;br /&gt;This one help me a lot&lt;br /&gt;My hair really changed a lot since I used it</li>
