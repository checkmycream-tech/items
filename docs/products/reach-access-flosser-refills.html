            <li>However, when I found the Reach Access Flosser I became a true believer.</li>
            <li>As with the reviews below, I did not receive the full order.  </li>

            <li>Love these, I have big hands and a small mouth</li>
            <li>With regards to the various flavors, I do like the Clean Paste version I&#x27;ve purchased a couple of times, but I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other flavors.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected, same as from drug store.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to get to those tougher back teeth when using the handle, and I don&#x27;t have any problem with the tight spots any longer.  </li>

            <li> My mother in law bought these. She was visiting from England and search everywhere for them. It was perfect and her first experience of Prime!</li>
            <li> WARNING - I received only one packet of refills (&#x3D; 28), not 176 as promised.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and shipped on time.</li>

            <li> Super great - can&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore.</li>

            <li> Best invention for dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I have never been someone who flossed their teeth, even though I know I should have and my dentist and my wife were forever after me to do so. However, when I found the Reach Access Flosser I became a true believer. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I could never get the hang of using standard dental floss. Using the Reach Access simple and easy-to-use handle, along with the individual, disposable flosser refills, allows flossing to become a VERY simple task. With regards to the various flavors, I do like the Clean Paste version I&#x27;ve purchased a couple of times, but I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other flavors. BTW, the bonus flossers you get with the accessory handle are &amp;#34;plain&amp;#34; and have no flavor. I&#x27;m hooked on these things and my dentist and my wife could not be happier. THEY REALLY WORK!!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality and much easier and faster than using floss. I am very happy with the product I received and my teeth and gums are very happy</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these, as I have difficulty flossing between back teeth that are somewhat close together.  I didn&#x27;t think it would make much of a difference, but I was wrong.  It is so much easier to get to those tougher back teeth when using the handle, and I don&#x27;t have any problem with the tight spots any longer.  I wish I had a way to store the loose heads once the package is opened, but other than that, no complaints!  I would definitely recommend this product to others, and this is a great starter kit!</li>
            <li> I received only one pack of refills instead of the 6 pack.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> A must have for your dental needs.  Men should use these as the handle is long enough to reach in the mouth.</li>
            <li> The idea of reusing the handle is the worst I can imagine, you do realize a part of the handle will stick into your mouth and you&#x27;ll have to keep it for next use, do you?&lt;br /&gt;So basically I need to clean the handle after every use, for hygiene reason, really annoying.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed,hard to find here,</li>
            <li> Very helpful, for those with hand problems especially.</li>
            <li> As with the reviews below, I did not receive the full order.  I was missing the Bonus Reach Access Flosser.</li>
            <li> We bought this because it specifically did NOT indicate that the floss had a mint flavor as my wife hates mint. Soon as it arrived and she opened it I could tell something was wrong - and then I smelled the peppermint. There are refills that specifically say MINT but this one didn&#x27;t which is why we bought it. End result - she hates it and wont use it due to the very strong peppermint smell and taste. If you don&#x27;t like mint don&#x27;t but this refill.</li>
            <li> received the product and it works great.</li>
            <li> I had to buy these because I had shoulder and hand surgery. This made is possible to continue flossing daily, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> Love these, I have big hands and a small mouth this is the only way I can reach my back teeth</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t receive full order.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, same as from drug store.</li>
            <li> Cheapest way to go! And now I&#x27;m covered for several weeks.  Love the mint flavor.</li>
            <li> Great, Love it. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The string is very rigid. The handle is nice and lays good in the hand. This is a good product</li>
            <li> Fantastic deal.... If you are still flossing with string and breaking your fingers trying to get to the back teeth... you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing!&lt;br /&gt;The BEST way to floss.... BY FAR!!!  These are hard to find in the stores and when you do... they are expensive.  Can&#x27;t beat this deal or this way of flossing... you&#x27;d be amazed how much crap you get out of your teeth...helps your gums and your Breath!  EASY - PEASY!</li>
            <li> only thing that works on me all the way to the  back without ripping my lips</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting four fingers into my mouth to floss.  So while these cost a little more, they work great for me.</li>
