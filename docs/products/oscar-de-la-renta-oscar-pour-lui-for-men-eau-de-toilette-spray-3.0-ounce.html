            <li> A get smiles all day long.</li>
            <li> At first use though, seemed suspiciously weak.</li>
            <li> Personally this stuff is a headache in a bottle and smells nothing like those other fragrances.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> Top notes are aldehydes, caraway, juniper berries, lavender, galbanum, basil, sage, anise and bergamot; middle notes are cyclamen, carnation, patchouli, cinnamon, vetiver, cedar and geranium; base notes are labdanum, leather, sandalwood, musk and oakmoss.</li>
            <li> This was a &amp;#34;blind buy&amp;#34;  based on reviews from this and other sites.</li>
            <li> In other words, I do not like it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to describe it, but the scent seemed weaker than what I am used to for this cologne which I have been using for over 25 years.</li>
            <li> There was hardly any smell to it.  </li>
            <li> If memory serve it smells a little like stale Azzaro, fermented Boucheron for men or a stale bottle of Charles Jourdan.  </li>

            <li> Received on time with no problems. Great product.</li>

            <li> My dad loves this! Ordered it last minute in a rush! Came super fast on regular shipping! Came packaged great ! Nice and safe! Super happy!</li>
            <li> just wanted my needs at a great price</li>
            <li> I anticipated this being the equal of Oscar De La Renta for men with a difference. It was different, alright! Wow, what a pungent, stifling, chemical gas smell to my nose! I tried it twice before giving it away. So far, no phone calls from the recipient, so I&#x27;m hoping he enjoys it. I&#x27;ve noticed that many others consider it a favorite. To me, it smells like the original Aramis. I would describe these both as smelling like a rusty nail might taste. Not for me!</li>
            <li> Leather fragrance for men which was launched in 1980. Top notes are aldehydes, caraway, juniper berries, lavender, galbanum, basil, sage, anise and bergamot; middle notes are cyclamen, carnation, patchouli, cinnamon, vetiver, cedar and geranium; base notes are labdanum, leather, sandalwood, musk and oakmoss.</li>
            <li> el perfume fue recibido satisfactoriamente sin problema.</li>

            <li> My hubby loves this cologne.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.  I am glad I can still get it as it is not available in most retail stores.</li>
