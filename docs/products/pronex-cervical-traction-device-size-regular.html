            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>At a fraction of the price others charge, this unit served our doctor&#x27;s recommendation in an excellent manner.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Using it twice a day, in the morning before I get up, and in the evening before I go to sleep, my neck muscle spasms have been GREATLY reduced.</li>
            <li>Now I use it on my own at home and save $$$ in PT costs.</li>
            <li>surprisingly effective</li>
            <li>I found it very easy to set up and use, after one trial run.  </li>
            <li>This unit is very comfortable for my patients.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Easy to store and setup.</li>
            <li>The device is easily portable and lightweight.</li>
            <li>Easy to inflate and fit to your neck.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one in 20 years,  Easy to use and a great price at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My chiropractor noticed on my first visit after using it that my neck adjusted much more easily.  </li>
            <li>Using as directed, it helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Delivered as advertised, and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I had purchased it on Amazon, and I was still within the 30-day return window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now if it could only adjust the lower back. :D</li>
            <li>I think it is not the right size.</li>
            <li>I never expected to be able to afford it until I searched out the item name on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was able to use my medical  flexible spending account to pay for it, I just sent a copy of the perscrpition to them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I chose Pronex because I knew I was more likely to use it than an Over-the-door counter-weighted model.  </li>
            <li>Although tube disconnects often from the main piece, but still would recommend!</li>
            <li>First, the price seems high for what you are getting.  </li>
            <li>it really helps</li>
            <li>It seems that much plastic and rubber should cost about $70, tops.  </li>
            <li>I called the manufacturer, thinking they could send a replacement, but they were very unhelpful, and told me I needed to return it to wherever I bought it.  </li>
            <li>This device has really improved my quality of life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well built and works very well.</li>
            <li>After 2 days of neck traction with the Pronex, I have had significant pain relief and overall improvement.</li>
            <li>I ordered a regular size but think I received a Large size one (there is a &amp;#34;L&amp;#34;) on the device.</li>
            <li>I felt like a new woman.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am with my purchase and would highly recommend the Pronex to anyone who suffers with neck pain.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anyone with the same problems or Dowagers hump need to purchase.</li>
            <li>It really provided relief, and I could feel my entire mid and lower back relaxing as well.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Have arthritis in the C5, C6, C7 discs in my neck and work all day typing on a PC.  After an injury that left me unable to type, I went to PT and this traction kit did wonders.  It elongated my neck and after 20 min I felt like a new woman. I never expected to be able to afford it until I searched out the item name on Amazon. Now I use it on my own at home and save $$$ in PT costs.</li>
            <li> Use it twice a day! Great product.  Although tube disconnects often from the main piece, but still would recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my second Pronex - Cervical Device. It seems to me to be too tight compared to my former one. It is harder to regulate for me.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey and the components are now all plastic, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this traction device. It does not put enough pressure down on the shoulders to relieve tension in the neck. I wish I could return it but the packaging said that once you take it out of the plastic you cannot return it. Total rip off and expensive. Waste of hard-earned dollars!</li>
            <li> Pronex does relieve my neck pain (ongoing for almost a year, consulted a neurologist, went to physical therapy).  I use it about 3 x a week. I have no issues with the effectiveness of the device. I was able to use my medical  flexible spending account to pay for it, I just sent a copy of the perscrpition to them.&lt;br /&gt;The hose to inflate the device detached the 2nd time I used it and you can&#x27;t return it because it is medical equipment.</li>
            <li> surprisingly effective</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It was recommended by my PT. I have arthritis in my neck, causing stiffness and pain. Using as directed, it helped tremendously. The product is expensive, but is well constructed, easy to use, and it did the job.</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised, and delivered quickly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have chronic cervical radiculopathy (herniation of cervical discs)and the pain and discomfort has become unbearable! After trying chiropractors, cervical collars, physical therapy, medications and other modalities of pain relief I decided to try traction for my neck. After 2 days of neck traction with the Pronex, I have had significant pain relief and overall improvement. I use the Pronex for 10 minutes twice a day. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am with my purchase and would highly recommend the Pronex to anyone who suffers with neck pain. It is a very costly and expensive item to purchase but rather than go through the hassle of physical therapy and everything again and again, I chose to spend the extra money and try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative point against the Pronex is upon opening it and following directions, it was a little awkward trying to figure out which \\&quot;U\\&quot; shape your head goes in because the device can be positioned 2 different ways and there be a \\&quot;U\\&quot; shape.</li>
            <li> I no longer have the neck issues I had before using the Cervical Traction Device. I use to have constant nagging pains, soreness and stiffness along the neck and shoulder area I no longer have. I started Yogo to help aide with the long term use of my Cervical Traction Device. I highly recommend anyone with the same problems or Dowagers hump need to purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great! This is my second one in 20 years,  Easy to use and a great price at Amazon.  Easy to store and setup.</li>
            <li> ;I am not sure I  know how to use it.  One time I think I might have done something wrong because I didn&#x27;t feel well when I got up  I will take it to the Dr. that told me to get it the next time I have an appointment with him.  Also I would get it stretched  out and thought I have it closed off, and it kept loosing where I had it stopped.</li>
            <li> Not sure what this device is really for, but as a vibrator, it ROCKS. Things had gotten stale in our relationship, but this device saved us. You want headboard-breaking, freaky fun-time? Get this. It&#x27;s like God Himself anointed a tool to explode with pleasure.</li>
            <li> My wife loves her Pronex ... it really helps</li>
            <li> I have stenosis in my cervical spine and traction was recommended by my chiropractor.  I chose Pronex because I knew I was more likely to use it than an Over-the-door counter-weighted model.  I found it very easy to set up and use, after one trial run.  There are YouTube videos to help you get started.  It really provided relief, and I could feel my entire mid and lower back relaxing as well.  My chiropractor noticed on my first visit after using it that my neck adjusted much more easily.  He said \\&quot;What have you been doing?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are two concerns however.  First, the price seems high for what you are getting.  It seems that much plastic and rubber should cost about $70, tops.  The second problem was that after 4 uses, the valve on the bulb used to hand inflate the extender broke.  I called the manufacturer, thinking they could send a replacement, but they were very unhelpful, and told me I needed to return it to wherever I bought it.  Luckily, I had purchased it on Amazon, and I was still within the 30-day return window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I have been without it for a month and intend to repurchase today.  Hopefully, the next one won&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Easy to inflate and fit to your neck.  Small enough to pack up and take on a trip if desired</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had to go to the chiropractor at all for neck related issues since getting the Pronex! Now if it could only adjust the lower back. :D</li>
            <li> This device has really improved my quality of life. Using it twice a day, in the morning before I get up, and in the evening before I go to sleep, my neck muscle spasms have been GREATLY reduced. The device is easily portable and lightweight. Beats weeks of physical therapy.Do not forget to bend your knees, though. It makes a big difference in the spinal alignment.</li>
            <li> At a fraction of the price others charge, this unit served our doctor&#x27;s recommendation in an excellent manner.  It&#x27;s well built and works very well.</li>
            <li> This unit is very comfortable for my patients. It is simple enough to teach them home traction as well. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered a regular size but think I received a Large size one (there is a &amp;#34;L&amp;#34;) on the device. I think it is not the right size.</li>
