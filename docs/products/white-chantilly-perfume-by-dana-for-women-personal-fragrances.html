            <li>Better than I could buy locally!!</li>
            <li>It is a nice light smell that last and last.  </li>
            <li>Came by the first date I could expect it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s a big bottle, because I wear it often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite daily perfume.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been using this perfume for all our married life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only cologne my wife has used for more than 30 years.</li>
            <li>actually received a larger bottle for $34 - Good thing</li>
            <li>I finally just put them aside and bought more at a real store.</li>
            <li>It has a very feminine scent, and seems to last most of the day.</li>
            <li>I had a positive experience ordering online.</li>
            <li>I have been using Chantilly for a long time, my Mother introduced  me to it many years ago.</li>
            <li>keep this large size on line as it cannot been found in stores</li>
            <li>Hope it is never discontinued because it is definitely a Classic!</li>
            <li>I really like the scent &amp; wear it all the time.</li>
            <li>It does not smell as soft and fresh as I remembered it.  </li>
            <li>It is very feminine and I wear it for no one else but myself.  </li>
            <li>My husband does not care much for colognes but this one does not bother him when I use</li>
            <li>and they tell me how much they like it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying Chantilly.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife to give to her mother as a stocking-stuffer for Christmas, so I can&#x27;t really write a review on this product.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t much care for the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you can find it very cheap, and other times they are holding the price way up there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn other, lighter perfumes with a citrus or orange blossom component, but sandalwood is deeper, more intense.  </li>
            <li>Originally I thought I was order a smaller bottle at $20.</li>
            <li>My mother has worn Chantilly perfume for MANY years and has no desire to wear any other brand.</li>
            <li>A very soft gentle scent.  </li>
            <li>I was very scepticle about it initially as this is my first time attempted.</li>
            <li>I wish stores would do a sample spray for customers so new shoppers will know about ChaNTILLY</li>
            <li>It is a powder soft, feminine smelling classic perfume.</li>
            <li>It smells like it&#x27;s very old or wasn&#x27;t stored correctly.  </li>
            <li>This is the first (and last) time I&#x27;ll order it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Not overwhelming like most perfumes of today.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly, there are times especially after the holidays, that it is hard to find because everyone has sold out of their stock.</li>
            <li>but i search all around until i get it and mostly buy at least 2 bottles at a time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since I was a young teenager</li>
            <li>I have used chantilly for yyears, it is not a heavy cologne.</li>
            <li>Different scent and does not last more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>More of an irritant and has NO pleasant fragrance at all.  </li>
            <li>I have used this cologne since an old boyfriend bought it for me back in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I will definitely consider it in the near future.</li>
            <li>sweet, femenine, delicate.</li>

            <li> It does not smell as soft and fresh as I remembered it.  </li>
            <li> It is very feminine and I wear it for no one else but myself.  </li>
            <li> My husband does not care much for colognes but this one does not bother him when I use</li>
            <li> and they tell me how much they like it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for carrying Chantilly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to give to her mother as a stocking-stuffer for Christmas, so I can&#x27;t really write a review on this product.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t much care for the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you can find it very cheap, and other times they are holding the price way up there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn other, lighter perfumes with a citrus or orange blossom component, but sandalwood is deeper, more intense.  </li>
            <li> Originally I thought I was order a smaller bottle at $20.</li>
            <li> My mother has worn Chantilly perfume for MANY years and has no desire to wear any other brand.</li>
            <li> A very soft gentle scent.  </li>
            <li> I was very scepticle about it initially as this is my first time attempted.</li>
            <li> I wish stores would do a sample spray for customers so new shoppers will know about ChaNTILLY</li>
            <li> It is a powder soft, feminine smelling classic perfume.</li>
            <li> It smells like it&#x27;s very old or wasn&#x27;t stored correctly.  </li>
            <li> This is the first (and last) time I&#x27;ll order it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Not overwhelming like most perfumes of today.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly, there are times especially after the holidays, that it is hard to find because everyone has sold out of their stock.</li>
            <li> but i search all around until i get it and mostly buy at least 2 bottles at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was a young teenager</li>
            <li> I have used chantilly for yyears, it is not a heavy cologne.</li>
            <li> Different scent and does not last more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> More of an irritant and has NO pleasant fragrance at all.  </li>
            <li> I have used this cologne since an old boyfriend bought it for me back in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I will definitely consider it in the near future.</li>
            <li> sweet, femenine, delicate.</li>
            <li> and I smell like a dream all day long.</li>
            <li> but I spray some on in the mornings and it has a scent all day long.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the only places (other than on-line) that I can get this product.   </li>
            <li> I can wear expensive, designer scents and rarely does anyone comment, but with Chantilly, both men and women regularly say, &amp;#34;You smell SO good!&amp;#34;  and</li>
            <li> This perfume is getting harder and harder to find on the shelves.</li>
            <li> It arrived sealed as expected.  </li>
            <li> Everything I expected</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of the Chantilly products and like the other two</li>
            <li> I have bought Chantilly by Dana in the past.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find around here</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> it is difficult to find</li>
            <li> Smells like dirty armpits or shoes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this item.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What can I say....my wife has used this for years its her favorite scent. Its a better value through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Introduced in 1941, Chantilly is a non-floral blend that includes sandalwood and orange blossom.  I recently rediscovered this enticing scent and have been fascinated by the scent&#x27;s history. I&#x27;ve worn other, lighter perfumes with a citrus or orange blossom component, but sandalwood is deeper, more intense.  Definitely appeals to my senses.</li>
            <li> I loved this fragrance as a teenager; it was so feminine. I had forgotten about it, but saw it on Amazon and had to buy it to see if I still loved it. A review by a gentleman saying he liked it on his wife gave me reassurance.  I still love it!</li>
            <li> Price very reasonable for size. Better than I could buy locally!!</li>
            <li> Definitely a knock off. Smells like dirty armpits or shoes.</li>
            <li> it has been more than 20 years that i use chantilly and i will keep on using it because it is all i want in a cologne. sweet, femenine, delicate. i just love it. it is difficult to find but i search all around until i get it and mostly buy at least 2 bottles at a time.</li>
            <li> I love Chantilly and have used it for over 40 years.  This is the first (and last) time I&#x27;ll order it from Amazon.  It does not have a good fragrance at all.  It smells like it&#x27;s very old or wasn&#x27;t stored correctly.  More of an irritant and has NO pleasant fragrance at all.  I don&#x27;t know what my options are but if at all possible, I&#x27;d like to return it and get my money back!</li>
            <li> bought for mom\\&quot;s on her birthday, she loves chantilly, could not find this size bottle anywhere, went to amazon and found it and bought it!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, but not please that supplier changed the size &amp; therefore, the price.  Originally I thought I was order a smaller bottle at $20. actually received a larger bottle for $34 - Good thing this is my fragrance of choice. but I don&#x27;t like surprises when they cost more.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful everyday perfume, I have been using it for years.  It came in its original package and in a very timely fashion.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of the Chantilly products and like the other two but this one is really very strong</li>
            <li> I have bought Chantilly by Dana in the past.  I really like the scent &amp; wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> I really like this sent,only wish i liked my wife as much.maby next year ill have someone i love to give it to.</li>
            <li> The scent was good for my wife and therefore, good for me.  Better price than most and better quality than the knock offs.</li>
            <li> I have been using Chantilly fragrance for 60 years -  it&#x27;s the only fragrance I&#x27;ve used extensively since I was a teenager.  It used to be made by Houbigant.  Love everything about it.</li>
            <li> This perfume is getting harder and harder to find on the shelves.Gave it to my Mother in law for Christmas.It&#x27;s one of her favorite perfumes and they have the best price I could find anywhere on this perfume.</li>
            <li> Well worth what I paid for &amp; was packed real good.</li>
            <li> A favorite perfume for my favorite mother.</li>
            <li> Daughter has been looking for this for years and I found it here, she&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this item. I bought two boxes and neither has the right smell for Chantilly Lace. I finally just put them aside and bought more at a real store. I waited too long to ask for a refund, so I probably am not being fair as perhaps they would have given me one? So, just know they may have taken care of me, but the product isn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Chantilly for years, when I can find it in stores, because it has a wonderful scent that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had people give me hugs and ask what \\&quot;soap\\&quot; I used because it was a refreshing and clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not a fragrance where they SMELL you before they SEE you...just wished others would learn that fact, too, with&lt;br /&gt;colognes and perfumes.  Hope it is never discontinued because it is definitely a Classic!</li>
            <li> A very soft gentle scent.  It is the only kind of perfume that My mom can whare. This is one of the only places (other than on-line) that I can get this product.   Highly recamended!!!</li>
            <li> I loved this fragrance as a young teen.  I think that it has changed somewhat.  It does not smell as soft and fresh as I remembered it.  It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I wore this as a girl and although that has been decades ago, Chantilly&#x27;s timeless femininity still resonates. Since I&#x27;m a huge fan of sweet fragrances, this certainly fits that bill. But it also has a hint of spice, so like me, it&#x27;s never TOO sweet. I don&#x27;t wear this when I dress to go out, but rather after a shower when I&#x27;m lounging or working at home. Several well-placed spritzes and I smell like a dream all day long.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Birthday gift for my Mom.  She used to wear this but now can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and always a nicely scented product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spritzed Chantilly on my neck and wrists every morning since 1966--LOVE it! Glad to find the real thing rather than knock offs as I bought once on Ebay and once at Walmart and had to return.</li>
            <li> This is a nice perfume for day time. It is fresh and yet sweet. The spray on helps to use only a bit at once. I recommend it for anyone that enjoys smelling sweet.</li>
            <li> I love this product.I had had some of this perfume before and loved it so I decided to buy some to see if I still loved it and I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was a young teenager and now I&#x27;m a young-ish grandma...I still love Chantilly and will always wear it.  I just hope it will continue to be made!  It is suggested for evening useage but I spray some on in the mornings and it has a scent all day long.  Even by the time I go to bed I can still smell it and the scent changes a bit during the day.  It is very feminine and I wear it for no one else but myself.  My husband does not care much for colognes but this one does not bother him when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I go out in public I have many women ask me what fragrance I use and they tell me how much they like it.  Or I&#x27;ll just be in a store and I will hear &amp;#34;someone smells wonderful!&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> its a good buy and good quality, i  bought it for my sister and she was very pleased with it,</li>
            <li> Perfect fragrance.  It arrived sealed as expected.  Smells wonderful.  Safe to buy from this Seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not personally a fan of Chantilly however my mother in law is.  It&#x27;s hard to find around here so I  was happy to find some on Amazon.  This is a big bottle that will last her quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I love this old classic scent because it reminds me of the wonderful smell of mom and much simpler days gone by!</li>
            <li> Chantilly purfume has been around forever it seems. Amazingly, there are times especially after the holidays, that it is hard to find because everyone has sold out of their stock. Sometimes you can find it very cheap, and other times they are holding the price way up there. I love the scent, and if I happen across it anywhere, I immediately look around for my wife (which is a good thing). The scent of Chantilly makes me think of her. It has a very feminine scent, and seems to last most of the day.</li>
            <li> Just got my Chantilly today. Delivered right to my door. A nice size bottle that does spray. This bottle will last me a awhile. I have been using Chantilly for a long time, my Mother introduced  me to it many years ago. I am very pleased with my purchase, would definately buy again from Amazon. Thanks Amazon for carrying Chantilly.</li>
            <li> This has been my signature perfume for many years now...I can wear expensive, designer scents and rarely does anyone comment, but with Chantilly, both men and women regularly say, &amp;#34;You smell SO good!&amp;#34;  and that&#x27;s sometimes after a full day--so the scent lingers nicely.</li>
            <li> Chantilly is my only fragrance.  Every time I get a hug from someone they tell me how good I smell.  It&#x27;s getting very hard to find.  I wish stores would do a sample spray for customers so new shoppers will know about ChaNTILLY</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming like most perfumes of today.  It is a nice light smell that last and last.  My friends and my husband love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for 8t in stores and could not find.  Service was great.  Came by the first date I could expect it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> My mother has always loved this perfume more than any other and it was her signature fragrance as I grew up. So glad I could find it for her again!</li>
            <li> Chantilly is a wonderful perfume.  I have been wearing it for many years now and continue to love the scent.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this perfume and I always get it for her for Christmas.  This was an awesome price!  Quick shipment and in great condition!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. It is perfect. For many years I wore Chanel No.5 exclusively. I developed an allergy to most scents, but Chantilly is my favorite and has been for many years. No allergies!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to give to her mother as a stocking-stuffer for Christmas, so I can&#x27;t really write a review on this product.  All I can say is that her mother loves this perfume.</li>
            <li> A warm floral, not too sweet.  I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s a big bottle, because I wear it often.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for 65 years.  My favorite of all scents!  Product was delivered in 4 days.  Price was cheaper than retail stores charge, and more fragrance for the money.  Incredible buy.  Happy to have my old friend readily available.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Grandmother for Christmas This was exactly what she wanted and it was a great price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite daily perfume.  The fragrance is not too powerful, but it evokes comments, even from strangers. I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I have worn Chantilly perfumes about forty years and consider it my signature perfume. I have had many compliments over the years on its beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t much care for the fragrance. As this was for my mother and is the only fragrance she likes, it is a wonderful product. Item came as described and quickly.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this perfume for all our married life. Amazon had what she wanted and made my life easy.</li>
            <li> My mother has worn Chantilly perfume for MANY years and has no desire to wear any other brand. This is her only perfume choice at gift time.</li>
            <li> have been using this product for over 30 yrs it is one of my favorites the scent is so soft even my granchildren love the scent keep this large size on line as it cannot been found in stores</li>
            <li> No musk or patullli smell.  It is a powder soft, feminine smelling classic perfume. I simply like the smell of Chantilly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, floral and great for daytime use.  It&#x27;s the only cologne my wife has used for more than 30 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Chantilly since I was 15 and I&#x27;m now 64.  I&#x27;m always complemented when I put it on.  I think perfumes work differently with everyone&#x27;s body chemistry and Chantilly is perfect for me...therefore, I love it.</li>
            <li> Light scent great for any age.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would definitely recommended it to my family and friends about this product. I had a positive experience ordering online. I was very scepticle about it initially as this is my first time attempted. I will definitely consider it in the near future.</li>
            <li> My father has me buy Chantilly for his friend every year for Christmas.  It&#x27;s the only scent she uses, so she loves receiving it every Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne since an old boyfriend bought it for me back in the 70&#x27;s. Love it!</li>
            <li> Everything I expected</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother. This is her favorite perfume.  A great perfume and a great price. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used chantilly for yyears, it is not a heavy cologne.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the same product.  Different scent and does not last more than a few minutes.  Manufacturer changed and so did the quality.</li>
            <li> AS the day progresses, the scent stays mildly on you....never is overpowering at all.  Is pleasant and feminine, and does not remind you of cheap colognes...it is very nice indeed.</li>
