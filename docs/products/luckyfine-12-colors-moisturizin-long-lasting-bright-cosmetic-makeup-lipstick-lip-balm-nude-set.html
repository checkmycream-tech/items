            <li>This lipstick is awesome</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do :D</li>
            <li>Very bright and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Beautifull colors , bright lipsticks!</li>
            <li>Smells good too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Great for the price.</li>
            <li>but I tried one on and it looked great.</li>
            <li>Irdk if that&#x27;s good or what, but she sounded happy when she said it so</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s lots of pinks and they are so bright</li>
            <li>However color is good and does show well.  </li>
            <li>Would make a good gift to a beginner makeup lover or to someone who would like to experiment with color.</li>
            <li>I kind of like it that way.  </li>
            <li>The colors are nice though, all of them.  </li>
            <li>Many nude like and neutral shades.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I would not buy it again, but it was a nice change for how cheap it was.</li>
            <li>but I found them to be nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>There are many pinks as you can see from the photo.</li>
            <li>and now I have more to play with.</li>
            <li>I got the package and it was very light and looked like it was wrapped really quickly.</li>
            <li>its fine for girls ad the price</li>
            <li>This is a good filler by which to save your most expensive and latest lipsticks for good.</li>
            <li>Nice colors mostly more into the pink</li>
            <li>Bright colors and arrived fast enough from China.</li>
            <li>Two pretty reds, a pale coral, a bright orange, some barbie pinks and cool toned pinks and finally a deep rose color.</li>
            <li>If you have dry lips, the color will stick more in the cracks and show them, so you have to have well moisturized lips.  </li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The colors are all very different, but some of them when put on are like neon pink, and some are super light in color.</li>
            <li>Only one coat sticks very well for me.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more like a hard balm as described, so it takes several passes to get it on.  </li>
            <li>Got this as a Sweet 16 gift for my little sister &amp; she said the colors are very vibrant plus really long lasting.</li>
            <li>They come off the lips easily, and you can&#x27;t see any of the colors lighter than the dark pink.</li>
            <li>The Aloe lipsticks from Princessa-something are much nicer and $2 less.</li>

            <li> after having these for several months i have noticed some changes, they became dry and chalk like.  </li>
            <li> I just bought them because I get bored easily with lipsticks</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the formula because a few reviews warned that they were dry</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dry my lips were until I used this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Overall, not an enormous waste of money, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> You can always melt them down, mix &#x27;em and make sheer lip balms.</li>
            <li> All the colors look like chalk when you put them on and half the colors look the same.</li>
            <li> Mostly pink shades.  </li>
            <li> Not very pigmented, had to go over a few times to show up a little bit.</li>
            <li> Less than $1 a piece</li>
            <li> It is thin/semi transparent, so you need a few layers to get the color, and even then it&#x27;s still slightly transparent.  </li>
            <li> Sensible everyday and wearable colors for every complexion.</li>
            <li> that I usually didn&#x27;t wear</li>
            <li> the colors were really not nice.</li>
            <li> She also said the lipstick is thick.</li>
            <li> Broken  lipstick cases.</li>
            <li> so sorry I wasted my money on this crap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really weird.</li>
            <li> Not as pigmented as an expensive lip balm,  but for the price they work well.</li>
            <li> Their all junk, ugly, ugly, ugly is all I can say.</li>
            <li> bad colors</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t horrible but they aren&#x27;t bad either.</li>

            <li> This lipstick is awesome</li>
            <li> Very bright and beautiful. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the price.  It is thin/semi transparent, so you need a few layers to get the color, and even then it&#x27;s still slightly transparent.  However color is good and does show well.  I kind of like it that way.  It isn&#x27;t creamy/soft, it&#x27;s more like a hard balm as described, so it takes several passes to get it on.  If you have dry lips, the color will stick more in the cracks and show them, so you have to have well moisturized lips.  I didn&#x27;t realize how dry my lips were until I used this stuff.  Maybe it will help.  Mostly pink shades.  The colors are nice though, all of them.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> If I could give these so called lipsticks a zero I would have. Their all junk, ugly, ugly, ugly is all I can say. If your five these might be a hit, but not if your a grown women. All the colors look like chalk when you put them on and half the colors look the same. There&#x27;s lots of pinks and they are so bright I don&#x27;t know who would actually wear them out in public. I so sorry I wasted my money on this crap, I guess I&#x27;ll thrown them in the trash.</li>
            <li> Sensible everyday and wearable colors for every complexion. Many nude like and neutral shades. This is a good filler by which to save your most expensive and latest lipsticks for good.</li>
            <li> Got this as a Sweet 16 gift for my little sister &amp; she said the colors are very vibrant plus really long lasting. She also said the lipstick is thick. Irdk if that&#x27;s good or what, but she sounded happy when she said it so, yeah. Haha</li>
            <li> the colors were really not nice. like 80s colors</li>
            <li> At this point i have received the lipsticks but my tracking logs say its still being shipped.  after having these for several months i have noticed some changes, they became dry and chalk like.  moisture- NIL</li>
            <li> I did not like it at all</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Nice colors mostly more into the pink that I usually didn&#x27;t wear but I tried one on and it looked great. Only one coat sticks very well for me. Bright colors and arrived fast enough from China. Less than $1 a piece, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Beautifull colors , bright lipsticks!</li>
            <li> I got the package and it was very light and looked like it was wrapped really quickly. The colors are all very different, but some of them when put on are like neon pink, and some are super light in color. It&#x27;s really weird. I would not buy it again, but it was a nice change for how cheap it was. The Aloe lipsticks from Princessa-something are much nicer and $2 less.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. I mixand match the colors</li>
            <li> Not very pigmented, had to go over a few times to show up a little bit. I got what i paid for.</li>
            <li> its fine for girls ad the price</li>
            <li> Broken  lipstick cases.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the formula because a few reviews warned that they were dry but I found them to be nice and smooth. The two frosty pinks were the same and the two corals with gold flecks were the same. There are many pinks as you can see from the photo. Two pretty reds, a pale coral, a bright orange, some barbie pinks and cool toned pinks and finally a deep rose color. I kept six and passed six to my daughter. They aren&#x27;t horrible but they aren&#x27;t bad either. Would make a good gift to a beginner makeup lover or to someone who would like to experiment with color. I just bought them because I get bored easily with lipsticks and now I have more to play with. You can always melt them down, mix &#x27;em and make sheer lip balms. I think that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do :D</li>
            <li> Only one of the colors goes on well, and it&#x27;s the darkest red one. They come off the lips easily, and you can&#x27;t see any of the colors lighter than the dark pink. Overall, not an enormous waste of money, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like them... bad colors</li>
            <li> Not as pigmented as an expensive lip balm,  but for the price they work well.</li>
