            <li>which is a great feeling!</li>
            <li>and I am quite impressed with the difference it has made to my teeth</li>
            <li>and I am so happy with the results!  </li>
            <li>So removing the head and rinsing it is the best way.  </li>
            <li>also great for kids!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is great too!</li>
            <li>BEST.</li>
            <li>Best tooth brush ever !!</li>
            <li>Perhaps it was the pasty Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste I used with it, but I was not overly impressed at all with this product.</li>

            <li>The toothpaste is not so great.</li>

            <li>I love the spin brush!!</li>
            <li>Really enjoyed the way it made my mouth feel!!  </li>
            <li>Very effective combination.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this spinbrush for a while and for what it is, I find it very effective.  </li>
            <li>The spinbrush was very nice on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste had a very nice flavor.</li>
            <li>The spinning massage is very pleasant and effective.</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>3.The Mint effect was so effective that even when I was done brushing I could still taste it!  </li>
            <li>She was even more happy with the look of her teeth after using both for a week!  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush works great, good bristles even after weeks of use.</li>
            <li>What I write, however, is completely my own opinion!    </li>
            <li>This is 100% of my own opinion!</li>
            <li>Make your SMILE brilliant and try this-you will be so happy you did!</li>
            <li>The batteries were easy to insert and the battery life is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Well made and good shape for holding.  </li>
            <li>I loved the brush head,  </li>
            <li>I am always looking for a good battery powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li>battery life is good too.</li>
            <li>how wise it was for me to make the switch from manual to electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the toothbrush is a good choice.</li>
            <li>I received the spinbrush Truly Radiant free from Smiley 360 and it is the best tooth brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free sample for a survey and it works great!  </li>
            <li>The feel is fairly chintzy.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I felt that the spinning bristles did a good job of also polishing my teeth while cleaning them.</li>
            <li>and i loved it.</li>
            <li>And I realize it is not as thorough as a trip to the dentist, but it is good to be using every day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good entry before plunging and buying yourself an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I  received this product for free to use and review, and in my opinion, this Truly Radiant Spinbrush is the best brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is good at cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>I really loved my Spinbrush Truly Radiant toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I think for the price it would be a good purchase though.</li>
            <li>Truly Radiant™ Toothpaste &amp; Spinbrush seemed like a great combo, but neither is as spectacular as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>absolutely loved the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a good product.  </li>
            <li>the spinbrush works really good</li>
            <li>feel really good about these products.</li>
            <li>I feel like I get a really good cleaning every time I use it.</li>
            <li>loved having this toothbrush!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a good battery charged toothbrush.</li>
            <li>+ years ago, but it uses rechargeable batteries and they no longer hold a good charge.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve all seen the fancy displays of the sonic brushes in our dentist office, but unless I win the lottery there is no way I am ever going to drop that kind of cash to get one.  </li>
            <li>The batteries (Duracell) that came with it just died, so in that regard, this toothbrush gives good bang for its buck.</li>
            <li>This battery operated toothbrush by Arm &amp; Hammer (Spinbrush) cleans your teeth wonderfully with two swiftly rotating brush heads that clean your teeth all around.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I have been extremely impressed by the whitening and how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>It even felt like with that kind of power the Spinbrush moved on its own!  </li>
            <li>However, I have to say I am super impressed.</li>
            <li>I received one of these from Smiley360 for free to review and I am honestly quite happy with it!</li>
            <li>this one is definitly more affordable than others andworks great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I had the opportunity to try this product.</li>
            <li>That said, if power brushes are your bag, I think you&#x27;ll be very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>I feel proud when people compliment me about my teeth saying how healthy they look.</li>
            <li>The best thing is, its kinda fun</li>
            <li>I love my Toothbrush always leaves my teeth feeling great    </li>
            <li>very pleased with the toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Great product love the way it works</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush is works so great.</li>
            <li>but if you just want something effective to throw in your suitcase, this is definitely a good choice.</li>
            <li>The tooth brush works great on my teeth and it really gets them very clean!!!</li>
            <li>I love love this tooth brush, and will never buy anything else!!</li>

            <li>I love this spin brush!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>

            <li>Absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>and I think we need to buy two more!  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll just keep using this one for sure!</li>
            <li>Totally in love with this tooth brush will never use another try!</li>
            <li>Even more so after a week of using this product!  </li>
            <li>It is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and a great one!  </li>
            <li>I would gladly reccomend both to others, because when used together,cavities watch out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my teeth appreciate it!  </li>

            <li>Truly Radiant™ worked much better!  </li>
            <li>absolutely love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste and toothbrush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty great!</li>
            <li>I love it and will not use anything else!</li>
            <li>I thought that would be an easy win for the rechargeables -- that this one made me go through batteries a lot -- but I&#x27;ve used it for 2-3 minutes 2-3 times a day for 3 weeks</li>
            <li>as a bonus the toothpaste has a pleasant and refreshing taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this toothbrush as a free sample to review and I am very pleased!  </li>
            <li>It spun really well and did a very good job of cleaning her teeth and had good power to it.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is a great cheap electric option.</li>
            <li>When you combine the two its amazing.</li>
            <li>toothbrush did an amazing job at cleaning my teeth,</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>For the price (and the fact that you can change the batteries (AA) yourself), this is definitely a great tool to help you achieve a cleaner and healthier mouth!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>You get amazing results</li>
            <li>A free sample was a great way for me to see if a change was needed.</li>
            <li>These are my own opinions..</li>
            <li>Nice spinbrush.</li>

            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.”</li>
            <li>What I liked about the Spinbrush  -------------------------------------  </li>
            <li>Two pieces of information: the brush does not have a plastic cover for head which is nice to have for travels and the brush does work with rechargeable batteries</li>
            <li>design is nice - it doesn’t feel too clunky or oversized in my hand</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those who want an affordable electric toothbrush that does a good job, the SpinBrush is a safe</li>
            <li>I honestly like the toothbrush but not the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I also own a oral-b electric toothbrush.</li>

            <li>I love ❤</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush-</li>
            <li>so I wanted an electric toothbrush that cleans more efficiently than I would by manually brushing and don&#x27;t clutter my sink with cords.  </li>
            <li>But this is so much better.</li>
            <li>I got to try this out as I received it as a free sample and really liked it.  </li>

            <li>received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>Brush is ok.  </li>
            <li>For me, the Sonic Care does a better job of getting in the gum line.</li>
            <li>, the SpinBrush is a safe bet.</li>
            <li>and that might put some users off, but the end result means more to me and I am buying another one of these for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All I can say is I love it</li>
            <li>Better than manual tooth brush, but I think the sonic brush is better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I believe I can feel a better job of cleaning when I use the sonic brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;But as I said, it is better than a manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>A plus is it removes 100% more plaque because its bristles are elongated.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It worked for me. :)</li>

            <li>found the Truly Radiant Toothpaste to be better than the Colgate Whitening I have been using.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would suggest the manufacturer redesign the handle to use a slip resistant material and the switch for better grip as well.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the Crest spinbrush.</li>
            <li>My manual brush does that better since I have more control over it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I think because I tried to press it a bit to reach between teeth more.</li>
            <li>I used it with Arm and hammer truly radiant toothpaste which I LOVE and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>sure if I’ll fall for the consumer gouging.</li>
            <li>but all in all its easy to use and the softness of all the many bristles was nice and easy on my teeth .i</li>

            <li>It does a great job of cleaning your teeth and while I prefer the rechargeable type, this one was powerful enough to get my teeth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>Very powerful for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got it free from Smiley360, but I have since bought more, because it is my new favorite regimen.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in the cleanliness of my teeth, or the amount of time I spend brushing to get them feeling as clean as I like.</li>

            <li>and my teeth still feels smooth and clean..</li>

            <li>The brush head is replaceable with just a quick and easy twist,and so are of course the batteries.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great toothbrush, not as abrasive as other spin brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past...totally saw a significant difference within a week of using it!</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and did an awesome job, even in those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>I really do love this spinbrush very much.</li>
            <li>my own.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush is a great product for those who don&#x27;t want to shell out the big bucks to by a rechargable electric toothbrush but want something more effective than the traditional manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a more thorough cleaning than a manual brush but less of a commitment than an electric brush, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth and used the Spin brush Truly Radiant with the same brand toothpaste and was very impressed with the cleaning power.</li>
            <li>(Every other whiting toothpaste I ever tried never worked as good as this!)    </li>
            <li>It fits in my small hand perfect as well as my mouth.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference in my Oral health since trying this.</li>
            <li>Everyone was excited and wanting to try the products.</li>
            <li>I have used the Spinbrush twice a day for over a month, and the original batteries are still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Plus, after a month of use, the original batteries and head are still good.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I received a full tube of Truly Radiant toothpaste, and a Truly Radiant Spinbrush 100% free.</li>
            <li>Also I already notice a significant difference in whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love the freshness it gives you after brushing from the first time.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure, I was selected to review this product as part of a sampling program, and I did recieve the product for free.  </li>
            <li>So, the feel of using this was familiar to me.  </li>
            <li>However after using the product for just one week there was a significant difference.</li>
            <li>def worth the price!</li>
            <li>By day 5, there was a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I was already a fan of Arm &amp; Hammer Advanced White toothpaste, but I do believe this is even better, which is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have always used a manual toothbrush, so I was excited to try out an electric one.</li>
            <li>Others I have tried were way too powerful and hurt my mouth!</li>
            <li>I have been using it twice a day for over a month with the original batteries in it</li>
            <li>It spins as you brush and my mouth felt so clean after using all three products..  </li>
            <li>it gets my teeth that clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel extremely clean and doesn&#x27;t feel like the enamel was scrubbed off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After just two minutes of brushing, my teeth are literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>The top portion of the brush head rotates while the bottom portion vibrates, providing varying cleaning techniques and ensuring more complete plaque removal.  </li>
            <li>a 2-minute minimum brushing session provides a just-left-the-dentist quality clean.  </li>
            <li>The only problem i could see anyone having is replacing the brush heads, but when you think of the great way this toothbrush works it really is worth it.</li>

            <li>The clean feeling literally lasted for hours.  </li>

            <li>I feel it does a thorough job of getting my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I liked it way better then using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product and the price is right</li>
            <li>the brush head requires me to grip it on the bottom while trying to avoid sqeezing the bristles with my hand as I turn it towards the right to remove it compared to the SC Up&#x27;s easily grip bottom and pull up.    </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for something special, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>, this spinbrush really gets my teeth clean - better than any of the bargain motorized toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve tried in the past!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This is amazing, I will never go back to a manual toothbrush again, why would I when I got such great results with this?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing so far.</li>
            <li>this is a pretty nice toothbrush i really didnt care for electronic toothbrush</li>
            <li>This meant they would send me a package which contained all this...    #1 Full Size Tube of their Truly Radiant Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I love Arm &amp; Hammer products because they are reasonably priced and they work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I still loved the toothpaste &amp; the spinbrush &amp; will likely continue to use them.  </li>
            <li>use along with Arm &amp; Hammer truely radiant toothpaste</li>
            <li>Thanks to Smiley 360, for the free product!  </li>
            <li>Overall a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a good quality product and one that she would recommend, though it may not be all that different, it seems, to some others that are available.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I actually found the head to be a good size.</li>
            <li>I am using it from last three week and the brush head is still really good condition</li>
            <li>My mouth feels super clean after brushing with the Spinbrush.</li>
            <li>It rattles my teeth and makes my top lip/nose tingle from how fast it spins.</li>
            <li>They sent me a full size tooth brush along with a full size toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Spinnbrush is gentle on my gums (wich are rather sensitive) and the bristles are soft,i also like the fact that the brush is not heavy and fits perfectly into my hand.</li>
            <li>My mouth tingled and if I had just come from a cleaning at the dentist, and I really feel that my mouth is in better condition since using this item.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste wasn&#x27;t my favorite flavor, the saltiness of the baking soda came through too much.</li>
            <li>The Spinbrush made my teeth feel super clean.  </li>
            <li>It works very thoroughly and has a lot more power than you would think.  </li>
            <li>This is my true opinion.</li>
            <li>to most dentists and hygienists, there is no way a manual toothbrush can remove as much debris, plaque, and also massage the gums as well as an electric spinbrush.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to keep the brush head moving on the teeth and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure which causes gums to shrink and abrades tooth surfaces.</li>
            <li>Loved brushing my teeth with this and would definitely recommend buying this!  </li>
            <li>Also, the toothbrush head was very bulky and would be much better in my opinion if  </li>
            <li>, it has soft, yet effective bristles and works with the amount of pressure you apply.  </li>
            <li>Using this in conjunction with the Arm &amp; Hammer Radiant Whitening and Strengthening Toothpaste and flossing, has really allowed me to have a greater experience cleaning my mouth twice</li>
            <li>I received a Full Size Tube of their Truly Radiant Toothpaste &amp; the spin toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>But I guess that is not necessarily a bad thing.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying my husband and 11 yr old one because I loved it so much, and they like theirs too!</li>
            <li>I have to be very careful because of the power, the toothpaste has a strong baking soda taste, but it was great for brushing my teeth and leaving them clean and white, Smiley 360 offers great opportunities to receive free products tor try and let consumers know how well it works.</li>
            <li>Got here super fast i love it</li>
            <li>Because of the light consistency of the paste it would easily fly off the tooth brush when switched on or either the force from the  faucet&#x27;s rushing water would knock it clean of the brush and down the drain!  </li>
            <li>but right after brushing my teeth with this brush my teeth did feel smooth like I just got a dentist cleaning.</li>
            <li>and it is still going just as strong as the first day.</li>
            <li>Love the Spinbrush for it&#x27;s ability to clean completely and thoroughly,even after 1 month of use!!</li>
            <li>First time i used it my teeth felt smooth and clean like after you get a cleaning from the dentist</li>
            <li>First time i used it my teeth felt smooth and clean like after you get a cleaning from the dentist</li>
            <li>It really has gotten my teeth looking and feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>It has lasted longer than some of the other brands I have tried and the brisell feel great against my teeth.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, my husband is happily pestering me about getting him a Spinbrush, too.  </li>
            <li>I love this new toothbrush and how it has helped my smile!</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh and clean and my teeth has gotten whiter in 5 days.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few others and quickly tossed them to the side, but this brush is comfortable to use and feels great on my teeth.</li>
            <li>My mouth is so clean and fresh, and my teeth feel stronger.</li>
            <li>Not only did this Spinbrush toothbrush do a better job cleaning, but I felt it was able to reach places/crevices in my teeth</li>
            <li>The only things I didn&#x27;t like were that brush creates a mini racket and the minty flavor which I have come to expect of most toothpastes is more salty with this one, if you can overlook these things this is something can work for you even if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li>It polishes by front teeth and adequately cleans my molars in one pass.</li>
            <li>My 7 yr old loved it soooo much</li>
            <li>The longer bristles get in and give me a really good deep cleaning and the toothpaste keeps my mouth and breath fresh for a god 3-4 hours.  </li>
            <li>leaves my mouth feeling fresh super clean</li>
            <li>After trying this toothbrush for the first time i was so excited on how clean my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li>I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep Clean thru the Vine program...and LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>It is also a more affordable option thzn getting a high end electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It really gets your teeth clean!</li>
            <li>But it really gets teeth clean!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste works very well and leaves my mouth feeling ridiculously clean!</li>
            <li>Not only is it easy to maintain, with heads and batteries cheap and easy to replace, but it also keeps teeth clean and white.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pros are that it leaves my teething feeling very clean and works way better than a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>i am very pleased with it overall.</li>
            <li>I received my toothbrush for free for my review and when I tried it I was pretty amazed.</li>
            <li>Combined with the Arm and Hammer toothpaste, which I also got to try for free, my mouth felt noticeably cleaner after the first use.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the brush feels pretty comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>I love how wonderfully clean it makes my teeth and that it does such an incredible job getting my teeth cleaner than a typical toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So glad that the site Smiley360 choose me to be a part of the NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER Truly Radiant Mission.</li>
            <li>Love the new spinbrush from arm and hammer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m not really made for powered toothbrushes, but my teeth did feel especially clean afterwards</li>
            <li>Enjoy a fresh from the dentist experience thanks to the Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like an electric toothbrush at first, but I really like the way it cleans my teeth, gums and tongue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great at first because it gives an electric toothbrush clean for less...</li>
            <li>This is my first battery operated toothbrush and it blows my manual brush out of the water!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Really gets in between my teeth and cleans!!</li>
            <li>You will notice the same difference I did and you will love the results too!</li>
            <li>Usually I&#x27;m pretty sceptical when it comes to electric tooth brushes, but boy was I mistaken this time!</li>
            <li>Like I just left a dentists office.. or better!  </li>
            <li>It makes my teeth more sensitive and it burn my gums!</li>
            <li>1.It&#x27;s much more powerful than my old Colgate Motion Electric Toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I was amazed about how shinny clean my teeth looked.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a spinbrush &amp; it made my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>The baking soda really makes my teeth feel clean and using the spin brush supports that fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Also the head seems large and doesn&#x27;t fit well between my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I will not post a positive review simply because I got a free sample; I will give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as the more expensive recharging tooth brushes but for the great low price I really liked it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used colgate spinbrushes many times and this one is much better at giving me the clean down to the gums feeling.</li>
            <li>I received the Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush free thanks to Smiley360,and</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush, and even got to try it for free through smiley.</li>
            <li>For the price of this toothbrush it is actually quite amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was really wanting to like this Spinbrush from Arm &amp; Hammer and was grateful to receive it for free from Smily360 in order to create a review about it.</li>
            <li>a nice inexpensive toothbrush, this was my second one like this</li>
            <li>Love the longer bristles which seem to clean teeth better than my previous spinbrush.</li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush were soft but the amount of power the toothbrush had was overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I was a regular toothbrush kind of girl</li>
            <li>Products are definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li>This Spinbrush is the best powered toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever tired.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice angle on the brush head that helps it reach my back teeth without stretching my mouth.  </li>
            <li>It works well, appears to be adequately waterproof (I run it under water a smidge to clean it), and came out of the package ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I received this toothbrush complimentary for testing purposes from Smiley360  http://h5.sml360.com/-/1ktf.  </li>
            <li>but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>product (when used with it&#x27;s toothpaste) promises a brighter smile in just five days.  </li>
            <li>Overall, i think it&#x27;s a nice brush</li>
            <li>I kind of like that its battery operated, last one I owned had a charger</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own: I regularly use Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I like it, but, honestly, tend to use my regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it with the Truly Radiant toothpaste and my mouth feels tingly fresh after brushing.  </li>
            <li>The brush head is nice and big.</li>
            <li>I love  the dual action head brush.</li>
            <li>and I believe my smile is getting whiter</li>
            <li>, I can honestly say that I am hooked and will not be going back to what I used before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After having two babies in two years, I noticed that my teeth are more sensitive now.</li>
            <li>I have a smaller mouth and it was effective while cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li>I found this completely unsatisfactory as it generated a lot more laundry and mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smile member&lt;</li>
            <li>No one thinks flossing is a fun activity but by using this toothbrush, flossing is even faster.  </li>
            <li>Also the spinbrush made my teeth more sensitive</li>
            <li>I must say I really like it, the spin brush is gentle on your teetha nd gums but it gets your teeth super clean!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using both products they left my teeth whiter and feeling very fresh.  </li>
            <li>Powerful cleaning action that leaves your feeling clean and your breath super fresh!</li>
            <li>Other than my own personal preference,  it is a good product.</li>
            <li>I did not expect much of the Spinbrush as I have been using other electric tooth brushes for years and am really happy with their results.</li>
            <li>This brush eliminates flossing if your short on time in the mornings due to it&#x27;s wonderful brushes and the power of the brush.</li>
            <li>I loved how soft the bristles were, yet my teeth felt clean after I brushed.  </li>
            <li>really leaves me with a fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Package claims to deep clean and promises to remove a 100% more plaque...</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the effectiveness of the product and would recommend it to others looking for a simple way to clean their teeth.</li>
            <li>It is powerful, yet gentle, and leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>compared to other battery operated toothbrushes this one ranks about a 4 out of 5 in the how good does it work department.</li>
            <li>I rec&#x27;d this toothbrush from Smiley360 and put it to the test right away.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t imagine how clean</li>
            <li>My Sonicare toothbrush just didn&#x27;t clean the gumline very well.</li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth really well and leaves them shiny and clean.  </li>
            <li>so I really feel like my teeth are as clean as they can be</li>
            <li>Really gets your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>It really gives you a deeper clean than a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li>I really feel like it has made it easier to keep my mouth clean for longer.</li>
            <li>I found this Spinbrush to be easy to handle, powerful and left my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>However, the vibration that the Truly Radiant Spinbrush provides is pleasantly mild, yet powerful enough to make my teeth feel clean and plaque free.  </li>
            <li>I received this spin brush for free to test out and let me just say, WOW!!</li>
            <li>However, this opinion is my own and unaffected by Smiley360 in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush seems to clean about as well as that one, at least as far as i can tell, which is impressive considering how much cheaper it</li>
            <li>So, I have to clean more than the standard three minutes to make sure I do a thorough job.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush that I have, and have used, prior to receiving the Spinbrush is a Sonicare DiamondClean electronic brush that I purchased from Costco.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s better than a manual brush as far as how clean it gets your teeth, but for me it is harder to maneuver in my mouth than even a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Awesome brush really gets to the back of my teeth which I have a hard time doing and always makes my teeth feel squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t huge; it actually fits perfectly fine in my travel toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free product to review, and in my opinion, this is actually a pretty decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is a great little toothbrush and works really well.</li>
            <li>Awesome brush that gentle on gums and tough on plaque.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to clean my teeth very well even though I had recently had a root canal done.  </li>
            <li>The brush is bulkier and louder than the Sonicare, but a decent brush for the price and my teeth felt just as clean.</li>
            <li>Especially if you want something gentle, yet effective.  </li>
            <li>The taste was average and didn&#x27;t give me much of a nice minty cool after feel that I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the sound always drove me crazy but I gave this one a try and was super impressed with the deep clean results!</li>
            <li>So happy that I will be buying this toothpaste and only this toothpaste in the future, despite the fact that I am an avid couponer and ALWAYS buy what&#x27;s on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From the very first use my teeth felt much cleaner than they do after brushing with a manual brush.  </li>
            <li>The cost of this tooth brush is also very reasonable compared to a manual brush..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for about a week and have noticed a brighter smile and some slight whitening, My mouth feels clean and fresh after using it and the toothbrush does an okay job of cleaning between the teeth.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>After using it for about 2 weeks, I can say it&#x27;s a pretty good toothbrush, but it&#x27;s pretty basic as far as these kinds of motorized toothbrushes come.</li>
            <li>Other than the loud noise, it really is a great toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the spinbrush, but it was a little too strong for my sensitive teeth and kind of left my jaw hurting after use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good product if you are on a budget and would like to add a little something to your oral hygiene routine...</li>
            <li>I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep Clean from smiley360 for free to test...</li>
            <li>I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep Clean from smiley360 for free to test...</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this product for free, but would definitely say it&#x27;s worth more</li>
            <li>Truly Radiant™ Deep Clean Battery Toothbrush for free to review for my opinions.</li>
            <li>That toothbrush reached to my back teeth and when I&#x27;m done I feel my mouth completely clean and food free.</li>
            <li>Something I admit I laughed a little at when I first got them.  </li>
            <li>3.The Lower half of the head moves in a fast right to left Motion which did a wonderful job in brushing the side of the rows of teeth which I really can&#x27;t see.  </li>
            <li>at first.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s way better than a regular toothbrush...</li>
            <li>This would be much improved with a push button!</li>
            <li>I would think you could find somewhere besides China to have these manufactured so they would be better quality and last longer.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s way better than a regular toothbrush...</li>
            <li>It really cleans my teeth and gums!</li>
            <li>and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I wish the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; action brush was actually available on Amazon, but I doesn&#x27;t seem to be.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using an electric toothbrush of spinbrush of any type.</li>
            <li>I could see more of the whitening of my teeth on just the third brushing mind</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t noticeable to me on the first day after two brushings.)  </li>
            <li>five days of brushing twice a day my teeth were really Truly Radiant as advertised !</li>
            <li>The first time I used this Truly Radiant Spinbrush, my teeth immediately felt cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li>It actually does a better cleaning than the Oral-B I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Come on now ;)</li>
            <li>My next dental appointment isn&#x27;t until November, so I won&#x27;t have any information on how this affected my dental health until after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information &amp; coupons, click this link:</li>
            <li>I have converted to a much cleaner mouth with the push of a button!</li>
            <li>this was my first one</li>
            <li>I am going to buy these for my whole family!</li>
            <li>I also think that the big head reduced the time you need to brush your teeth as it reaches more teeth at once.</li>
            <li>To begin with, I should say that this is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It was my first electric brush</li>
            <li>(you can find out more by following this link: http://h5.sml360.com/-/1ger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toothbrush did exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I love using this not only for my teeth but massaging my gums.</li>
            <li>She has been the most likely one to use it in her years growing</li>
            <li>(Thanks smiley.360!)</li>
            <li>At first I did not like it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first spinbrush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>was on the fence about this toothbrush for the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>From the first day I used Arm &amp; Hammer(tm)</li>
            <li>many others fromArm &amp; Hammer in the future!</li>
            <li>my own&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I never used spinbrush before and this was my first experience</li>
            <li>I am an avid coffee and tea drinker, and my teeth were proof of that.  </li>
            <li>Everyone in my family wants to know why they didn&#x27;t get one too!</li>
            <li>awesome but ill jist buy rechargable batteries.</li>
            <li>and I immediately noticed whitening on my teeth within the first three days.</li>
            <li>Love it - never going back!  </li>
            <li>I love it &amp; never want to go back to a manual toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I  was hesitant at first because I have never used a spin brush</li>
            <li>I am fortunate to have naturally whiter teeth, but I already notice a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really noisy!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using it.</li>
            <li>but the bristles are kind of too rough for my teeth.</li>
            <li>It was the first battery operated toothbrush I have used</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and will never go back to a manual brush!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Truly Radiant Spinbrush!</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t recall exactly when and what</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I&#x27;m done with the brushing, I think my teeth are pretty clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>since I have mentioned that its top couldn&#x27;t reach the very deep side of my mouth,&lt;br /&gt;I had to try a couple of times for all my deepest teeth, it took a while</li>
            <li>this is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>The head has two sets of independently motorized bristles, radial rotating at the top and axial rotating at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was pleased with both the toothbrush and the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>head size seems smaller than most.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my first experience with a powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a toothbrush that wasn&#x27;t too expensive, and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first experience with Arm &amp; Hammer.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;After brushing teeth at night the next morning</li>
            <li>this is the first spinning brush i have ever used  </li>
            <li>and I really like it!  </li>
            <li>it uses regular batteries (2 AA); they&#x27;re more convenient than needing to keep the rechargables charged.</li>
            <li>: The motor is louder than the Oral B; the brush head seems to buzz more than actually move</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with the Spinbrush.</li>
            <li>I am overall satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>After the first two days I noticed that my teeth felt cleaner after brushing.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried a power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>And that mindset also disturbs me because if everyone takes the same approach, how many of these Spinbrushes are going to end up rotting in landfills?</li>
            <li>Its super soft and is easy on my sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a really good brush at a decent price for brand name...</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this brush for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li>someone making something like this with a USB rechargeable capacity would be cool and eliminate the need for new batteries.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brush for the last month and so far, I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and not rough on my gums.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting anything from an electric brush this cheap, but other than being noisy and using regular batteries, it seems just as good as my Braun rechargeable that cost literally 10x</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not harsh on my teeth but leaves them clean.</li>
            <li>this brush really does magic definitely buying again</li>
            <li>The Truly Radiant Spinbrush is by far my favorite, and the positives far outweigh the negatives.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was expecting a better result with regard to whitening, but didn&#x27;t see much difference compared with what I get from the old-school manual-type toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>A word to the wise though, just be extra careful if you have sensitive gums like I do, you want to clutch the toothbrush just a more gentle than everyone else.</li>
            <li>Not only do my teeth feel super clean, they also appear whiter.  </li>
            <li>Only drawbacks - its kind of loud and sometimes the vibration makes my nose itch.  </li>
            <li>Changing the head is very easy, simply requiring you to twist the head off, pop on a new one, and twist it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I want to say I was very surprised indeed to find that the Arm and Hammer SSinbursh really made my teeth and gums feel clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle as well which the oral-b isn&#x27;t as much.</li>
            <li>I leave the house feeling like I have such a clean mouth!</li>
            <li>It is a deep clean!</li>
            <li>deep clean!</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is that they have a cap for the brush part so when not using it stays clean!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush for people who have a hard time brushing, I swear it does all the work on its own!</li>
            <li>I personally think it tastes very sweet.</li>
            <li>Now the whole family wants one!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more powerful than any other power toothbrush I have used.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed a bit much.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, especially for young kids that may not brush well enough.</li>
            <li>When I started using this, it left my mouth feeling really clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>I have not one bit of irritation on my gums and they are nice and pink as the dentist states they SHOULD be!!</li>
            <li>It is soft, non gritty and rinse very easily.</li>
            <li>I found this brush to be a bit too harsh for my sensitive gums but the toothpaste is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I am very particular in my tooth-brushing habits.</li>
            <li>It was so strong and so thorough I felt as though I had just left the dentist.</li>
            <li>certain respects</li>
            <li>This brush has long bristles and a more powerful action than the Oral B I have been using.</li>
            <li>On the fourth day after the first brushing I was loving my teeth which were so pearly white</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter, shinier, stay smooth longer and my breath stays fresh all day long!</li>
            <li>This one certainly works very well.</li>
            <li>However the Spinbrush really exceeded my expectations and I will certainly continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I already have an electric Oral-B toothbrush that I&#x27;m already spoiled by, but for people that are still brushing their teeth with regular, plain toothbrushes, I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying this as a way to start more effectively cleaning their teeth!  </li>
            <li>She may love these kind, but she can break them in nothing flat usually.  </li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; I have never used a mechanical toothbrush before, so I was a little susceptible about how effective it would be.</li>
            <li>Truly Radiant Deep Clean Battery toothbrush is the first battery-powered toothbrush that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>This spinbrush, while fun to use, did not clean as well as I had hoped and I felt the need to floss much more than with my manual brush.</li>
            <li>still think if you&#x27;re looking for a main toothbrush you might come out better in the long run with a rechargeable</li>
            <li>spinbrush is a great little item to have around, it&#x27;s a basic battery powered, motorized toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have seen such great whitening results in the little time that I have had it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it scrubs as hard as good ol&#x27; elbow grease</li>
            <li>There are no false promises here.</li>
            <li>While this may not be the highest powered, or top-of-the-line brush, I feel like it was a huge step up from a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I really like the Truly Radiant Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I noticed this polished my teeth very well.(I</li>
            <li>so wet hands can keep a better grip of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the Sonic Care.  </li>
            <li>Spinbrush comes courtesy of Arm &amp; Hammer, is reasonably priced at just under $10</li>
            <li>I got this as a free sample, this is a review on the same product listed.</li>
            <li>It is very thorough in it&#x27;s cleaning power.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well.</li>
            <li>and I think I can really feel a difference of how it did when I use it to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>but that isnt unusual for battery powered toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>I dont like to floss every day and this really helps.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s real noisy</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li>I received a free sample from Smiley 360 of Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste and spin brush toothbrush for the purpose of giving my personal opinion.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t buzz too intensely.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated the chance to test this out.</li>
            <li>The name truly radiant really fits this product.</li>
            <li>Gives thorough cleaning and gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have teeth that are very close together</li>
            <li>A battery powered toothbrush with this much power is a steal</li>
            <li>I know that my dentist told me a few years ago to stop using a manual brush and to convert to this brush because it works better and does more in the same amount of time as using a manual brush.</li>
            <li>the bristles hold up really well</li>
            <li>Also, my teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth really well.</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable.</li>
            <li>worsened my sensitivity) to gels which did absolutely nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really had my doubts about it.</li>
            <li>My teeth really felt cleaner</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it works really well.  </li>
            <li>and you are ready</li>
            <li>, I have to twist my hands to reach the very back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Shared the toothbrush and paste with my daughter who is very worried about the health and appearance of her teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is much louder, though.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s a downside, it&#x27;s that the replacement heads cost as much as the brush package itself.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is really noisy, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I really like Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s truly radiant toothpaste</li>
            <li>I got this Spinbrush, as well as a tube of Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste from Smiley 360 for free, in exchange for my use and subsequent review.  </li>
            <li>There is no left over grime and gunk; my teeth are SMOOTH and CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;- Size and weight.</li>
            <li>I have stuck the whole thing under running water.  </li>
            <li>works really well to remove debris from teeth.  </li>
            <li>$ Much much cheaper than the sonic spin brush</li>
            <li>I was a product tester for the Spinbrush and received it for free, but I will definitely be buying one for my husband!</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t feel fast or full-cleaning at any point.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price for an automated toothbrush (without having to spend $50+)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Applies even pressure while brushing and is gentle on gums and teeth&lt;</li>
            <li>a whole lot easier since it does all the scrubbing for</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Helps to whiten teeth and cleans really well.</li>
            <li>I didnt really mind the noise it makes, but that might be a deal breaker for some.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these products, but I cannot.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My teeth were much cleaner after using this spinbrush.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like the Truly Radiant Spinbrush.</li>
            <li>I feel the combination of the toothbrush and toothpaste get my teeth much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I have arthritis and this makes brushing my teeth so much easier.  </li>
            <li>I found the Truly Radiant toothpaste to be much too this and runny.</li>
            <li>submerge whole brush underwater</li>
            <li>thanks to the longer bristles.</li>
            <li>My daughter wants one now.</li>
            <li>really like it.</li>
            <li>They also were much smoother and felt cleaner when I rubbed my tongue against my teeth.</li>
            <li>The head is compact and it can really be comfortably maneuvered into place to get the backs of my teeth and the ones waaaaay in the back.</li>
            <li>The bristles really got between my teeth and along the gum line.  </li>
            <li>My teeth truly felt much cleaner after just one brushing.  </li>
            <li>Very noisy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Spinbrush for about 3 weeks now and am finally ready to give it a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to Smiley360</li>
            <li>I also like that you can replace the head and not have to toss the whole brush.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels much cleaner</li>
            <li>I really like the spinbrush</li>
            <li>It makes to much noise for me and the toothpaste seems to drip alot, making this toothbrush slippery.</li>
            <li>The bristles were fast and cleaned my teeth to perfection.</li>
            <li>I really do like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the arm &amp; hammer truly radiant toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing Spinbrushes for my whole family.</li>
            <li>Massage your gums with the gentle spinning heads.</li>
            <li>I got one each for the whole family.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quality toothbrush at a reasonable price, this is it.</li>
            <li>and I really like it..</li>
            <li>I credit much of this to the grittier consistency of the Truly Radiant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are gentle, yet reaches between my teeth.</li>
            <li>but it really does.  </li>
            <li>The bristles were gentle on my gums and teeth, no need to add pressure.</li>
            <li>I have been using the arm and hammer spin brush for about a month now, and my teet feel so much cleaner then before.</li>
            <li>But for the brand it does very well.</li>
            <li>(Which I liked it&#x27;s shorter round brush head</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t break the bank, so even if you don&#x27;t love it as much as I do, you&#x27;re not going to have a panic attack over the money you spent to try it.</li>
            <li>so its nice to have my white teeth back...</li>
            <li>Truly Radiant™ Deep Clean Battery Toothbrush and a tube of Truly Radiant toothpaste for free in return for my feed back.</li>
            <li>i can tell a real difference when i brush my teeth with this toothbrush compared to many other brands.</li>
            <li>(replacement brush heads are priced similarly at just under $10 for 2 heads), and does an admirable job at keeping my teeth clean while being gentle on my gums.  </li>
            <li>It really does feel like your eethe are getting a deep clean from using this brush.</li>
            <li>Although I wish it was a bit smaller for the size of my teeth, it really does clean well.  </li>
            <li>I also have a permanent retainer on the back of my bottom teeth and it helps clean around it very well too.  </li>
            <li>I feel dentist clean, yet the head is gentle enough my teeth and gums don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush really helped me get my teeth clean, they not only looked cleaner but also felt cleaner.</li>
            <li>I really felt like my teeth were clean after I brushed with my Truly Radiant Spinbrush.  </li>
            <li>Its not weak like some power toothbrushes I have used.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the Spinbrush, I was completely amazed!</li>
            <li>I have used other battery operated toothbrushes before, but this one works so much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I previously had to go through 2 of the same kind from a different brand</li>
            <li>I have many dental issues (genetic) and must be very careful when I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li>it had plenty of bristles to give you a deep and thorough clean.</li>
            <li>I did feel a deep clean feeling after.  </li>
            <li>and it gives you a feeling of a deep clean.</li>
            <li>I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep clean from Smiley 360.</li>
            <li>It  does a deep clean to your teeth.</li>
            <li>It left my teeth feeling clean</li>
            <li>and I always use these types of toothbrushes to feel like I&#x27;m getting that extra clean</li>
            <li>Deep Clean  </li>
            <li>Deep Clean Battery Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li>gives you that deep clean like going to the denist</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think  that it gives your mouth a deep clean.</li>
            <li>Truly Radiant deep clean spinbrush and toothpaste from Smiley360 to review.</li>
            <li>The only time my teeth feel that clean is at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>well and left my teeth feeling clean and sparkling</li>
            <li>This Spin brush Truly Radiant Toothbrush deep clean is a must have.</li>
            <li>Since using this brush (after the first few days), my gums aren&#x27;t bleeding any more and look healthier.  </li>
            <li>and I found it with the Spinbrush Truly Radian Deep Clean Battery toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It left my teeth feeling clean, but not over sensitized.</li>
            <li>It left my teeth squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves work really well; however, the on/off switch quits working very quickly and the only way to turn it on or off is to remove the battery compartment complete.  </li>
            <li>I like the spin action very much, and the longer orange bristles that reach those pesky areas.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very convenient, powerful battery operated toothbrush that I can certainly recommend.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft on my gums but strong enough to get the job done!</li>
            <li>I did not notice a huge difference long term</li>
            <li>This Spinbrush, however, has lightened them significantly, and without any extra pressure applied than normal brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how much cleaner this brush got my teeth!</li>
            <li>and it just makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting a true deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little loud, but cleans nicely.</li>
            <li>I will be buying a new one!</li>
            <li>AND MY TEETH FEEL MUCH CLEANER WITH MY NEW SPIN BRUSH.</li>
            <li>I really like how you can purchase new heads and replace the batteries when needed withhout buying a whole new spinbrush.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush, but I’ll probably just wait for a sale and buy a brand new product.</li>
            <li>(It even has less bulk than the SC Up which felt more like a brick in the hand.)    </li>
            <li>Had one before nad i still use it.. just another one to have two and probably replace older one soon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the regular Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush for several years now and totally love them too.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a super simple thing to do, though.</li>
            <li>and it does a decent job on cleaning my teeth compared to the oral-b.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive the Spinbrush Truly Radiant toothbrush and toothpaste as a mission via smiley 360.  </li>
            <li>The paste foams up well and brush has a decent amount of power.</li>
            <li>I always thought that more expensive was better when it came to my toothbrush of choice.</li>
            <li>My gum health is MUCH better with reference especially above my crown that I&#x27;ve had for several years!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will ever be able to go back to using a regular toothbrush again.</li>
            <li>head is pretty small, however, I felt that its top still couldn&#x27;t reach the very deep side of my mouth where my most inner tooth is located.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really spins and moves, the head&#x27;s aggressive action doesn&#x27;t need much pressure applied.</li>
            <li>--it definitely reaches further and brushes better than I could with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get to sample one</li>
            <li>It works much better than a regular toothbrush, I would buy one in the future.</li>
            <li>I had tried battery toothbrushes before but was never impressed enough to continue, but this toothbrush does a wonderful job cleaning.</li>
            <li>This is my first spinbrush and it is a little strong for me too.</li>
            <li>Truly Radiant Deep Clean Soft Powered Toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>the reason why I deducted one star from the Spinbrush is because it&#x27;s very loud!</li>
            <li>Because I haven&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush in a very long time, this brush seems very powerful to me.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much experience with electric toothbrushes, actually the one I had crapped out right after I bought it, and this toothbrush has turned me into an electric toothbrush person.</li>
            <li>The head of the brush is nice and big, not like these dinky electric toothbrush heads, typical to most of the other brands.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I DO highly recommend you try both the brush &amp; the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>All in all I can highly recommend the Spinbrush from Arm&amp;Hammer</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this toothbrush</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this brush and have since purchased additional brushes for my family.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend using the arm and hammer dental products.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for those who are looking for an affordable toothbrush that produces results.</li>
            <li>The Spinbrush Radiant Deep Clean Manual Toothbrush head has my favorite setup - a round spinning head, along with a wider lower head that is also mechanized, rather than just fixed is engineered to get the most out of your average alkaline AA batteries</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, because of its relatively bulky size, appropriate angles are not always, or at least easily, achievable with the Spinbrush.</li>
            <li>Lucky me the site Smiley360 (Which I just joined a short while ago) choose me to be a part of the NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER Truly Radiant Mission.  </li>
            <li>but it seemed more like a toy with the little power it had.)    </li>
            <li>Its a definite yes and is not expensive like many other brand name  Spin Brush.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush could be a little better and include a tongue scrubber, but the toothpaste is not goopy, if that is a word...</li>
            <li>Truly Radiant Deep Clean Soft Powered Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Team it with Arm and Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste for a complete clean with extra whitening.</li>
            <li>Now if you have had other Spin brushes you will noticed that this one for Arm &amp; Hammer is very powerful and you can really feel it cleaning as you brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>It got my teeth very clean, with half the time it takes for a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone that is looking for a good clean feel to their teeth, but are unable to afford or don&#x27;t want to spend too much money on a different brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not generally a fan of baking soda in my toothpaste, but I honestly didn&#x27;t mind this formula as much as I have with previous formulas.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it provide a deep down clean, but the bristles are nice and soft on my gums.</li>
            <li>One thing that I really dislike about this product is that it&#x27;s really loud.</li>
            <li>I get up early in the morning for work and the whole house knows when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth because they hear the Spinbrush.</li>
            <li>I really truly feel like I just got a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never wanted to invest the money in one of the expensive ones, so trying this one out was great.</li>
            <li>but it surprised me it was amazingly gentle on my teeth</li>
            <li>The top round part of the brush &amp;#34;spins&amp;#34; and the lower bristles vibrate.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it leave my mouth feeling fresh</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel deeply cleaned, and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I am a normal manual toothbrush user.</li>
            <li>Also, I miss my timer to make sure I brush long enough.  </li>
            <li>I use both manual and powered toothbrushes because they seem to get at my teeth in slightly different ways, plus a powered brush is a fun change.</li>
            <li>Although I have enjoyed using the Spinbrush, there are a few things that I would want to change in order to improve upon the product.</li>
            <li>I consider this product a good toothbrush, but not great in comparison to the electric one I have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whenever you are getting tired of using the manual one, this one should be a good choice if you are looking for  alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess the best part of the Truly Radiant variance is that it has little bristles that stick out further in some places on the head that feel like they get in between hard to get places better than the other</li>
            <li>I love this Spinbrush, and it makes it less time to brush and get in between all of my teeth!</li>
            <li>only remedy I found with the test product was to wrap it in a washcloth to keep the surface dry and provide a better grip and reduce switch slip.  </li>
            <li>2.It didn&#x27;t have that strong mint taste that burns like the Big Red Chewing Gum.    </li>
            <li>I switched back to the manual toothbrush and it came right out.  </li>
            <li>I definitely think it reaches far to the back of my teeth and the two different motions makes for an effective brushing.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and gentle enough for sensitive teeth and gums, but the spinning power is strong enough to leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean all over, even the harder to reach spots way in the back.</li>
            <li>The batteries that came with the brush only lasted a week, but I put a couple of rechargeables in it and they&#x27;ve been working fine for several weeks without needing to be charged.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a pretty decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I felt like the bristles wore down kind of fast, but I think that might actually be due to my own brushing technique (brushing too hard).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought and used quite a few of these over the past years and it&#x27;s safe to say I love them.  </li>
            <li>Other than those two drawbacks the spinbrush cleans well and leaves your teeth smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I do not know if it is any louder than other types of electric toothbrushes, but I would prefer a quieter sound.</li>
            <li>the NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER</li>
            <li>But I can live with that.</li>
            <li>Also you can by new brush heads on amazon or at walmart.  </li>
            <li>I tried the samples of Arm and Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste , mouthwash and the new Spin brush.</li>
            <li>This product is a &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; Spinbrush with new bristle design.</li>
            <li>I recieved a tube of NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER™ Truly Radiant™ Toothpaste &amp; The ARM &amp; HAMMER™ Spinbrush</li>
            <li>I am using New Arm &amp; Hammer truly Radiant Toothpaste from about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Smiley360 choose me to be a part of the NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER Truly Radiant Mission.  </li>
            <li>I use manual brushes, so this was new for me.</li>
            <li>At about $4.50 apiece, you can get two for the price of a brand new toothbrush *</li>
            <li>Easy to grip, powerful but not so powerful that it makes it uncomfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li>is very loud</li>
            <li>Very gentle on gums while giving a very solid cleaning to your teeth.  </li>
            <li>However, it also seems very loud, but I do not have another electric brush to compare the noise level to.  </li>
            <li>must have with family members along with the right toothpaste this gets the job done without having to pay all that big money for electric dentist toothspinners this is for adult as well as children</li>
            <li>But I quickly got used to it as my mouth truly felt cleaner after using it the first few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use spinbrushes but as far as spinbrushes go I did like it.</li>
            <li>Hi, I received my spinbrush Truly Radiant toothbrush from Smiley 360 and have enjoyed using it over the past month.  </li>
            <li>after I brushed for the first time I felt the difference between my manual and</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure the end effect is any better, for me anyway.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no louder than my electric razor and the one I have is pretty darn quiet.</li>
            <li>Spinbrush is the first, and only, battery-operated toothbrush I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mind has been completely changed and I will always be using this spinbrush!</li>
            <li>and I was devastated to have to return to my old brushing methods!  </li>
            <li>I used this daily for the first week</li>
            <li>This is a solid toothbrush and, for me, my first electric version.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it could be slightly more powerful.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been eyeing other toothbrushes like the Spinbrush and was excited to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when I received this one to try I fell in love and realized I was missing out all these years!</li>
            <li>but I do actually believe that the bigger head makes it easier to clean your teeth</li>
            <li>My teeth felt so clean afterwards that I doubt I&#x27;d go back to a regular brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would still recommend buying it, however I would suggest using it a couple times a week as a deep clean and a regular brush the rest of the time.</li>
            <li>I feel as though my teeth are not only getting clean, but polished all at the same time.  </li>
            <li>This one will help perfect your smile and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well as some other electronic toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>They have completely reformulated it; between using the new toothpaste and the extra scrubbing from the battery operated toothbrush, my teeth have never felt so clean outside of a dental cleaning!</li>
            <li>Having a significant amount of experience with product testing I have spent the last month trying each product with my regular product, i.e. regular toothbrush with the toothpaste, and regular tooth paste with the toothbrush to come up with the best possible determination possible with a single subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only concerns were the softness of the bristles (I prefer &#x27;firm&#x27; toothbrushes), and the battery life, although I am not ready to put all blame for battery life on the brush, itself, until I replace the batteries that came with the brush, with my own fresh set.</li>
            <li>and so far this new one works like a champ.</li>
            <li>2.The Upper half of the head which moves in a fast circular motion made it easy to get any food out of my crowns in just one pass  </li>
            <li>My only issue with this brush is that it seems to be pretty loud.</li>
            <li>things I liked about this were the results, the color of the brush (pink!), and the fact that you don&#x27;t accidentally shut it off while brushing like other electronic tooth brushes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>the battery seem to keep going strong i have been using the spin brush for few weeks</li>
            <li>It actually seemed to really get into those hard to reach places, leaving my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This is an okay electric toothbrush for its price, but compared to the Oral-B Triumph I am used to, it is a really big let down.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how this brush made my teeth feel very clean and how it got into the little gaps in my teeth!  </li>
            <li>of my thoughts on the Spinbrush are positive, such as how the brush was made</li>
            <li>The bottom half goes back and forth and the top circle rotates clockwise/</li>
            <li>(I was so sure of this I ate a bag of hard crunchy pretzels which most people would agree they were past crispy and more on the hard as a rock side. )    </li>
            <li>so it is gentle enough for sensitive gums!</li>
            <li>The head is a little hard, but otherwise great.</li>
            <li>After the first couple of uses, my gums did bleed a little, but that was probably because they are not used to such a deep clean and probably needed it!</li>
            <li>It was a bit odd at first because I automatically wanted to move the brush back and forth like a manual brush but that passed quickly.</li>
            <li>The bristles on this are not too hard and with the spinning action, I felt that it did a much better job cleaning my teeth than a manual toothbrush did.  </li>
            <li>While it has the great ability to brush in all the hard to reach places, I found that it was quite messy while doing it.</li>
            <li>Really does give your teeth a complete and overall cleaning</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and I thought that was going to be an issue</li>
            <li>my 2 year old uses this and loves it</li>
            <li>I always get the soft bristles because that&#x27;s what the dentist recommends.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really loud.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and non-abrasive.</li>
            <li>I have an electric powered brush and tried this one to see how it would compare and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>It does not  irritate my sensitive teeth pressure-wise</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s loud</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the freshness my mouth felt after using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling really</li>
            <li>It annoys my family when I use it and sounds quite loud to me.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive teeth and have struggled with cavities and abscess for years.</li>
            <li>So far it has been performing well.</li>
            <li>I like the dual action head.  </li>
            <li>, it is horribly loud...</li>
            <li>And I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>and I guess it no longer spins fast enough for her.  </li>
            <li>so I ended up pulling my old fashioned manual toothbrush to ensure</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The only negative is it&#x27;s kind of loud.</li>
            <li>really like the Spinbrush and will continue to use it inthe future!</li>
            <li>but my teeth were so sensitive afterwards</li>
            <li>I can actually feel the rotating head REALLY cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>This really does work, I had yellowish stained teeth and now they are white again!</li>
            <li>So when I tried this it really was different from what I am used to.</li>
            <li>The downside is it is loud and having to twist off the tips when you need to rinse off the bristles after brushing</li>
            <li>The spinning action makes this almost the equivalent of getting a professional cleaning in a dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Its got soft bristles and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Compared to that, this toothbrush was loud and bulky.</li>
            <li>I have stayed away from electric toothbrushes because I have sensitive teeth and was worried about the pain.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Is a bit loud</li>
            <li>The only problems I had was the taste took about two times to get used to, but now I really like it.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised by the power of this brush.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is 9 years old and loves using it</li>
            <li>(I have young children and multi task a lot )</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and this never once made them bleed</li>
            <li>Simply take it out of the package, power it on, and it is ready for use.  </li>
            <li>For one, I find the toothbrush to be loud.</li>
            <li>The bristles are way too soft and they do not get in between the teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter, cleaner, and left with an overall fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I mean HUGE!</li>
            <li>Yes, the initial brush is close to $8 (at Wal-Mart at least) and the set of 2 replacement heads is the same price, but it is worth the money and really saves more in the long run for your wallet.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so much cleaner than it has with any other toothpast, and my teeth are so much whiter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, I received the following products, an ARM &amp; HAMMER Spinbrush Truly Radiant Deep Clean Battery Toothbrush and tube of Truly Radiant toothpaste, for the purpose of the following review I will provide.  </li>
            <li>It works really well and keeps my mouth feeling really clean without brushing so hard that I lose my enamel.</li>
            <li>The round top portion glides easily around and behind my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li>Not sure if all electric toothbrushes sound this loud</li>
            <li>The brush itself has soft bristles so that wasn&#x27;t different from my normal brush.</li>
            <li>For years, I have wanted one of those super expensive, fancy, electronic toothbrushes, but instead I simply buy the more affordable battery-powered toothbrushes sold in department stores.  </li>
            <li>I have steadily cut back on the &amp;#34;pea&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I feel like I can really get down to my gums clean and the very back teeth especially!  </li>
            <li>Even the grime that never comes off the back of my front bottom teeth, no matter how long I brush with a manual toothbrush, was totally gone and my teeth were left squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li>The brush head is small enough that I can reach every corner of my mouth and the bristles seem to clean everything very well.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well, maybe not as well as say the sonic or other high end brands.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Compared to manual brushing,the dual action brush head made it easier to get in between teeth and hard to reach back teeth for better cleaning</li>
            <li>I got to try this Spin Brush out for free for product review along with the Tooth past</li>
            <li>, I feel clean mouth in very less time.</li>
            <li>I found that the battery lasted for longer than other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past (which was nice).</li>
            <li>I just found it very hard to make sure that every one of my teeth were cleaned completely.</li>
            <li>The brush is too large to brush gums effectively without cutting.  </li>
            <li>That said this less expensive and would be a good alternative for someone not wanting to pay a lot for a tooth brush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s phenomenal for reaching and deep cleaning hard to reach areas like the backs of your molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush really does a deep clean, without having to worry that I&#x27;m brushing too hard, or not reaching the hard-to-reach spots.</li>
            <li>pack of two Spinbrush replacement heads cost about the same as a brand new Spinbrush.&lt;br /&gt;*No built in timer for the recommended two minutes of tooth</li>
            <li>: I recently received a new toothpaste and toothbrush to try, compliments of Smily360, for this review.</li>
            <li>The batteries last pretty long and are changeable.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have much of a gag reflex when brushing towards the back as when I brushed with the C Motion/SC Up.    </li>
            <li>and I definitely feel like it helped get my teeth much cleaner than a regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li>It really gets around the back teeth where a regular brush always misses.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are soft enough for my sensitive gums&lt;br /&gt;Price</li>
            <li>definitely saw whiter, brighter teeth after about 10 days of regular use so this combo really does work!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the Spinbrush I can easily fix a slow battery.  </li>
            <li>A quick few words about the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>On one hand, its efficient, affordable, and has replaceable heads, however on the other hand, its loud (too loud if using the master bath in the morning and trying not to wake your partner on the other side of the door), and I actually found it to be too strong.  </li>
            <li>The design has a major flaw.</li>
            <li>Instead of a slide on and off it would be a major improvement to have just an on/off push button.</li>
            <li>I will start by saying this is my first spin brush (I have had other electric tooth brushes but never a spin brush).</li>
            <li>I have trouble with my hands cramping and with a traditional toothbrush, sometimes I just can&#x27;t get my teeth as clean as they should be.</li>
            <li>Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a decently priced motorized toothbrush that does a standard job, this one will work for you.</li>
            <li>The only thing I did not like was that it is loud and a little too powerful.</li>
            <li>4.The long orange bristles that stick out of the brush head&#x27;s Upper and Lower part make it so even one as myself who doesn&#x27;t really like flossing for the time it should take   can still reach all those slits inbetween the teeth which food always seems to find a way in.(Not to mention these prevent any paste from sinking into your bristles.)    </li>
            <li>Weird, I know, but overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;On&#x27; switch is covered with a rubber surface so no slipping of fingers, the battery compartment is sealed with an O-ring and the bristles have a color indicator to show when it is time to change the brush head.</li>
            <li>It was gentle on my teeth and gums without the rough bristles that some battery controlled toothbrushes have.</li>
            <li>my only issue with it is that it&#x27;s a bit too loud.</li>
            <li>so far it is still working, so the outside protection might work just well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it, but now they&#x27;re almost completely gone and his teeth are actually getting whiter!</li>
            <li>Once you buy a spinbrush you will never want a regular old toothbrush again.</li>
            <li>My teenage son has sensitive teeth and doesn&#x27;t like the rechargeable tooth brushes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that I will go back to my old manual toothbrush again.</li>
            <li>The plastic used in the construction is very slippery when wet.  </li>
            <li>I barely dab any on and it cleans each and every tooth.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was it was a bit loud &amp; wish it had a timer.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t know if it is the exact same model), the first lasted me a few years and had only recently started to show its age.  </li>
            <li>rather it be too powerful then not powerful enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While using the Spinbrush, it is still recommended that you use the same brushing motions as normal, but you will instantly feel the difference versus using a manual brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a heavy coffee consumer &amp; I need my toothpaste to be better than average.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you grip the handle firmly; since water and toothpaste dribble down the handle</li>
            <li>I have tried other battery operated brushes in the past but this has been my favorite</li>
            <li>I have used other battery operated toothbrushes in the past and they are ok</li>
            <li>Other than that I really like using this spinbrush .</li>
            <li>Only downfall...might get fired from my job for being late to work in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this over a regular toothbrush but think I still prefer my old sonicare brush to this one.</li>
            <li>feeling gritty or extra sensitive.</li>
            <li>I had to get used to the big head at first as the other electric toothbrushes I have have got a much smaller head</li>
            <li>the back of the brushhead was flat and not round like the Colgate Motion.    </li>
            <li>My only hold back was that the vibration is a little to excessive and causes one not to fully allow it to really get to clean the teeth.</li>
            <li>however i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for a child or an adult with a small mouth as the head of the brush is quite large.</li>
            <li>At first the bristles were way to hard for my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>The head on this brush is really chunky, which felt odd to me.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh, the bristles are not too hard to hurt the gum but hard enough to scrub the teeth.</li>
            <li>1.The thin consistency made the recommend pea size enough since it spread so easily and evenly anyway unlike the thicker toothpastes I used before.    </li>
            <li>Clean does not mean expensive in this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It was a little to intense for my gums</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s minty fresh, and doesn&#x27;t have an odd taste like some of the other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li>which only moves in a fast up and down motion which for electric gives me the feeling I was using a Manuel Toothbrush!    </li>
            <li>In the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my teeth, they look a few shades whiter.</li>

            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush on the market for the price.</li>
            <li> I feel like it cleans great!</li>
            <li> I was extremely impressed with this product.  </li>

            <li> I must say that this is the best toothbrush I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> I was really impressed that I did not have any sensitivity to the toothpaste at all which I sometimes experience.</li>
            <li> Then I read that the recommended brush time for best results is two minutes.</li>
            <li> They keep improving on these battery powered toothbrushes and this is the best one yet!  </li>
            <li> A great deal for the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably about the best quality out there for the price.</li>
            <li> It was a great experience and I will continue to use it by buying the replacement heads!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>

            <li> I have been telling everyone how happy I am with these products.</li>

            <li> Great toothbrush for the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Performance: the Spinbrush does a thorough &amp; great job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> but this toothbrush worked great.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> Great with the truly radiant toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It gives a great cleaning.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt great after using.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great for travel, but I still prefer my sonicare.</li>
            <li> it is great.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush for his gingivitis because of the great reviews here, and lo and behold, in about 5 weeks</li>

            <li> but this one is just great.  </li>
            <li> Also, it would be great if there was a two minute timer on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is not so great.</li>
            <li> If the handle wasn&#x27;t so bulky and the switch was easier to turn on and off, it would be greatly improved.</li>

            <li> LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH!!</li>
            <li> &amp; I love it!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE my spinbrush!!</li>
            <li> I love the spin brush!!</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed the way it made my mouth feel!!  </li>
            <li> Very effective combination.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spinbrush for a while and for what it is, I find it very effective.  </li>
            <li> The spinbrush was very nice on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste had a very nice flavor.</li>
            <li> The spinning massage is very pleasant and effective.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!  </li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> 3.The Mint effect was so effective that even when I was done brushing I could still taste it!  </li>
            <li> She was even more happy with the look of her teeth after using both for a week!  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush works great, good bristles even after weeks of use.</li>
            <li> What I write, however, is completely my own opinion!    </li>
            <li> This is 100% of my own opinion!</li>
            <li> Make your SMILE brilliant and try this-you will be so happy you did!</li>
            <li> The batteries were easy to insert and the battery life is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Well made and good shape for holding.  </li>
            <li> I loved the brush head,  </li>
            <li> I am always looking for a good battery powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> battery life is good too.</li>
            <li> how wise it was for me to make the switch from manual to electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the toothbrush is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I received the spinbrush Truly Radiant free from Smiley 360 and it is the best tooth brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample for a survey and it works great!  </li>
            <li> The feel is fairly chintzy.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I felt that the spinning bristles did a good job of also polishing my teeth while cleaning them.</li>
            <li> and i loved it.</li>
            <li> And I realize it is not as thorough as a trip to the dentist, but it is good to be using every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good entry before plunging and buying yourself an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I  received this product for free to use and review, and in my opinion, this Truly Radiant Spinbrush is the best brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is good at cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really loved my Spinbrush Truly Radiant toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I think for the price it would be a good purchase though.</li>
            <li> Truly Radiant™ Toothpaste &amp; Spinbrush seemed like a great combo, but neither is as spectacular as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> absolutely loved the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good product.  </li>
            <li> the spinbrush works really good</li>
            <li> feel really good about these products.</li>
            <li> I feel like I get a really good cleaning every time I use it.</li>
            <li> loved having this toothbrush!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a good battery charged toothbrush.</li>
            <li> + years ago, but it uses rechargeable batteries and they no longer hold a good charge.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all seen the fancy displays of the sonic brushes in our dentist office, but unless I win the lottery there is no way I am ever going to drop that kind of cash to get one.  </li>
            <li> The batteries (Duracell) that came with it just died, so in that regard, this toothbrush gives good bang for its buck.</li>
            <li> This battery operated toothbrush by Arm &amp; Hammer (Spinbrush) cleans your teeth wonderfully with two swiftly rotating brush heads that clean your teeth all around.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I have been extremely impressed by the whitening and how clean my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> It even felt like with that kind of power the Spinbrush moved on its own!  </li>
            <li> However, I have to say I am super impressed.</li>
            <li> I received one of these from Smiley360 for free to review and I am honestly quite happy with it!</li>
            <li> this one is definitly more affordable than others andworks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I had the opportunity to try this product.</li>
            <li> That said, if power brushes are your bag, I think you&#x27;ll be very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I feel proud when people compliment me about my teeth saying how healthy they look.</li>
            <li> The best thing is, its kinda fun</li>
            <li> I love my Toothbrush always leaves my teeth feeling great    </li>
            <li> very pleased with the toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Great product love the way it works</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush is works so great.</li>
            <li> but if you just want something effective to throw in your suitcase, this is definitely a good choice.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush works great on my teeth and it really gets them very clean!!!</li>
            <li> I love love this tooth brush, and will never buy anything else!!</li>

            <li> I love this brush and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I love this spin brush!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>

            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Spinbrush for almost a month now, and I absolutely love it!</li>

            <li> Absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> and I think we need to buy two more!  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll just keep using this one for sure!</li>
            <li> Totally in love with this tooth brush will never use another try!</li>
            <li> Even more so after a week of using this product!  </li>
            <li> It is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and a great one!  </li>
            <li> I would gladly reccomend both to others, because when used together,cavities watch out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my teeth appreciate it!  </li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the spin brush!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush!</li>

            <li> absolutely love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste and toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty great!</li>
            <li> I love it and will not use anything else!</li>
            <li> I thought that would be an easy win for the rechargeables -- that this one made me go through batteries a lot -- but I&#x27;ve used it for 2-3 minutes 2-3 times a day for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> as a bonus the toothpaste has a pleasant and refreshing taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush as a free sample to review and I am very pleased!  </li>
            <li> It spun really well and did a very good job of cleaning her teeth and had good power to it.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a great cheap electric option.</li>
            <li> When you combine the two its amazing.</li>
            <li> toothbrush did an amazing job at cleaning my teeth,</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> For the price (and the fact that you can change the batteries (AA) yourself), this is definitely a great tool to help you achieve a cleaner and healthier mouth!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> You get amazing results</li>
            <li> A free sample was a great way for me to see if a change was needed.</li>

            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.”</li>
            <li> What I liked about the Spinbrush  -------------------------------------  </li>
            <li> Two pieces of information: the brush does not have a plastic cover for head which is nice to have for travels and the brush does work with rechargeable batteries</li>
            <li> design is nice - it doesn’t feel too clunky or oversized in my hand</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those who want an affordable electric toothbrush that does a good job, the SpinBrush is a safe</li>
            <li> I honestly like the toothbrush but not the toothpaste.</li>

            <li> I used this brush with the truly radiant paste, which I really liked.    </li>
            <li> The good thing is that the refill brushes aren&#x27;t expire as most others are.</li>

            <li> Since figuring that out, using the SpinBrush has been very easy and</li>

            <li> Very easy once I did that.</li>

            <li> Great taste and our mouths felt fresh even after drinking coffee.</li>
            <li> I would not have bought the Spinbrush on my own, but after trying out the Spinbrush for 30 days, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I always kind of thought that they were just a ploy to get you to pay more for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> my teeth were quite strong after just 3 days twice a day brushing with this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> Good speed and leaves teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I have always felt that mechanical toothbrushes do t clean as good as a manual one where you do the work yourself</li>

            <li> The paste is minty fresh and pleasant.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean after using it and are shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I already own and use rechargeable batteries, so it was easy to just pop some in and start using it.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The opinions I have shared are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I found this extremely easy and quick, lots of great results and it just keeps getting better and better</li>

            <li> I received a free product trial and I LOVE the truly radiant tooth brush and toothpaste!  </li>

            <li> I even brush my tongue - very gentle yet extremely effective!  </li>
            <li> I personally think that the spinbrush does a very good job of getting any kind of food out of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love ❤</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush-</li>
            <li> so I wanted an electric toothbrush that cleans more efficiently than I would by manually brushing and don&#x27;t clutter my sink with cords.  </li>
            <li> But this is so much better.</li>
            <li> I got to try this out as I received it as a free sample and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I love my Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush</li>
            <li> love this brush, would buy it, and would recommend it to friends and family.  </li>
            <li> and I love the spin brush.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free to review and the review is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this spin-brush.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> so I would have to use one pea size for the top row and another for the bottom row.)    </li>
            <li> received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Brush is ok.  </li>
            <li> For me, the Sonic Care does a better job of getting in the gum line.</li>
            <li> , the SpinBrush is a safe bet.</li>
            <li> and that might put some users off, but the end result means more to me and I am buying another one of these for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I can say is I love it</li>
            <li> Better than manual tooth brush, but I think the sonic brush is better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I believe I can feel a better job of cleaning when I use the sonic brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;But as I said, it is better than a manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> A plus is it removes 100% more plaque because its bristles are elongated.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It worked for me. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more affordable if I were to lose it</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the arm and hammer spin brush free for reviewing purposes: review is 100% my own opinion.</li>
            <li> I love that feeling.</li>

            <li> found the Truly Radiant Toothpaste to be better than the Colgate Whitening I have been using.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would suggest the manufacturer redesign the handle to use a slip resistant material and the switch for better grip as well.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the Crest spinbrush.</li>
            <li> My manual brush does that better since I have more control over it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>

            <li> It didn&#x27;t have a strong minty flavor like most toothpastes.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to make sure it&#x27;s charged up which makes for easy traveling.</li>
            <li> I actually like the humming sound made while I brush, lol!</li>

            <li> 5.The slender handle that gives me a much better grip than my old fat rounded yet nicely rubber texture handle on the Colgate Motion.  </li>
            <li> far as the toothpaste, I loved the flavor.  </li>
            <li> I also loved the taste of the toothpaste, it wasn&#x27;t overpowering but left a refreshing taste after brushing.  </li>
            <li> After receiving a free sample of the new Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant battery-powered toothbrush to try, I was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of cleaning your teeth and while I prefer the rechargeable type, this one was powerful enough to get my teeth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> Very powerful for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got it free from Smiley360, but I have since bought more, because it is my new favorite regimen.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in the cleanliness of my teeth, or the amount of time I spend brushing to get them feeling as clean as I like.</li>
            <li> and my teeth still feels smooth and clean..</li>
            <li> and my teeth still feels smooth and clean..</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so smooth and clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I get a polished smooth clean from the Sonicare</li>
            <li> The brush head is replaceable with just a quick and easy twist,and so are of course the batteries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush, not as abrasive as other spin brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past...totally saw a significant difference within a week of using it!</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and did an awesome job, even in those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> I really do love this spinbrush very much.</li>
            <li> my own.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush is a great product for those who don&#x27;t want to shell out the big bucks to by a rechargable electric toothbrush but want something more effective than the traditional manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a more thorough cleaning than a manual brush but less of a commitment than an electric brush, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and used the Spin brush Truly Radiant with the same brand toothpaste and was very impressed with the cleaning power.</li>
            <li> (Every other whiting toothpaste I ever tried never worked as good as this!)    </li>
            <li> It fits in my small hand perfect as well as my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference in my Oral health since trying this.</li>
            <li> Everyone was excited and wanting to try the products.</li>
            <li> I have used the Spinbrush twice a day for over a month, and the original batteries are still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Plus, after a month of use, the original batteries and head are still good.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I received a full tube of Truly Radiant toothpaste, and a Truly Radiant Spinbrush 100% free.</li>
            <li> Also I already notice a significant difference in whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love the freshness it gives you after brushing from the first time.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure, I was selected to review this product as part of a sampling program, and I did recieve the product for free.  </li>
            <li> So, the feel of using this was familiar to me.  </li>
            <li> However after using the product for just one week there was a significant difference.</li>
            <li> def worth the price!</li>
            <li> By day 5, there was a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I was already a fan of Arm &amp; Hammer Advanced White toothpaste, but I do believe this is even better, which is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have always used a manual toothbrush, so I was excited to try out an electric one.</li>
            <li> Others I have tried were way too powerful and hurt my mouth!</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day for over a month with the original batteries in it</li>
            <li> It spins as you brush and my mouth felt so clean after using all three products..  </li>
            <li> it gets my teeth that clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel extremely clean and doesn&#x27;t feel like the enamel was scrubbed off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After just two minutes of brushing, my teeth are literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> The top portion of the brush head rotates while the bottom portion vibrates, providing varying cleaning techniques and ensuring more complete plaque removal.  </li>
            <li> a 2-minute minimum brushing session provides a just-left-the-dentist quality clean.  </li>
            <li> The only problem i could see anyone having is replacing the brush heads, but when you think of the great way this toothbrush works it really is worth it.</li>

            <li> The clean feeling literally lasted for hours.  </li>
            <li> The design of this brush, i.e. the bristle configuration made it much more effective in cleaning my back teeth as well as between teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have never felt my teeth so clean before.</li>
            <li> I like how clean my teeth feel after using this toothbrush.</li>

            <li> Makes your teeth feel squarely clean.  </li>
            <li> These are also great if you want to have the great feel of an electric tooth brush while vacationing but don&#x27;t want to lug around your expensive tooth brush or the charging station.</li>
            <li> Also really enjoyed that it was free thanks to Smiley360.com.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how clean my teeth felt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros.&lt;br /&gt;Morning brushing makes my teeth feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth and mouth both felt clean , but did not have that &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; feeling.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> I feel it does a thorough job of getting my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I liked it way better then using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product and the price is right</li>
            <li> the brush head requires me to grip it on the bottom while trying to avoid sqeezing the bristles with my hand as I turn it towards the right to remove it compared to the SC Up&#x27;s easily grip bottom and pull up.    </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for something special, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> , this spinbrush really gets my teeth clean - better than any of the bargain motorized toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve tried in the past!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This is amazing, I will never go back to a manual toothbrush again, why would I when I got such great results with this?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing so far.</li>
            <li> this is a pretty nice toothbrush i really didnt care for electronic toothbrush</li>
            <li> This meant they would send me a package which contained all this...    #1 Full Size Tube of their Truly Radiant Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I love Arm &amp; Hammer products because they are reasonably priced and they work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I still loved the toothpaste &amp; the spinbrush &amp; will likely continue to use them.  </li>
            <li> use along with Arm &amp; Hammer truely radiant toothpaste</li>
            <li> Thanks to Smiley 360, for the free product!  </li>
            <li> Overall a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a good quality product and one that she would recommend, though it may not be all that different, it seems, to some others that are available.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I actually found the head to be a good size.</li>
            <li> I am using it from last three week and the brush head is still really good condition</li>
            <li> My mouth feels super clean after brushing with the Spinbrush.</li>
            <li> It rattles my teeth and makes my top lip/nose tingle from how fast it spins.</li>
            <li> They sent me a full size tooth brush along with a full size toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Spinnbrush is gentle on my gums (wich are rather sensitive) and the bristles are soft,i also like the fact that the brush is not heavy and fits perfectly into my hand.</li>
            <li> My mouth tingled and if I had just come from a cleaning at the dentist, and I really feel that my mouth is in better condition since using this item.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste wasn&#x27;t my favorite flavor, the saltiness of the baking soda came through too much.</li>
            <li> The Spinbrush made my teeth feel super clean.  </li>
            <li> It works very thoroughly and has a lot more power than you would think.  </li>
            <li> This is my true opinion.</li>
            <li> to most dentists and hygienists, there is no way a manual toothbrush can remove as much debris, plaque, and also massage the gums as well as an electric spinbrush.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to keep the brush head moving on the teeth and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure which causes gums to shrink and abrades tooth surfaces.</li>
            <li> Loved brushing my teeth with this and would definitely recommend buying this!  </li>
            <li> Also, the toothbrush head was very bulky and would be much better in my opinion if  </li>
            <li> , it has soft, yet effective bristles and works with the amount of pressure you apply.  </li>
            <li> Using this in conjunction with the Arm &amp; Hammer Radiant Whitening and Strengthening Toothpaste and flossing, has really allowed me to have a greater experience cleaning my mouth twice</li>
            <li> I received a Full Size Tube of their Truly Radiant Toothpaste &amp; the spin toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> But I guess that is not necessarily a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying my husband and 11 yr old one because I loved it so much, and they like theirs too!</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful because of the power, the toothpaste has a strong baking soda taste, but it was great for brushing my teeth and leaving them clean and white, Smiley 360 offers great opportunities to receive free products tor try and let consumers know how well it works.</li>
            <li> Got here super fast i love it</li>
            <li> Because of the light consistency of the paste it would easily fly off the tooth brush when switched on or either the force from the  faucet&#x27;s rushing water would knock it clean of the brush and down the drain!  </li>
            <li> but right after brushing my teeth with this brush my teeth did feel smooth like I just got a dentist cleaning.</li>
            <li> and it is still going just as strong as the first day.</li>
            <li> Love the Spinbrush for it&#x27;s ability to clean completely and thoroughly,even after 1 month of use!!</li>
            <li> First time i used it my teeth felt smooth and clean like after you get a cleaning from the dentist</li>
            <li> First time i used it my teeth felt smooth and clean like after you get a cleaning from the dentist</li>
            <li> It really has gotten my teeth looking and feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> It has lasted longer than some of the other brands I have tried and the brisell feel great against my teeth.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, my husband is happily pestering me about getting him a Spinbrush, too.  </li>
            <li> I love this new toothbrush and how it has helped my smile!</li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh and clean and my teeth has gotten whiter in 5 days.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few others and quickly tossed them to the side, but this brush is comfortable to use and feels great on my teeth.</li>
            <li> My mouth is so clean and fresh, and my teeth feel stronger.</li>
            <li> Not only did this Spinbrush toothbrush do a better job cleaning, but I felt it was able to reach places/crevices in my teeth</li>
            <li> The only things I didn&#x27;t like were that brush creates a mini racket and the minty flavor which I have come to expect of most toothpastes is more salty with this one, if you can overlook these things this is something can work for you even if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> It polishes by front teeth and adequately cleans my molars in one pass.</li>
            <li> My 7 yr old loved it soooo much</li>
            <li> The longer bristles get in and give me a really good deep cleaning and the toothpaste keeps my mouth and breath fresh for a god 3-4 hours.  </li>
            <li> leaves my mouth feeling fresh super clean</li>
            <li> After trying this toothbrush for the first time i was so excited on how clean my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li> I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep Clean thru the Vine program...and LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> It is also a more affordable option thzn getting a high end electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It really gets your teeth clean!</li>
            <li> But it really gets teeth clean!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works very well and leaves my mouth feeling ridiculously clean!</li>
            <li> Not only is it easy to maintain, with heads and batteries cheap and easy to replace, but it also keeps teeth clean and white.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pros are that it leaves my teething feeling very clean and works way better than a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> i am very pleased with it overall.</li>
            <li> I received my toothbrush for free for my review and when I tried it I was pretty amazed.</li>
            <li> Combined with the Arm and Hammer toothpaste, which I also got to try for free, my mouth felt noticeably cleaner after the first use.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the brush feels pretty comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> I love how wonderfully clean it makes my teeth and that it does such an incredible job getting my teeth cleaner than a typical toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So glad that the site Smiley360 choose me to be a part of the NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER Truly Radiant Mission.</li>
            <li> Love the new spinbrush from arm and hammer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m not really made for powered toothbrushes, but my teeth did feel especially clean afterwards</li>
            <li> Enjoy a fresh from the dentist experience thanks to the Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like an electric toothbrush at first, but I really like the way it cleans my teeth, gums and tongue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great at first because it gives an electric toothbrush clean for less...</li>
            <li> This is my first battery operated toothbrush and it blows my manual brush out of the water!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Really gets in between my teeth and cleans!!</li>
            <li> You will notice the same difference I did and you will love the results too!</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m pretty sceptical when it comes to electric tooth brushes, but boy was I mistaken this time!</li>
            <li> Like I just left a dentists office.. or better!  </li>
            <li> It makes my teeth more sensitive and it burn my gums!</li>
            <li> 1.It&#x27;s much more powerful than my old Colgate Motion Electric Toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I was amazed about how shinny clean my teeth looked.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a spinbrush &amp; it made my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> The baking soda really makes my teeth feel clean and using the spin brush supports that fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Also the head seems large and doesn&#x27;t fit well between my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I will not post a positive review simply because I got a free sample; I will give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as the more expensive recharging tooth brushes but for the great low price I really liked it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used colgate spinbrushes many times and this one is much better at giving me the clean down to the gums feeling.</li>
            <li> I received the Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush free thanks to Smiley360,and</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush, and even got to try it for free through smiley.</li>
            <li> For the price of this toothbrush it is actually quite amazing.  </li>
            <li> I was really wanting to like this Spinbrush from Arm &amp; Hammer and was grateful to receive it for free from Smily360 in order to create a review about it.</li>
            <li> a nice inexpensive toothbrush, this was my second one like this</li>
            <li> Love the longer bristles which seem to clean teeth better than my previous spinbrush.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush were soft but the amount of power the toothbrush had was overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was a regular toothbrush kind of girl</li>
            <li> Products are definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li> This Spinbrush is the best powered toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever tired.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice angle on the brush head that helps it reach my back teeth without stretching my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It works well, appears to be adequately waterproof (I run it under water a smidge to clean it), and came out of the package ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush complimentary for testing purposes from Smiley360  http://h5.sml360.com/-/1ktf.  </li>
            <li> but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> product (when used with it&#x27;s toothpaste) promises a brighter smile in just five days.  </li>
            <li> Overall, i think it&#x27;s a nice brush</li>
            <li> I kind of like that its battery operated, last one I owned had a charger</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own: I regularly use Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I like it, but, honestly, tend to use my regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it with the Truly Radiant toothpaste and my mouth feels tingly fresh after brushing.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is nice and big.</li>
            <li> I love  the dual action head brush.</li>
            <li> and I believe my smile is getting whiter</li>
            <li> , I can honestly say that I am hooked and will not be going back to what I used before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After having two babies in two years, I noticed that my teeth are more sensitive now.</li>
            <li> I have a smaller mouth and it was effective while cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> I found this completely unsatisfactory as it generated a lot more laundry and mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smile member&lt;</li>
            <li> No one thinks flossing is a fun activity but by using this toothbrush, flossing is even faster.  </li>
            <li> Also the spinbrush made my teeth more sensitive</li>
            <li> I must say I really like it, the spin brush is gentle on your teetha nd gums but it gets your teeth super clean!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using both products they left my teeth whiter and feeling very fresh.  </li>
            <li> Powerful cleaning action that leaves your feeling clean and your breath super fresh!</li>
            <li> Other than my own personal preference,  it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I did not expect much of the Spinbrush as I have been using other electric tooth brushes for years and am really happy with their results.</li>
            <li> This brush eliminates flossing if your short on time in the mornings due to it&#x27;s wonderful brushes and the power of the brush.</li>
            <li> I loved how soft the bristles were, yet my teeth felt clean after I brushed.  </li>
            <li> really leaves me with a fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Package claims to deep clean and promises to remove a 100% more plaque...</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the effectiveness of the product and would recommend it to others looking for a simple way to clean their teeth.</li>
            <li> It is powerful, yet gentle, and leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> compared to other battery operated toothbrushes this one ranks about a 4 out of 5 in the how good does it work department.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d this toothbrush from Smiley360 and put it to the test right away.</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t imagine how clean</li>
            <li> My Sonicare toothbrush just didn&#x27;t clean the gumline very well.</li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth really well and leaves them shiny and clean.  </li>
            <li> so I really feel like my teeth are as clean as they can be</li>
            <li> Really gets your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> It really gives you a deeper clean than a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> I really feel like it has made it easier to keep my mouth clean for longer.</li>
            <li> I found this Spinbrush to be easy to handle, powerful and left my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> However, the vibration that the Truly Radiant Spinbrush provides is pleasantly mild, yet powerful enough to make my teeth feel clean and plaque free.  </li>
            <li> I received this spin brush for free to test out and let me just say, WOW!!</li>
            <li> However, this opinion is my own and unaffected by Smiley360 in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush seems to clean about as well as that one, at least as far as i can tell, which is impressive considering how much cheaper it</li>
            <li> So, I have to clean more than the standard three minutes to make sure I do a thorough job.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush that I have, and have used, prior to receiving the Spinbrush is a Sonicare DiamondClean electronic brush that I purchased from Costco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s better than a manual brush as far as how clean it gets your teeth, but for me it is harder to maneuver in my mouth than even a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush really gets to the back of my teeth which I have a hard time doing and always makes my teeth feel squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t huge; it actually fits perfectly fine in my travel toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free product to review, and in my opinion, this is actually a pretty decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is a great little toothbrush and works really well.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush that gentle on gums and tough on plaque.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to clean my teeth very well even though I had recently had a root canal done.  </li>
            <li> The brush is bulkier and louder than the Sonicare, but a decent brush for the price and my teeth felt just as clean.</li>
            <li> Especially if you want something gentle, yet effective.  </li>
            <li> The taste was average and didn&#x27;t give me much of a nice minty cool after feel that I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the sound always drove me crazy but I gave this one a try and was super impressed with the deep clean results!</li>
            <li> So happy that I will be buying this toothpaste and only this toothpaste in the future, despite the fact that I am an avid couponer and ALWAYS buy what&#x27;s on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From the very first use my teeth felt much cleaner than they do after brushing with a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> The cost of this tooth brush is also very reasonable compared to a manual brush..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a week and have noticed a brighter smile and some slight whitening, My mouth feels clean and fresh after using it and the toothbrush does an okay job of cleaning between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> After using it for about 2 weeks, I can say it&#x27;s a pretty good toothbrush, but it&#x27;s pretty basic as far as these kinds of motorized toothbrushes come.</li>
            <li> Other than the loud noise, it really is a great toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the spinbrush, but it was a little too strong for my sensitive teeth and kind of left my jaw hurting after use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good product if you are on a budget and would like to add a little something to your oral hygiene routine...</li>
            <li> I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep Clean from smiley360 for free to test...</li>
            <li> I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep Clean from smiley360 for free to test...</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this product for free, but would definitely say it&#x27;s worth more</li>
            <li> Truly Radiant™ Deep Clean Battery Toothbrush for free to review for my opinions.</li>
            <li> That toothbrush reached to my back teeth and when I&#x27;m done I feel my mouth completely clean and food free.</li>
            <li> Something I admit I laughed a little at when I first got them.  </li>
            <li> 3.The Lower half of the head moves in a fast right to left Motion which did a wonderful job in brushing the side of the rows of teeth which I really can&#x27;t see.  </li>
            <li> at first.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s way better than a regular toothbrush...</li>
            <li> This would be much improved with a push button!</li>
            <li> I would think you could find somewhere besides China to have these manufactured so they would be better quality and last longer.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s way better than a regular toothbrush...</li>
            <li> It really cleans my teeth and gums!</li>
            <li> and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I wish the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; action brush was actually available on Amazon, but I doesn&#x27;t seem to be.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using an electric toothbrush of spinbrush of any type.</li>
            <li> I could see more of the whitening of my teeth on just the third brushing mind</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t noticeable to me on the first day after two brushings.)  </li>
            <li> five days of brushing twice a day my teeth were really Truly Radiant as advertised !</li>
            <li> The first time I used this Truly Radiant Spinbrush, my teeth immediately felt cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li> It actually does a better cleaning than the Oral-B I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> Come on now ;)</li>
            <li> My next dental appointment isn&#x27;t until November, so I won&#x27;t have any information on how this affected my dental health until after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information &amp; coupons, click this link:</li>
            <li> I have converted to a much cleaner mouth with the push of a button!</li>
            <li> this was my first one</li>
            <li> I am going to buy these for my whole family!</li>
            <li> I also think that the big head reduced the time you need to brush your teeth as it reaches more teeth at once.</li>
            <li> To begin with, I should say that this is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It was my first electric brush</li>
            <li> (you can find out more by following this link: http://h5.sml360.com/-/1ger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothbrush did exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I love using this not only for my teeth but massaging my gums.</li>
            <li> She has been the most likely one to use it in her years growing</li>
            <li> (Thanks smiley.360!)</li>
            <li> At first I did not like it.  </li>
            <li> This is the first spinbrush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> was on the fence about this toothbrush for the first couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> From the first day I used Arm &amp; Hammer(tm)</li>
            <li> many others fromArm &amp; Hammer in the future!</li>
            <li> my own&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I never used spinbrush before and this was my first experience</li>
            <li> I am an avid coffee and tea drinker, and my teeth were proof of that.  </li>
            <li> Everyone in my family wants to know why they didn&#x27;t get one too!</li>
            <li> awesome but ill jist buy rechargable batteries.</li>
            <li> and I immediately noticed whitening on my teeth within the first three days.</li>
            <li> Love it - never going back!  </li>
            <li> I love it &amp; never want to go back to a manual toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I  was hesitant at first because I have never used a spin brush</li>
            <li> I am fortunate to have naturally whiter teeth, but I already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really noisy!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using it.</li>
            <li> but the bristles are kind of too rough for my teeth.</li>
            <li> It was the first battery operated toothbrush I have used</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and will never go back to a manual brush!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Truly Radiant Spinbrush!</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t recall exactly when and what</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I&#x27;m done with the brushing, I think my teeth are pretty clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> since I have mentioned that its top couldn&#x27;t reach the very deep side of my mouth,&lt;br /&gt;I had to try a couple of times for all my deepest teeth, it took a while</li>
            <li> this is my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> The head has two sets of independently motorized bristles, radial rotating at the top and axial rotating at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was pleased with both the toothbrush and the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> head size seems smaller than most.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my first experience with a powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toothbrush that wasn&#x27;t too expensive, and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first experience with Arm &amp; Hammer.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;After brushing teeth at night the next morning</li>
            <li> this is the first spinning brush i have ever used  </li>
            <li> and I really like it!  </li>
            <li> it uses regular batteries (2 AA); they&#x27;re more convenient than needing to keep the rechargables charged.</li>
            <li> : The motor is louder than the Oral B; the brush head seems to buzz more than actually move</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with the Spinbrush.</li>
            <li> I am overall satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> After the first two days I noticed that my teeth felt cleaner after brushing.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried a power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> And that mindset also disturbs me because if everyone takes the same approach, how many of these Spinbrushes are going to end up rotting in landfills?</li>
            <li> Its super soft and is easy on my sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a really good brush at a decent price for brand name...</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this brush for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> someone making something like this with a USB rechargeable capacity would be cool and eliminate the need for new batteries.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for the last month and so far, I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and not rough on my gums.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting anything from an electric brush this cheap, but other than being noisy and using regular batteries, it seems just as good as my Braun rechargeable that cost literally 10x</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not harsh on my teeth but leaves them clean.</li>
            <li> this brush really does magic definitely buying again</li>
            <li> The Truly Radiant Spinbrush is by far my favorite, and the positives far outweigh the negatives.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was expecting a better result with regard to whitening, but didn&#x27;t see much difference compared with what I get from the old-school manual-type toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> A word to the wise though, just be extra careful if you have sensitive gums like I do, you want to clutch the toothbrush just a more gentle than everyone else.</li>
            <li> Not only do my teeth feel super clean, they also appear whiter.  </li>
            <li> Only drawbacks - its kind of loud and sometimes the vibration makes my nose itch.  </li>
            <li> Changing the head is very easy, simply requiring you to twist the head off, pop on a new one, and twist it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want to say I was very surprised indeed to find that the Arm and Hammer SSinbursh really made my teeth and gums feel clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle as well which the oral-b isn&#x27;t as much.</li>
            <li> I leave the house feeling like I have such a clean mouth!</li>
            <li> It is a deep clean!</li>
            <li> deep clean!</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is that they have a cap for the brush part so when not using it stays clean!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush for people who have a hard time brushing, I swear it does all the work on its own!</li>
            <li> I personally think it tastes very sweet.</li>
            <li> Now the whole family wants one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more powerful than any other power toothbrush I have used.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed a bit much.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, especially for young kids that may not brush well enough.</li>
            <li> When I started using this, it left my mouth feeling really clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li> I have not one bit of irritation on my gums and they are nice and pink as the dentist states they SHOULD be!!</li>
            <li> It is soft, non gritty and rinse very easily.</li>
            <li> I found this brush to be a bit too harsh for my sensitive gums but the toothpaste is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I am very particular in my tooth-brushing habits.</li>
            <li> It was so strong and so thorough I felt as though I had just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> certain respects</li>
            <li> This brush has long bristles and a more powerful action than the Oral B I have been using.</li>
            <li> On the fourth day after the first brushing I was loving my teeth which were so pearly white</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter, shinier, stay smooth longer and my breath stays fresh all day long!</li>
            <li> This one certainly works very well.</li>
            <li> However the Spinbrush really exceeded my expectations and I will certainly continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I already have an electric Oral-B toothbrush that I&#x27;m already spoiled by, but for people that are still brushing their teeth with regular, plain toothbrushes, I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying this as a way to start more effectively cleaning their teeth!  </li>
            <li> She may love these kind, but she can break them in nothing flat usually.  </li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; I have never used a mechanical toothbrush before, so I was a little susceptible about how effective it would be.</li>
            <li> Truly Radiant Deep Clean Battery toothbrush is the first battery-powered toothbrush that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> This spinbrush, while fun to use, did not clean as well as I had hoped and I felt the need to floss much more than with my manual brush.</li>
            <li> still think if you&#x27;re looking for a main toothbrush you might come out better in the long run with a rechargeable</li>
            <li> spinbrush is a great little item to have around, it&#x27;s a basic battery powered, motorized toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have seen such great whitening results in the little time that I have had it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it scrubs as hard as good ol&#x27; elbow grease</li>
            <li> There are no false promises here.</li>
            <li> While this may not be the highest powered, or top-of-the-line brush, I feel like it was a huge step up from a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I really like the Truly Radiant Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I noticed this polished my teeth very well.(I</li>
            <li> so wet hands can keep a better grip of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the Sonic Care.  </li>
            <li> Spinbrush comes courtesy of Arm &amp; Hammer, is reasonably priced at just under $10</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample, this is a review on the same product listed.</li>
            <li> It is very thorough in it&#x27;s cleaning power.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well.</li>
            <li> and I think I can really feel a difference of how it did when I use it to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> but that isnt unusual for battery powered toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> and I can really tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> I dont like to floss every day and this really helps.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s real noisy</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Smiley 360 of Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste and spin brush toothbrush for the purpose of giving my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t buzz too intensely.  </li>
            <li> I appreciated the chance to test this out.</li>
            <li> The name truly radiant really fits this product.</li>
            <li> Gives thorough cleaning and gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have teeth that are very close together</li>
            <li> A battery powered toothbrush with this much power is a steal</li>
            <li> I know that my dentist told me a few years ago to stop using a manual brush and to convert to this brush because it works better and does more in the same amount of time as using a manual brush.</li>
            <li> the bristles hold up really well</li>
            <li> Also, my teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth really well.</li>
            <li> The price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> worsened my sensitivity) to gels which did absolutely nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really had my doubts about it.</li>
            <li> My teeth really felt cleaner</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it works really well.  </li>
            <li> and you are ready</li>
            <li> , I have to twist my hands to reach the very back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Shared the toothbrush and paste with my daughter who is very worried about the health and appearance of her teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is much louder, though.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a downside, it&#x27;s that the replacement heads cost as much as the brush package itself.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is really noisy, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I really like Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s truly radiant toothpaste</li>
            <li> I got this Spinbrush, as well as a tube of Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste from Smiley 360 for free, in exchange for my use and subsequent review.  </li>
            <li> There is no left over grime and gunk; my teeth are SMOOTH and CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;- Size and weight.</li>
            <li> I have stuck the whole thing under running water.  </li>
            <li> works really well to remove debris from teeth.  </li>
            <li> $ Much much cheaper than the sonic spin brush</li>
            <li> I was a product tester for the Spinbrush and received it for free, but I will definitely be buying one for my husband!</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t feel fast or full-cleaning at any point.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price for an automated toothbrush (without having to spend $50+)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Applies even pressure while brushing and is gentle on gums and teeth&lt;</li>
            <li> a whole lot easier since it does all the scrubbing for</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Helps to whiten teeth and cleans really well.</li>
            <li> I didnt really mind the noise it makes, but that might be a deal breaker for some.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these products, but I cannot.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My teeth were much cleaner after using this spinbrush.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like the Truly Radiant Spinbrush.</li>
            <li> I feel the combination of the toothbrush and toothpaste get my teeth much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I have arthritis and this makes brushing my teeth so much easier.  </li>
            <li> I found the Truly Radiant toothpaste to be much too this and runny.</li>
            <li> submerge whole brush underwater</li>
            <li> thanks to the longer bristles.</li>
            <li> My daughter wants one now.</li>
            <li> really like it.</li>
            <li> They also were much smoother and felt cleaner when I rubbed my tongue against my teeth.</li>
            <li> The head is compact and it can really be comfortably maneuvered into place to get the backs of my teeth and the ones waaaaay in the back.</li>
            <li> The bristles really got between my teeth and along the gum line.  </li>
            <li> My teeth truly felt much cleaner after just one brushing.  </li>
            <li> Very noisy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Spinbrush for about 3 weeks now and am finally ready to give it a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to Smiley360</li>
            <li> I also like that you can replace the head and not have to toss the whole brush.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels much cleaner</li>
            <li> I really like the spinbrush</li>
            <li> It makes to much noise for me and the toothpaste seems to drip alot, making this toothbrush slippery.</li>
            <li> The bristles were fast and cleaned my teeth to perfection.</li>
            <li> I really do like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like the arm &amp; hammer truly radiant toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing Spinbrushes for my whole family.</li>
            <li> Massage your gums with the gentle spinning heads.</li>
            <li> I got one each for the whole family.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quality toothbrush at a reasonable price, this is it.</li>
            <li> and I really like it..</li>
            <li> I credit much of this to the grittier consistency of the Truly Radiant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are gentle, yet reaches between my teeth.</li>
            <li> but it really does.  </li>
            <li> The bristles were gentle on my gums and teeth, no need to add pressure.</li>
            <li> I have been using the arm and hammer spin brush for about a month now, and my teet feel so much cleaner then before.</li>
            <li> But for the brand it does very well.</li>
            <li> (Which I liked it&#x27;s shorter round brush head</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t break the bank, so even if you don&#x27;t love it as much as I do, you&#x27;re not going to have a panic attack over the money you spent to try it.</li>
            <li> so its nice to have my white teeth back...</li>
            <li> Truly Radiant™ Deep Clean Battery Toothbrush and a tube of Truly Radiant toothpaste for free in return for my feed back.</li>
            <li> i can tell a real difference when i brush my teeth with this toothbrush compared to many other brands.</li>
            <li> (replacement brush heads are priced similarly at just under $10 for 2 heads), and does an admirable job at keeping my teeth clean while being gentle on my gums.  </li>
            <li> It really does feel like your eethe are getting a deep clean from using this brush.</li>
            <li> Although I wish it was a bit smaller for the size of my teeth, it really does clean well.  </li>
            <li> I also have a permanent retainer on the back of my bottom teeth and it helps clean around it very well too.  </li>
            <li> I feel dentist clean, yet the head is gentle enough my teeth and gums don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really helped me get my teeth clean, they not only looked cleaner but also felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> I really felt like my teeth were clean after I brushed with my Truly Radiant Spinbrush.  </li>
            <li> Its not weak like some power toothbrushes I have used.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Spinbrush, I was completely amazed!</li>
            <li> I have used other battery operated toothbrushes before, but this one works so much better.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I previously had to go through 2 of the same kind from a different brand</li>
            <li> I have many dental issues (genetic) and must be very careful when I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> it had plenty of bristles to give you a deep and thorough clean.</li>
            <li> I did feel a deep clean feeling after.  </li>
            <li> and it gives you a feeling of a deep clean.</li>
            <li> I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep clean from Smiley 360.</li>
            <li> It  does a deep clean to your teeth.</li>
            <li> It left my teeth feeling clean</li>
            <li> and I always use these types of toothbrushes to feel like I&#x27;m getting that extra clean</li>
            <li> Deep Clean  </li>
            <li> Deep Clean Battery Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li> gives you that deep clean like going to the denist</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think  that it gives your mouth a deep clean.</li>
            <li> Truly Radiant deep clean spinbrush and toothpaste from Smiley360 to review.</li>
            <li> The only time my teeth feel that clean is at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> well and left my teeth feeling clean and sparkling</li>
            <li> This Spin brush Truly Radiant Toothbrush deep clean is a must have.</li>
            <li> Since using this brush (after the first few days), my gums aren&#x27;t bleeding any more and look healthier.  </li>
            <li> and I found it with the Spinbrush Truly Radian Deep Clean Battery toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It left my teeth feeling clean, but not over sensitized.</li>
            <li> It left my teeth squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves work really well; however, the on/off switch quits working very quickly and the only way to turn it on or off is to remove the battery compartment complete.  </li>
            <li> I like the spin action very much, and the longer orange bristles that reach those pesky areas.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very convenient, powerful battery operated toothbrush that I can certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft on my gums but strong enough to get the job done!</li>
            <li> I did not notice a huge difference long term</li>
            <li> This Spinbrush, however, has lightened them significantly, and without any extra pressure applied than normal brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how much cleaner this brush got my teeth!</li>
            <li> and it just makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting a true deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud, but cleans nicely.</li>
            <li> I will be buying a new one!</li>
            <li> AND MY TEETH FEEL MUCH CLEANER WITH MY NEW SPIN BRUSH.</li>
            <li> I really like how you can purchase new heads and replace the batteries when needed withhout buying a whole new spinbrush.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush, but I’ll probably just wait for a sale and buy a brand new product.</li>
            <li> (It even has less bulk than the SC Up which felt more like a brick in the hand.)    </li>
            <li> Had one before nad i still use it.. just another one to have two and probably replace older one soon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush for several years now and totally love them too.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a super simple thing to do, though.</li>
            <li> and it does a decent job on cleaning my teeth compared to the oral-b.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive the Spinbrush Truly Radiant toothbrush and toothpaste as a mission via smiley 360.  </li>
            <li> The paste foams up well and brush has a decent amount of power.</li>
            <li> I always thought that more expensive was better when it came to my toothbrush of choice.</li>
            <li> My gum health is MUCH better with reference especially above my crown that I&#x27;ve had for several years!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever be able to go back to using a regular toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> head is pretty small, however, I felt that its top still couldn&#x27;t reach the very deep side of my mouth where my most inner tooth is located.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really spins and moves, the head&#x27;s aggressive action doesn&#x27;t need much pressure applied.</li>
            <li> --it definitely reaches further and brushes better than I could with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get to sample one</li>
            <li> It works much better than a regular toothbrush, I would buy one in the future.</li>
            <li> I had tried battery toothbrushes before but was never impressed enough to continue, but this toothbrush does a wonderful job cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is my first spinbrush and it is a little strong for me too.</li>
            <li> Truly Radiant Deep Clean Soft Powered Toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> the reason why I deducted one star from the Spinbrush is because it&#x27;s very loud!</li>
            <li> Because I haven&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush in a very long time, this brush seems very powerful to me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much experience with electric toothbrushes, actually the one I had crapped out right after I bought it, and this toothbrush has turned me into an electric toothbrush person.</li>
            <li> The head of the brush is nice and big, not like these dinky electric toothbrush heads, typical to most of the other brands.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I DO highly recommend you try both the brush &amp; the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> All in all I can highly recommend the Spinbrush from Arm&amp;Hammer</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this toothbrush</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this brush and have since purchased additional brushes for my family.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend using the arm and hammer dental products.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for those who are looking for an affordable toothbrush that produces results.</li>
            <li> The Spinbrush Radiant Deep Clean Manual Toothbrush head has my favorite setup - a round spinning head, along with a wider lower head that is also mechanized, rather than just fixed is engineered to get the most out of your average alkaline AA batteries</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, because of its relatively bulky size, appropriate angles are not always, or at least easily, achievable with the Spinbrush.</li>
            <li> Lucky me the site Smiley360 (Which I just joined a short while ago) choose me to be a part of the NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER Truly Radiant Mission.  </li>
            <li> but it seemed more like a toy with the little power it had.)    </li>
            <li> Its a definite yes and is not expensive like many other brand name  Spin Brush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush could be a little better and include a tongue scrubber, but the toothpaste is not goopy, if that is a word...</li>
            <li> Truly Radiant Deep Clean Soft Powered Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Team it with Arm and Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste for a complete clean with extra whitening.</li>
            <li> Now if you have had other Spin brushes you will noticed that this one for Arm &amp; Hammer is very powerful and you can really feel it cleaning as you brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> It got my teeth very clean, with half the time it takes for a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone that is looking for a good clean feel to their teeth, but are unable to afford or don&#x27;t want to spend too much money on a different brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally a fan of baking soda in my toothpaste, but I honestly didn&#x27;t mind this formula as much as I have with previous formulas.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it provide a deep down clean, but the bristles are nice and soft on my gums.</li>
            <li> One thing that I really dislike about this product is that it&#x27;s really loud.</li>
            <li> I get up early in the morning for work and the whole house knows when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth because they hear the Spinbrush.</li>
            <li> I really truly feel like I just got a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never wanted to invest the money in one of the expensive ones, so trying this one out was great.</li>
            <li> but it surprised me it was amazingly gentle on my teeth</li>
            <li> The top round part of the brush &amp;#34;spins&amp;#34; and the lower bristles vibrate.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it leave my mouth feeling fresh</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel deeply cleaned, and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I am a normal manual toothbrush user.</li>
            <li> Also, I miss my timer to make sure I brush long enough.  </li>
            <li> I use both manual and powered toothbrushes because they seem to get at my teeth in slightly different ways, plus a powered brush is a fun change.</li>
            <li> Although I have enjoyed using the Spinbrush, there are a few things that I would want to change in order to improve upon the product.</li>
            <li> I consider this product a good toothbrush, but not great in comparison to the electric one I have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whenever you are getting tired of using the manual one, this one should be a good choice if you are looking for  alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess the best part of the Truly Radiant variance is that it has little bristles that stick out further in some places on the head that feel like they get in between hard to get places better than the other</li>
            <li> I love this Spinbrush, and it makes it less time to brush and get in between all of my teeth!</li>
            <li> only remedy I found with the test product was to wrap it in a washcloth to keep the surface dry and provide a better grip and reduce switch slip.  </li>
            <li> 2.It didn&#x27;t have that strong mint taste that burns like the Big Red Chewing Gum.    </li>
            <li> I switched back to the manual toothbrush and it came right out.  </li>
            <li> I definitely think it reaches far to the back of my teeth and the two different motions makes for an effective brushing.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and gentle enough for sensitive teeth and gums, but the spinning power is strong enough to leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean all over, even the harder to reach spots way in the back.</li>
            <li> The batteries that came with the brush only lasted a week, but I put a couple of rechargeables in it and they&#x27;ve been working fine for several weeks without needing to be charged.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a pretty decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I felt like the bristles wore down kind of fast, but I think that might actually be due to my own brushing technique (brushing too hard).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and used quite a few of these over the past years and it&#x27;s safe to say I love them.  </li>
            <li> Other than those two drawbacks the spinbrush cleans well and leaves your teeth smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it is any louder than other types of electric toothbrushes, but I would prefer a quieter sound.</li>
            <li> the NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER</li>
            <li> But I can live with that.</li>
            <li> Also you can by new brush heads on amazon or at walmart.  </li>
            <li> I tried the samples of Arm and Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste , mouthwash and the new Spin brush.</li>
            <li> This product is a &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; Spinbrush with new bristle design.</li>
            <li> I recieved a tube of NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER™ Truly Radiant™ Toothpaste &amp; The ARM &amp; HAMMER™ Spinbrush</li>
            <li> I am using New Arm &amp; Hammer truly Radiant Toothpaste from about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Smiley360 choose me to be a part of the NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER Truly Radiant Mission.  </li>
            <li> I use manual brushes, so this was new for me.</li>
            <li> At about $4.50 apiece, you can get two for the price of a brand new toothbrush *</li>
            <li> Easy to grip, powerful but not so powerful that it makes it uncomfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> is very loud</li>
            <li> Very gentle on gums while giving a very solid cleaning to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> However, it also seems very loud, but I do not have another electric brush to compare the noise level to.  </li>
            <li> must have with family members along with the right toothpaste this gets the job done without having to pay all that big money for electric dentist toothspinners this is for adult as well as children</li>
            <li> But I quickly got used to it as my mouth truly felt cleaner after using it the first few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use spinbrushes but as far as spinbrushes go I did like it.</li>
            <li> Hi, I received my spinbrush Truly Radiant toothbrush from Smiley 360 and have enjoyed using it over the past month.  </li>
            <li> after I brushed for the first time I felt the difference between my manual and</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure the end effect is any better, for me anyway.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no louder than my electric razor and the one I have is pretty darn quiet.</li>
            <li> Spinbrush is the first, and only, battery-operated toothbrush I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mind has been completely changed and I will always be using this spinbrush!</li>
            <li> and I was devastated to have to return to my old brushing methods!  </li>
            <li> I used this daily for the first week</li>
            <li> This is a solid toothbrush and, for me, my first electric version.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it could be slightly more powerful.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been eyeing other toothbrushes like the Spinbrush and was excited to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I received this one to try I fell in love and realized I was missing out all these years!</li>
            <li> but I do actually believe that the bigger head makes it easier to clean your teeth</li>
            <li> My teeth felt so clean afterwards that I doubt I&#x27;d go back to a regular brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would still recommend buying it, however I would suggest using it a couple times a week as a deep clean and a regular brush the rest of the time.</li>
            <li> I feel as though my teeth are not only getting clean, but polished all at the same time.  </li>
            <li> This one will help perfect your smile and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well as some other electronic toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> They have completely reformulated it; between using the new toothpaste and the extra scrubbing from the battery operated toothbrush, my teeth have never felt so clean outside of a dental cleaning!</li>
            <li> Having a significant amount of experience with product testing I have spent the last month trying each product with my regular product, i.e. regular toothbrush with the toothpaste, and regular tooth paste with the toothbrush to come up with the best possible determination possible with a single subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only concerns were the softness of the bristles (I prefer &#x27;firm&#x27; toothbrushes), and the battery life, although I am not ready to put all blame for battery life on the brush, itself, until I replace the batteries that came with the brush, with my own fresh set.</li>
            <li> and so far this new one works like a champ.</li>
            <li> 2.The Upper half of the head which moves in a fast circular motion made it easy to get any food out of my crowns in just one pass  </li>
            <li> My only issue with this brush is that it seems to be pretty loud.</li>
            <li> things I liked about this were the results, the color of the brush (pink!), and the fact that you don&#x27;t accidentally shut it off while brushing like other electronic tooth brushes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> the battery seem to keep going strong i have been using the spin brush for few weeks</li>
            <li> It actually seemed to really get into those hard to reach places, leaving my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This is an okay electric toothbrush for its price, but compared to the Oral-B Triumph I am used to, it is a really big let down.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how this brush made my teeth feel very clean and how it got into the little gaps in my teeth!  </li>
            <li> of my thoughts on the Spinbrush are positive, such as how the brush was made</li>
            <li> The bottom half goes back and forth and the top circle rotates clockwise/</li>
            <li> (I was so sure of this I ate a bag of hard crunchy pretzels which most people would agree they were past crispy and more on the hard as a rock side. )    </li>
            <li> so it is gentle enough for sensitive gums!</li>
            <li> The head is a little hard, but otherwise great.</li>
            <li> After the first couple of uses, my gums did bleed a little, but that was probably because they are not used to such a deep clean and probably needed it!</li>
            <li> It was a bit odd at first because I automatically wanted to move the brush back and forth like a manual brush but that passed quickly.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this are not too hard and with the spinning action, I felt that it did a much better job cleaning my teeth than a manual toothbrush did.  </li>
            <li> While it has the great ability to brush in all the hard to reach places, I found that it was quite messy while doing it.</li>
            <li> Really does give your teeth a complete and overall cleaning</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and I thought that was going to be an issue</li>
            <li> my 2 year old uses this and loves it</li>
            <li> I always get the soft bristles because that&#x27;s what the dentist recommends.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really loud.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and non-abrasive.</li>
            <li> I have an electric powered brush and tried this one to see how it would compare and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> It does not  irritate my sensitive teeth pressure-wise</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s loud</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the freshness my mouth felt after using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling really</li>
            <li> It annoys my family when I use it and sounds quite loud to me.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth and have struggled with cavities and abscess for years.</li>
            <li> So far it has been performing well.</li>
            <li> I like the dual action head.  </li>
            <li> , it is horribly loud...</li>
            <li> And I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> and I guess it no longer spins fast enough for her.  </li>
            <li> so I ended up pulling my old fashioned manual toothbrush to ensure</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The only negative is it&#x27;s kind of loud.</li>
            <li> really like the Spinbrush and will continue to use it inthe future!</li>
            <li> but my teeth were so sensitive afterwards</li>
            <li> I can actually feel the rotating head REALLY cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> This really does work, I had yellowish stained teeth and now they are white again!</li>
            <li> So when I tried this it really was different from what I am used to.</li>
            <li> The downside is it is loud and having to twist off the tips when you need to rinse off the bristles after brushing</li>
            <li> The spinning action makes this almost the equivalent of getting a professional cleaning in a dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Its got soft bristles and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Compared to that, this toothbrush was loud and bulky.</li>
            <li> I have stayed away from electric toothbrushes because I have sensitive teeth and was worried about the pain.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Is a bit loud</li>
            <li> The only problems I had was the taste took about two times to get used to, but now I really like it.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised by the power of this brush.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is 9 years old and loves using it</li>
            <li> (I have young children and multi task a lot )</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and this never once made them bleed</li>
            <li> Simply take it out of the package, power it on, and it is ready for use.  </li>
            <li> For one, I find the toothbrush to be loud.</li>
            <li> The bristles are way too soft and they do not get in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter, cleaner, and left with an overall fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I mean HUGE!</li>
            <li> Yes, the initial brush is close to $8 (at Wal-Mart at least) and the set of 2 replacement heads is the same price, but it is worth the money and really saves more in the long run for your wallet.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so much cleaner than it has with any other toothpast, and my teeth are so much whiter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, I received the following products, an ARM &amp; HAMMER Spinbrush Truly Radiant Deep Clean Battery Toothbrush and tube of Truly Radiant toothpaste, for the purpose of the following review I will provide.  </li>
            <li> It works really well and keeps my mouth feeling really clean without brushing so hard that I lose my enamel.</li>
            <li> The round top portion glides easily around and behind my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> Not sure if all electric toothbrushes sound this loud</li>
            <li> The brush itself has soft bristles so that wasn&#x27;t different from my normal brush.</li>
            <li> For years, I have wanted one of those super expensive, fancy, electronic toothbrushes, but instead I simply buy the more affordable battery-powered toothbrushes sold in department stores.  </li>
            <li> I have steadily cut back on the &amp;#34;pea&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I feel like I can really get down to my gums clean and the very back teeth especially!  </li>
            <li> Even the grime that never comes off the back of my front bottom teeth, no matter how long I brush with a manual toothbrush, was totally gone and my teeth were left squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li> The brush head is small enough that I can reach every corner of my mouth and the bristles seem to clean everything very well.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well, maybe not as well as say the sonic or other high end brands.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Compared to manual brushing,the dual action brush head made it easier to get in between teeth and hard to reach back teeth for better cleaning</li>
            <li> I got to try this Spin Brush out for free for product review along with the Tooth past</li>
            <li> , I feel clean mouth in very less time.</li>
            <li> I found that the battery lasted for longer than other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past (which was nice).</li>
            <li> I just found it very hard to make sure that every one of my teeth were cleaned completely.</li>
            <li> The brush is too large to brush gums effectively without cutting.  </li>
            <li> That said this less expensive and would be a good alternative for someone not wanting to pay a lot for a tooth brush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s phenomenal for reaching and deep cleaning hard to reach areas like the backs of your molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush really does a deep clean, without having to worry that I&#x27;m brushing too hard, or not reaching the hard-to-reach spots.</li>
            <li> pack of two Spinbrush replacement heads cost about the same as a brand new Spinbrush.&lt;br /&gt;*No built in timer for the recommended two minutes of tooth</li>
            <li> : I recently received a new toothpaste and toothbrush to try, compliments of Smily360, for this review.</li>
            <li> The batteries last pretty long and are changeable.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have much of a gag reflex when brushing towards the back as when I brushed with the C Motion/SC Up.    </li>
            <li> and I definitely feel like it helped get my teeth much cleaner than a regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It really gets around the back teeth where a regular brush always misses.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Bristles are soft enough for my sensitive gums&lt;br /&gt;Price</li>
            <li> definitely saw whiter, brighter teeth after about 10 days of regular use so this combo really does work!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the Spinbrush I can easily fix a slow battery.  </li>
            <li> A quick few words about the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> On one hand, its efficient, affordable, and has replaceable heads, however on the other hand, its loud (too loud if using the master bath in the morning and trying not to wake your partner on the other side of the door), and I actually found it to be too strong.  </li>
            <li> The design has a major flaw.</li>
            <li> Instead of a slide on and off it would be a major improvement to have just an on/off push button.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying this is my first spin brush (I have had other electric tooth brushes but never a spin brush).</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my hands cramping and with a traditional toothbrush, sometimes I just can&#x27;t get my teeth as clean as they should be.</li>
            <li> Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a decently priced motorized toothbrush that does a standard job, this one will work for you.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like was that it is loud and a little too powerful.</li>
            <li> 4.The long orange bristles that stick out of the brush head&#x27;s Upper and Lower part make it so even one as myself who doesn&#x27;t really like flossing for the time it should take   can still reach all those slits inbetween the teeth which food always seems to find a way in.(Not to mention these prevent any paste from sinking into your bristles.)    </li>
            <li> Weird, I know, but overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;On&#x27; switch is covered with a rubber surface so no slipping of fingers, the battery compartment is sealed with an O-ring and the bristles have a color indicator to show when it is time to change the brush head.</li>
            <li> It was gentle on my teeth and gums without the rough bristles that some battery controlled toothbrushes have.</li>
            <li> my only issue with it is that it&#x27;s a bit too loud.</li>
            <li> so far it is still working, so the outside protection might work just well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it, but now they&#x27;re almost completely gone and his teeth are actually getting whiter!</li>
            <li> Once you buy a spinbrush you will never want a regular old toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> My teenage son has sensitive teeth and doesn&#x27;t like the rechargeable tooth brushes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I will go back to my old manual toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> The plastic used in the construction is very slippery when wet.  </li>
            <li> I barely dab any on and it cleans each and every tooth.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was it was a bit loud &amp; wish it had a timer.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t know if it is the exact same model), the first lasted me a few years and had only recently started to show its age.  </li>
            <li> rather it be too powerful then not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While using the Spinbrush, it is still recommended that you use the same brushing motions as normal, but you will instantly feel the difference versus using a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy coffee consumer &amp; I need my toothpaste to be better than average.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you grip the handle firmly; since water and toothpaste dribble down the handle</li>
            <li> I have tried other battery operated brushes in the past but this has been my favorite</li>
            <li> I have used other battery operated toothbrushes in the past and they are ok</li>
            <li> Other than that I really like using this spinbrush .</li>
            <li> Only downfall...might get fired from my job for being late to work in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this over a regular toothbrush but think I still prefer my old sonicare brush to this one.</li>
            <li> feeling gritty or extra sensitive.</li>
            <li> I had to get used to the big head at first as the other electric toothbrushes I have have got a much smaller head</li>
            <li> the back of the brushhead was flat and not round like the Colgate Motion.    </li>
            <li> My only hold back was that the vibration is a little to excessive and causes one not to fully allow it to really get to clean the teeth.</li>
            <li> however i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for a child or an adult with a small mouth as the head of the brush is quite large.</li>
            <li> At first the bristles were way to hard for my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> The head on this brush is really chunky, which felt odd to me.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh, the bristles are not too hard to hurt the gum but hard enough to scrub the teeth.</li>
            <li> 1.The thin consistency made the recommend pea size enough since it spread so easily and evenly anyway unlike the thicker toothpastes I used before.    </li>
            <li> Clean does not mean expensive in this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It was a little to intense for my gums</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minty fresh, and doesn&#x27;t have an odd taste like some of the other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> which only moves in a fast up and down motion which for electric gives me the feeling I was using a Manuel Toothbrush!    </li>
            <li> In the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my teeth, they look a few shades whiter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very excited when I got this Arm and Hammer Toothpaste and mechanical brush because I had recently tossed my expensive spin brush after it gave up on me.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet needed to buy a new brush, so the brush lasts at least a month under normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only real negative thing I have to say is, and maybe I just haven&#x27;t learned the proper technique, that brushing with it can be a tad messy, with the toothpaste easily and quickly running down your chin.</li>
            <li> My Braun has a couple of nice touches (like a battery power display and an indication of how long you&#x27;ve been brushing and if you&#x27;re pressing too hard) but for the basic act of brushing your teeth, it&#x27;s hard to say which is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My only concern is that one night, my gums were sensitive due to a popcorn kernel that had wedged itself in, and the Spinbrush did not get it out.  </li>
            <li> I thought the batteries were dead but the next day it turned on just fine, so I&#x27;m not sure why it did that.</li>
            <li> It also is a tad on the loud side but other than that and just based on performance</li>
            <li> And, I honestly did not expect that from an inexpensive toothbrush, but was I ever wrong!  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time keeping my lips together to contain it and keep the toothpaste from flowing freely out of my mouth and down my chin.</li>
            <li> Being unaccustomed to electric toothbrushes, it was quite a weird sensation when I first started using the SpinBrush, but now that I have been using it for over a month, the degree of vibration is very tolerable.  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed is the toothbrush is heavy (which I will assume is to be expected if you consider the batteries)&lt;br</li>
            <li> For example, I believe that the circular oscillating head can provide a thorough brushing down to the gum-line without putting unnecessary stress on the gums themselves, if wielded at the appropriate angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I get less of a fresh feel after brushing); and the brush head is HUGE (not just the bristles but also the frame; very difficult to get around the back of my upper molars).</li>
            <li> I think it is a bit hard to turn on and off because the switch is pretty flush with the handle.  </li>
            <li> I was a little embarrassed by how yellow my teeth were getting, but didn&#x27;t want to shell out big bucks for professional whitening treatments.  </li>
            <li> And after brushing my teeth once the old way after having used the Spinbrush for a while, I was left with slightly aching gums.  </li>
            <li> It is a lot less expensive than the electric brushes and it is nice not to have to recharge it.</li>
            <li> So much so that I have intentionally avoided mechanized toothbrushes for years, fearing that I would become lazy and complacent about my oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I was not able to close my mouth to brush because if I did then the vibrations would hit my teeth, this would not be an issue bit when the toothpaste gets too runny, you really need to close your mouth&lt;</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t last long if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;- Flat bottom.</li>
            <li> The spinbrush has a flat bottom</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flat bottom allows it to stand</li>
            <li> on/off switch is flat</li>
            <li> I like that the bottom is flat</li>
            <li> Cons for me were that the brush felt huge and the button to turn it on sometimes sticks a little making it hard to turn on which can be aggravating.</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;ve used it for a month, and the head shows no signs of wearing down.  </li>
            <li> Such a redesign would also make it possible for individuals with arthritis and other impairments of the hand to use the product which the current design would prohibit.</li>
            <li> She likes it and it does what is supposed to, but it did not seem NEW or IMPROVED over the one she had a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I typically use a different brand of electric toothbrush and was surprised how well Spinbrush performed compared to the other more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to turn off, but difficult to turn on.</li>
            <li> slippery issue is compounded with this product as the slide switch to turn the brush on and off is made of the same slippery especially when wet plastic as the handle itself.  </li>
            <li> And because the toothbrush spins I find I usually have to stop the toothbrush and restart after I have rinsed my mouth out a little because there is so much foaming, cleaning action.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t purchase or use spin-brushes, due to the cost, but gave this a try</li>
            <li> It removed more of the staining, especially in hard to reach areas than the gel Colgate Whitening variety I was using.  </li>
            <li> I have replaced my expensive rechargeable electric brush with this new Truly Radiant Spinbrush from Arm &amp; Hammer!!!!!</li>
            <li> A little loud.</li>
            <li> The motor can be a little loud</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit loud but</li>
            <li> is that it is a little loud.  </li>
            <li> : I have very compact teeth and have a hard time sliding floss between in between them without the floss getting stuck.</li>
            <li> Oh well, I am still pleased with the results just a tad inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> My dentist surmised it was because I brushed too roughly and advised me to start using an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The only things I don&#x27;t like is that I find it quite messy to use (maybe thats just me though) because of the bigger head I have to have my moth open wider</li>
            <li> The cons which are minor:  </li>
            <li> The cons are minimal for the thorough cleaning it provides for your teeth and gums, especially when combined with the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I finally needed to replace the batteries on it and had absolutely no luck in figuring that out by reading the package instructions.  </li>
            <li> felt a bit long, tho</li>
            <li> It seemed to brush rough to me and the head was really big.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I have never used a powerbrush in the past, I felt that upgrading from my normal manual toothbrush was long overdue.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer than 5 days to &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; my teeth, but after using it for a little less than a month, I can certainly tell a difference!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always been a bit skeptical of electric toothbrushes, but from the very first time I used this brush, it was like I had just left the dentist office after a routine cleaning.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it can be difficult to turn the brush on/off and take the brush head off in order to clean it, especially if your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> Other than that I think it works just as well as a regular manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Several times I have had to pull the toothbrush out of my mouth and use the other had to force the toothbrush on sending toothpaste flying to my mirror.  </li>
            <li> Bulkier compared to other regular toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used a battery-operated toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Some toothpaste that claim to whiten are gritty, abrasive and make your teeth sensitive to hot and cold.</li>
            <li> It also deep cleans extremely well.</li>
            <li> might have used it very long time ago</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even used it a week and the battery ran dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have all the power of some other spinbrushes, and it&#x27;s a little loud to me, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was amazed at how easy it was to brush, especially getting to those hard to reach areas where I couldn&#x27;t get to with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dont like is that there&#x27;s no real easy way to store it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a person who takes their personal appearance very seriously and for that reason , teeth whitening is very high up on my list.  </li>
            <li> I also find the head of this toothbrush to be bigger than the manual toothbrush I usually use, making it difficult to clean my teeth in the back.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the vibration began, I found that the mixed liquid ( the toothpaste and my saliva ) kept dripping down along the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Most of the other one I have tried have gone bad within a month of having them and I would have to either replace it or get a different one.</li>
            <li> They should make the same brush head but in a smaller size for those with small mouths like myself.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to switch on (but hand towel quickly fixes that).&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I have tried other battery-operated toothbrushes in the past, but they are NO where near the cleaning quality and comfort of the Spinbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had other battery powered brushes in the past, but never one that spins , vibrates and goes back and fourth.</li>
            <li> it did take a little longer then 5 days to actually see results</li>
            <li> Also, it took a little getting used to because the brush part is larger then a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is the thoothpaste is a little thinner in consistency</li>
            <li> 2.The long brush head seemed a bit too wide on the upper half of the brush head unlike the lower half.  </li>
            <li> The on/off switch is clumsy, and the product is LOUD when it is on.  </li>
            <li> The one negative is it is loud.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have to say, last night I started to use it, and it was dead.</li>
            <li> my were hands wet</li>
            <li> (But if you wet the brush before you apply the paste you wont have this problem.)    </li>
            <li> It made me realize just how rough I’d been on my mouth and</li>
            <li> Another con is the the button to slide on and off has gotten harder to use( Ive had it about a month).</li>
            <li> so it gets a bit messy (no big deal</li>
            <li> will definitely repurchase in a few months to replace this one.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*It is heavy and big</li>
            <li> It was too harsh on my gums but did not apply enough pressure to my tongue and cheeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an Oral B Sonic something-or-other from a few years back, that still works and i use it sometimes.</li>
            <li> and after a few days of using this product I noticed a big change in my teeth.</li>
            <li> It may just come with the territory, but it&#x27;s a lot louder than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rattle my head and isn&#x27;t loud enough that it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use, but it&#x27;s not quiet either.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t supposed to get the handle wet, since it houses the batteries.</li>
            <li> no* idea what I was missing by using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product operated as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Slippery when wet (which it almost always will be after brushing teeth)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> another reviewer stated: if your hands are wet</li>
            <li> Brushing teeth is ALWAY going to result in a wet toothbrush handle as the hand is wet to begin with or when the moistened brush is tipped up to put in the mouth moisture</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve noticed that I splattered the front of my shirt with toothpaste if I wasn&#x27;t careful while brushing.</li>
            <li> It was bulky in my hands and when my hands were wet</li>
            <li> Using this brush required a bit of a learning curve for me – I noticed initially that if I didn’t bring the brush head slightly past the gum line and hold for a few seconds that those areas didn’t get thoroughly cleaned and I was left with lingering plaque at the gum line.  </li>
            <li> Spinbrushes make toothbrushing less of a chore early in the morning, or late at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This being the case, I have gotten into the routine of swapping between my manual brush and the Spinbrush every other day.</li>
            <li> (I have had problems with this in other brands).</li>
            <li> then some other electric brushes out there.  </li>
            <li> It seems quite a bit louder than any other thootbrushes.</li>
            <li> Not too big but not too small either.</li>
            <li> Of course, like with any product, I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> The build up i usually try to scrub off with a regular toothbrush was just gone.  </li>
            <li> due to illness)...</li>
            <li> I have used other electric toothbrushes, but they don&#x27;t even compare to this one.</li>
            <li> Its just like other tooth brushes that spin.  </li>
            <li> Other than that small issue I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one and have yet to replace my other.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to carry around my other toothbrush and charger.  </li>
            <li> Other then the loudness of the toothbrush</li>
            <li> The handle was a bit different, but I am not sure what it was.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great price compared to other powered toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> The brush and replacement heads are also inexpensive compared to other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are extremely pricey.</li>
            <li> It takes very minimal effort to achieve results I could never have with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The on button is hard to push especially once my hand was wet.</li>
            <li> First, the taste and texture of the toothpaste was slightly unpleasant, and left a burning sensation in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> , it is inevitable that the melted toothpaste usually will drip down whether you are using a manual toothbrush or an electric one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other battery toothbrushes, and i never really kept up with them, so</li>
            <li> it takes some getting use to, can be a little rough, probably user error</li>
            <li> I give it a low score because it is hard to turn on with just you thumb or finger.</li>
            <li> Being in the health care profession, I would definitely remind others not to press down too hard with this brush as you can wear away your gums if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It reaches deep down between teeth in those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Only negative</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the Phillips sonicare and the radiant was very bulky in my mouth and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I would have is that once or twice it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is it feels a bit bulky.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical that it would make that much of a difference</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this does not need a base that plugs into the wall.</li>
            <li> only thing that I can say was a negative is that the brush feels slightly bulky.</li>
            <li> Now let&#x27;s get down to business.</li>
            <li> immediately makes its way down the handle.  </li>
            <li> I can tell that it gets down into the spaces between my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And because it is recommended that heads be replaced every three months, that’s a LOT of money down the drain over time.</li>
            <li> Cleans really well, even gets those hard to reach areas like behind your molars and the backs of front teeth.  </li>
            <li> 6.The slight curve of the neck made it</li>
            <li> the handle must hold the battery and the motorized mechanisms to make the bristles move, but at the start it felt rather odd to use.</li>
            <li> I feel the small head size ( I have a small mouth) helps me reach my back teeth</li>
            <li> Still for its size I gets thats typical.</li>
            <li> I also feel an item like this should cost less.</li>
            <li> and I had to keep a washcloth under my lip to keep from making a mess.</li>
            <li> It made a bit of a mess with toothpaste everywhere for a while.</li>
            <li> After a few of these two-minute sessions, I did notice a slight improvement in the whitening of my teeth when coupled with a whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It goes up and down AND round and round</li>
            <li> (there is a little diagram on the handle) and looked at the batteries.</li>
            <li> (I just wish the brush head was a little thinner like the SC Power Up to get close to those pockets  where the gums connect to the teeth which food tends to fall.)    </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t realize how little it was doing.</li>
            <li> and I think they may have got a little bit whiter.  </li>
            <li> I started to notice my teeth a little whiter after using  Arm &amp; Hammer (tm)</li>
            <li> and it always held a little water in the brush end.</li>
            <li> However it did make her little sisters jealous</li>
            <li> However, the cleaning experience made it a little easier to take.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Motor was a little noisy</li>
            <li> There is no significant raised area on the switch to give a thumb or finger something substantial to push against to compensate for this.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that after only a couple weeks of use, the on/off switch is getting very hard to move, like there is some sort of build-up inside the handle that I can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time once this got wet to turn it off and on.</li>
            <li> The switch is a bit hard to flip on and off, that would be my only complaint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negative would be that it is hard to turn on.</li>
            <li> I had this trouble with your brushes when I ordered them before.  </li>
            <li> Just a glitch, but if you have trouble, take a look.</li>
            <li> I found this brush did a thorough job of cleaning without being overly harsh.  </li>
            <li> it was lightweight and compact, not bulky or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth after a few days.</li>
            <li> but my teeth was getting whiter and stronger everyday</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday twice a day for about a month now</li>
            <li> It was not to harsh</li>
            <li> It is kinda heavy which I dislike about it.</li>
            <li> Any one who has used an electric toothbrush knows you need to turn it off  and on a few times during each brushing.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not rocket science, but it did take me a few days to get accustomed to this brush.</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It has stopped dead a few times.</li>
            <li> manually.the spinbrush is a bit bottom heavy because of the batteries</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few of these inexpensive motorized toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been getting heavy use and works all the time.</li>
            <li> I mean I think that is just expected from just about anything electric</li>
            <li> my teeth were visibly whiter in less than a week!</li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth with the just cleaned slick feeling every time you brush and with way less toothpaste than you are used to using.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed that when I ate ice cream I didn&#x27;t cringe like I normally do, when something cold touches my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical initially but followed the directions to the dot.</li>
            <li> It was also hard to switch the toothbrush on and off if my fingers were even slightly damp.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that the vibration is a little  hard</li>
            <li> It cleans and brush away some the old nasty stuff my old toothbrush left behind.</li>
            <li> I feel like with very little work</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to family and friends except small children..</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to family and friends except small children..</li>
            <li> bristles get into all the nooks and crannies, which can be difficult with a regular brush.  </li>
            <li> (I have small hands) and</li>
            <li> It works well at making my teeth feel slick and shiny.</li>
            <li> We usually buy the manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> (Now, I will say I&#x27;m not sure if the brush by itself would do any whitening, as I haven&#x27;t used it without the whitening toothpaste.)  </li>
            <li> They are priced well and usually can be found on sale.</li>
            <li> However, in my opinion, that is a small price to pay using electric brushes.</li>
            <li> and I was a bit skeptical since I have been a longtime user of my electric toothbrush however shortly after I received this brush</li>
            <li> so I was not sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an electric toothbrush in the past, but it was years ago.  </li>
            <li> I felt the head moved just enough to help with cleaning, without being overpowering or uncomfortable.    </li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday for weeks and have not had to change the batteries yet!</li>
            <li> However, the toothpaste that came with the brush seemed thinner than my usual toothpaste, so this might have caused the spatters.</li>
            <li> I have used the waterpik, in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have tried both rechargeable electric toothbrushes as well as other brands of battery powered tooth brushes in the past, but I found the vibrating sensation unpleasant enough that I discontinued using them.  </li>
            <li> , I have small hands so that makes it a bit hard for me to control and move with the ease I would like&lt;</li>
            <li> My expensive Oral B Brush had a long slow rechargeable battery death.  </li>
            <li> I found it hard to slide the switch up to turn it on.  </li>
            <li> and there were things that made it hard to get used to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could hardly eat (plus it didn&#x27;t work all that</li>
            <li> I also had a hard time getting it rinsed well</li>
            <li> However, the bristles seem a bit hard, so don&#x27;t press too hard</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to work as hard to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I have a hard time getting the bush</li>
            <li> It gets to all the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> I found this toothbrush hard to control.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of anything negative about it.  </li>
            <li> I honestly am not a fan if this product.</li>
            <li> , I figured that I had to at least give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Also, the power switch is difficult to turn on and off if your hands get wet.</li>
            <li> Prior to using the Arm &amp; Hammer truly radiant toothpaste , I had lots of sensitivity to cold things.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaint about it.</li>
            <li> This was a bit awkward since it is necessary to grab the brush in order to twist it off.  </li>
            <li> Too painful for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> y&#x27;all know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is battery operated making it much less expensive</li>
            <li> They should surround the brush head&#x27;s hard plastic with thin rubber to serve as a sort of bumper.  </li>
            <li> It fits in the hard to reach places and gets behind teeth.  </li>
            <li> not too bad considering they last for 2 to 3 months before needing replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was some serious vibration in my teeth, which was not exactly pleasant.  </li>
            <li> This combination of an already slippery handle and water is not a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vibration feels weak.</li>
            <li> I was not very impressed with the spinbrush.</li>
            <li> The handle is not too thick for a powered brush, but the head is a little wide and I kept bumpking my teeth with it, which was when the worst of the brain-vibration happened.</li>
            <li> They should make behind the head thinner similiar like the Sonic Care Power Up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine a month and have not had to replace the batteries yet and have not experienced battery drain weakness.</li>
            <li> I told him that&#x27;s not necessary because we can just buy some brush head replacements and share the base.</li>
            <li> The base of the Spinbrush isn&#x27;t too big, I can grip it well.</li>
            <li> We have tried several children&#x27;s Bruges and hated them.</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to turn on or off sometimes.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the switch can be difficult and I wish I could replace the heads.</li>
            <li> So sorry)</li>
            <li> The head is difficult to remove when you are trying to replace it which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> so I know my teeth are not perfect but after using these products together</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a sonicare spin brush because they are much to expensive for me</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after a week of use the toothbrush turns on and off by itself.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about using a battery operated toothbrush, but the Truly Radiant Spinbrush did the trick.</li>
            <li> but they are always so expensive.</li>
            <li> I am still getting used to the flavor though, it leaves a weird after taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Difficult to turn on and off.</li>
            <li> im not a fan of electric or battery powered tooth brushes but this did prove me wrong</li>
            <li> but I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was always against battery operated toothbrushes because I thought they were silly</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the cost of long-term loyalty has alienated me a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem with these brushes is the replacement heads are very expensive.</li>
            <li> it was almost impossible to maneuver the toothbrush around my teeth.</li>
            <li> I mentioned, just because some things do not work for me, it does not make it a bad toothbrush</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it was terrible.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush, but I hate that toothpaste!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the spinbrush pro fro years. It&#x27;s really great at first because it gives an electric toothbrush clean for less... at first. The problem with these brushes is the replacement heads are very expensive. They also don&#x27;t last long if you follow the instructions. If I threw these out every time the head&#x27;s color depleted i would be paying 7 bucks a month to brush my teeth. It&#x27;s really great but I think 7 bucks a replacement head is just so pricey.</li>
            <li> a nice inexpensive toothbrush, this was my second one like this (I don&#x27;t know if it is the exact same model), the first lasted me a few years and had only recently started to show its age.  and so far this new one works like a champ.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush, not as abrasive as other spin brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past...totally saw a significant difference within a week of using it!</li>
            <li> I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep Clean from smiley360 for free to test...These are my own opinions..I&#x27;m not one to use spinbrusht but i do like this one...First time i used it my teeth felt smooth and clean like after you get a cleaning from the dentist..It&#x27;s been over a month and i still use it and my teeth still feels smooth and clean..I think it&#x27;s way better than a regular toothbrush...I would recommend this to family and friends except small children..</li>
            <li> I like to get extras of a product I know I will use for years.</li>
            <li> The Truly Radiant Family oral care products are the most effective and affordable on the market.The Spinbrush Radiant Deep Clean Manual Toothbrush head has my favorite setup - a round spinning head, along with a wider lower head that is also mechanized, rather than just fixed is engineered to get the most out of your average alkaline AA batteries, this spinbrush really gets my teeth clean - better than any of the bargain motorized toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve tried in the past!&lt;br /&gt;Also the NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER Truly Radiant Rejuvenating Toothpaste gave me a great clean smile.&lt;br /&gt;Truly Radiant Whitening &amp; Strengthening Fluoride Rinse prevents stains without alcohol or peroxide, 2 components the most other brands can&#x27;t remove to be effective.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter for Christmas, she loves it!</li>
            <li> Very good electric toothbrush that works on Batteries, so it&#x27;s real handy and can also be taken on camping trips etc. The head of the brush is nice and big, not like these dinky electric toothbrush heads, typical to most of the other brands. And the price is awesome. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Got here super fast i love it</li>
            <li> Nice spinbrush.A little loud.But I can live with that.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush works great but very loud!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a great cheap electric option. It works as expected. My only qualm with it is the power switch. It can be difficult to turn on or off sometimes. This would be much improved with a push button!</li>
            <li> Had one before nad i still use it.. just another one to have two and probably replace older one soon</li>
            <li> I love ❤ this brush really does magic definitely buying again</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great for those who don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars on the fancy electric toothbrushes.  This works great and is under $10.  I can&#x27;t think of anything negative about it.  The batteries last pretty long and are changeable.  Also you can by new brush heads on amazon or at walmart.  This could easily sell for much more money with the quality it provides.  I&#x27;ll definitely be getting this again if mine breaks.</li>
            <li> Overall, a pretty decent toothbrush. I felt like the bristles wore down kind of fast, but I think that might actually be due to my own brushing technique (brushing too hard).</li>
            <li> My gums get sore after using it! Now that&#x27;s DEEP cleaning</li>
            <li> the best. does a great job.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush- I prefer it to the more expensive electronic toothbrushes because of the height of the brush itself. The bottom half goes back and forth and the top circle rotates clockwise/counter clockwise. I leave the house feeling like I have such a clean mouth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and used quite a few of these over the past years and it&#x27;s safe to say I love them.  I like to simplify things in my life so I wanted an electric toothbrush that cleans more efficiently than I would by manually brushing and don&#x27;t clutter my sink with cords.  My dentist and my dental hygienist seem to agree that it is definitely doing its job.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I previously had to go through 2 of the same kind from a different brand and it was terrible. But this is so much better. Yes, it is somewhat loud, but that doesn&#x27;t matter much because it is strong and does an excellent job at brushing. I&#x27;m very happy with this brush. The bristles are soft and I thought that was going to be an issue but it&#x27;s not at all. My teeth feel great after using.</li>
            <li> this is fantastic... my 2 year old uses this and loves it</li>
            <li> After replacing the batteries the dang thing won&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves work really well; however, the on/off switch quits working very quickly and the only way to turn it on or off is to remove the battery compartment complete.  I had this trouble with your brushes when I ordered them before.  I would think you could find somewhere besides China to have these manufactured so they would be better quality and last longer.</li>
            <li> I got to try this out as I received it as a free sample and really liked it.  Well made and good shape for holding.  Definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep Clean from smiley360 for free to test...These are my own opinions..I&#x27;m not one to use spinbrusht but i do like this one...First time i used it my teeth felt smooth and clean like after you get a cleaning from the dentist..It&#x27;s been over a month and i still use it and my teeth still feels smooth and clean..I think it&#x27;s way better than a regular toothbrush...I would recommend this to family and friends except small children..</li>
            <li> I love my Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush Truly Radiant Deep Clean Soft Powered Toothbrush!  It feels like when I brush my teeth they get that &amp;#34;dental office&amp;#34; cleanliness.  I&#x27;ve used the regular Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush for several years now and totally love them too.  I always get the soft bristles because that&#x27;s what the dentist recommends.  I guess the best part of the Truly Radiant variance is that it has little bristles that stick out further in some places on the head that feel like they get in between hard to get places better than the other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush, would buy it, and would recommend it to friends and family.  In fact my sister bought one for both my parents.  She has to use a toothbrush with a tiny head, so she couldn&#x27;t take advantage of the Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush Truly Radiant Deep Clean Soft Powered Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.”</li>
            <li> I tried the samples of Arm and Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste , mouthwash and the new Spin brush. They all work really great and I love the spin brush. It is a manual toothbrush so no batteries or plugs required . It spins as you brush and my mouth felt so clean after using all three products..  I have purchased the spin brush for every member of our household!</li>
            <li> I received this product for free to review and the review is 100% my own. This product is AMAZING!! I&#x27;ve used and each time I use it my teeth feel like I just left the dentist it gets my teeth that clean. My friends even noticed that my teeth were whiter it works that good! Sometimes you find a forever type of product that you will use forever and that is what this product is for me!</li>
            <li> This brush is working great. Love the longer bristles which seem to clean teeth better than my previous spinbrush. Great price too!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was all that!!! It worked awesome along with the truly rafiant toothpaste.It was so coolI received a Sample of Arm and Hammer truly Radiant for free!!The toothbrush and Truly radiant toothpaste I received as  free Sample</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of electric toothbrushes, and those with replaceable batteries like this one are my favorites. This brush has long bristles and a more powerful action than the Oral B I have been using. It really cleans my teeth and gums! I have to say, last night I started to use it, and it was dead. I opened it up (there is a little diagram on the handle) and looked at the batteries. I was surprised to see that they were a good brand of alkalines. There was one problem, though. Both were facing the same direction. Uh oh. I turned one around and it works fine again. Just a glitch, but if you have trouble, take a look. That&#x27;s a super simple thing to do, though. I am probably going to order another one of these for my husband.</li>
            <li> I got to try this free from Smiley360 and it works pretty well. I don&#x27;t normally use spinbrushes but as far as spinbrushes go I did like it. I did not notice a huge difference long term but right after brushing my teeth with this brush my teeth did feel smooth like I just got a dentist cleaning. Other than that I think it works just as well as a regular manual toothbrush. When using this brush with the Arm and Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste I think it did work well and my mouth felt very clean!</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This product is a &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; Spinbrush with new bristle design. It IS NOT compatible with the &amp;#34;Truly Radiant Sonic&amp;#34; refills that Amazon pairs it with.  I wish the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; action brush was actually available on Amazon, but I doesn&#x27;t seem to be.</li>
            <li> I signed up for the Radiant Toothpaste and spinbrush campaign on Smiley360. Both were free for me to try for my review. I&#x27;m submitting my opinion of using the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush. This was my first time using an electric toothbrush of spinbrush of any type. I loved the brush head,  it had plenty of bristles to give you a deep and thorough clean. I couldn&#x27;t help but notice that the vibration is a little  hard and it&#x27;s really loud.  Other than those two drawbacks the spinbrush cleans well and leaves your teeth smooth and shiny. The bristles are soft and non-abrasive. I really like the Truly Radiant Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this spin-brush.  I received this Truly Radiant spin-brush along with the toothpaste free through Smiley360.  I generally don&#x27;t purchase or use spin-brushes, due to the cost, but gave this a try and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  My teeth feel extremely clean and doesn&#x27;t feel like the enamel was scrubbed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles get into all the nooks and crannies, which can be difficult with a regular brush.  I highly recommend it.  I receivedd this product for free for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> Lucky me the site Smiley360 (Which I just joined a short while ago) choose me to be a part of the NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER Truly Radiant Mission.  This meant they would send me a package which contained all this...    #1 Full Size Tube of their Truly Radiant Toothpaste.  #1 Truly Radiant Spinbrush. (Mind you this was before either one could be found in stores!)    In return all I had to do was brush my teeth with these for the tube&#x27;s avertised twice a day for the lengh five days.    (To see pictures of  the Toothbrushes I compare in this review go to [...]  )    What I liked about the Spinbrush  -------------------------------------  1.It&#x27;s much more powerful than my old Colgate Motion Electric Toothbrush!  (Which I liked it&#x27;s shorter round brush head but it seemed more like a toy with the little power it had.)    It even felt like with that kind of power the Spinbrush moved on its own!  Unlike when I used the mouth quake shaking teeth knocking Sonic Power Up  which only moves in a fast up and down motion which for electric gives me the feeling I was using a Manuel Toothbrush!    2.The Upper half of the head which moves in a fast circular motion made it easy to get any food out of my crowns in just one pass  and when I used it on my front teeth I noticed this polished my teeth very well.(I relized this on my third brushing!.)    3.The Lower half of the head moves in a fast right to left Motion which did a wonderful job in brushing the side of the rows of teeth which I really can&#x27;t see.  (I just wish the brush head was a little thinner like the SC Power Up to get close to those pockets  where the gums connect to the teeth which food tends to fall.)    4.The long orange bristles that stick out of the brush head&#x27;s Upper and Lower part make it so even one as myself who doesn&#x27;t really like flossing for the time it should take   can still reach all those slits inbetween the teeth which food always seems to find a way in.(Not to mention these prevent any paste from sinking into your bristles.)    5.The slender handle that gives me a much better grip than my old fat rounded yet nicely rubber texture handle on the Colgate Motion.  (It even has less bulk than the SC Up which felt more like a brick in the hand.)    6.The slight curve of the neck made it so I didn&#x27;t have much of a gag reflex when brushing towards the back as when I brushed with the C Motion/SC Up.    7.That the back of the brushhead was flat and not round like the Colgate Motion.    What I didn&#x27;t like about the Spinbush  ---------------------------------------  1.When my were hands wet I found it hard to slide the switch up to turn it on.  (In this situation I always found myself reaching for a nearby towel.)    2.The long brush head seemed a bit too wide on the upper half of the brush head unlike the lower half.  (Because of this I found it a chore to brush the sides without bumping the upper white plastic that connects the brush head to the toothbrush into the surrounding teeth. )    3.That the brush head requires me to grip it on the bottom while trying to avoid sqeezing the bristles with my hand as I turn it towards the right to remove it compared to the SC Up&#x27;s easily grip bottom and pull up.    My Advice to Arm and Hammer to make this the best of the electric toothbrushes  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    They should surround the brush head&#x27;s hard plastic with thin rubber to serve as a sort of bumper.  They should make the same brush head but in a smaller size for those with small mouths like myself.  They should add rubber texure around the handle or something similar to the Colgate&#x27;s Motion handle so wet hands can keep a better grip of the toothbrush.  They should make behind the head thinner similiar like the Sonic Care Power Up. (Which made it easier for me to brush in the gumline.)  They should give the brush a push button like the Sonic Care Power Up to power it on instead of a slide switch.    What I likedabout the Arm and Hammer Truly Radiant Tooth Paste  -----------------------------------------------------------------  1.The thin consistency made the recommend pea size enough since it spread so easily and evenly anyway unlike the thicker toothpastes I used before.    (The others made it so I would have to use one pea size for the top row and another for the bottom row.)    2.It didn&#x27;t have that strong mint taste that burns like the Big Red Chewing Gum.    3.The Mint effect was so effective that even when I was done brushing I could still taste it!  (Even my pet parrot and lovebird were able to smell it on my breath!)    4.That my teeth were quite strong after just 3 days twice a day brushing with this toothpaste!  (I was so sure of this I ate a bag of hard crunchy pretzels which most people would agree they were past crispy and more on the hard as a rock side. )    5.That I could see more of the whitening of my teeth on just the third brushing mind you this was after the 1st brushing of day two.(Yeah It wasn&#x27;t noticeable to me on the first day after two brushings.)  On the fourth day after the first brushing I was loving my teeth which were so pearly white there was no way to see any stains from my ice coffee drinking.    6.After five days of brushing twice a day my teeth were really Truly Radiant as advertised ! (Every other whiting toothpaste I ever tried never worked as good as this!)    What I didn&#x27;t like about the tooth paste  ---------------------------------------------------  Because of the light consistency of the paste it would easily fly off the tooth brush when switched on or either the force from the  faucet&#x27;s rushing water would knock it clean of the brush and down the drain!  (But if you wet the brush before you apply the paste you wont have this problem.)    I bet you all are wondering are you still going to keep using this brush?  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Yes, I will!  Because brushing feels lessboring and gets done way sooner than ever!.    Just so you all know \\&quot;I received Arm and Hammer Truley Radiant Spinbrush and Toothpaste for free. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a good battery powered toothbrush. Since I have an electric toothbrush at home I want something with comparable power for my travels. This one certainly works very well. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh, the bristles are not too hard to hurt the gum but hard enough to scrub the teeth. The &#x27;On&#x27; switch is covered with a rubber surface so no slipping of fingers, the battery compartment is sealed with an O-ring and the bristles have a color indicator to show when it is time to change the brush head. Two pieces of information: the brush does not have a plastic cover for head which is nice to have for travels and the brush does work with rechargeable batteries but the power is noticeably reduce, so I won&#x27;t use them. Overall, a very convenient, powerful battery operated toothbrush that I can certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting anything from an electric brush this cheap, but other than being noisy and using regular batteries, it seems just as good as my Braun rechargeable that cost literally 10x more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is good too. I thought that would be an easy win for the rechargeables -- that this one made me go through batteries a lot -- but I&#x27;ve used it for 2-3 minutes 2-3 times a day for 3 weeks and I&#x27;m still on the battery that it came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mechanically it seems about the same as the Braun. Replaceable head, back-and-forth rotation. My Braun has a couple of nice touches (like a battery power display and an indication of how long you&#x27;ve been brushing and if you&#x27;re pressing too hard) but for the basic act of brushing your teeth, it&#x27;s hard to say which is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think if you&#x27;re looking for a main toothbrush you might come out better in the long run with a rechargeable but if you just want something effective to throw in your suitcase, this is definitely a good choice.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this Truly Radiant Spinbrush, my teeth immediately felt cleaner and smoother. I&#x27;m not a fan of battery powered toothbrushes, but this one is great! One thing that I really dislike about this product is that it&#x27;s really loud. I get up early in the morning for work and the whole house knows when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth because they hear the Spinbrush. Other than the loud noise, it really is a great toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I honestly am not a fan if this product. I don&#x27;t think my teeth were any cleaner using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product from Smiley360</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush for free to try from Smiley360. This is my new favorite toothbrush. Every time I use it, I feel like I have just been to the dentist. After just two minutes of brushing, my teeth are literally squeaky clean. After the first couple of uses, my gums did bleed a little, but that was probably because they are not used to such a deep clean and probably needed it! I am very happy with this product, and I have recommended it to all of my family and friends. I am planning to buy a bunch of these to use as stocking stuffers this Christmas!! It does work best with used with the Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Brush is ok.  I much prefer the Sonic Care.  The head on this brush is really chunky, which felt odd to me.  It will get your teeth clean, just not my favorite of the electric toothbrushes.  For me, the Sonic Care does a better job of getting in the gum line.</li>
            <li> My gums have been receding for the last year or so.  My dentist surmised it was because I brushed too roughly and advised me to start using an electric toothbrush.  The brand they recommended, however, was a bit too pricey for me (Sonicare) so I shopped around.  When the opportunity arose for me to try this battery-powered brush through Amazon Vine, I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spinbrush comes courtesy of Arm &amp; Hammer, is reasonably priced at just under $10 (replacement brush heads are priced similarly at just under $10 for 2 heads), and does an admirable job at keeping my teeth clean while being gentle on my gums.  The top portion of the brush head rotates while the bottom portion vibrates, providing varying cleaning techniques and ensuring more complete plaque removal.  Batteries are purported to last 4-6 weeks for someone who brushes their teeth for 2 minute intervals twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is nice - it doesn’t feel too clunky or oversized in my hand (I have small hands) and it’s lightweight.  Being unaccustomed to electric toothbrushes, it was quite a weird sensation when I first started using the SpinBrush, but now that I have been using it for over a month, the degree of vibration is very tolerable.  Using this brush required a bit of a learning curve for me – I noticed initially that if I didn’t bring the brush head slightly past the gum line and hold for a few seconds that those areas didn’t get thoroughly cleaned and I was left with lingering plaque at the gum line.  Since figuring that out, using the SpinBrush has been very easy and a 2-minute minimum brushing session provides a just-left-the-dentist quality clean.  And after brushing my teeth once the old way after having used the Spinbrush for a while, I was left with slightly aching gums.  It made me realize just how rough I’d been on my mouth and how wise it was for me to make the switch from manual to electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who want an affordable electric toothbrush that does a good job, the SpinBrush is a safe bet.ob, the SpinBrush is a safe bet.</li>
            <li> I am very particular in my tooth-brushing habits. So much so that I have intentionally avoided mechanized toothbrushes for years, fearing that I would become lazy and complacent about my oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was given the opportunity to try the Spinbrush, I figured that I had to at least give it a shot. I have to say, I was/am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In certain respects I have come to prefer the Spinbrush. For example, I believe that the circular oscillating head can provide a thorough brushing down to the gum-line without putting unnecessary stress on the gums themselves, if wielded at the appropriate angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, because of its relatively bulky size, appropriate angles are not always, or at least easily, achievable with the Spinbrush. This being the case, I have gotten into the routine of swapping between my manual brush and the Spinbrush every other day. Overall, I think that the Spinbrush has contributed to an improvement in my broader routine, and consequent oral cleanliness.</li>
            <li> I have an electric powered brush and tried this one to see how it would compare and was pleasantly surprised.  The brush is lightweight, and stands upright on the counter.  The top round part of the brush &amp;#34;spins&amp;#34; and the lower bristles vibrate.  It does not  irritate my sensitive teeth pressure-wise (I have had problems with this in other brands). This brush also gets in between the teeth and polishes the enamel well.  It does what it purports to do and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> And, I honestly did not expect that from an inexpensive toothbrush, but was I ever wrong!  It actually does a better cleaning than the Oral-B I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s loud and that might put some users off, but the end result means more to me and I am buying another one of these for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Spinbrush based on my experience with it.</li>
            <li> This battery operated toothbrush by Arm &amp; Hammer (Spinbrush) cleans your teeth wonderfully with two swiftly rotating brush heads that clean your teeth all around. I love Arm &amp; Hammer products because they are reasonably priced and they work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 stars for this product. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the freshness my mouth felt after using this toothpaste. Not only did it leave my mouth feeling fresh but my teeth were whiter as well and felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample, this is a review on the same product listed. I love my spin brush! It is very thorough in it&#x27;s cleaning power. The switch is a bit hard to flip on and off, that would be my only complaint. It cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I recieved a free sample from Arm and Hammer to try their spin brush. All I can say is I love it and it&#x27;s a must buy!! It fits in my small hand perfect as well as my mouth.</li>
            <li> Better than manual tooth brush, but I think the sonic brush is better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have both and I think I can really feel a difference of how it did when I use it to brush my teeth. I believe I can feel a better job of cleaning when I use the sonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as I said, it is better than a manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. I really enjoy the fact that it really does do a great job of cleaning your teeth. The only problem i could see anyone having is replacing the brush heads, but when you think of the great way this toothbrush works it really is worth it. It really does feel like your eethe are getting a deep clean from using this brush. The motor can be a little loud but that isnt unusual for battery powered toothbrushes. this one is definitly more affordable than others andworks great. I did try this as a free product but will continue to buy replacment heads and use it until it gives out</li>
            <li> I love the free sample of the Truly Radiant Spin brush and toothpaste I received from Smiley360. The brush cleans well and massages. The paste is minty fresh and pleasant. When you combine the two its amazing. Leaves your mouth feeling dentist office clean. I&#x27;ve been using this combo for awhile and I can really tell a difference.  I dont like to floss every day and this really helps. I think everyone should try this brush and paste.</li>
            <li> best tooth brush ever</li>
            <li> After receiving a free sample of the new Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant battery-powered toothbrush to try, I was very pleased with the results.  The bristles on this are not too hard and with the spinning action, I felt that it did a much better job cleaning my teeth than a manual toothbrush did.  After using this, my teeth felt a lot smoother and cleaner.  Not only did this Spinbrush toothbrush do a better job cleaning, but I felt it was able to reach places/crevices in my teeth that a regular manual toothbrush can&#x27;t.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electronic toothbrush before. I really like it! Sometimes the switch can be difficult and I wish I could replace the heads. Seems like a waste to throw the whole thing away.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH!! I have only been using a manual tooth brush and I didn&#x27;t realize how little it was doing. Now every day I feel like I just got my teeth cleaned at the Dentist. LOVE and highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush as a free sample and I was truly amazed! It was gentle on my teeth and gums without the rough bristles that some battery controlled toothbrushes have.A plus is it removes 100% more plaque because its bristles are elongated.The brush head is removable and replaceable so the toothbrush is a good choice.FYI:DO NOT SUBMERGE IN WATER(Unit can become damaged).</li>
            <li> I received the spinbrush Truly Radiant free from Smiley 360 and it is the best tooth brush I have ever used. The spinbrush gets in between my teeth and I can get the back of my teeth where manual tooth brushes can&#x27;t. I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone!!</li>
            <li> (received this toothbrush for free via Smiley 360) Gotta say I don&#x27;t \\&quot;love\\&quot; this toothbrush, after having a Sonicare. It just doesn&#x27;t compare. The on/off switch is clumsy, and the product is LOUD when it is on.  Also the head seems large and doesn&#x27;t fit well between my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and used the Spin brush Truly Radiant with the same brand toothpaste and was very impressed with the cleaning power. The bristles on the brush were soft but the amount of power the toothbrush had was overwhelming. I have to be very careful because of the power, the toothpaste has a strong baking soda taste, but it was great for brushing my teeth and leaving them clean and white, Smiley 360 offers great opportunities to receive free products tor try and let consumers know how well it works. I honestly like the toothbrush but not the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> So happy to have tried this out...as the has gone by my teeth have yellowed. I am grateful that this has come along. I found this extremely easy and quick, lots of great results and it just keeps getting better and better</li>
            <li> it does the job but it&#x27;s real noisy</li>
            <li> I got for free from Smiley 360. this Spinbrush and Truly Radiant toothpaste and I love it. I was a manual toothbrush user but not anymore. My mouth feels fresh and clean and my teeth has gotten whiter in 5 days. Try it and you will see. It worked for me. :)</li>
            <li> Received this product free through Smiley 360 for purpose of trying then reviewing. The toothpaste itself is awesome and the spinbrush is amazing! Very effective combination. I don&#x27;t believe my teeth have ever felt this clean :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently tried using this toothbrush and I love it!  I also own a oral-b electric toothbrush. I like this arm and hammer spin brush for traveling. It&#x27;s more affordable if I were to lose it and it does a decent job on cleaning my teeth compared to the oral-b.  It&#x27;s very gentle as well which the oral-b isn&#x27;t as much. I did feel a deep clean feeling after.  Also great paired with truly brilliant arm and hammer toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the arm and hammer spin brush free for reviewing purposes: review is 100% my own opinion.</li>
            <li> Smiley360.com sent me a tube of Truly Radiant toothpaste &amp; the battery operated Trult Radiant Spinbrush , both ftom Arm &amp; Hammer. I used to think their toothpaste was gritty so I never used it. They have completely reformulated it; between using the new toothpaste and the extra scrubbing from the battery operated toothbrush, my teeth have never felt so clean outside of a dental cleaning! I am a very blunt, honest person; &amp; if I didn&#x27;t like this product, you woyld know it regardless of their gifting it to me. I DO highly recommend you try both the brush &amp; the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! I received this as a free sample for a survey and it works great!  It really gets your teeth clean!</li>
            <li> I love it works really good. The first time I tried it I was amazed about how shinny clean my teeth looked. I keep feeling my teeth they felt so smooth I love that feeling. From now on this will be favorite toothbrush !!! It&#x27;s a must try u have to try it what do you have to lose? Come on now ;) try it I promise u will like it. I received this for testing purposes from smiley360</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from Smiley360 and I love this toothbrush. My teeth feel cleaner than they have in years. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have never been one to use electric toothbrushes b/c the sound always drove me crazy but I gave this one a try and was super impressed with the deep clean results! It cleans so much better than a manual toothbrush and using it along with ARM &amp; HAMMER Truly Radiant Toothpaste my teeth were visibly whiter in less than a week! I was defiantly impressed! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with my paintbrush.  It makes my teeth feel deeply cleaned, and fresh.  I feel like it doesn&#x27;t miss a spot.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Good speed and leaves teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Hi, I received my spinbrush Truly Radiant toothbrush from Smiley 360 and have enjoyed using it over the past month.  Although I wish it was a bit smaller for the size of my teeth, it really does clean well.  When you are done brushing, you can actually tell that your teeth are cleaner.  Cleans much better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  My mouth feels clean when i use it.  I also have a permanent retainer on the back of my bottom teeth and it helps clean around it very well too.  I hope to use this toothbrush for awhile. I recieved this toothbrush for free but 100% my own opinion on this.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. With that being said, I am thrilled I was picked for this mission. My teeth feel so much cleaner and I noticed my teeth getting whiter every day. I was a regular toothbrush kind of girl but since I got it in the mail and it was free, what the heck. You really can&#x27;t imagine how clean you know you&#x27;re getting your teeth with the Spinbrush.  Match it up with the Truly Radiant toothpaste and you&#x27;re in for a treat.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brush, it gave me a professional cleaning feel after using. I will be purchasing more.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!  I gave it a 4/5 because I haven&#x27;t had great luck with battery life but the actual product works wonderfully.  I use with the Truly Radiant Toothpaste and have found my teeth to feel cleaner and appear whiter!  Note:  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received an Arm &amp; Hammer spinbrush &amp; a tube of Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste from Smiley360 for free to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had not used a battery powered toothbrush since I was a kid.  When I started using this, it left my mouth feeling really clean &amp; fresh. I love how the spinbrush works to clean every tooth. It took some time to get used to the &amp;#34;tickling&amp;#34; feeling on my nose.  My daughter watches me brush my teeth &amp; she wanted a toothbrush like mommy&#x27;s, so we bought her the kid version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the toothpaste, I loved the flavor.  It didn&#x27;t have a strong minty flavor like most toothpastes. It left my mouth feeling really fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product states that it promises visible results in five days.  I decided to do a before and after five days pic.  It seemed as though my teeth were whiter in the before pic.  I was using a whitening mouthwash &amp; didn&#x27;t start this toothpaste &amp; toothbrush until I was finished with that, so I think that might have affected the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I still loved the toothpaste &amp; the spinbrush &amp; will likely continue to use them.  My next dental appointment isn&#x27;t until November, so I won&#x27;t have any information on how this affected my dental health until after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information &amp; coupons, click this link: http://h5.sml360.com/-/53ir&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on Smiley360, click this link: http://h5.sml360.com/-/9od&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Again, I received these products for free from Smiley360 &amp; the opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush gets my teeth feeling clean. It works well at making my teeth feel slick and shiny. The cons about this toothbrush is the noise level. It annoys my family when I use it and sounds quite loud to me. Another con is the the button to slide on and off has gotten harder to use( Ive had it about a month).</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. I have extremely sensitive teeth and have struggled with cavities and abscess for years.The brush cleans so deep I feel dentist clean, yet the head is gentle enough my teeth and gums don&#x27;t hurt. I bought a second to try on my daughter who hates cleaning her teeth. She loves hers and can&#x27;t wait to use it. We have tried several children&#x27;s Bruges and hated them. Keeping an eye out for kids versions. I have two girls waiting :)</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush as a free sample to review and I am very pleased!  This is my first battery operated toothbrush and it blows my manual brush out of the water!  I have converted to a much cleaner mouth with the push of a button!</li>
            <li> I love my spin brush. this was my first one and I will continue using Arm &amp; Hammer Brand. makes your teeth feel as clean as they can be . use along with Arm &amp; Hammer truely radiant toothpaste</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Smiley 360 of Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste and spin brush toothbrush for the purpose of giving my personal opinion. I have used them for a week now, and I love both.  The toothbrush is better than any battery operated toothbrush I have tried in the past and the toothpaste is great! I can see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth and the taste is very pleasant! I recommend both!</li>
            <li> I like this.  I like that the head has bristles of different lengths.  It doesn&#x27;t buzz too intensely.  I think it is a bit hard to turn on and off because the switch is pretty flush with the handle.  I would buy this, it is especially nice for traveling because you don&#x27;t need to worry about recharging.  Thanks to Smiley 360, for the free product!  I appreciated the chance to test this out.</li>
            <li> I received this free for review from smily360. So glad I did! I have had other battery powered brushes in the past, but never one that spins , vibrates and goes back and fourth. It is a deep clean! The name truly radiant really fits this product. my teeth are whiter , stronger and just feel wonderful. I would recommend this brush for people who have a hard time brushing, I swear it does all the work on its own! I am going to buy these for my whole family!</li>
            <li> To be up front I received this brush along with a tube of truly radiant toothpaste free.  The views expressed here are my own.  I really liked this brush.  I have many dental issues (genetic) and must be very careful when I brush my teeth.  I found this brush did a thorough job of cleaning without being overly harsh.  Using the brush in combination with Truly Radiant toothpaste I saw a distinct difference in the appearance of my teeth in under a weeks time while brushing at least three times a day.  One of the best benefits was the lasting effects of the clean feeling I had after brushing.  I have used brushes where that feeling passed in a matter of minutes but that wasn&#x27;t the case here.  The clean feeling literally lasted for hours.  I also loved the taste of the toothpaste, it wasn&#x27;t overpowering but left a refreshing taste after brushing.  The design of this brush, i.e. the bristle configuration made it much more effective in cleaning my back teeth as well as between teeth.  I also like that it is battery operated making it much less expensive then some other electric brushes out there.  I would have given it five stars if it had a rubber grip and was fully submersible for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive the Spinbrush Truly Radiant toothbrush and toothpaste as a mission via smiley 360.  Opinions are all my own.  I really enjoyed using both products they left my teeth whiter and feeling very fresh.  Products are definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li> received this product for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.”. I did not expect much of the Spinbrush as I have been using other electric tooth brushes for years and am really happy with their results. However the Spinbrush really exceeded my expectations and I will certainly continue to use it. Its so easy to use and feels good in your hands. I had to get used to the big head at first as the other electric toothbrushes I have have got a much smaller head but I do actually believe that the bigger head makes it easier to clean your teeth and it gives you a feeling of a deep clean. I have never felt my teeth so clean before. I also think that the big head reduced the time you need to brush your teeth as it reaches more teeth at once. The only things I don&#x27;t like is that I find it quite messy to use (maybe thats just me though) because of the bigger head I have to have my moth open wider so it gets a bit messy (no big deal but I thought I mention it) and the noise it makes. It seems quite a bit louder than any other thootbrushes. but again its something you get used to. All in all I can highly recommend the Spinbrush from Arm&amp;Hammer and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever.Gives thorough cleaning and gentle on the gums.I have noticed a significant difference in my Oral health since trying this.Free from Smiley360. Would recommend this brush to everyone.</li>
            <li> Received this as a free sample from Smiley360!&lt;br /&gt;I loved how easy to use and powerful this toothbrush is.&lt;br /&gt;I love how the toothbrush is light and compact</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, love the spinning action. Leaves teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample to review and my opinions are my own.  I really like this toothbrush. I&#x27;m used to using manual brushes so using this was a nice upgrade.  I like how clean my teeth feel after using this toothbrush. It is also a more affordable option thzn getting a high end electric toothbrush. The only thing I dont like is that there&#x27;s no real easy way to store it. If you keep it standing up, it falls over easily. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing if this makes a difference at my next dental check up.</li>
            <li> I got this spinbrush and arrm &amp; hammer toothpaste for free from smiley for the purpose of trying it out and offering a review. The opinion is 100% my own and I have to say I have been extremely impressed by the whitening and how clean my teeth feel. I have teeth that are very close together and I have noticed a difference in between them as to the cleanliness. I have been telling everyone how happy I am with these products. A battery powered toothbrush with this much power is a steal and I am Truly Radiant now.</li>
            <li> This spin brush offers great surface area for cleaning teeth. The round top portion glides easily around and behind my wisdom teeth. The feel is fairly chintzy. Plastic construction makes me worry the switch may malfunction eventually. So far it has been performing well. As with any electric toothbrush, you have to get used to the feeling of the vibrations...tickles your mouth.I received this brush for free for providing my review. The opinions stated here are my own.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste and great tooth brush it did take a little longer then 5 days to actually see results but my teeth have never looked better not to mention my breath too. I have received this product to test out and my opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> i loved the toothbrush myself and this is actually my very FIRST time every using any type of battery operated toothbrush...i am hooked and will be buying some for my family here soon!!</li>
            <li> Simply the BEST toothbrush I have ever used. I love that it now has the indicators on the brush head to let me know when it is time to change them out. Yes, the initial brush is close to $8 (at Wal-Mart at least) and the set of 2 replacement heads is the same price, but it is worth the money and really saves more in the long run for your wallet. I know that my dentist told me a few years ago to stop using a manual brush and to convert to this brush because it works better and does more in the same amount of time as using a manual brush.</li>
            <li> received this brush to review and this is 100% of my personal opinion. this spinbrush is so thorough at cleaning i feel so refreshed every time. the bristles hold up really well and i am always left feeling well maintained. will definitely repurchase in a few months to replace this one. definitely recommend to everyone. give it a try!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Spinbrush!  My teeth have never felt cleaner and it is so easy to use.  I even brush my tongue - very gentle yet extremely effective!  Thank you Arm &amp; Hammer!</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush free to try through Smiley360. While it has the great ability to brush in all the hard to reach places, I found that it was quite messy while doing it. It may be because the head of the brush is so big but it ends up pushing a lot of the toothpaste out of your mouth and I had to keep a washcloth under my lip to keep from making a mess. It does a great job of cleaning your teeth and while I prefer the rechargeable type, this one was powerful enough to get my teeth feeling very clean. I&#x27;ve had mine a month and have not had to replace the batteries yet and have not experienced battery drain weakness.</li>
            <li> Awesome and inexpensive.  I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> this brush is awesome its the best 1 out there i got mine for free on smiley360</li>
            <li> This Spinbrush is the best powered toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever tired. I received it free courtesy of Smiley360. The Dual-Action brush head does an excellent job whitening my teeth. Also, my teeth feel so much cleaner. I doubt I will resume using a manual toothbrush. I&#x27;m very glad I had the opportunity to try this product. My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> To begin with, I should say that this is my first electric toothbrush. I really like it and I sure think it is effective but my only issue with it is that it&#x27;s a bit too loud. Not sure if all electric toothbrushes sound this loud but I think they shouldn&#x27;t. That been said, it&#x27;s a bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> I received the Truly Radiant SpinBrush for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% mine. I consider this product a good toothbrush, but not great in comparison to the electric one I have. It does clean your teeth and gets in between.  I didn&#x27;t like that it takes batteries,  it is not sonic speed like I am used to and not rechargeable. Other than my own personal preference,  it is a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. My teeth feel so clean. I have tried other battery operated brushes in the past but this has been my favorite so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received this from Smiley360 for free to try out. This opinion is my own. This is an awesome brush! I&#x27;m glad I tried it. It makes my teeth feel very clean. I feel like this brush reaches places my regular one couldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s affordable as well, because my partner ended up purchasing one too!</li>
            <li> I love this Spinbrush, and it makes it less time to brush and get in between all of my teeth!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the price.  Works well love it</li>
            <li> Works well for the price.  I like that it is charged by batteries.  My expensive Oral B Brush had a long slow rechargeable battery death.  With the Spinbrush I can easily fix a slow battery.  I like the dual action head.  I definitely think it reaches far to the back of my teeth and the two different motions makes for an effective brushing.  My teeth are noticeably cleaner than when I use a regular toothbrush.  I would purchase this toothbrush again.  The cons which are minor:  Clunky but you are going to have that with a tool that uses batteries. The on button is hard to push especially once my hand was wet. Several times I have had to pull the toothbrush out of my mouth and use the other had to force the toothbrush on sending toothpaste flying to my mirror.  After a month of use I have already worn off the thumb pad color.  No big deal but makes me concerned about material getting into my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> I have only used an electric tooth brush one time, until I got the spinbrush truly radiant toothbrush deep clean! I love love this tooth brush, and will never buy anything else!! Really gets in between my teeth and cleans!! Its super soft and is easy on my sensitive teeth! My husband has even bought one now and uses that brush also!!</li>
            <li> I like how clean my teeth became.  It was especially after went to the dentist for a cleaning.  It was good but was gentle.</li>
            <li> The Arm and Hammer spin brush along with the truly radiant toothpaste is a winning combination. My teeth are whiter, cleaner, and left with an overall fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, cleans wonderfully!! Only negative I have to say about it, it is horribly loud...But, I do love the clean it gives me :)</li>
            <li> I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep clean from Smiley 360. I aboslutely love it. It cleans your teeth really well. It  does a deep clean to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I was chosen to receive this product completely free in return for my opinion. I was very surprised at how well it worked. I found that the battery lasted for longer than other electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past (which was nice). I liked the way my teeth felt after brushing (which was smooth). Overall a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I really liked this toothbrush. It was my first electric brush and I definitely feel like it helped get my teeth much cleaner than a regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush as part of a mission from Smiley360 (you can find out more by following this link: http://h5.sml360.com/-/1ger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I liked the weight of the brush- it was lightweight and compact, not bulky or heavy at all. The price is very affordable. The power is great for a battery operated brush, and the action of the bristles polishing the teeth offers an awesome cleaning! My teeth feel so smooth and clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I wish it were submersible for easier cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great toothbrush! My family are all getting these.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE  LOVE THE CLEAN FEELING I GET FROM THIS SPINBRUSH!! I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE!!!! MY 100% OWN OPINION !! TRY IT AND YOU WILL AGREE</li>
            <li> I received a free product from Smiley 360 for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a person who takes their personal appearance very seriously and for that reason , teeth whitening is very high up on my list.  I have tried everything from whitening strips(which worsened my sensitivity) to gels which did absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited when I got this Arm and Hammer Toothpaste and mechanical brush because I had recently tossed my expensive spin brush after it gave up on me.  I was a little skeptical initially but followed the directions to the dot. And I was pleasantly surprised.  Its not a miraculous product , you wont have sparkling teeth after a week but it gets the job of getting the stains removed done.  The paste foams up well and brush has a decent amount of power. The only things I didn&#x27;t like were that brush creates a mini racket and the minty flavor which I have come to expect of most toothpastes is more salty with this one, if you can overlook these things this is something can work for you even if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> As a Smiley360 member, I was invited to try this toothbrush for free in return for my review. This toothbrush did exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It left my teeth feeling clean and I always use these types of toothbrushes to feel like I&#x27;m getting that extra clean I&#x27;m between dental visits. The Spinbrush gets the job done!</li>
            <li> ♂&lt;br /&gt;you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;★★★★★ ★★★★★ 5 out of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;· a minute ago&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never before used an electric toothbrush and I really had my doubts about it. However, I have to say I am super impressed. It is sleek, well designed and easy to hold. The spinning massage is very pleasant and effective. My teeth felt so clean afterwards that I doubt I&#x27;d go back to a regular brush. It was a bit odd at first because I automatically wanted to move the brush back and forth like a manual brush but that passed quickly. Also, it took a little getting used to because the brush part is larger then a manual brush.  I love using this not only for my teeth but massaging my gums. I would definitely recommend this brush! --I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> I was only using a toothbrush so switching to this spinbrush felt awesome.  My teeth really felt cleaner and I think they may have got a little bit whiter.  I would definitely recommend the Truly Radiant Spinbrush!</li>
            <li> I had our daughter Gabrielle use the Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant Spin Brush.  She has been the most likely one to use it in her years growing up.&lt;br /&gt;She is almost 15 now and I guess it no longer spins fast enough for her.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works really well.  It spun really well and did a very good job of cleaning her teeth and had good power to it.  It seems to be a good quality product and one that she would recommend, though it may not be all that different, it seems, to some others that are available.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush for free for the purpose of my review. (Thanks smiley.360!) Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used electronic toothbrushes for a while. Most do a mediocre job. This one like a supped-up sports car. I was blown away with the wind parting my hair. I love this brush and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush from arm &amp; Hammer courtesy of Smiley360 for testing and reviewing purposes.  All opinions expressed are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used a battery operated toothbrush before until now.  I felt there were things I really liked about this toothbrush and there were things that made it hard to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Info:&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is the toothbrush is heavy (which I will assume is to be expected if you consider the batteries)&lt;br /&gt;The batteries are very easy to replace and the cap is safely attached so there is no issues with it coming off&lt;br /&gt;The brush is very easy to replace as well, just twist and you are ready&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;*The toothbrush did an amazing job at cleaning my teeth, after I brushed for the first time I felt the difference between my manual and this toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;*It has enough strength to remove plaque even in places where I have difficulty reaching with the manual one, I have to twist my hands to reach the very back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does not work for me (not necessarily an issue for others):&lt;br /&gt;*It is very loud&lt;br /&gt;*It is heavy and big, I have small hands so that makes it a bit hard for me to control and move with the ease I would like&lt;br /&gt;*I like to brush my tongue, gums and cheeks and this tootbrush did not leave me feeling clean so I ended up pulling my old fashioned manual toothbrush to ensure I got the results I wanted.  It was too harsh on my gums but did not apply enough pressure to my tongue and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;*I was not able to close my mouth to brush because if I did then the vibrations would hit my teeth, this would not be an issue bit when the toothpaste gets too runny, you really need to close your mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I mentioned, just because some things do not work for me, it does not make it a bad toothbrush and it might be just perfect for other people.</li>
            <li> Enjoy a fresh from the dentist experience thanks to the Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush!  My smile is now radiant and the easy to handle toothbrush is a must buy! I was lucky enough to try this product for free, but would definitely say it&#x27;s worth more than it&#x27;s current price.</li>
            <li> I received a free Truly Radiant toothbrush from Smiley360 for my reviews and honest opionons. This toothbrush works great along with the Truly Radiant toothpaste and helps make my teeth feel so much cleaner, smoother and brighter. I love this new toothbrush and how it has helped my smile!</li>
            <li> I really do love this spinbrush very much. I could see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth after a few days.</li>
            <li> I love love love my arm &amp; hammer spin brush, it works so good it reaches places that I couldn&#x27;t reach with a regular toothbrush! I love this spin brush! I received arm &amp; hammer spin brush for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was given this toothbrush to try out from Smile360 and I love it!  I love how wonderfully clean it makes my teeth and that it does such an incredible job getting my teeth cleaner than a typical toothbrush. Highly recommend this toothbrush and I know I won&#x27;t use anything else again!</li>
            <li> Shared the toothbrush and paste with my daughter who is very worried about the health and appearance of her teeth.  She loved the feeling of her teeth after using both for the first time. She was even more happy with the look of her teeth after using both for a week!  We shared her results with her friends and my friends!  Everyone was excited and wanting to try the products.</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush as a free sample from Smiley360 so I could try it and give my opinion.  My teeth have never felt so clean!  Make sure and try the toothpaste to go with it.  It has a great, fresh taste.</li>
            <li> I received this tooth brush as a free sample to try.  I would not have bought one with out trying it first!When this brush is done... I will be buying a new one! At first I did not like it.  It made my nose itch.  However, the brush does a wonderful job cleaning my teeth.  My dentist was pleased with the outcome.  It reaches into areas I can not get with a manual brush.  It also has a nice angle on the brush head that helps it reach my back teeth without stretching my mouth.  I was pleasantly surprised at the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I got to try this Spin Brush out for free for product review along with the Tooth past and I tell you it really works good. It is Battery powered.  It really has gotten my teeth looking and feeling very clean. Now if you have had other Spin brushes you will noticed that this one for Arm &amp; Hammer is very powerful and you can really feel it cleaning as you brush your teeth. The Spin Brush do comes with its own Batteries but you may want to buy some just in case. I do say that the taste of the toothpaste I had to get use too but my husband liked it so you should give it a try. Use the toothpaste as well as their other products with the Spin Brush for the best results. This is Only my Opinion and is How I got my great results.</li>
            <li> I have an Oral B Sonic something-or-other from a few years back, that still works and i use it sometimes. This brush seems to clean about as well as that one, at least as far as i can tell, which is impressive considering how much cheaper it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much louder, though. If you have a partner who&#x27;s a light sleeper, they might prefer you not use this while they&#x27;re asleep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spinbrush for a while and for what it is, I find it very effective.  I don&#x27;t think it scrubs as hard as good ol&#x27; elbow grease so I&#x27;m not sure the end effect is any better, for me anyway.  But, I&#x27;m a purposeful brusher :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually, power toothbrushes are for those who may not be OCD about brushing.  It works well, appears to be adequately waterproof (I run it under water a smidge to clean it), and came out of the package ready to go.  I haven&#x27;t yet needed to buy a new brush, so the brush lasts at least a month under normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the only reason for four rather than five stars is that, in my experience, you may not see an overall upgrade going from a traditional to power toothbrush.  That said, if power brushes are your bag, I think you&#x27;ll be very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush. Our kids use them and it seems to clean their teeth better than a manual one.</li>
            <li> Ever realize that you didn&#x27;t need something until you tried it?  Well, that&#x27;s the Spinbrush from Arm &amp; Hammer.  For years, I&#x27;ve seen my friends &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; their toothbrushes to electric, while I foolishly clung to my standard bristled sticks.  Well no more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spinbrush leaves my teeth and gums feeling like I just went to the dentist every time I use it.  It&#x27;s phenomenal for reaching and deep cleaning hard to reach areas like the backs of your molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve used it for a month, and the head shows no signs of wearing down.  If there&#x27;s a downside, it&#x27;s that the replacement heads cost as much as the brush package itself.  That said, it doesn&#x27;t appear I&#x27;ll have to replace the head any time soon.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is really noisy, but it gets the job done. If you want something quieter you&#x27;ll pay a premium, so in the low cost range this is probably the best option. Give it a spin! (Yes, I am embarrassed to have made that joke. So sorry)</li>
            <li> This is the first spinbrush I have ever owned. It&#x27;s great to give you that really clean teeth feeling. Being in the health care profession, I would definitely remind others not to press down too hard with this brush as you can wear away your gums if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw someone mention that the brush is noisy but I have to disagree. It&#x27;s no louder than my electric razor and the one I have is pretty darn quiet. I mean I think that is just expected from just about anything electric but it&#x27;s definitely nothing extreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this toothbrush to anyone. The fresh feeling it gives me is almost as good as a cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I was able to try the Spinbrush for free through Smiley360 in return for writing reviews of what I like or did not like about it. The Spinbrush does a fabulous job at cleaning my teeth. It has enough power to get the job done. I actually found the head to be a good size. Not too big but not too small either. The head is difficult to remove when you are trying to replace it which I don&#x27;t like. Also, the power switch is difficult to turn on and off if your hands get wet. However, I can see how this can be a pro as it will not accidentally be turned on. Overall, I recommend this toothbrush to anyone looking for an electric brush. It does the job and does it well.</li>
            <li> As a member of smiley360.com I got a free sample in order to review this. I typically use a different brand of electric toothbrush and was surprised how well Spinbrush performed compared to the other more expensive brand. The only negative is it&#x27;s kind of loud. But it really gets teeth clean! I definitely recommend Spinbrush.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the truly radiant tooth brush and tooth paste from Smiley 360 and absolutely love the results!</li>
            <li> Love it! Powerful cleaning action that leaves your feeling clean and your breath super fresh!</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush complimentary for testing purposes from Smiley360  http://h5.sml360.com/-/1ktf.  This opinion is solely my own...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on the fence about this toothbrush for the first couple of weeks.  On one hand, its efficient, affordable, and has replaceable heads, however on the other hand, its loud (too loud if using the master bath in the morning and trying not to wake your partner on the other side of the door), and I actually found it to be too strong.  After using it for a couple of weeks my teeth actually HURT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend buying it, however I would suggest using it a couple times a week as a deep clean and a regular brush the rest of the time.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample for my review and my opinion is my own! After I received my free sample of Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant Toothpaste and toothbrush I immediately started using it and after a few days of using this product I noticed a big change in my teeth. Not only was my tooth enamel getting repaired but my teeth was getting whiter and stronger everyday I used these products. They absolutely impressed me and changed my mind about A&amp;H tooth products. I love actions of the toothbrush, it gets in every spot my old toothbrush never could and I am loving it! I like how it takes batteries and the heads are replaceable. The bristles are soft on my gums but strong enough to get the job done! I am not only recommending the Arm &amp; Hammer Radiant toothbrush but also the toothpaste, they both have worked wonders for my teeth! I am a smoker and I love soda so I know my teeth are not perfect but after using these products together I love my teeth now and I can show them off and not be embarrassed anymore which is a great feeling! If you haven&#x27;t tried these products I recommend you do so now! You will notice the same difference I did and you will love the results too!</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush for free so that I could provide feedback. I am very pleased with the results my teeth feel super clean and I plan of buying one for my husband!!</li>
            <li> I recently got the chance to review the spinbrush truly radiant toothbrush as well as the Arm &amp; Hammer (tm)Truly Radiant (tm) toothpaste through smiley360. These two items were provided free for review purposes and all opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  From the first day I used Arm &amp; Hammer(tm) Truly Radiant(tm) toothpaste I loved the way my mouth felt fresh. The taste of the toothpaste didn&#x27;t turn me away like some toothpaste do. I started to notice my teeth a little whiter after using  Arm &amp; Hammer (tm) Truly Radiant(tm) toothpaste for about a week. I personally think that the spinbrush does a very good job of getting any kind of food out of my teeth. I felt that the spinning bristles did a good job of also polishing my teeth while cleaning them. I  suffer from teeth sensitivity and I noticed that when I ate ice cream I didn&#x27;t cringe like I normally do, when something cold touches my teeth. Prior to using the Arm &amp; Hammer truly radiant toothpaste , I had lots of sensitivity to cold things.  I really like Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s truly radiant toothpaste and I am quite impressed with the difference it has made to my teeth</li>
            <li> I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep Clean  in the Truly Radiant Smiley 360 package I received absolutely free!  This is my second time using an electric powered toothbrush, I loved this toothbrush and have purchased one for all my kids and my husband!  We usually buy the manual toothbrushes.  After trying this toothbrush for the first time i was so excited on how clean my teeth felt.  My teeth were definitely cleaner than they were before, when i told my family about this toothbrush they all wanted one and they loved it to!  Me and my husband combined it with the Truly Radiant Toothpaste that also came in the Truly Radiant Smiley 360 package, and with the two products combined we noticed our teeth were brighter, cleaner, and whiter than ever! The kids combined the product with children&#x27;s toothpaste and had similar results!</li>
            <li> I received one of these from Smiley360 for free to review and I am honestly quite happy with it! It also came along with the toothpaste for my deal, which is something else I would recommend. If you&#x27;re looking for a great toothbrush, look no further. This one will help perfect your smile and you will not be disappointed! Of course, like with any product, I was skeptical at first. However, I no longer am because I have seen what it can do! Definitely look into buying this product and many others fromArm &amp; Hammer in the future!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received the Spinbrush &amp; Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothbrush for free from Smiley360. However, this opinion is my own and unaffected by Smiley360 in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me: I have very compact teeth and have a hard time sliding floss between in between them without the floss getting stuck. So, I have to clean more than the standard three minutes to make sure I do a thorough job.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush that I have, and have used, prior to receiving the Spinbrush is a Sonicare DiamondClean electronic brush that I purchased from Costco. Prior to that, my toothbrush was a different Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;The Spinbrush is the first, and only, battery-operated toothbrush I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance: the Spinbrush does a thorough &amp; great job cleaning my teeth. The best part for me, is that it deeply cleans away plaque at my gum line. My Sonicare toothbrush just didn&#x27;t clean the gumline very well. I get a polished smooth clean from the Sonicare but no matter how I hold it, the bristles don&#x27;t reach &amp; clean my gumline. However, with the Spinbrush, I can reach and get a smooth and fully cleaned teeth.  This comparison is why I will not go back to the Sonicare DiamondClean once it dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise &amp; Switch Control: the reason why I deducted one star from the Spinbrush is because it&#x27;s very loud! You will wake up someone while using the Spinbrush. The on/off switch doesn&#x27;t slide easily, especially if your hands are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Splatter/Messy Bathroom: Thankfully, toothpaste does not splatter everywhere when you have to take the brush out of your mouth to slide the on/off switch or to rinse your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive Upkeep: You can change the brush heads AND change the 2/AA batteries as needed! There are often coupons available to help save money with both of these. I have used the Spinbrush twice a day for over a month, and the original batteries are still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Spinbrush and will continue to use it inthe future! I always thought that more expensive was better when it came to my toothbrush of choice. The Spinbrush definitely challenged that thought.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;i received this product for free for the purpose of my review, opinions are 100% my own&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I never used spinbrush before and this was my first experience but so far I love it. Its easy to use, I feel clean mouth in very less time. I am using it from last three week and the brush head is still really good condition and i haven&#x27;t replace the cell. The only thing i don&#x27;t like is the noise. I wish it should be quieter.</li>
            <li> Received the Truly Radiant Spinbrush  thru Smiley360.  Love this toothbrush and the way my teeth feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> I got this Spinbrush, as well as a tube of Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste from Smiley 360 for free, in exchange for my use and subsequent review.  All opinions about this product are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product (when used with it&#x27;s toothpaste) promises a brighter smile in just five days.  Something I admit I laughed a little at when I first got them.  I am an avid coffee and tea drinker, and my teeth were proof of that.  I was a little embarrassed by how yellow my teeth were getting, but didn&#x27;t want to shell out big bucks for professional whitening treatments.  I tried one at-home treatment but my teeth were so sensitive afterwards I could hardly eat (plus it didn&#x27;t work all that well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise (and utter delight!) this product delivered on its promise! I actually noticed whiter teeth on just day 3!  I have now been using it for about a month and I am so happy with the results!  So happy that I will be buying this toothpaste and only this toothpaste in the future, despite the fact that I am an avid couponer and ALWAYS buy what&#x27;s on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;S:&lt;br /&gt;- Price. For the price of this Spinbrush vs. it&#x27;s competitors you can&#x27;t beat it. Plus, after a month of use, the original batteries and head are still good.&lt;br /&gt;- Performance. It actually delivers. There are no false promises here. (Now, I will say I&#x27;m not sure if the brush by itself would do any whitening, as I haven&#x27;t used it without the whitening toothpaste.)  I can actually feel the rotating head REALLY cleaning my teeth. It polishes by front teeth and adequately cleans my molars in one pass. There is no left over grime and gunk; my teeth are SMOOTH and CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;- Size and weight. It isn&#x27;t huge; it actually fits perfectly fine in my travel toothbrush holder. And it&#x27;s lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;- Flat bottom. The spinbrush has a flat bottom so it sits nicely on my sink. I don&#x27;t know if others do or not, but I love that about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;S:&lt;br /&gt;- Noise. It may just come with the territory, but it&#x27;s a lot louder than I expected it to be. It doesn&#x27;t rattle my head and isn&#x27;t loud enough that it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use, but it&#x27;s not quiet either.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning. You aren&#x27;t supposed to get the handle wet, since it houses the batteries. So removing the head and rinsing it is the best way.  I will say, however, than many times in my haste to get out of the house (or into the bed) I have stuck the whole thing under running water.  The batteries still work, nothing went up in flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So without a doubt, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a deeper clean for their pearly (or soon-to-be pearly) whites! It won&#x27;t break the bank, so even if you don&#x27;t love it as much as I do, you&#x27;re not going to have a panic attack over the money you spent to try it.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotional item to review, but please rest assured that my opinions and expressions are entirely my own. Scouts honor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spinbrush is a great little item to have around, it&#x27;s a basic battery powered, motorized toothbrush. It cleans well and holds a charge for quite a while (I have had it for about a month now and the battery is still going just as strong as the day I received it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a step up for anyone who has been using a basic manual toothbrush, but if you are thinking of swutching from a Triumph or Sonicare item, this will not hold up to those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product if you are on a budget and would like to add a little something to your oral hygiene routine...also great for kids!</li>
            <li> I received this spinbrush for free, for the purpose of my review.  The comments are 100% my own.  I absolutely love the spinbrush.  I would definitely recommend it to people.  I love the clean feeling you get after using an electric toothbrush.  Everyone in my family wants to know why they didn&#x27;t get one too!</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample and it rocks.  It makes my whole mouth tingle and feels amazing.  I really truly feel like I just got a professional cleaning.  It gets all the nooks and crannies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it were rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opinions expressed are not paid and 100% my own</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free with the tooth paste and i loved it. A rechargeable station would be awesome but ill jist buy rechargable batteries. My teeth feel so clean after using this brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant Spinbrush and Toothpaste for a couple of months now! My teeth are whiter, shinier, stay smooth longer and my breath stays fresh all day long! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received this Spinbrush free for the purpose of my review, but opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the title says, I had *no* idea what I was missing by using a regular toothbrush. The Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush really does a deep clean, without having to worry that I&#x27;m brushing too hard, or not reaching the hard-to-reach spots. My mouth feels super clean after brushing with the Spinbrush. Love this toothbrush! I wish refills were cheaper, though!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush and Truly Radiant Toothpaste  for the purpose of my review from Simley 360.com Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;The toothbrush  works really well to remove debris from teeth.  It cleans your teeth really well and leaves them shiny and clean.  Both together work on repairing the tooth enamel and I noted it has helped relieve a lot of my teeth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like an electric toothbrush at first, but I really like the way it cleans my teeth, gums and tongue. After using this toothbrush, there is no going back to a manual one!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I recieved this spinbrush along with arm and hammer&#x27;s truly radiant toothpaste absolutely free through smiley360.com, sign up yourself it&#x27;s free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did as directed and used this twice a day for five days and I immediately noticed whitening on my teeth within the first three days. This really does work, I had yellowish stained teeth and now they are white again! This is amazing, I will never go back to a manual toothbrush again, why would I when I got such great results with this?</li>
            <li> I love this Spinbrush!  I was able to get it for free to test it out.  I have been using it almost two months now.  I have tried others within in the same price range and they don&#x27;t hold up as well as this one!  The bristles are still going strong and the it lasts.  I will be buying additional ones for my kids.  They are priced well and usually can be found on sale.</li>
            <li> I am a normal manual toothbrush user. Nothing electronic, spinning, etc. So when I tried this it really was different from what I am used to. The brush itself has soft bristles so that wasn&#x27;t different from my normal brush. But everything else was a big change. From the moving bristles, the great clean feel and the whiter look to my teeth. I came away the first time with a wonderful feeling like I had just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist. And I realize it is not as thorough as a trip to the dentist, but it is good to be using every day. A great brush that I will be purchasing heads for in the future! Only problem? Make sure to put the brush in your mouth before turning on or your toothpaste will spray across the room, splattering the walls and counter:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I got mine for 6$ Much much cheaper than the sonic spin brush, it leaves my teeth feeling like I just left the hygienist. (of course it cant replace actually going). I couldn&#x27;t wait to brush my teeth when I got it in. The downside is it is loud and having to twist off the tips when you need to rinse off the bristles after brushing but you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;ve never owned a sonicare spin brush because they are much to expensive for me so I cant compare the two of them.</li>
            <li> I received this Spinbrush Toothbrush from smiley360 for free so that i could test and review it. I was skeptical at first but this toothbrush worked great. It&#x27;s a little bit loud but after using it my teeth felt very clean. The bristles are soft and the price is great. If you want the step up from a manual toothbrush without spending tons of money.. this is the toothbrush for you.</li>
            <li> This cleans so much better than a manual toothbrush! It really gets around the back teeth where a regular brush always misses.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;I started using the Spinbrush in combination with the Truly Radiant toothpaste, and my teeth were whiter and brighter within five days. My teeth also feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> My gum health is MUCH better with reference especially above my crown that I&#x27;ve had for several years!  I have not one bit of irritation on my gums and they are nice and pink as the dentist states they SHOULD be!! for free.  I received a free product for the purpose of my own review! This is my actual experience!</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d this toothbrush from Smiley360 and put it to the test right away. I LOVE it! really leaves me with a fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel amazing! I actually like the humming sound made while I brush, lol! Great product!</li>
            <li> I Love  Spin brush I&#x27;ll never go manual again!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  i&#x27;ve always been a bit skeptical of electric toothbrushes, but from the very first time I used this brush, it was like I had just left the dentist office after a routine cleaning.  Amazing!  The build up i usually try to scrub off with a regular toothbrush was just gone.  Love it - never going back!  **I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.**</li>
            <li> I received a free spinbrush for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  Great toothbrush, my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> I was chosen by Smiley 360 to try this toothbrush along with the Truly Radiant toothpaste, and I have to say I absolutely love this combo!!! My mouth feels so much cleaner than it has with any other toothpast, and my teeth are so much whiter.</li>
            <li> I received the Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush for free to try. Overall I am really happy with this product. The only thing I did not like was that it is loud and a little too powerful. It rattles my teeth and makes my top lip/nose tingle from how fast it spins. But I guess that is not necessarily a bad thing. I would rather it be too powerful then not powerful enough. I have been using it everyday twice a day for about a month now and it is still going just as strong as the first day. It is a great little toothbrush and works really well. I feel like my teeth are very clean after using it. Definitely a good buy! If you are inthe market for a spinbruch, give this one a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush that gentle on gums and tough on plaque.  Clean does not mean expensive in this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I recieved a tube of NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER™ Truly Radiant™ Toothpaste &amp; The ARM &amp; HAMMER™ Spinbrush Truly Radiant™ Deep Clean Battery Toothbrush for free to review for my opinions. This is based 100% my own opinion. I love it &amp; never want to go back to a manual toothbrush! This was my first time using a spinbrush &amp; it made my teeth feel so clean. The toothpaste is great too! It works great &amp; has a minty clean taste. I recommend this to everyone to try out! You will love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> So glad that the site Smiley360 choose me to be a part of the NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER Truly Radiant Mission. They sent me a full size tooth brush along with a full size toothpaste. I honestly didn&#x27;t think I would love this brush as much as I did. It has lasted longer than some of the other brands I have tried and the brisell feel great against my teeth. Most of the other one I have tried have gone bad within a month of having them and I would have to either replace it or get a different one.</li>
            <li> THIS. IS. THE. BEST. BRUSH. I&#x27;VE. EVER. USED. !!!!!!!!  Hadn&#x27;t been to the dentist in over a year (due to illness)...and my recent cleaning/check-up was perfect.  The hygienist couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth were and gum line was great, too.  I will never use another brush!  Like, ever!  (I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.)</li>
            <li> I have been using the Spinbrush for almost a month now, and I absolutely love it! I don&#x27;t think I will ever be able to go back to using a regular toothbrush again. I have used other electric toothbrushes, but they don&#x27;t even compare to this one. The spinning action makes this almost the equivalent of getting a professional cleaning in a dentist&#x27;s office. I would, and have, recommended this to anyone who will listen. I was a product tester for the Spinbrush and received it for free, but I will definitely be buying one for my husband!</li>
            <li> I really loved this toothbrush! it made my teeth feel so clean! Love it!</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m pretty sceptical when it comes to electric tooth brushes, but boy was I mistaken this time! Never have me teeth felt soo clean after using this toothbrush. My mind has been completely changed and I will always be using this spinbrush!</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush I received it as a free sample from smiley360 and it works great.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush ever !!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan. I&#x27;m used to the Phillips sonicare and the radiant was very bulky in my mouth and difficult to use. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s better than a manual brush as far as how clean it gets your teeth, but for me it is harder to maneuver in my mouth than even a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a very basic, simple, battery operated toothbrush. It felt like the toothbrush was creaking in my mouth and it didn&#x27;t feel fast or full-cleaning at any point. In comparison to the entry-level Sonicare toothbrush, this one felt like a cheapie version. While the price point is very low, I almost feel as though the manual toothbrush may have left my teeth feeling cleaner. Perhaps it was the pasty Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste I used with it, but I was not overly impressed at all with this product.</li>
            <li> It was a little to intense for my gums</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re debating on whether to purchase an electronic toothbrush, this is a fantastic entry model to try before taking the plunge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I received the following products, an ARM &amp; HAMMER Spinbrush Truly Radiant Deep Clean Battery Toothbrush and tube of Truly Radiant toothpaste, for the purpose of the following review I will provide.  However, the opinions that are to be stated are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ARM &amp; HAMMER Spinbrush Truly Radiant Deep Clean Battery Toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Reasonable price for an automated toothbrush (without having to spend $50+)&lt;br /&gt;- Really does give your teeth a complete and overall cleaning like you came from the dentist&lt;br /&gt;- Applies even pressure while brushing and is gentle on gums and teeth&lt;br /&gt;- Makes brushing teeth a whole lot easier since it does all the scrubbing for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Bulkier compared to other regular toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;- A bit noisy&lt;br /&gt;- No timer, so you have to monitor your brushing time on your own&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL ... I already have an electric Oral-B toothbrush that I&#x27;m already spoiled by, but for people that are still brushing their teeth with regular, plain toothbrushes, I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying this as a way to start more effectively cleaning their teeth!  It&#x27;s a good entry before plunging and buying yourself an electric toothbrush.  The cons are minimal for the thorough cleaning it provides for your teeth and gums, especially when combined with the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This product operated as expected. It was delivered promptly and safely packaged for shipment. My only hold back was that the vibration is a little to excessive and causes one not to fully allow it to really get to clean the teeth.</li>
            <li> This is an okay electric toothbrush for its price, but compared to the Oral-B Triumph I am used to, it is a really big let down.  The brush is too large to brush gums effectively without cutting.  Also, I miss my timer to make sure I brush long enough.  I am glad I tried this product for free with Smiley360.com and did not pay for it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for the last month and so far, I love it! My teeth feel super clean after using it and are shiny and beautiful. My only issue with this brush is that it seems to be pretty loud.</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush for free from Smiley360 for the purposes of obtaining a review.  My opinions are 100% my own.  I was floored by how clean this toothbrush made my teeth feel!  Like I just left a dentists office.. or better!  Even the grime that never comes off the back of my front bottom teeth, no matter how long I brush with a manual toothbrush, was totally gone and my teeth were left squeaky clean!  I forgot to take it with me on vacation and I was devastated to have to return to my old brushing methods!  The cost of this tooth brush is also very reasonable compared to a manual brush.. but I won&#x27;t be going back!  I even like the Truly radiant toothpaste that came with it.  I&#x27;m not generally a fan of baking soda in my toothpaste, but I honestly didn&#x27;t mind this formula as much as I have with previous formulas.  I will also purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> I received the Spinbrush toothbrush for free as part of a product trial through smiley360.com.  I really like this toothbrush.  It was not to harsh and I was able to clean my teeth very well even though I had recently had a root canal done.  I love the power associated with this brush.</li>
            <li> Love the new spinbrush from arm and hammer. I got the purple one.It does spin well. It is kinda heavy which I dislike about it. Overall, i think it&#x27;s a nice brush</li>
            <li> I  received this product for free to use and review, and in my opinion, this Truly Radiant Spinbrush is the best brush I have ever used. I have tried a few others and quickly tossed them to the side, but this brush is comfortable to use and feels great on my teeth. Now the whole family wants one! Great product and I love it!</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush, but I hate that toothpaste! It makes my teeth more sensitive and it burn my gums!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this Spinbrush and I was very excited to use it.  I&#x27;ve never had a motorized brush before this one.  I enjoyed using it.  It seems to polish the teeth nicely.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate the gums.  My only concern is that one night, my gums were sensitive due to a popcorn kernel that had wedged itself in, and the Spinbrush did not get it out.  I switched back to the manual toothbrush and it came right out.  On the other hand, my husband is happily pestering me about getting him a Spinbrush, too.  I told him that&#x27;s not necessary because we can just buy some brush head replacements and share the base.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the arm and hammers spin brush and I must say that was was impressed. Great with the truly radiant toothpaste. Helps to whiten teeth and cleans really well.</li>
            <li> I received the Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush free thanks to Smiley360,and i&#x27;m in love.The brush head is replaceable with just a quick and easy twist,and so are of course the batteries. Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Spinnbrush is gentle on my gums (wich are rather sensitive) and the bristles are soft,i also like the fact that the brush is not heavy and fits perfectly into my hand.Overall a great product and the price is right</li>
            <li> I received this truly radiant spinbrush free from smiley 360 to give my honest opinion. Now let&#x27;s get down to business. The toothbrush itself is good at cleaning my teeth. Its got soft bristles and it gets the job done. I didn&#x27;t have to apply pressure to get any gunk out of my teeth after eating. I didnt really mind the noise it makes, but that might be a deal breaker for some. I kind of like that its battery operated, last one I owned had a charger and I honestly had no idea what happened to it when we moved. I already own and use rechargeable batteries, so it was easy to just pop some in and start using it. I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone that is looking for a good clean feel to their teeth, but are unable to afford or don&#x27;t want to spend too much money on a different brand.</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush for free through smiley360 and I am thrilled with the results! I love how this toothbrush feels when using it. It&#x27;s more powerful than any other power toothbrush I have used. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a clean feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li> I was given the Spinbrush Truly Radiant toothbrush to use as a free sample and this product is truly amazing. It leaves your teeth feeling sparkling clean which makes you want to brush more. Not only did it make me a believer but it made my husband go out and buy one too.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush really gets to the back of my teeth which I have a hard time doing and always makes my teeth feel squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> I really loved my Spinbrush Truly Radiant toothbrush. I love the was it works. I don&#x27;t have any complaint about it. I  was hesitant at first because I have never used a spin brush but I don&#x27;t think I will ever use a manual brush again. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this spinbrush.It&#x27;s amazing so far.This is my first time trying spinbrush.very impressed with the results.The bristles are very soft and gives a perfect cleaning.I Highly recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush Free in a trial from Smiley360.  I have been using it for over a month now.  It gives a great cleaning.  The battery is still working.  I give it a low score because it is hard to turn on with just you thumb or finger.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from Smiley360. All opinions are my own: I regularly use Sonicare. Compared to that, this toothbrush was loud and bulky. I also had a hard time getting it rinsed well and it always held a little water in the brush end. I think for the price it would be a good purchase though. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and better than just a manual.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush on the market for the price.</li>
            <li> I  received a free sample of Arm and Hammer toothpaste and an Arm and Hammer Spinbrush from Smiley 360! This opinion is 100% my own.  I am fortunate to have naturally whiter teeth, but I already notice a difference. The baking soda really makes my teeth feel clean and using the spin brush supports that fresh clean feeling. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I received a spinbrush as a free trial. I like it, but, honestly, tend to use my regular toothbrush. It&#x27;s really noisy! It does make my gums feel good and my teeth are nice and clean, but it didn&#x27;t blow my mind!</li>
            <li> I thought The Truly Radiant Spinbrush was very good quality and lasts a long time.  I would buy this tooth brush again.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this brush for free for testing purposes &amp; I love it!! Its not weak like some power toothbrushes I have used. I really love how clean your teeth when you are done. I actually will be purchasing this as my brand for now on.</li>
            <li> When i tried The truly ridiant spinbrush and tooth. This is my first time using it. I was diferent using the spinbrush from my regular toothbrush. It cleans and brush away some the old nasty stuff my old toothbrush left behind. I like this and i start to yse it every day.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I received my free Arm &amp; Hammer truly radiant spin brush from Smiley360.com. I really like this product. I have noticed a difference in how clean my teeth look and feel.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free product to review, and in my opinion, this is actually a pretty decent toothbrush. It doesn&#x27;t have all the power of some other spinbrushes, and it&#x27;s a little loud to me, but it gets the job done. My teeth felt nice and clean after using it. However, the bristles seem a bit hard, so don&#x27;t press too hard or you&#x27;re gums are going to be sore. That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Overall, I will definitely continue using this spinbrush. It kept my teeth clean and I could definitely tell a difference after using it. These opinions are all my own, and it is something I would recommend to friends or family.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; I have never used a mechanical toothbrush before, so I was a little susceptible about how effective it would be. I want to say I was very surprised indeed to find that the Arm and Hammer SSinbursh really made my teeth and gums feel clean. My mouth tingled and if I had just come from a cleaning at the dentist, and I really feel that my mouth is in better condition since using this item. It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works well but the bristles are kind of too rough for my teeth. It lasted me 3 months before I had to change it.</li>
            <li> I used this daily for the first week and I was thoroughly pleased with how clean my teeth felt. Unfortunately, after a week of use the toothbrush turns on and off by itself. I tried changing the battery, but that did not help. Oh well, I am still pleased with the results just a tad inconvenient.  I received as a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this toothbrush. my teeth have never felt so clean. i can tell a real difference when i brush my teeth with this toothbrush compared to many other brands.</li>
            <li> love this product. gives you that deep clean like going to the denist</li>
            <li> make my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just had them cleaned at the dentist!</li>
            <li> The spinbrush was very nice on my teeth and gums. I don&#x27;t think  that it gives your mouth a deep clean. Its just like other tooth brushes that spin.  I didn&#x27;t see a differences  in the color of my teeth.I used it longer than 5 days . I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I recieved Arm and Hammer Truly Radiant deep clean spinbrush and toothpaste from Smiley360 to review. I must say I really like it, the spin brush is gentle on your teetha nd gums but it gets your teeth super clean! In the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my teeth, they look a few shades whiter. I recommend this product, you will like it and see the diffrence in your teeth.</li>
            <li> ARM &amp; HAMMER™ Truly Radiant™ Toothpaste &amp; Spinbrush seemed like a great combo, but neither is as spectacular as I had hoped. I come from using a toothpaste I love and a SonicCare toothbrush. The toothpaste wasn&#x27;t my favorite flavor, the saltiness of the baking soda came through too much. The Spinbrush toothbrush; the head of the toothbrush was giant. I had a hard time keeping my lips together to contain it and keep the toothpaste from flowing freely out of my mouth and down my chin. I really wanted to like these products, but I cannot. I will not post a positive review simply because I got a free sample; I will give an honest opinion. I received a free sample from Smiley360.</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush free from Smiley360 for my review.  I love this toothbrush.  I feel like it cleans great!</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush for free for the purpose of my review.  It was the first battery operated toothbrush I have used and I am enjoying it.  I don&#x27;t have to work as hard to brush my teeth.  But it definitely is bulkier than my regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> As a recent member of Smiley360, I was one of the chosen to try out their Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant mission. I received a full tube of Truly Radiant toothpaste, and a Truly Radiant Spinbrush 100% free. This is my honest opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of my thoughts on the Spinbrush are positive, such as how the brush was made, how well it reaches, and how, within the allotted 5 days to make your smile more radiant, it polishes your teeth. I like the spin action very much, and the longer orange bristles that reach those pesky areas. The base of the Spinbrush isn&#x27;t too big, I can grip it well. The only real negative thing I have to say is, and maybe I just haven&#x27;t learned the proper technique, that brushing with it can be a tad messy, with the toothpaste easily and quickly running down your chin. However, in my opinion, that is a small price to pay using electric brushes. The Truly Radiant Spinbrush is by far my favorite, and the positives far outweigh the negatives. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush makes me want to brush my teeth longer because I can actually feel it working!  My teeth were much cleaner after using this spinbrush.  Only downfall...might get fired from my job for being late to work in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I am using New Arm &amp; Hammer truly Radiant Toothpaste from about 2 weeks. I am impressed with how fresh and clean it left my mouth and teeth feeling. Also I already notice a significant difference in whiteness of my teeth. I feel proud when people compliment me about my teeth saying how healthy they look. It truly clean and repair tooth enamel.  Thanks! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!  Does what it is supposed to do. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like the Truly Radiant Spinbrush. Not only does it provide a deep down clean, but the bristles are nice and soft on my gums. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about using a battery operated toothbrush, but the Truly Radiant Spinbrush did the trick. It actually seemed to really get into those hard to reach places, leaving my mouth feeling fresh and clean. Another thing that I liked is that the brush head for the Truly Radiant Spinbrush is replaceable. One thing I didn&#x27;t like is that while the toothbrush can stand on it own, I wish it would be able to fit in my toothbrush holder. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush and toothpaste are fantastic.  In fact, this is what I use now.  I feel the combination of the toothbrush and toothpaste get my teeth much cleaner.  The Truly Radiant toothpaste has also whitened my teeth.  Fantastic products. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Does the job. I like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush, and even got to try it for free through smiley. It got my teeth very clean, with half the time it takes for a normal toothbrush. The only complaint I would have is that once or twice it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I thought the batteries were dead but the next day it turned on just fine, so I&#x27;m not sure why it did that. Other than that small issue I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  I found this brush to be a bit too harsh for my sensitive gums but the toothpaste is amazing!  Great clean but just a little too much of a good thing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Gets deep in between your teeth and gives your mouth a nice refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> I was sent the Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant Spinbrush for review from Smiley 360. This toothbrush really helped me get my teeth clean, they not only looked cleaner but also felt cleaner. I have wanted a spinbrush for along time but they are always so expensive. This one is more affordable and worth every penny! Give it a try, you will not regret it! &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was extremely impressed with this product.  I have stayed away from electric toothbrushes because I have sensitive teeth and was worried about the pain.  My teeth feel as clean as when I walk out of the dentist office.  The toothbrush works so well that I will not go back to a manual toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> I started using the Truly Radiant Spinbrush because I received it free for the purpose of my review.  I had been using a manual toothbrush when I received the Truly Radiant Sprinbrush to review.  I love this toothbrush and will never go back to a manual brush!  The toothbrush is light weight and easy to hold.  I have arthritis and this makes brushing my teeth so much easier.  From the very first use my teeth felt much cleaner than they do after brushing with a manual brush.  I have tried both rechargeable electric toothbrushes as well as other brands of battery powered tooth brushes in the past, but I found the vibrating sensation unpleasant enough that I discontinued using them.  However, the vibration that the Truly Radiant Spinbrush provides is pleasantly mild, yet powerful enough to make my teeth feel clean and plaque free.  I strongly recommend giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The opinions I have shared are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! I really felt like my teeth were clean after I brushed with my Truly Radiant Spinbrush.  The only time my teeth feel that clean is at the dentist.  :)  I did receive a free Truly Radiant Spinbrush but this review is my own honest opinion.  Thanks Truly Radiant Spinbrush!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s been several years since I have used any type of electric/motorized toothbrush.  The Spinbrush made my teeth feel super clean.  I&#x27;ve been using it with the Truly Radiant toothpaste and my mouth feels tingly fresh after brushing.  I recommend the Spinbrush. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I gave the spinbrush to my oldest daughter because she had been wanting another spinbrush after years of using a manual. She likes it and it does what is supposed to, but it did not seem NEW or IMPROVED over the one she had a few years ago. However it did make her little sisters jealous and I think we need to buy two more!  &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me start it with clarifying that I am actually not a electronic toothbrush lover before.&lt;br /&gt;I might have used it very long time ago but I couldn&#x27;t recall exactly when and what that brand was.&lt;br /&gt;So basically I am actually telling how I feel as a manual toothbrush user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it, I think that this is a lightweight one and can easily fit into my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Its head is pretty small, however, I felt that its top still couldn&#x27;t reach the very deep side of my mouth where my most inner tooth is located.&lt;br /&gt;After the vibration began, I found that the mixed liquid ( the toothpaste and my saliva ) kept dripping down along the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it is inevitable that the melted toothpaste usually will drip down whether you are using a manual toothbrush or an electric one.&lt;br /&gt;I am just worried if the liquid will damage the inside of the electric toothbrush since it is battery based.&lt;br /&gt;But so far it is still working, so the outside protection might work just well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I&#x27;m done with the brushing, I think my teeth are pretty clean.&lt;br /&gt;And since I have mentioned that its top couldn&#x27;t reach the very deep side of my mouth,&lt;br /&gt;I had to try a couple of times for all my deepest teeth, it took a while but it was okay.&lt;br /&gt;The vibration might took you some time to get used to, but is was okay as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared with the manual one,&lt;br /&gt;this electric one is doing a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever you are getting tired of using the manual one, this one should be a good choice if you are looking for  alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a couponer like me,&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;d know when and where to get it for a good price or even for free with the coupons and in-store promotion.&lt;br /&gt;So the price shouldn&#x27;t be a big issue anyway.</li>
            <li> Really spins and moves, the head&#x27;s aggressive action doesn&#x27;t need much pressure applied. You don&#x27;t brush the same compared to when using a regular toothbrush. All one needs to do is lightly &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; over every surface and let the brush do the cleaning and polishing.  Just make sure you grip the handle firmly; since water and toothpaste dribble down the handle I&#x27;ve let it slip out several times, dropping to the sink or floor with no damage.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this does not need a base that plugs into the wall. You can store this in a drawer instead of being on your counter top plugged in. The design has a major flaw. Instead of a slide on and off it would be a major improvement to have just an on/off push button. I had a hard time once this got wet to turn it off and on. Any one who has used an electric toothbrush knows you need to turn it off  and on a few times during each brushing. Other than that it is just about perfect. The brush head is nice and big. My teeth felt great after using. I found the Truly Radiant toothpaste to be much too this and runny. &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I know it&#x27;s not rocket science, but it did take me a few days to get accustomed to this brush. It made a bit of a mess with toothpaste everywhere for a while. However, now that I have the hang of it, I can say that my teeth have never felt cleaner! I haven&#x27;t priced the replacement heads yet but I hope to continue using this brush.</li>
            <li> Very nice toothbrush...gives my teeth a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling!</li>
            <li> This spinbrush was fantastic.  It works very thoroughly and has a lot more power than you would think.  I highly recommend this brush. I was given a sample of the the Arm &amp; Hammer spin brush as well as the toothpaste.  These are my genuine opinions.</li>
            <li> Was really impressed with this toothbrush!  Felt good on my gums and cleaned excellent!</li>
            <li> (Disclaimer: I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush is a great product for those who don&#x27;t want to shell out the big bucks to by a rechargable electric toothbrush but want something more effective than the traditional manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works well and left my teeth feeling clean and sparkling&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are soft enough for my sensitive gums&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Slippery when wet (which it almost always will be after brushing teeth)&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t submerge whole brush underwater&lt;br /&gt;Is a bit loud</li>
            <li> This Spin brush Truly Radiant Toothbrush deep clean is a must have. I love  the dual action head brush. It reaches deep down between teeth in those hard to reach places. It goes along the gum line too removing food and plaque thanks to the longer bristles. This will eliminate some visits to the dentist. Its a definite yes and is not expensive like many other brand name  Spin Brush.</li>
            <li> I received this Spinbrush free of charge from Smiley360, my comments are purely my own. I love this toothbrush. I have trouble with my hands cramping and with a traditional toothbrush, sometimes I just can&#x27;t get my teeth as clean as they should be. I found this Spinbrush to be easy to handle, powerful and left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is awesome! It seems to work a lot better than the average battery toothbrush, the toothpaste is simply magnificent! The power if the two makes my pearly whites come back to life!</li>
            <li> Received a free sample from Smiley360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using for about a week and have noticed a brighter smile and some slight whitening, My mouth feels clean and fresh after using it and the toothbrush does an okay job of cleaning between the teeth. I am still getting used to the flavor though, it leaves a weird after taste in my mouth. I&#x27;m satisfied with the results</li>
            <li> This toothbrush definitely gets the cleaning done. I give it an A+ for that. I do wish the brush head was a tad smaller to brush those bard to reach teeth in the back. It also is a tad on the loud side but other than that and just based on performance I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product from Smiley 360 for free. I agreed to try and review this as honestly as possible. Here&#x27;s my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely loved the toothbrush. I haven&#x27;t had much experience with electric toothbrushes, actually the one I had crapped out right after I bought it, and this toothbrush has turned me into an electric toothbrush person. It was easy to use and did an awesome job, even in those hard to reach places. I would reccomend this toothbrush to anyone!!</li>
            <li> i received this toothbrush and a tube of the truly radiant toothpaste free as part of a promotion thru smiley360.com and have been using them for about 3 weeks. compared to other battery operated toothbrushes this one ranks about a 4 out of 5 in the how good does it work department. however i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for a child or an adult with a small mouth as the head of the brush is quite large. the head is replaceable though and i&#x27;m hoping they come out with different sized heads to make it nicer to use.&lt;br /&gt;it is a powerful brush and gives a nice clean and polish to my teeth. i am very pleased with it overall. i&#x27;ve used colgate spinbrushes many times and this one is much better at giving me the clean down to the gums feeling. as a bonus the toothpaste has a pleasant and refreshing taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was not paid to give this review, it is 100% my opinion.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works great, good bristles even after weeks of use. The one negative is it is loud. This toothbrush is great for travel, but I still prefer my sonicare. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; I am not a fan. Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well as some other electronic toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I received the Arm and Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste and spinbrush free as a member of Smiley360.com. I like this product very much. As a child I used baking soda and peroxide as toothpaste so I have no issues with the taste. Its lightly minty. I&#x27;ve never used a spinbrush before but I am amazed at the results! Surface stains are easily gone and it feels like mini dentist visit. I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Love the Spinbrush for it&#x27;s ability to clean completely and thoroughly,even after 1 month of use!! It took a little longer than 5 days to &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; my teeth, but after using it for a little less than a month, I can certainly tell a difference!! For the price (and the fact that you can change the batteries (AA) yourself), this is definitely a great tool to help you achieve a cleaner and healthier mouth!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this toothbrush it is great.</li>
            <li> I received this Truly Radiant Spinbrush as a  free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  I received this toothbrush and I was a bit skeptical since I have been a longtime user of my electric toothbrush however shortly after I received this brush my tooth brush got dropped and broke.  I&#x27;ve been using this one and have yet to replace my other.  At first the bristles were way to hard for my sensitive teeth but they did soften up after some use.  I think I will add this toothbrush to my travel bag so I don&#x27;t have to carry around my other toothbrush and charger.  My dentist did not notice any damage to my gums so that&#x27;s enough for me.  I think I&#x27;ll just keep using this one for sure!</li>
            <li> I love this spin brush . My teeth are whitening as I type. Gets the parts a toothbrush doesn&#x27;t. My daughter wants one now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush I was chosen to participate in a study by Smiley360 and they sent me an Arm &amp; Hammer toothbrush and toothpaste this is my first electric toothbrush and I love it my teeth feel so clean and the toothpaste makes my mouth feel so fresh.and my teeth are whiter I will never go back to a manual toothbrush .</li>
            <li> This is an awesome battery powered toothbrush that works very well. Easy to grip, powerful but not so powerful that it makes it uncomfortable to hold. Nice design. I really enjoyed using this brush and would recommend it to friends and family. I received a free product for the purpose of my review.  Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush for free to review, by being a member of Smiley 360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it. I&#x27;ve used a few other battery toothbrushes, and i never really kept up with them, so i almost didn&#x27;t see the point with this one. But i&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and i can see a difference. Other then the loudness of the toothbrush, it&#x27;s a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for months and I still love it.  I finally needed to replace the batteries on it and had absolutely no luck in figuring that out by reading the package instructions.  I&#x27;ll tell you right now, Google \\&quot;replace batteries for Spinbrush\\&quot; and there is a great YouTube video that shows you exactly what to do.  Very easy once I did that.</li>
            <li> I was very lucky to receive this spinbrush for free from the site Smiley360 for review purposes. I must say that this is the best toothbrush I have ever used!  It comes with the batteries already in place and the bristle head is replaceable. As well as the batteries. I highly recommended this brush and have since purchased additional brushes for my family.</li>
            <li> Totally in love with this tooth brush will never use another try! clean feeling and when used with ARM &amp; HAMMER™ Truly Radiant™ Toothpaste  You get amazing results my teeth are white now...and ex smoker, and soda and coffee drinker  so its nice to have my white teeth back...</li>
            <li> I got a free Truly Radiant toothbrush and toothpaste. It has been a while since I have used an Arm &amp; Hammer dental product so I was not sure what to expect. I found together this toothbrush and toothpaste did actually help whiten my teeth. My teeth looked noticeably whiter within days. They also were much smoother and felt cleaner when I rubbed my tongue against my teeth. I was really impressed that I did not have any sensitivity to the toothpaste at all which I sometimes experience. The only problems I had was the taste took about two times to get used to, but now I really like it. And because the toothbrush spins I find I usually have to stop the toothbrush and restart after I have rinsed my mouth out a little because there is so much foaming, cleaning action.</li>
            <li> For the price of this toothbrush it is actually quite amazing.  It works way better than a manual toothbrush.  Even though i got this toothbrush for free with Smiley360 I wouldnt mind paying a couple bucks for this in the future</li>
            <li> After receiving my free full size sample electric toothbrush and Radiant toothpaste from Smiley360, I have to say that I absolutely love this toothpaste! The toothbrush could be a little better and include a tongue scrubber, but the toothpaste is not goopy, if that is a word...y&#x27;all know what I mean. Also I did notice a fresher clean, a better dentist checkup, and a great feel on my teeth. This is my true opinion.</li>
            <li> I already have a power operated toothbrush so to use a battery powered brush had its pros and cons. I love the freshness it gives you after brushing from the first time. I like how it is used with batteries and you don&#x27;t have to make sure it&#x27;s charged up which makes for easy traveling. I still feel like the powered brush gives you a deeper clean. But for the price you def get more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my spinbrush!! It does a really good job of getting in all the nooks and crannies, and really brushing and polishing my teeth. The head is compact and it can really be comfortably maneuvered into place to get the backs of my teeth and the ones waaaaay in the back. It goes up and down AND round and round so I really feel like my teeth are as clean as they can be when im done. The best thing is, its kinda fun so I seem to be brushing more often and I believe my smile is getting whiter too!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> The ARM &amp; HAMMER Spinbrush Truly Radiant Deep Clean Battery toothbrush is the first battery-powered toothbrush that I have tried.  I was quite surprised by the power of this brush.  At first it seemed a bit much.  There was some serious vibration in my teeth, which was not exactly pleasant.  However, the cleaning experience made it a little easier to take.  The bristles really got between my teeth and along the gum line.  My teeth truly felt much cleaner after just one brushing.  Running my tongue along my teeth after brushing was reminiscent of a visit to the dentist!  The instructions require that the head be removed from the toothbrush before rinsing.  This was a bit awkward since it is necessary to grab the brush in order to twist it off.  This was messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Very noisy. Disappointed. Difficult to turn on and off.</li>
            <li> My father had some stains on his teeth (he&#x27;s in his 80&#x27;s) and the dentist just mentioned them, but didn&#x27;t say anything about removing them.  This led us to believe he was just stuck with them.  I got this toothbrush for his gingivitis because of the great reviews here, and lo and behold, in about 5 weeks, we saw the stains were disappearing.  I can&#x27;t believe it, but now they&#x27;re almost completely gone and his teeth are actually getting whiter!</li>
            <li> It has stopped dead a few times.</li>
            <li> i recieved this product to review from smiley 360. im not a fan of electric or battery powered tooth brushes but this did prove me wrong this spinbrush actually made my teeth look and feel cleaner without me having to do it manually.the spinbrush is a bit bottom heavy because of the batteries but all in all its easy to use and the softness of all the many bristles was nice and easy on my teeth .i would recommend this spinbrush as a must have with family members along with the right toothpaste this gets the job done without having to pay all that big money for electric dentist toothspinners this is for adult as well as children</li>
            <li> This is a solid toothbrush and, for me, my first electric version.  After several weeks of use, the bristles have held up well.  Initially, I was expecting a better result with regard to whitening, but didn&#x27;t see much difference compared with what I get from the old-school manual-type toothbrush.  Then I read that the recommended brush time for best results is two minutes. That might not sound like much until you&#x27;re actually brushing your teeth and time it out.  After a few of these two-minute sessions, I did notice a slight improvement in the whitening of my teeth when coupled with a whitening toothpaste.  Two minutes, though, feels a bit long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with the electric toothbrush--not necessarily specific to this product--is that it&#x27;s more difficult to neatly brush your tongue than it is with a manual-type toothbrush.  Otherwise, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I had a sonicare and couldn&#x27;t tolerate the intensive vibration. This is my first spinbrush and it is a little strong for me too. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m not really made for powered toothbrushes, but my teeth did feel especially clean afterwards so that&#x27;s a shame. The handle is not too thick for a powered brush, but the head is a little wide and I kept bumpking my teeth with it, which was when the worst of the brain-vibration happened. Overall, I think that if someone likes powered brushes, they&#x27;d like this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Spinbrush for about 3 weeks now and am finally ready to give it a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have never used a powerbrush in the past, I felt that upgrading from my normal manual toothbrush was long overdue. And the Spinbrush did not disappoint. The head has two sets of independently motorized bristles, radial rotating at the top and axial rotating at the bottom. The head is replaceable and cost about $8.00 for a two pack. not too bad considering they last for 2 to 3 months before needing replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using the Spinbrush, it is still recommended that you use the same brushing motions as normal, but you will instantly feel the difference versus using a manual brush. To put it simply, the Spinbrush made my mouth feel cleaner than manual brushing alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I can say was a negative is that the brush feels slightly bulky. Granted the handle must hold the battery and the motorized mechanisms to make the bristles move, but at the start it felt rather odd to use. But I quickly got used to it as my mouth truly felt cleaner after using it the first few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fully recommend the Spinbrush for anyone looking to upgrade from a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure, I was selected to review this product as part of a sampling program, and I did recieve the product for free.  What I write, however, is completely my own opinion!    I&#x27;ve used an electric toothbrush in the past, but it was years ago.  So, the feel of using this was familiar to me.  I thought it was a good product.  The handle was a bit different, but I am not sure what it was. I think it was just a different shape than I was used to.    I felt the head moved just enough to help with cleaning, without being overpowering or uncomfortable.    I used this brush with the truly radiant paste, which I really liked.    Overall, I was pleased with both the toothbrush and the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product through Smiley360.com. I absolutely love how the toothebrush makes your mouth feel so clean and refreshed..</li>
            <li> Got to try this free from smiley 360 the spinbrush works really good gets your teeth clean</li>
            <li> As a member of Smiley360.com I received an ARM &amp; HAMMER™ Spinbrush Truly Radiant™ Deep Clean Battery Toothbrush and a tube of Truly Radiant toothpaste for free in return for my feed back. I love my smile! Even more so after a week of using this product!  My teeth are whiter and my while mouth feels cleaner! #SmileBrighter with Arm &amp; Hammer(TM) Truly Radiant Toothpaste &amp; Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush with its longer bristles.  My teeth never felt better.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Smiley360 I got to try out the Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant Spin Brush.  It is my first experience with an electric toothbrush, and a great one!  I loved how soft the bristles were, yet my teeth felt clean after I brushed.  It&#x27;s flat bottom allows it to stand and it&#x27;s still going strong since I started using it about a month ago.</li>
            <li> I received these product at no cost to review. I shared my opinion of the products with my friends and encouraged them to try the products because I was extremely pleased with them. I also was able to share with them coupon savings. I would highly recommend using the arm and hammer dental products. I have changed to them permanently!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tooth brush!!! I have seen the commercials with Sammy from DAYS OF OUR LIFES.  The tooth brush works great on my teeth and it really gets them very clean!!! You should buy it!!! :)</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush free sample in the mail and it works great especially when used with Arm and Hammer Truly Radiant whitening toothpaste of which I also received a free sample of.  Makes your teeth feel squarely clean.  They keep improving on these battery powered toothbrushes and this is the best one yet!  I would gladly reccomend both to others, because when used together,cavities watch out!</li>
            <li> Most dentists recommend electric toothbrushes for more thorough plaque removal from teeth.  These readily available and cost effective Spinbrushes make toothbrushing less of a chore early in the morning, or late at night.&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;*The rotating and gently vibrating bristles provide faster and more effective debris and plaque removal than manual toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;*Includes two AA batteries that lasted for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;*The brush head has a built-in wear indicator to show when the brush head needs to be replaced (about every 3 months).&lt;br /&gt;*Nice, large, ergonomic handle for a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slight Concerns:&lt;br /&gt;*A pack of two Spinbrush replacement heads cost about the same as a brand new Spinbrush.&lt;br /&gt;*No built in timer for the recommended two minutes of tooth brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;According to most dentists and hygienists, there is no way a manual toothbrush can remove as much debris, plaque, and also massage the gums as well as an electric spinbrush.  Just make sure to keep the brush head moving on the teeth and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure which causes gums to shrink and abrades tooth surfaces.</li>
            <li> My dentist had recommended that I get an electric toothbrush to combat some gum bleeding issues.  Since using this brush (after the first few days), my gums aren&#x27;t bleeding any more and look healthier.  The batteries that came with the brush only lasted a week, but I put a couple of rechargeables in it and they&#x27;ve been working fine for several weeks without needing to be charged.  The batteries that I took out still have plenty of power to light up the flashlight we keep in the bathroom.  I also like that you can replace the head and not have to toss the whole brush.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great price compared to other powered toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;Easy to replace brush head&lt;br /&gt;Compared to manual brushing,the dual action brush head made it easier to get in between teeth and hard to reach back teeth for better cleaning&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic handle for easy grip and brush control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;Motor was a little noisy</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few of these inexpensive motorized toothbrushes.This model is just so-so to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heres what i like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head size seems smaller than most.I feel the small head size ( I have a small mouth) helps me reach my back teeth easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a battery powered brush its lightweight.The lightweight is perfect for me because a heavy brush would make me stop brushing too soon ( i&#x27;m lazy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has color wear bristles to remind you to change your brush head every three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heres what I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch is flat and I have a hard time getting the bush started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration feels weak. I dont feel like it has enough power to make it difference over a manual brush. Package claims to deep clean and promises to remove a 100% more plaque...Both unprovable facts.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted!!!!!</li>
            <li> great toothbrush and very good price point</li>
            <li> This product gets 2 stars off because of the battery.  I haven&#x27;t even used it a week and the battery ran dry.</li>
            <li> I received the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush, Deep Clean thru the Vine program...and LOVE it!  I like the way the two parts of the head work separately and I think that helps to get teeth even cleaner.  The directions say to use it for 2 minutes at a time...felt a bit long, tho I&#x27;m sure my teeth appreciate it!  The head is replaceable and this uses AA batteries which are available everywhere.  Convenient, easy to use, and inexpensive...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;-1smileycat :-)</li>
            <li> So far, so good! I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and it&#x27;s my first experience with a powered toothbrush. I&#x27;ve never wanted to invest the money in one of the expensive ones, so trying this one out was great. I&#x27;m hooked! My mouth feels much cleaner and I know I&#x27;ll never go back to a manual brush. A great deal for the money!</li>
            <li> I received this brush for free to test and review. I will start by saying this is my first spin brush (I have had other electric tooth brushes but never a spin brush). The pros are that it leaves my teething feeling very clean and works way better than a traditional toothbrush. Cons for me were that the brush felt huge and the button to turn it on sometimes sticks a little making it hard to turn on which can be aggravating. I would definitely recommend this over a regular toothbrush but think I still prefer my old sonicare brush to this one. That said this less expensive and would be a good alternative for someone not wanting to pay a lot for a tooth brush!</li>
            <li> I received the Truly Radiant Toothbrush, as well as the Truly Radiant Toothpaste, for free to review for Smiley360. I really like the spinbrush--it definitely reaches further and brushes better than I could with a manual toothbrush. The toothpaste is pretty good too. It&#x27;s minty fresh, and doesn&#x27;t have an odd taste like some of the other whitening toothpastes. I&#x27;ve been using the toothbrush and toothpaste together, twice a day, for about two weeks now, and I definitely notice a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. It&#x27;s probably about the best quality out there for the price.</li>
            <li> I received a free Truly Radiant spin brush and tube of Truly Radiant toothpaste.I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the spin brush! the taste of the toothpaste leaves a lot to be desired tho. However after using the product for just one week there was a significant difference. I mean HUGE! def worth the price!</li>
            <li> I received my toothbrush for free for my review and when I tried it I was pretty amazed. I have always felt that mechanical toothbrushes do t clean as good as a manual one where you do the work yourself but I was proven wrong. That toothbrush reached to my back teeth and when I&#x27;m done I feel my mouth completely clean and food free. The good thing is that the refill brushes aren&#x27;t expire as most others are.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE FLAVOR OF THE TOOTHPASTE IT ALSO DID NOT GIVE ME SORES IN THE CORNERS OF MY MOUTH LIKE MANY TOOTHPASTES DO. AND MY TEETH FEEL MUCH CLEANER WITH MY NEW SPIN BRUSH.</li>
            <li> this is a pretty nice toothbrush i really didnt care for electronic toothbrush but i went a head and gave it a try through smiley 360 although my reason for not using battery power toothbrush hasnt change i will say the toothbrush has helped me with brushing better.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from smiley360. Arm and hammer  brushes and paste are awesome and make your mouth feel super clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Got this free from smiley 360.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love the clean polish feeling of my teeth and the freshness that the toothpaste has. It&#x27;s worth the money for your mouth to feel this good</li>
            <li> I received this free to review and LOVE IT!  My mouth feels clean and my gums don&#x27;t hurt like they do with most power brushes. I will be buying another when this ones time is up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used a battery-operated toothbrush!  I was pleasantly surprised at how this brush made my teeth feel very clean and how it got into the little gaps in my teeth!  It was a great experience and I will continue to use it by buying the replacement heads! The only thing I would change is that they have a cap for the brush part so when not using it stays clean!  Please note that I did receive this product with a tube of  Arm &amp; Hammer. Truly Radiant toothpaste for free to review!  These are my opinions only!</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush for free to test out, but the opinion is my own. After using it for about 2 weeks, I can say it&#x27;s a pretty good toothbrush, but it&#x27;s pretty basic as far as these kinds of motorized toothbrushes come. It does the job, but doesn&#x27;t blow me away. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in the cleanliness of my teeth, or the amount of time I spend brushing to get them feeling as clean as I like. Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a decently priced motorized toothbrush that does a standard job, this one will work for you. But if you&#x27;re looking for something special, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Great product! Loved brushing my teeth with this and would definitely recommend buying this!  I received a free sample of the spin brush truly radiant to review.</li>
            <li> I received the Truly Radiant Spinbrush, to try and review, for free. I have been wanting to go back to a brush like this but haven&#x27;t had the extra money, even for the cheapest one. While this may not be the highest powered, or top-of-the-line brush, I feel like it was a huge step up from a standard toothbrush. Combined with the Arm and Hammer toothpaste, which I also got to try for free, my mouth felt noticeably cleaner after the first use. My only concerns were the softness of the bristles (I prefer &#x27;firm&#x27; toothbrushes), and the battery life, although I am not ready to put all blame for battery life on the brush, itself, until I replace the batteries that came with the brush, with my own fresh set. I also noticed that after only a couple weeks of use, the on/off switch is getting very hard to move, like there is some sort of build-up inside the handle that I can&#x27;t see. Besides those things, the brush, itself, has been an effective, affordable brush if you are looking to move on from manual brushes.</li>
            <li> I received this for free to try nd it is an awesome product that works extreme,y well.</li>
            <li> I love the spin brush!! My teeth feel squeaky clean after each use!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Spinbrush, I was completely amazed! It was so strong and so thorough I felt as though I had just left the dentist. The bristles are soft and gentle enough for sensitive teeth and gums, but the spinning power is strong enough to leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean all over, even the harder to reach spots way in the back. It takes very minimal effort to achieve results I could never have with a manual toothbrush. I have tried other battery-operated toothbrushes in the past, but they are NO where near the cleaning quality and comfort of the Spinbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fter my experience with the Spinbrush and Truly Radiant toothpaste, I can honestly say that I am hooked and will not be going back to what I used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel really good about these products. After having two babies in two years, I noticed that my teeth are more sensitive now. Instead of just focusing on whitening my teeth, it is really important for me to also care for everything underneath  so that my mouth not only looks great, but also feels healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I recently received a new toothpaste and toothbrush to try, compliments of Smily360, for this review. All thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li> I received this as being a member of Smiley360.  It makes to much noise for me and the toothpaste seems to drip alot, making this toothbrush slippery. I do like Arm &amp; Hammer products but this toothbrush isn&#x27;t a must have for me.</li>
            <li> Once you buy a spinbrush you will never want a regular old toothbrush again. Feels great on you teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Spinbrush.  I feel like I get a really good cleaning every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the vibrations of the toothbrush. It gives me a headache. I also find the head of this toothbrush to be bigger than the manual toothbrush I usually use, making it difficult to clean my teeth in the back.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It seemed to brush rough to me and the head was really big.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get to sample one and I love it. It gets to all the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> I love my Toothbrush always leaves my teeth feeling great    \\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a spinbrush before so I was skeptical. Needless to say I was amazed at how easy it was to brush, especially getting to those hard to reach areas where I couldn&#x27;t get to with a regular toothbrush. I am a member of Smiley360 and I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> The Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush is a great electric tooth brush. Not as strong as the more expensive recharging tooth brushes but for the great low price I really liked it. These are also great if you want to have the great feel of an electric tooth brush while vacationing but don&#x27;t want to lug around your expensive tooth brush or the charging station. My teenage son has sensitive teeth and doesn&#x27;t like the rechargeable tooth brushes but he actually liked this one.</li>
            <li> Loved this product! It works just as well as the more expensive brands and my teeth feel cleaner than when I use a manual brush.  I received this as a sample to test.  My opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush. I have seen such great whitening results in the little time that I have had it. I recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free and I thought it was great. Really gets your teeth clean. A word to the wise though, just be extra careful if you have sensitive gums like I do, you want to clutch the toothbrush just a more gentle than everyone else. Other than that, it&#x27;s a really good brush at a decent price for brand name...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get in between teeth as well as it should!!</li>
            <li> very pleased with the toothbrush and toothpaste. i see difference in my teeth for just a week. i received this product for free to try at home. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed the way it made my mouth feel!!  Also really enjoyed that it was free thanks to Smiley360.com. This is 100% of my own opinion!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! I was looking for a toothbrush that wasn&#x27;t too expensive, and this one is perfect. Very powerful for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> My dentist has recommended for years that I get an electric brush. I have always preferred to simplicity of a manual toothbrush. A free sample was a great way for me to see if a change was needed. I received a free product for the purpose of my review of the Spinbrush and the whitening toothpaste. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first experience with Arm &amp; Hammer. I am pleased with the effectiveness of the product and would recommend it to others looking for a simple way to clean their teeth. If you are looking for a more thorough cleaning than a manual brush but less of a commitment than an electric brush, this is a great choice.The brush is easy to use and batteries are replaceable which is much better than the proprietary batteries so many companies force you to use. It is a lot less expensive than the electric brushes and it is nice not to have to recharge it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, especially for young kids that may not brush well enough. My daughter is 9 years old and loves using it and she brushes longer and better because of it.</li>
            <li> The best power toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used!! I like that it&#x27;s not harsh on my teeth but leaves them clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a quality toothbrush and I found it with the Spinbrush Truly Radian Deep Clean Battery toothbrush. I was amazed at how clean my teeth felt. It felt as if I had just left the dentist. The bristles were fast and cleaned my teeth to perfection. I had heard horror stories about electronic spinbrushes and I can honeslty state that I am one satisfied woman. I will be purchasing these for my children. I really like how you can purchase new heads and replace the batteries when needed withhout buying a whole new spinbrush. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality spinbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative would be that it is hard to turn on. I have had to use the toothpaste lid to turn the spinbrush on. It&#x27;s easy to turn off, but difficult to turn on. &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have replaced my expensive rechargeable electric brush with this new Truly Radiant Spinbrush from Arm &amp; Hammer!!!!! I was given this great opportunity for free to try out for my 100% personal review. This brush is great!!!! This brush eliminates flossing if your short on time in the mornings due to it&#x27;s wonderful brushes and the power of the brush. I recommend this to you if your reading this and also all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I received one to try and I actually really liked it. It works much better than a regular toothbrush, I would buy one in the future.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;Have loved having this toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;Pros.&lt;br /&gt;Morning brushing makes my teeth feel squeaky clean. :)&lt;br /&gt;After brushing teeth at night the next morning they still feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer stated: if your hands are wet it&#x27;s difficult to switch on (but hand towel quickly fixes that).&lt;br /&gt;Once this brush is worn out, I will likely purchase another.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant Spin brush and Toothpaste from Smiley360 to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely saw whiter, brighter teeth after about 10 days of regular use so this combo really does work!!&lt;br /&gt;The things I liked about this were the results, the color of the brush (pink!), and the fact that you don&#x27;t accidentally shut it off while brushing like other electronic tooth brushes I&#x27;ve used.  There were a couple of things that I feel Arm &amp; Hammer could do to make it a 5 star product.  First, the taste and texture of the toothpaste was slightly unpleasant, and left a burning sensation in my mouth.  Also, the toothbrush head was very bulky and would be much better in my opinion if  it was more tapered for your mouth to close around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you really want whiter and brighter teeth inexpensively this combo may be the perfect product for you to try!</li>
            <li> I received this spinbrush for free from Smiley360. I had tried battery toothbrushes before but was never impressed enough to continue, but this toothbrush does a wonderful job cleaning. I used it with the Truly radiant toothpaste and you can really notice your teeth getting whiter in just a few days. It makes your mouth feel clean!</li>
            <li> I liked it but it didn&#x27;t do as well as they said it would.</li>
            <li> I found this toothbrush fast and effective to get the job done after using it my teeth were very clean removed tarter and build up  &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush and some toothpaste for free to try it out.  I love the way my teeth feel after using it. One thing not to do is take your hands off the brush while it is on in your mouth...it hurts your teeth. (I have young children and multi task a lot ) It is a good battery charged toothbrush.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a spin brush before.  I really do like it.  I feel like I can really get down to my gums clean and the very back teeth especially!  I am not use to spin brushes so the one downfall is it takes some getting use to, can be a little rough, probably user error but I can&#x27;t seem to keep the toothpaste spit in my mouth while brushing so I have to constantly spit!</li>
            <li> i thought it was pretty good  this is the first spinning brush i have ever used  i have just used reagular toothbrush so i will keep using the spin brush the battery seem to keep going strong i have been using the spin brush for few weeks</li>
            <li> I really like the arm &amp; hammer truly radiant toothpaste. It makes my mouth&lt;br /&gt;feel very fresh and clean. I am so glad I was able to try it for free through smiley360.com&lt;br /&gt;with the spinbrush now I know what it is like and hopefully I can buy some&lt;br /&gt;sometime. My teeth seem to feel cleaner then before I used this.</li>
            <li> I love the Spinbrush, my teeth have never felt cleaner from just brushing. I got mine absolutely FREE I received it for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I will be purchasing Spinbrushes for my whole family. I don&#x27;t think that I will go back to my old manual toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Spin brush is the way to go to brush your teeth. It cleans quickly and  efficiently without hurting! Massage your gums with the gentle spinning heads.</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush for free to try from Smiley360 and I absolutely LOVE it! It is everything you would hope for from a battery powered toothbrush. Using this toothbrush definitely makes it feel like you have just come from the dentist&#x27;s office, in a good way! It really gives you a deeper clean than a manual toothbrush would because of the constant spinning motion of the bristles. I have sensitive gums and this never once made them bleed so it is gentle enough for sensitive gums! Combined with the Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant Toothpaste, this toothbrush does wonders for brightening up teeth! I drink soda, coffee, and tea regularly, but this helps keep my teeth from looking so dingy. The batteries were easy to insert and the battery life is wonderful! I have been using this everyday for weeks and have not had to change the batteries yet! The low price of this toothbrush definitely makes it affordable and a must-have item!</li>
            <li> I received the product free. The views expressed are 100% my own. I was very impressed with the toothbrush. I feel like it did a great job cleaning my teeth and gums. The product is sturdy and holds up well. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I am a Sonicare user but tried the Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant Spinbrush for two weeks. The brush is bulkier and louder than the Sonicare, but a decent brush for the price and my teeth felt just as clean. I will probably hold onto this and use it as a travel brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Arm and Hammer spin brush for a couple of weeks now and I really like it!  My teeth feel cleaner and look whiter.  I&#x27;d recommend it. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I opened my kit from Smiley360 on a Saturday.  I have used Arm &amp; Hammer Toothpaste in the paste.  I always like the way it left my teeth and mouth feeling.  I don&#x27;t like toothpaste or gels that leave your mouth feeling gritty or extra sensitive. I as very excited to accepted into the mission and to try the products.  I do have an &amp;#34;automatic&amp;#34; or battery run toothbrush.  However, I felt that the Spinbrush Truly Radiant™ worked much better!  I felt an even cleaning on all of my teeth, as well as equal pressure and even cleaning. The toothpaste has a clean and pleasant smell.  I did put on my fingers to feel it as well.  It is soft, non gritty and rinse very easily. When I used the toothpaste, i felt that it did a very good job of cleaning my teeth.  I used with the Spinbrush and with a regular toothbrush.  It left my teeth feeling clean, but not over sensitized. My teeth and mouth both felt clean , but did not have that &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; feeling.  Some toothpaste that claim to whiten are gritty, abrasive and make your teeth sensitive to hot and cold. I used the toothpaste as directed.  I noticed a difference after 2 days.  By day 5, there was a significant difference. My boyfriend and coworkers noticed after 3 days. I am a smiley, bubbly, outgoing person. Because of my job I speak to a lot of people. I always want the whitest teeth and best smile possible.  ARM &amp; HAMMER™ Truly Radiant™ Toothpaste definitely made a difference.  My boyfriend actually went out and purchased the product after he saw the difference in a week. I would recommend this product to hers.  Especially if you want something gentle, yet effective.  I will definitely purchase this product in once I finish this tube!  A quick few words about the toothbrush.  It cleans well, it has soft, yet effective bristles and works with the amount of pressure you apply.  Another great product that I would purchase and recommend. I&#x27;m a member of Smiley360.com, where I qualify to try brands for free in exchange for sharing my authentic feedback.</li>
            <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> My 7 yr old loved it soooo much I got one each for the whole family.</li>
            <li> For years, I have wanted one of those super expensive, fancy, electronic toothbrushes, but instead I simply buy the more affordable battery-powered toothbrushes sold in department stores.  The Spinbrush is my favorite.  Not only is it easy to maintain, with heads and batteries cheap and easy to replace, but it also keeps teeth clean and white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spinbrush is easy to use.  Simply take it out of the package, power it on, and it is ready for use.  Changing the head is very easy, simply requiring you to twist the head off, pop on a new one, and twist it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this toothbrush! Since using the Spinbrush Truly Radiant Toothbrush I can tell a noticeable difference in my teeth.  Not only do my teeth feel super clean, they also appear whiter.  I highly recommend this for those who are looking for an affordable toothbrush that produces results.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves using spinbrushes.  What I think I liked the most about this though was the fact in it being soft bristled and it lasted for over 3 weeks without breaking! She may love these kind, but she can break them in nothing flat usually.  Great toothbrush that is worth the money!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quality toothbrush at a reasonable price, this is it. It&#x27;s easy to use and not rough on my gums. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is well made. the batteries are replaceable and so are the brush heads. It&#x27;s been getting heavy use and works all the time. My only complaint is that it could be slightly more powerful. I find that rather than let the motor do all the work I still need to brush back and forth. Still for its size I gets thats typical. I also feel an item like this should cost less. someone making something like this with a USB rechargeable capacity would be cool and eliminate the need for new batteries.</li>
            <li> I use both manual and powered toothbrushes because they seem to get at my teeth in slightly different ways, plus a powered brush is a fun change. I still love the Oral B I bought 15+ years ago, but it uses rechargeable batteries and they no longer hold a good charge. So I&#x27;ve been eyeing other toothbrushes like the Spinbrush and was excited to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I like that it uses regular batteries (2 AA); they&#x27;re more convenient than needing to keep the rechargables charged. The unit is easy to hold and it&#x27;s easy to remove the brush head for thorough rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The motor is louder than the Oral B; the brush head seems to buzz more than actually move (I get less of a fresh feel after brushing); and the brush head is HUGE (not just the bristles but also the frame; very difficult to get around the back of my upper molars). These aren&#x27;t dealbreakers, but I&#x27;ll definitely look for a smaller brush head when it&#x27;s time for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I was given this toothbrush for free for the purpose of my review...My opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A really great toothbrush!  I have used other battery operated toothbrushes before, but this one works so much better.  It has a great spin...I feel as though my teeth are not only getting clean, but polished all at the same time.  Using this in conjunction with the Arm &amp; Hammer Radiant Whitening and Strengthening Toothpaste and flossing, has really allowed me to have a greater experience cleaning my mouth twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can say about it is that it is a little loud.  If my husband is asleep before I brush my teeth, the sound wakes him up, so I have to make sure to brush before he retires for the night...if not, I have to go back to a regular toothbrush and that is a no-no...lol.</li>
            <li> I received a free Arm &amp; Hammer Spinbrush from Smiley to review.  I really liked it.  Cleans really well, even gets those hard to reach areas like behind your molars and the backs of front teeth.  Very gentle on gums while giving a very solid cleaning to your teeth.  I tried going back to my manual brush just for comparison, but then threw it out.  I&#x27;m sticking with the Spinbrush!  Only drawbacks - its kind of loud and sometimes the vibration makes my nose itch.  Weird, I know, but overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> LOVE this toothbrush.  I have used other battery operated toothbrushes in the past and they are ok but this one is just great.  I feel like my teeth and mouth feel cleaner and fresher.  My teeth look whiter.  This is a keeper</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste and toothbrush! I got it free from Smiley360, but I have since bought more, because it is my new favorite regimen. My mouth is so clean and fresh, and my teeth feel stronger. I was already a fan of Arm &amp; Hammer Advanced White toothpaste, but I do believe this is even better, which is amazing.</li>
            <li> it was the best tooth brush i have ever brushed my teeth with and i got it for free from the smiley 360 program and arm &amp; hammer i love it</li>
            <li> Have been using the spin brush with Truly Radiant toothpaste and I really like it..I love how clean my teeth feel. I can also notice whitening..Very excited of the results I&#x27;ve see. So far...would feel comfortable recommending it....</li>
            <li> I tried this brush free from Smiley360. It&#x27;s pretty great! It&#x27;s a little loud, but cleans nicely.</li>
            <li> I received a free ARM &amp; HAMMER Truly Radiant Spinbrush and tube of Truly Radiant Toothpaste from Smiley360 to try out and review. I have always used a manual toothbrush, so I was excited to try out an electric one. Overall, I am pleased with the Spinbrush. It is powerful, yet gentle, and leaves my mouth feeling clean. The brush and replacement heads are also inexpensive compared to other electric toothbrushes. Price is an important factor for me as I do not want to spend a significant amount of money on a toothbrush and then even more for the replacement heads which should be changed every three months. Although I have enjoyed using the Spinbrush, there are a few things that I would want to change in order to improve upon the product. For one, I find the toothbrush to be loud. I do not know if it is any louder than other types of electric toothbrushes, but I would prefer a quieter sound. In addition, it can be difficult to turn the brush on/off and take the brush head off in order to clean it, especially if your hands are wet. Also, it would be great if there was a two minute timer on the toothbrush. However, I would say the positives outweigh the negatives. I plan on continuing to use this product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review on behalf that I received the Truely Radiant toothbrush and toothpaste for free from Smiley360.com to test and anything I say here within if of my own opinion 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the packaging, color, size and weight of these products. I found this toothbrush easy to turn on and it fit well in my hand. I have a smaller mouth and it was effective while cleaning my teeth but, I missed using a tongue cleaner as an added accessory. The battery died after five uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste was easy to dispense without it pouring out a bunch at one time. The taste was average and didn&#x27;t give me much of a nice minty cool after feel that I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall both the toothbrush and toothpaste could use improvement.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is wonderful. It really cleans my teeth super great!!!! Love this toothbrush :)</li>
            <li> I received a Spinbrush Truly radiant toothbrush from Smiley360. My teeth have never felt so clean. Team it with Arm and Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste for a complete clean with extra whitening. I love it and will not use anything else!</li>
            <li> I received my Spinbrush as part of a product testing panel with Smiley360.  Included in the test was also a tube of Arm and Hammer Truly Radiant toothpaste.  Having a significant amount of experience with product testing I have spent the last month trying each product with my regular product, i.e. regular toothbrush with the toothpaste, and regular tooth paste with the toothbrush to come up with the best possible determination possible with a single subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Truly Radiant Toothpaste to be better than the Colgate Whitening I have been using.  It removed more of the staining, especially in hard to reach areas than the gel Colgate Whitening variety I was using.  I credit much of this to the grittier consistency of the Truly Radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spinbrush had issues no matter which product I used with it.  The plastic used in the construction is very slippery when wet.  Brushing teeth is ALWAY going to result in a wet toothbrush handle as the hand is wet to begin with or when the moistened brush is tipped up to put in the mouth moisture immediately makes its way down the handle.  This combination of an already slippery handle and water is not a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slippery issue is compounded with this product as the slide switch to turn the brush on and off is made of the same slippery especially when wet plastic as the handle itself.  There is no significant raised area on the switch to give a thumb or finger something substantial to push against to compensate for this.  Since the switch triggers motion both spinning and bi-directional of surfaces with toothpaste applied it is definitely ill-advised to turn this device on before it is fully in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only remedy I found with the test product was to wrap it in a washcloth to keep the surface dry and provide a better grip and reduce switch slip.  I found this completely unsatisfactory as it generated a lot more laundry and mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest the manufacturer redesign the handle to use a slip resistant material and the switch for better grip as well.  Such a redesign would also make it possible for individuals with arthritis and other impairments of the hand to use the product which the current design would prohibit.</li>
            <li> Smiley360 choose me to be a part of the NEW ARM &amp; HAMMER Truly Radiant Mission.  I received a Full Size Tube of their Truly Radiant Toothpaste &amp; the spin toothbrush.  I am very pleased with the results.  I&#x27;m a heavy coffee consumer &amp; I need my toothpaste to be better than average.  I will definitely recommend this to my family &amp; friends &amp; plan to purchase soon.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free product trial and I LOVE the truly radiant tooth brush and toothpaste!  Make your SMILE brilliant and try this-you will be so happy you did!</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush free from Smiley360 to test. I am overall satisfied with it. It feels like my mouth is getting a massage if that makes sense.  I feel it does a thorough job of getting my teeth clean. The only complaint I have is it feels a bit bulky. But I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this toothbrush. It works really well and keeps my mouth feeling really clean without brushing so hard that I lose my enamel. I really feel like it has made it easier to keep my mouth clean for longer.</li>
            <li> I was given the spinbrush and truly radiant toothpaste from smiley360. This brush is so far, the best electric brush I have used. My teeth felt very clean afterwards. The head is a little hard, but otherwise great. The toothpaste is not so great. I personally think it tastes very sweet. I have to rinse my mouth a lot to get the sweetness out and still there is a lot of after-taste.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample Spinbrush toothbrush through Smiley360. I liked the spinbrush, but it was a little too strong for my sensitive teeth and kind of left my jaw hurting after use. The new Arm &amp; Hammer Truly Radian toothpaste however is amazing!!! My husband and I both thought it was the best toothpaste we have ever used. Great taste and our mouths felt fresh even after drinking coffee. Amazing! Will definitely be buying this toothpaste from now on.</li>
            <li> Received this item from the manufacturer for review.&lt;br /&gt; I liked this electric toothbrush. I use manual brushes, so this was new for me. It was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this toothbrush from Smiley.com for purpose of review and I&#x27;m so happy! This toothbrush made my mouth feel invigorated. Much better than the Crest spinbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works very well and leaves my mouth feeling ridiculously clean!</li>
            <li> I recieved the toothbrush and paste for free through smiley360 in return for my review.  The toothbrush is amazing and cleans a million times better than my old manual brush.  The longer bristles get in and give me a really good deep cleaning and the toothpaste keeps my mouth and breath fresh for a god 3-4 hours.  Since I am a hairdresser that LOVES coffee this is a HUGE plus for me 😊  the only thing is the thoothpaste is a little thinner in consistency so put the brush in your mouth before turning on otherwise some paste may fall off.</li>
            <li> Smile member&lt;br /&gt;Its a nice toothbrush I use it with the toothpaste also with another technique. I have noticed that I more able and willing to get to parts and longer with the 3 combination that I&#x27;m using its a perfect set.</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush and an Arm &amp; Hammer sample paste for free to test it. My opinions are 100% my own.   I like the sleek look of the brush. Additionally, the brush feels pretty comfortable in my hand. The brush head is small enough that I can reach every corner of my mouth and the bristles seem to clean everything very well. After the first two days I noticed that my teeth felt cleaner after brushing. Because I haven&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush in a very long time, this brush seems very powerful to me. However, it also seems very loud, but I do not have another electric brush to compare the noise level to.  The toothbrush does a great job cleaning my teeth although I&#x27;ve noticed that I now have toothpaste splatters on my shirt if I&#x27;m not careful. when in use, but I do not have another electric brush to compare the noise level to.  FYI: I&#x27;ve noticed that I splattered the front of my shirt with toothpaste if I wasn&#x27;t careful while brushing. However, the toothpaste that came with the brush seemed thinner than my usual toothpaste, so this might have caused the spatters.</li>
            <li> I was not very impressed with the spinbrush. The bristles are way too soft and they do not get in between the teeth. My manual brush does that better since I have more control over it. I also can&#x27;t say my teeth are ANY whiter. I won;t spend the money on another one and will be going back to my manual brush</li>
            <li> I was really wanting to like this Spinbrush from Arm &amp; Hammer and was grateful to receive it for free from Smily360 in order to create a review about it. With that said, the Spinbrush does have good power to it, but I honestly like my regular manual toothbrush better. I found this toothbrush hard to control. It was bulky in my hands and when my hands were wet it was almost impossible to maneuver the toothbrush around my teeth. I just found it very hard to make sure that every one of my teeth were cleaned completely. It was also hard to switch the toothbrush on and off if my fingers were even slightly damp. Honestly, I just feel like I can get my teeth cleaner with my manual toothbrush. If the handle wasn&#x27;t so bulky and the switch was easier to turn on and off, it would be greatly improved.</li>
            <li> I received this spin brush for free to test out and let me just say, WOW!! It has just enough power to get the job done! Others I have tried were way too powerful and hurt my mouth! Not this one! I ended up buying my husband and 11 yr old one because I loved it so much, and they like theirs too! Awesome job, Arm &amp; Hammer!</li>
            <li> I was always against battery operated toothbrushes because I thought they were silly but when I received this one to try I fell in love and realized I was missing out all these years! I love it and I&#x27;m never going back. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I have never bought a Spinbrush of any brand before.  I have used the waterpik, in the past.  I signed up for Smiley, and received the Spinbrush for a free trial.  I would not have bought the Spinbrush on my own, but after trying out the Spinbrush for 30 days, I love it.  My teeth feel like I just received a cleaning from the dentist.  The bristles are gentle, yet reaches between my teeth. I also like how portable the Spinbrush is compared to the waterpik.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried a power toothbrush. I always kind of thought that they were just a ploy to get you to pay more for a toothbrush. I was pleasantly surprised by how much cleaner this brush got my teeth! I feel like with very little work I can get my teeth way cleaner than I did with a manual toothbrush. This brush said it would get my teeth cleaner and I believe it! I can tell that it gets down into the spaces between my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all seen the fancy displays of the sonic brushes in our dentist office, but unless I win the lottery there is no way I am ever going to drop that kind of cash to get one.  The Truly Radiant Spinbrush does the same job but at a bargain price.  I was a bit skeptical that it would make that much of a difference but it really does.  It leaves your teeth with the just cleaned slick feeling every time you brush and with way less toothpaste than you are used to using.  I have steadily cut back on the &amp;#34;pea&amp;#34; sized amount of toothpaste that I use.  I barely dab any on and it cleans each and every tooth.  You don&#x27;t need any pressure....just simply glide it over your teeth and it does the rest. It fits in the hard to reach places and gets behind teeth.  No one thinks flossing is a fun activity but by using this toothbrush, flossing is even faster.  The longer set of bristles seem to get in those crannies between teeth.  It is a bit noisy...but I figured that was because I was used to using the silent manual type.  It does great on batteries (better than most smartphones).  I have been using it twice a day for over a month with the original batteries in it and it is still going strong.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review.

            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used a battery operated toothbrush before so didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I received this spinbrush to review.&lt;br /&gt;It took a couple of days to get used to the handle vs a manual toothbrush I&#x27;m used to using.  The bristles were gentle on my gums and teeth, no need to add pressure. It left my teeth squeaky clean. I like that the bottom is flat so I can stand it up. Plus you cant beat the price . The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was it was a bit loud &amp; wish it had a timer. Other than that I really like using this spinbrush . I also used truly radiant toothpaste and with these together , my teeth look whiter, feel cleaner, and polished.I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Too painful for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Great product love the way it works feels like I just visited the dentist leaves my mouth feeling fresh super clean everyone should own this for their teeth  perfect with the tooth paste</li>
            <li> I am totally ashamed to know that I have not been cleaning my teeth right. I have been using the arm and hammer spin brush for about a month now, and my teet feel so much cleaner then before. I am very happy with it and I definitely recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;This toothbrush does as promised. It cleans very well, maybe not as well as say the sonic or other high end brands. But for the brand it does very well.</li>
            <li> I liked it way better then using a regular toothbrush. I will never go back. It reaches all the areas in your mouth and you can feel it working. The best part it gently massages your gums. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> I received a free Arm and Hammer Truly Radiant Spinbrush to try from Smiley 360. My review is 100% my own opinions of this product. This spinbrush, while fun to use, did not clean as well as I had hoped and I felt the need to floss much more than with my manual brush. Also the spinbrush made my teeth more sensitive I think because I tried to press it a bit to reach between teeth more. I used it with Arm and hammer truly radiant toothpaste which I LOVE and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Smiley 360 gave me the awesome opportunity to use this spinbrush. I noticed an excellent clean after only 3 times using it after 5 days I was sold and will be buying this toothbrush for my family this coming holiday season</li>
            <li> This is a great product i have sensitive teeth and i was on the fence about using this product but it surprised me it was amazingly gentle on my teeth but it made my teeth sparkle i couldnt have been happier to recieve this product from smiley 360.I received a free product for the purpose of my review.

            <li> I received a free sample of the Spinbrush and Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste. I loved the toothbrush the way it worked  was so much better than a manual, it&#x27;s more accessible to get to the back teeth and it just makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting a true deep cleaning. The toothpaste had a very nice flavor. I did notice a difference in my teeth with whiteness in just 5 days. I will be purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> : &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. I love this toothbrush is works so great.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this Spinbrush twice a day for almost three months now. The batteries (Duracell) that came with it just died, so in that regard, this toothbrush gives good bang for its buck. It also deep cleans extremely well. I’ve had some stains on the back of my bottom teeth that I’d been trying to scrub away with a regular toothbrush to no avail. This Spinbrush, however, has lightened them significantly, and without any extra pressure applied than normal brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the reason why this brush gets four stars instead of five. The replacement heads are extremely pricey. At about $4.50 apiece, you can get two for the price of a brand new toothbrush *with* batteries. So, in fact, by buying replacement heads, you’re actually losing money. And because it is recommended that heads be replaced every three months, that’s a LOT of money down the drain over time. I can see how this product is a huge moneymaker for Arm &amp; Hammer. Unfortunately, the cost of long-term loyalty has alienated me a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I’ll fall for the consumer gouging. I really like this brush, but I’ll probably just wait for a sale and buy a brand new product. And that mindset also disturbs me because if everyone takes the same approach, how many of these Spinbrushes are going to end up rotting in landfills? Please consider the environmental effects of your profit model, Arm &amp; Hammer.</li>
