            <li>Every where he goes people are asking him what he has on because it smells so good.</li>
            <li>in all, this very strong smelling oil is great and smells like patchouli.</li>
            <li>I love this junk!</li>
            <li>This is the most authentic smelling patchouli out there.  </li>
            <li>Love it , love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this Patchouli oil and use it in my oil warmer all the time.</li>
            <li>The scent is okay, but not the best for lasting fragrance.  </li>
            <li>And they have supported my needs for many decades.</li>
            <li>My online source is Amazon for many things and again, it is my go-to source.</li>
            <li>I personally love patchouli scents.</li>
            <li>It is definitely better to buy oils in person and after exploring the options with someone who works with oils.</li>
            <li>This way, I made sure I bought what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would have preferred to be able to use a dropper.</li>
            <li>I smelled this at a local Sprouts from their tester and it smelled wonderful.</li>
            <li>was thinking this product is more of a 4.5-5 stars, but 5 stars would be more accurate.</li>
            <li>Lovely as a perfume, and quite strong.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best and most pure essence of patchouli.</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>That being said, this oil is sharply STRONG.</li>
            <li>I have always loved the smell of patchouli, reminds me of some of my past relationships, the good ol&#x27; days, hehe...</li>
            <li>It has a very rich aroma and works very well for scenting my homemade body wash, deodorant and body lotion.</li>
            <li>Love it, will be back when I need more.</li>
            <li>Classic Patchouli fragrance, love it.</li>
            <li>And Aura Cacia&#x27;s, which I&#x27;ve been buying since I became aware of it--surely at least 20 years now--is the very best, five-star without a doubt.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I think the buy was worth it.</li>
            <li>Was delivered quickly, thanks!</li>
            <li>love it, brings back memories from my youth.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys!</li>
            <li>bottles of Aura Cacia Patchouli w/levels at or above the top of the bottle label</li>
            <li>My husband was able to get each bottle open for me once, but he can&#x27;t get into them now either.  </li>
            <li>It is a pure, earthy scent.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Aura Cacia is the truest to the real thing.</li>
            <li>Was really looking forward to this.</li>
            <li>This patchouli is far more dry and herbal than others</li>
            <li>and it smells sickly sweet mixed with ashtray.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommenced this product to others.</li>
            <li>They think it is some new cologne I am wearing.  </li>
            <li>But when it was mixed with  some other oils, including virgin coconut oil, it becomes much more to what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Really disappointed, but maybe it&#x27;s me as I tried another brand that 20 years ago was the best</li>
            <li>BTW, I spent a very long time browsing online for patchouli oil and am glad I came upon this brand in person.</li>
            <li>I personally find it smells like pure patchouli oil, but I will post her opinion of the product since she will be the one who uses it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I can smell like one all of the time, Some patchouli stinks, but this brand of oil smells great.</li>
            <li>The strength is a soft patchouli.</li>
            <li>I give 5 stars because I am very picky about things like fragrances, especially so for a guy.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing patchouli for decades (literally, since the early 1970s).  </li>
            <li>the patchouli being worn on the skin as a fragrance, one only needs one drop and over time, such a long time, the lid of the bottle just can&#x27;t last through that many openings?  </li>
            <li>and this particular brand brings those memories back</li>
            <li>Aura acacia is only sold in high end spas, and at a price that one bottle would cost me there, I got 3(!).</li>

    <ol>
            <li> item pictured not item purchased</li>
            <li> I have been wearing patchouli for well over 15 years.  This is the most authentic smelling patchouli out there.  Great product.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is an essential oil but, I bought it or my husband to wear as cologne. Every where he goes people are asking him what he has on because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent for a long time. Aura Cacia is the truest to the real thing. Having been to India, nothing compares to the authenticity of aura acacias product. Also, great price. Aura acacia is only sold in high end spas, and at a price that one bottle would cost me there, I got 3(!). Love it, will be back when I need more.</li>
            <li> I was expexting an oil I could wear as a perfume......this is not anything I could ever wear.  Smells like dirt...sorry to say....I dont know what I would ever do with this...</li>
            <li> Smells just like the Patchouli of the 60&#x27;a.  Love it , love it.  Great price too!  Was delivered quickly, thanks!</li>
            <li> this is the only essential oil i use n i use it daily. its my scent. . . one bottle lasts for months. . . a little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> Aura Cacia is the best that money can buy&lt;br /&gt;purest oils and best results.  been using Aura Cacia coupled with Frontier&#x27;s 100% Organic Grapeseed Oil for over 5 years now.  Best results and best quality!</li>
            <li> I love this Patchouli oil and use it in my oil warmer all the time. It is a pure, earthy scent. People comment on how great my house smells all the time.</li>
            <li> The scent is okay, but not the best for lasting fragrance.  The strength is a soft patchouli. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I give 5 stars because I am very picky about things like fragrances, especially so for a guy.  I have always loved the smell of patchouli, reminds me of some of my past relationships, the good ol&#x27; days, hehe... and this particular brand brings those memories back and I get compliments about it when I put a few drops on my neck and back.  They think it is some new cologne I am wearing.  I would recomend this product to anyone who loves patchouli and the memories and thoughts it inspires!  Warmth, peace and happiness!!!</li>
            <li> love it, brings back memories from my youth.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this brand for awhile and I am very happy with it. It has a very rich aroma and works very well for scenting my homemade body wash, deodorant and body lotion. It is by far the best and most pure essence of patchouli.I would highly recommenced this product to others.</li>
            <li> Aura Cacia has supported my balance in the world with Patchouli. And they have supported my needs for many decades. As I pass from one residence to another, locations for supply are sometimes difficult to find. My online source is Amazon for many things and again, it is my go-to source.</li>
            <li> Lovely as a perfume, and quite strong.  This patchouli is far more dry and herbal than others I&#x27;ve used- reminds me of tobacco flowers.  I quite like it and I bet it is wonderful for infusions.</li>
            <li> This is very thin oil, scent doesn&#x27;t last long.  No I will not buy again. I will find another brand,</li>
            <li> This oil was bought for my partner. I personally find it smells like pure patchouli oil, but I will post her opinion of the product since she will be the one who uses it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking this product is more of a 4.5-5 stars, but 5 stars would be more accurate. I personally love patchouli scents. But being someone who just began to understand the nuances of blended oils and scents, I realized I prefer patchouli mixed with other scents. That being said, this oil is sharply STRONG. But when it was mixed with  some other oils, including virgin coconut oil, it becomes much more to what I was looking for. It retains it&#x27;s unique scent whilst cutting down on the smell just enough to soften it. BTW, I spent a very long time browsing online for patchouli oil and am glad I came upon this brand in person. It is definitely better to buy oils in person and after exploring the options with someone who works with oils. This way, I made sure I bought what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this very strong smelling oil is great and smells like patchouli. The bottle is sturdy but not too fond of the blue plastic covering the opening of the bottle. Would have preferred to be able to use a dropper. Nevertheless, I think the buy was worth it.</li>
            <li> Classic Patchouli fragrance, love it.</li>
            <li> I love this junk! I love smelling like a dirty hippie. Now I can smell like one all of the time, Some patchouli stinks, but this brand of oil smells great. Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> I must like the \\&quot;synthetic\\&quot; patchouli oil from the 90&#x27;s...burnt tobacco/dirty ashtray. Still searching for the dirty hippie smell. Seller uses \\&quot;Mail Innovations\\&quot; by UPS...sure it&#x27;s cheap. but plan on waiting a week as it ships from NJ...something well hidden..ought to take away a star for hiding your location. I smelled this at a local Sprouts from their tester and it smelled wonderful. Was really looking forward to this. Really disappointed, but maybe it&#x27;s me as I tried another brand that 20 years ago was the best and it smells sickly sweet mixed with ashtray.</li>
            <li> Best patchouli out there!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing patchouli for decades (literally, since the early 1970s).  And Aura Cacia&#x27;s, which I&#x27;ve been buying since I became aware of it--surely at least 20 years now--is the very best, five-star without a doubt.  However, there is one problem that I&#x27;ve had repeated.  The outer and inner lids get screwed up, so that I can&#x27;t open them.  I use other Aura Cacia oils in my aromatherapy burner and have never had this issue w/any of them.  Perhaps it&#x27;s because w/the patchouli being worn on the skin as a fragrance, one only needs one drop and over time, such a long time, the lid of the bottle just can&#x27;t last through that many openings?  Wouldn&#x27;t have taken the time to write this, except . . . hmmm, the Aura Cacia website has no &amp;#34;Contact Us&amp;#34; option . . . and at the moment, I have two .5 fl. oz. bottles of Aura Cacia Patchouli w/levels at or above the top of the bottle label and I can&#x27;t get either lid off to use the oil.  Yes, I&#x27;m pushing down on it as I turn it.  It&#x27;s just not working.  My husband was able to get each bottle open for me once, but he can&#x27;t get into them now either.  Enough patchouli oil here to last two years, but I can&#x27;t get to it!</li>
