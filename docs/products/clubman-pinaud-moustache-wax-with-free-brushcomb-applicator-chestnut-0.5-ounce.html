    <ol>
            <li>Been using this for over 40 years, excellent poroduct</li>
            <li>works.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product!</li>
            <li>hold is amazing, and it blends perfectly with my beard color.</li>
            <li>This wax is just what I needed--the color works well with my moustache and the hold is great.  </li>
            <li>Great seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good</li>
            <li>It is a vey good product.  </li>
            <li>I am not trying to win any beard contests or turn the ends into loops, so I think it works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>This did the job nicely.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with product and value.</li>
            <li>It is more like a paste than a wax.</li>
            <li>I got a flea comb for dogs at the pet store that is way better.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>The neutral color is more noticeable in my &#x27;stache.</li>
            <li>Love the 3-pack.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, and I don’t find it overpowering, but I do wonder about the kinds of chemicals I am putting right under the ol snot box.</li>
            <li>Its a great product, and I am sure, should I ever need it I will be using the same brand.</li>
            <li>The best way I have found to apply it is to rub it between the finger and thumb to smooth out any chunks, then dab it gently starting near the top before working it in.</li>
            <li>I use a bigger comb just because it goes fast, but the included comb is excellent.</li>
            <li>Works well,this is what i have been using,sure there is something better but the price was right.</li>
            <li>This is another item that I couldn&#x27;t find in stores anymore, and this is great stuff to cover grey and to keep a moustache neat and under control.</li>
            <li>I like some of the more expensive stuff better, but for every day use and portability this works great for me.</li>
            <li>Clubman wax has good hold once it is dry.  </li>
            <li>One is that when people see it for the first time and say “Hey!</li>
            <li>A quick comb—not too much or you will remove all the product you just applied—and then smooth it as needed.</li>
            <li>This is a very good mustache wax that is not overly hard to apply.</li>
            <li>All around a great little product for the mustache.</li>
            <li>Because it is based on beeswax, it is easy to clean out every night, and it gives me the control I need for my naturally mischievous handlebar.</li>
            <li>This stuff does the job, for the right price.</li>
            <li>The real surprise was I got 3 packages, and I only thought I was buying 1, so that was a pleasant surprise and made the price quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the ultimate best.</li>
            <li>Been using this for years, good stuff and works well to hide a little gray</li>
            <li>I hope you do better marketing in the future.</li>
            <li>After a quick shaping with a mini-pocket straightener, I gently smear a large glob of it into my mustache, trying to just lightly coat the hairs, and apply more as I comb through a 2nd, 3rd time.</li>
            <li>It has a nice holding ability suited for a typical mustache.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very wirey beard and mustache hair which ardently resists any and all styling attempts I make at it.</li>
            <li>Consistency of the wax was VERY clumpy (even when using blow-drying techniques).</li>
            <li>As advertised and fast delivery</li>
            <li>It blends away the gray a bit if you want it to (meaning amount applied) and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Neither &#x27;natural&#x27; nor &#x27;chestnut&#x27; colors were right for a red beard.</li>
            <li>Wax worked well, and I felt like I &amp;#34;used up&amp;#34; the brush about the time I was ready for my next tube, with a new brush included.</li>
            <li>It goes quick with a stache as big as mine, but that is life (make a bigger size, like toothpaste tube size!).</li>
            <li>Or even a clear.</li>
            <li>It has a gentle lemon scent which you get used to by the end of the 3rd day of use and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through 3 tubes so far</li>
            <li>By then, there is enough wax on to shape it and get it to hold very well.</li>
            <li>The color it comes out of the tube in is quite ugly, luckily as it dries it darkens into a nice shade.</li>
            <li>It last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>I went to 3 major drugstores to buy another tube only to find that none of them had it, so I went to a beauty supply and they had only &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I have had a difficult time finding some wax that was the correct color, as my hair is very light brown.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Totally satisfied with product and value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned a few things since deciding to grow out a real moustache.  One is that when people see it for the first time and say “Hey! I like your moustache!” you can translate that to “Hey! You have a moustache!”  But if you are a real man who doesn’t make facial hair decisions based on public consensus, you will move past that and get to the grooming. This is where moustache wax comes into play and here are the things I wondered about before I tried this one and other notables.  1. It is more like a paste than a wax. I am not trying to win any beard contests or turn the ends into loops, so I think it works just fine for me. It essentially tames it a little and de-bushifies it which is just what I need. If you need holding power your mileage may vary. 2. I have reddish whiskers but went for the chestnut color. It does darken it a little which I actually like, and I think that it blends close enough that it does not stand out or give a frosted appearance. Nobody noticed that it changed or that there is product in it. 3. The smell is nice, and I don’t find it overpowering, but I do wonder about the kinds of chemicals I am putting right under the ol snot box. 4. The comb and brush are garbage. I got a flea comb for dogs at the pet store that is way better. 5.  It last a pretty long time. Although it seems like a small amount you don’t need to use too much. 6. The best way I have found to apply it is to rub it between the finger and thumb to smooth out any chunks, then dab it gently starting near the top before working it in. This will help disperse it evenly. A quick comb—not too much or you will remove all the product you just applied—and then smooth it as needed.</li>
            <li> Works well,this is what i have been using,sure there is something better but the price was right.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product. I have had a difficult time finding some wax that was the correct color, as my hair is very light brown. This did the job nicely. It&#x27;s slightly difficult to get out of the tube, but not bad. The real surprise was I got 3 packages, and I only thought I was buying 1, so that was a pleasant surprise and made the price quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve tried that actually holds my beard and stache in a way that I like. Balms and other waxes have done little to nothing. This thing definitely holds.</li>
            <li> If you want to know about this wax, look no further than me. I have a mustache that comes out about 7 inches, which I form into a handlebar. I&#x27;ve tried the hardest pomade style products out there, and several tube style waxes. This is, hands down, the ultimate best. It has a gentle lemon scent which you get used to by the end of the 3rd day of use and don&#x27;t even notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very wirey beard and mustache hair which ardently resists any and all styling attempts I make at it. But this wax does an admirable job. I&#x27;ve gone through 3 tubes so far and I&#x27;ve got another 9 backlogged. It goes quick with a stache as big as mine, but that is life (make a bigger size, like toothpaste tube size!). The natural hole made by the cap is small, I open it up wider with a small flathead screwdriver I had laying around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is amazing, and it blends perfectly with my beard color. I use a bigger comb just because it goes fast, but the included comb is excellent. After a quick shaping with a mini-pocket straightener, I gently smear a large glob of it into my mustache, trying to just lightly coat the hairs, and apply more as I comb through a 2nd, 3rd time. By then, there is enough wax on to shape it and get it to hold very well. If clubman ever stops making this wax, I will have a very long cry about it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good mustache wax that is not overly hard to apply. It blends away the gray a bit if you want it to (meaning amount applied) and looks very natural. It has a nice holding ability suited for a typical mustache. It tends to make the mustache look a bit fuller too.</li>
            <li> I like some of the more expensive stuff better, but for every day use and portability this works great for me.</li>
            <li> One tube lasts me for months. I went to 3 major drugstores to buy another tube only to find that none of them had it, so I went to a beauty supply and they had only &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; so I found it on line and paid a fee upgrade. I hope you do better marketing in the future. I&#x27;m good but you just might want some other customers.</li>
            <li> I use it every day.  Because it is based on beeswax, it is easy to clean out every night, and it gives me the control I need for my naturally mischievous handlebar.</li>
            <li> It is the benchmark to which all other mustache waxes are compared. I like how the chestnut color blends. The neutral color is more noticeable in my &#x27;stache. The color it comes out of the tube in is quite ugly, luckily as it dries it darkens into a nice shade. I get a lot of compliments, and a lot of people ask what I use. Sometimes people try to get me to switch to &amp;#34;their&amp;#34; brand. I see no need. This stuff does the job, for the right price.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this for my father who swears by it and uses it everyday. Its a great product, and I am sure, should I ever need it I will be using the same brand.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for years.  It is a vey good product.  I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I always buy it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that it came in different colors. What I needed was an Auburn colour. Or even a clear. &amp; I ended up with a brown. And now my son in law&#x27;s red mustache is brown. Is there anyway we can exchange it.?</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be purchasing Clubman anymore. Consistency of the wax was VERY clumpy (even when using blow-drying techniques). Neither &#x27;natural&#x27; nor &#x27;chestnut&#x27; colors were right for a red beard.</li>
            <li> This wax is just what I needed--the color works well with my moustache and the hold is great.  Love the 3-pack.</li>
            <li> All around a great little product for the mustache. It was a little darker than I was expecting, but not too dark that I couldn&#x27;t use it. Be careful rolling it up like a toothpaste tube because the sides will split and you&#x27;ll be left with a sticky mess. It feels like the walls are a little thin, but as long as you don&#x27;t try to fold it you&#x27;re just fine. Wax worked well, and I felt like I &amp;#34;used up&amp;#34; the brush about the time I was ready for my next tube, with a new brush included.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over 40 years, excellent poroduct</li>
            <li> Clubman wax has good hold once it is dry.  It came out a bit darker than I thought it would, am going to try and cut it with some neutral Clubman wax and see if that works.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, good stuff and works well to hide a little gray</li>
            <li> The only wax my Dad will use. Great seller. As advertised and fast delivery</li>
            <li> This is another item that I couldn&#x27;t find in stores anymore, and this is great stuff to cover grey and to keep a moustache neat and under control. I will buy this item again, as I use it everyday.</li>
