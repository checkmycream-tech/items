            <li>He is very good about hygiene but at the end of the day he could still make your eyes water.</li>

            <li>Good wash as per my grandsons.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I admit that it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact you have to give it a good manly squeeze to squirt the soap out.  </li>
            <li>All in all a good product.</li>
            <li>This body wash smells really good.</li>
            <li>I have no skin irritation and think this product does a good job moisturizing as it works.</li>
            <li>so I figured it would be good to compare them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>you\\&quot; guy could find a more attractive guy to bathe with than me, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite body wash at a discounted price!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The smell is rather strong, but pleasant, so that can be taken for good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the vien of all these manly soaps it has a kind of musky cologne type smell.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and works and comes in a sturdy bottle.  </li>
            <li>He likes a good lather and this one lathers up well, better than the Suave brand he was using.</li>
            <li>We all liked it.  </li>
            <li>nice product.  </li>
            <li>They both feel nice on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He cleans up nice with dove&#x27;s men care.  </li>
            <li>I have used some in a pinch when I ran out of my own dove.  </li>
            <li>Another nice body wash by Dove for Men.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of ambivalent on the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with how clean I&#x27;ve been.</li>
            <li>great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li>This is a good liquid soap, with a strong citrus-y smell, that does everything I expect it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know body washes aren&#x27;t always considered the most manly ways of cleansing like a good ol&#x27; bar of soap, but Dove has made sure this differs from the ladies&#x27; stuff.  </li>
            <li>If it gets things clean, I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>lather was good, and he said he felt clean without feeling like there was a residue.  </li>
            <li>First time with this products and they are extreamly great, shaves are easist and softness is greats.</li>
            <li>in all, I liked this soap fine.  </li>
            <li>I would love to give this product five stars.</li>
            <li>I had used Dove soap before, but this is even better.  </li>
            <li>Like most guys I&#x27;m not horribly opinionated on soap.</li>
            <li>So much more moisturizing than soap, his skin looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 because, after all, it&#x27;s just soap. :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll use this for a shower any day, but I am mostly indifferent to it.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to give this Dove Body and Face Wash a try.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely better smelling than Axe body wash.</li>
            <li>Nabbed this one for my husband, love that Dove&#x27;s doing products geared towards men since he likes how moisturizing mine is but doesn&#x27;t like the girly smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells fabulous!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s probably designed more to wake me up than to leave me smelling like a grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So why do I love it?</li>
            <li>so no need to carry more than this bottle to the shower</li>
            <li>Dove Men+Care is my husbands favorite line of products to use.</li>
            <li>Awake has  more of a manly scent than a perfume scent.</li>
            <li>It is more energizing than calming.</li>
            <li>I love how his skin feels after he uses this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This would work better with a pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>Surely that \\&quot;I can buy and sell</li>
            <li>I think the thing that I&#x27;ve liked the most about this Dove Men Care and Face Wash Clean Defense is the smell.</li>
            <li>The Dove Clean Defense for Men is a nice bodywash.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice and light, nothing too strong</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a new body wash, this Dove Men Care Body is a great option.</li>
            <li>I love this scent on my hubbie and I&#x27;ve used it as shampoo myself and it works just fine for that as well.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh going on, and seems to do a good job of getting me clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used almost the whole bottle by now and do think Dove Men Care Body and Face Wash is a good product.  </li>
            <li>This has a nice clean scent, is not overpowering, and rinses clean without leaving a skin residue like some competitive products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Both seem to help with my dryness though Clean Defense seems to work a bit better.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s more of a clean scent person, I like the scent of Axe when he used</li>
            <li>One of the best I ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;Burst of freshness and the amazing scent that stays with you for for a while make it a great start to the day!&lt;br /&gt;Too bad</li>
            <li>bold like \\&quot;I buy and sell guys like you all day long\\&quot;, kind of a bold smelling jerk now</li>
            <li>Which is fine.  </li>
            <li>Which is also fine.  </li>
            <li>Both are fine products.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the body wash itself, but the tube is a pain to squeeze the product out of and for the record I have strong hands.  </li>
            <li>the replacement came the next day which was great</li>
            <li>The product works into nice lather, and it rinses away reasonably clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon sent me a free bottle of this shower gel to review.</li>
            <li>It is effective and very concentrated -- you will get a lot of uses for your money.</li>
            <li>Dove Clean Defense has got a strong manly smell.  </li>
            <li>But when one considers price and everything, this falls short of being a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It rinses off clean without any greasy residue and leaves a nice, clean, refreshing, piney, and masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>likes how clean it gets him, doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin, has a great clean smell (nothing girly here or overly strong cologne) and leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will have to continue my quest for Axe free ways to deodorize my sweet boy.</li>
            <li>First, clean defense is one of my favorite body washes.  </li>
            <li>I like the Dove&#x27;s Clean Defense face and body wash, though I prefer the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>, I end up clean and I smell good\\</li>
            <li>but you feel it is getting you clean.  </li>
            <li>because there&#x27;s Dove Men Care Body and Face Wash Clean Defense in a 13.5 Ounce</li>
            <li>I wish), this stuff does work wonders leaving me clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>So a big part of which product we both liked better had to do with that.  </li>
            <li>It is easier to use than regular soap and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the body wash with the micro beads, but overall the scent and product is good.</li>
            <li>He loved it so much he made sure he bought an extra one to take on his business trips, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its body wash- cool.</li>
            <li>after a full day, I can tell that this stuff is still working.</li>
            <li>I think that the smell is not as powerful as axe, it definitely smells good and clean and and cuddle worthy.  </li>
            <li>It leaves him smelling fresh and clean and,</li>
            <li>I am comparing both the Clean Defense and Fresh Awake body and washes by Dove.  </li>
            <li>Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident when I use this, especially when used in tandem with the Dove Deodorant!</li>
            <li>Luckily, the smell seems to go away almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a mild grit to it for deeper cleansing, and it&#x27;s a bit thicker than what I would use.  </li>
            <li>My husband is generally happy with his bar of soap to wash his face, and this was simply too much.  </li>
            <li>I feel super awake though.</li>
            <li>I said, the fragrance is stronger than I normally expect, and stronger than most of the Dove products.  </li>
            <li>The cap is nicely designed to control the amount you squeeze out, and it left me feeling clean, which is what I basically expect from a soap.  </li>
            <li>It has a great smell on this one; your typical musky men&#x27;s smell that my wife likes.  </li>
            <li>and he loved the feeling of the soap and this fine little beads that made his skin smoother.  </li>
            <li>do some of my best thinking in the shower, but now the whole experience is super confusing and not at all productive.</li>
            <li>B008VSYO5A Fresh Awake]</li>
            <li>personally find the scent to be lighter and more attractive than the axe products that currently seem to be attracting so many men currently.</li>
            <li>I put this and an Axe body wash in the shower for my husband to try at the same time and see which one he liked.  </li>
            <li>I have however been pretty loyal to the Dove brand since using this product because it doesn&#x27;t leave a slimy film all over.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is pretty bold though...</li>
            <li>I switched to this soap right after it came out</li>
            <li>Well, I suppose even a company like Dove can&#x27;t get everything right.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I actually had a strong opinion myself though, because the Axe has a wow! manly scent and this one has more of a clean scent.  </li>
            <li>The clean feeling your are left with without a strong scent</li>
            <li>Clean Defense offers a pleasingly mild scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is masculine and not overly strong.</li>
            <li>The gel cleans effectively, but seems to dry out the skin a bit.</li>
            <li>It does a good job as a basic body wash; I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;The soothing clean that my skin feels afterward is notable; though I have had better results from pricier products soaps and washes, it would be nitpicking to claim that it is worth the extra money for such a modest performance benefit.</li>
            <li>I have not really noticed any special moisturizing properties but that&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>It is a shame, because I do love purchasing all my daily use items through amazon.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no reason to mark it lower because it does exactly what it should.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather smell like this body wash after a 12 hour day than a hot dumpster.</li>
            <li>As a female, I love the smells of these products.</li>
            <li>so I was interested to see if both would help with that problem.</li>
            <li>I go back and forth between soap and liquid like this particular product - there&#x27;s no question that this is less drying than soap, and it does a very nice job cleaning with a fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s OK for the rest of my body parts, but those parts don&#x27;t see much daylight and don&#x27;t necessarily get all that</li>
            <li>With him as a guinea pig - that is a very high</li>
            <li>This body wash (Clean Defense) is pretty standard.  </li>
            <li>At the store it is a MUCH thicker consistency.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes it.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t have much lather to it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like how it made my face feel.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hydrate as much as you&#x27;d think but cleans well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Winter really dries my skin out</li>
            <li>I did not notice much of a scent after I was done showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first thought was, hey, that&#x27;s a very masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely while only using a small amount; which is a huge plus compared to most other products.  </li>
            <li>Given that I pack this body wash in my gym bag, I definitely like that it leaves me smelling clean before I go to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He wants all the normal body oils to be stripped away.  </li>
            <li>The top is pointed so it won&#x27;t stand upside down.</li>
            <li>A nice bonus is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave you a dried out husk, for those that also suffer sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too expensive and it smells better than many body washes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>, on the other hand, liked how my skin was left with some moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It rinses away easily and does not leave behind any strong odor.</li>
            <li>For me, I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, so that&#x27;s an extra special bonus.</li>
            <li>My husband has slightly dry skin and this body wash promised to clean without drying skin and even moisturize with \\&quot;Micro Moisture\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Fresh Awake version is almost exactly the same, but with a brighter color and a stronger - but similar - smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and the smell is nice and not irritating, but the standard kind (Sensitive Skin, Visible Toning, etc.) leaves my skin a little less dry</li>
            <li>However, I have been noticing that all of my recent ordering of this product has been consistently runny.</li>
            <li>The bar soap adds a gritty texture and musky scent, and this Clean Defense body wash takes a similar approach.</li>
            <li>It has a rich fresh red cedar woodsiness scent that is very long lasting on skin and in hair.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this whole line of products, especially the 2 n 1 and 3 n 1 products, because those save time and space without sacrificing its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a fine little body wash.  </li>
            <li>That is, in fact, just my natural repulsive scent after any semi-strenuous activity you say?</li>
            <li>I mean, if I&#x27;m not going to smell like this product after I bathe and the product makes me feel like there&#x27;s an invisible stranger in there with me, then why not just use a super hot chick fragrance and shower with an invisible female?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny, I don&#x27;t recall leasing certain parts of my body out for toxic waste disposal, yet...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry skin and found this product to be the equivalent of Dove&#x27;s unscented sensitive skin bar soap; skin feels clean without being dry.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 10 since they are thrown together in a box without padding there is a high chance the bottles will burst open.</li>
            <li>I mostly use liquid soaps for my gym bag, to avoid the mess of putting a wet bar into a zip loc baggie or something.  </li>
            <li>It has a masculine scent that lasts a little while and he seems to get clean enough.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t have to live a similar situation brothers and... um, maybe a sister or two...</li>
            <li>This liquid soap is easily dispensed with the now common upside-down container and lathers up well on the skin.  </li>
            <li>only problem has been that it left his face very oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clean Defense has less of powerful scent.</li>
            <li>When I am finished with my shower I notice even less of a scent than with Fresh Awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to wash the other 7 bottles, the bath sponges in the same shipment, and clean up the soap left that was oozing out of the box on my porch.  </li>
            <li>Dove is a brand with a feminine reputation, but it has become more common for guys to use and is often recommended to both genders by doctors for people with dry or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>At first I was afraid this fragrance would come off to strong (like a teenage kid with Axe spray), but it doesn&#x27;t really linger at all.</li>
            <li>I got this in hopes of deodorizing my young teenage son.</li>
            <li>By the time I get to work, I just smell like regular old me again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems like if you don&#x27;t very thoroughly rinse it off your hands, you&#x27;ll get enough in your eyes to bring minor discomfort, which results in taking them out and putting them back</li>
            <li>Nothing really stood out about this body wash to me which would differentiate it from all the other body washes out there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also started to notice that washing my hands with this or any other body wash makes putting my contacts in less comfortable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But at least I&#x27;m clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have that slightly gritty feel which some body washes have which I do like, but the fragrance was nothing special, and I found the wash left my skin a little dry</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen the same deal on this product ever again, but this is a regular product in my bathroom since I first tried it a few months back.</li>
            <li>And he found this wash to leave him a little less squeaky clean than he</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> He is very good about hygiene but at the end of the day he could still make your eyes water.</li>
            <li> I even used it as a shampoo and it does a great job, though I would recommend Dove&#x27;s \\&quot;all in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sold on it as a face wash, but it works great as a body wash.</li>

            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I admit that it smells really good.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact you have to give it a good manly squeeze to squirt the soap out.  </li>

            <li> This body wash smells really good.</li>

            <li> The smell is rather strong, but pleasant, so that can be taken for good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the vien of all these manly soaps it has a kind of musky cologne type smell.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and works and comes in a sturdy bottle.  </li>
            <li> He likes a good lather and this one lathers up well, better than the Suave brand he was using.</li>
            <li> We all liked it.  </li>
            <li> nice product.  </li>
            <li> They both feel nice on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He cleans up nice with dove&#x27;s men care.  </li>
            <li> I have used some in a pinch when I ran out of my own dove.  </li>
            <li> Another nice body wash by Dove for Men.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of ambivalent on the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with how clean I&#x27;ve been.</li>
            <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> This is a good liquid soap, with a strong citrus-y smell, that does everything I expect it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know body washes aren&#x27;t always considered the most manly ways of cleansing like a good ol&#x27; bar of soap, but Dove has made sure this differs from the ladies&#x27; stuff.  </li>
            <li> If it gets things clean, I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> lather was good, and he said he felt clean without feeling like there was a residue.  </li>
            <li> First time with this products and they are extreamly great, shaves are easist and softness is greats.</li>
            <li> in all, I liked this soap fine.  </li>
            <li> I would love to give this product five stars.</li>
            <li> I had used Dove soap before, but this is even better.  </li>
            <li> Like most guys I&#x27;m not horribly opinionated on soap.</li>
            <li> So much more moisturizing than soap, his skin looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 because, after all, it&#x27;s just soap. :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this for a shower any day, but I am mostly indifferent to it.</li>
            <li> so I was glad to give this Dove Body and Face Wash a try.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely better smelling than Axe body wash.</li>
            <li> Nabbed this one for my husband, love that Dove&#x27;s doing products geared towards men since he likes how moisturizing mine is but doesn&#x27;t like the girly smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s probably designed more to wake me up than to leave me smelling like a grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So why do I love it?</li>
            <li> so no need to carry more than this bottle to the shower</li>
            <li> Dove Men+Care is my husbands favorite line of products to use.</li>
            <li> Awake has  more of a manly scent than a perfume scent.</li>
            <li> It is more energizing than calming.</li>
            <li> I love how his skin feels after he uses this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This would work better with a pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> Surely that \\&quot;I can buy and sell</li>
            <li> I think the thing that I&#x27;ve liked the most about this Dove Men Care and Face Wash Clean Defense is the smell.</li>
            <li> The Dove Clean Defense for Men is a nice bodywash.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice and light, nothing too strong</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a new body wash, this Dove Men Care Body is a great option.</li>
            <li> I love this scent on my hubbie and I&#x27;ve used it as shampoo myself and it works just fine for that as well.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh going on, and seems to do a good job of getting me clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost the whole bottle by now and do think Dove Men Care Body and Face Wash is a good product.  </li>
            <li> This has a nice clean scent, is not overpowering, and rinses clean without leaving a skin residue like some competitive products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Both seem to help with my dryness though Clean Defense seems to work a bit better.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s more of a clean scent person, I like the scent of Axe when he used</li>
            <li> One of the best I ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;Burst of freshness and the amazing scent that stays with you for for a while make it a great start to the day!&lt;br /&gt;Too bad</li>
            <li> bold like \\&quot;I buy and sell guys like you all day long\\&quot;, kind of a bold smelling jerk now</li>
            <li> Which is fine.  </li>
            <li> Which is also fine.  </li>
            <li> Both are fine products.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the body wash itself, but the tube is a pain to squeeze the product out of and for the record I have strong hands.  </li>
            <li> the replacement came the next day which was great</li>
            <li> The product works into nice lather, and it rinses away reasonably clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon sent me a free bottle of this shower gel to review.</li>
            <li> It is effective and very concentrated -- you will get a lot of uses for your money.</li>
            <li> Dove Clean Defense has got a strong manly smell.  </li>
            <li> But when one considers price and everything, this falls short of being a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It rinses off clean without any greasy residue and leaves a nice, clean, refreshing, piney, and masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> likes how clean it gets him, doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin, has a great clean smell (nothing girly here or overly strong cologne) and leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will have to continue my quest for Axe free ways to deodorize my sweet boy.</li>
            <li> First, clean defense is one of my favorite body washes.  </li>
            <li> I like the Dove&#x27;s Clean Defense face and body wash, though I prefer the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> , I end up clean and I smell good\\</li>
            <li> but you feel it is getting you clean.  </li>
            <li> because there&#x27;s Dove Men Care Body and Face Wash Clean Defense in a 13.5 Ounce</li>
            <li> I wish), this stuff does work wonders leaving me clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> So a big part of which product we both liked better had to do with that.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to use than regular soap and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the body wash with the micro beads, but overall the scent and product is good.</li>
            <li> He loved it so much he made sure he bought an extra one to take on his business trips, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its body wash- cool.</li>
            <li> after a full day, I can tell that this stuff is still working.</li>
            <li> I think that the smell is not as powerful as axe, it definitely smells good and clean and and cuddle worthy.  </li>
            <li> It leaves him smelling fresh and clean and,</li>
            <li> I am comparing both the Clean Defense and Fresh Awake body and washes by Dove.  </li>
            <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident when I use this, especially when used in tandem with the Dove Deodorant!</li>
            <li> Luckily, the smell seems to go away almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a mild grit to it for deeper cleansing, and it&#x27;s a bit thicker than what I would use.  </li>
            <li> My husband is generally happy with his bar of soap to wash his face, and this was simply too much.  </li>
            <li> I feel super awake though.</li>
            <li> I said, the fragrance is stronger than I normally expect, and stronger than most of the Dove products.  </li>
            <li> The cap is nicely designed to control the amount you squeeze out, and it left me feeling clean, which is what I basically expect from a soap.  </li>
            <li> It has a great smell on this one; your typical musky men&#x27;s smell that my wife likes.  </li>
            <li> and he loved the feeling of the soap and this fine little beads that made his skin smoother.  </li>
            <li> do some of my best thinking in the shower, but now the whole experience is super confusing and not at all productive.</li>
            <li> B008VSYO5A Fresh Awake]</li>
            <li> personally find the scent to be lighter and more attractive than the axe products that currently seem to be attracting so many men currently.</li>
            <li> I put this and an Axe body wash in the shower for my husband to try at the same time and see which one he liked.  </li>
            <li> I have however been pretty loyal to the Dove brand since using this product because it doesn&#x27;t leave a slimy film all over.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is pretty bold though...</li>
            <li> I switched to this soap right after it came out</li>
            <li> Well, I suppose even a company like Dove can&#x27;t get everything right.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I actually had a strong opinion myself though, because the Axe has a wow! manly scent and this one has more of a clean scent.  </li>
            <li> The clean feeling your are left with without a strong scent</li>
            <li> Clean Defense offers a pleasingly mild scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is masculine and not overly strong.</li>
            <li> The gel cleans effectively, but seems to dry out the skin a bit.</li>
            <li> It does a good job as a basic body wash; I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;The soothing clean that my skin feels afterward is notable; though I have had better results from pricier products soaps and washes, it would be nitpicking to claim that it is worth the extra money for such a modest performance benefit.</li>
            <li> I have not really noticed any special moisturizing properties but that&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> It is a shame, because I do love purchasing all my daily use items through amazon.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no reason to mark it lower because it does exactly what it should.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather smell like this body wash after a 12 hour day than a hot dumpster.</li>
            <li> As a female, I love the smells of these products.</li>
            <li> so I was interested to see if both would help with that problem.</li>
            <li> I go back and forth between soap and liquid like this particular product - there&#x27;s no question that this is less drying than soap, and it does a very nice job cleaning with a fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s OK for the rest of my body parts, but those parts don&#x27;t see much daylight and don&#x27;t necessarily get all that</li>
            <li> With him as a guinea pig - that is a very high</li>
            <li> This body wash (Clean Defense) is pretty standard.  </li>
            <li> At the store it is a MUCH thicker consistency.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes it.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t have much lather to it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like how it made my face feel.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hydrate as much as you&#x27;d think but cleans well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Winter really dries my skin out</li>
            <li> I did not notice much of a scent after I was done showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first thought was, hey, that&#x27;s a very masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely while only using a small amount; which is a huge plus compared to most other products.  </li>
            <li> Given that I pack this body wash in my gym bag, I definitely like that it leaves me smelling clean before I go to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He wants all the normal body oils to be stripped away.  </li>
            <li> The top is pointed so it won&#x27;t stand upside down.</li>
            <li> A nice bonus is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave you a dried out husk, for those that also suffer sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive and it smells better than many body washes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> , on the other hand, liked how my skin was left with some moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It rinses away easily and does not leave behind any strong odor.</li>
            <li> For me, I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, so that&#x27;s an extra special bonus.</li>
            <li> My husband has slightly dry skin and this body wash promised to clean without drying skin and even moisturize with \\&quot;Micro Moisture\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Fresh Awake version is almost exactly the same, but with a brighter color and a stronger - but similar - smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the smell is nice and not irritating, but the standard kind (Sensitive Skin, Visible Toning, etc.) leaves my skin a little less dry</li>
            <li> However, I have been noticing that all of my recent ordering of this product has been consistently runny.</li>
            <li> The bar soap adds a gritty texture and musky scent, and this Clean Defense body wash takes a similar approach.</li>
            <li> It has a rich fresh red cedar woodsiness scent that is very long lasting on skin and in hair.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this whole line of products, especially the 2 n 1 and 3 n 1 products, because those save time and space without sacrificing its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s a fine little body wash.  </li>
            <li> That is, in fact, just my natural repulsive scent after any semi-strenuous activity you say?</li>
            <li> I mean, if I&#x27;m not going to smell like this product after I bathe and the product makes me feel like there&#x27;s an invisible stranger in there with me, then why not just use a super hot chick fragrance and shower with an invisible female?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny, I don&#x27;t recall leasing certain parts of my body out for toxic waste disposal, yet...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin and found this product to be the equivalent of Dove&#x27;s unscented sensitive skin bar soap; skin feels clean without being dry.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 10 since they are thrown together in a box without padding there is a high chance the bottles will burst open.</li>
            <li> I mostly use liquid soaps for my gym bag, to avoid the mess of putting a wet bar into a zip loc baggie or something.  </li>
            <li> It has a masculine scent that lasts a little while and he seems to get clean enough.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t have to live a similar situation brothers and... um, maybe a sister or two...</li>
            <li> This liquid soap is easily dispensed with the now common upside-down container and lathers up well on the skin.  </li>
            <li> only problem has been that it left his face very oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clean Defense has less of powerful scent.</li>
            <li> When I am finished with my shower I notice even less of a scent than with Fresh Awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to wash the other 7 bottles, the bath sponges in the same shipment, and clean up the soap left that was oozing out of the box on my porch.  </li>
            <li> Dove is a brand with a feminine reputation, but it has become more common for guys to use and is often recommended to both genders by doctors for people with dry or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> At first I was afraid this fragrance would come off to strong (like a teenage kid with Axe spray), but it doesn&#x27;t really linger at all.</li>
            <li> I got this in hopes of deodorizing my young teenage son.</li>
            <li> By the time I get to work, I just smell like regular old me again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems like if you don&#x27;t very thoroughly rinse it off your hands, you&#x27;ll get enough in your eyes to bring minor discomfort, which results in taking them out and putting them back</li>
            <li> Nothing really stood out about this body wash to me which would differentiate it from all the other body washes out there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also started to notice that washing my hands with this or any other body wash makes putting my contacts in less comfortable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But at least I&#x27;m clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have that slightly gritty feel which some body washes have which I do like, but the fragrance was nothing special, and I found the wash left my skin a little dry</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the same deal on this product ever again, but this is a regular product in my bathroom since I first tried it a few months back.</li>
            <li> And he found this wash to leave him a little less squeaky clean than he</li>
            <li> Awake and confused and kind of curious about where that other dude went and why he was there to begin with.</li>
            <li> Awake and confused and ambiguously clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to friends, though my household is likely to go back to using Dove beauty bars as ever single dermatologist I&#x27;ve ever met has recommended it, and nothing else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last that long on my skin, though, so</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Clean Defense\\&quot; body and face wash comes out in liquid form, and it&#x27;s not watery but not so thick that it needs to be watered down before application.</li>
            <li> I tried this &amp;#34;clean defense&amp;#34; product expecting to maintain body odor to minimum throughout the day, but the effect was very minimal and not long lasting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically wear heavy fragrances or colognes, and when I do, they are much more subtle.</li>
            <li> Actually DOES last long enough to keep you fresh, even if you inadvertently miss that random shower!</li>
            <li> It did relieve the dry skin on his hands and legs.</li>
            <li> So if you have dry skin this is probably just what you need.</li>
            <li> It seems to fight dry skin and oil build up well.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t dry it out</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards, as it sometimes does when I wash it with a bar of soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not as thick of a lotion as dove normally makes, but it also doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like some overly perfumed body washes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave his skin feeling dry as some other body washes do.</li>
            <li> and it worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> He works outside all day and he is pretty dirty, calloused and rough.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps my husband has sensitive skin, but it was not happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is some dye in the mix to make it slightly</li>
            <li> The bottle has a nice design with the cap at the base making it easier to use up the last few drops that otherwise would be difficult to get out.</li>
            <li> And since the fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger long enough for me to smell like that throughout the day, I&#x27;m shocked by the same impression every morning: I&#x27;m showering with some other dude!</li>
            <li> This body wash has those little micro beads that slough off some dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my man and after using it for a few weeks his review is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that maybe, just maybe, I&#x27;ll rethink that toxic waste storage after all...</li>
            <li> a few times ans</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not personally thrilled with the scent because it reminds me of other men and what their shower products so often smell like.  </li>
            <li> The bottle design also makes sense, very little fuss, no ooze between showers.</li>
            <li> Slightly irritated, and no great cleansing power.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously-</li>
            <li> the next morning I&#x27;m shocked by the smell again.</li>
            <li> Awake and confused.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I was hoping it was less annoying than the Axe products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when I received the order 3 bottles were just as I described.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with it as a face wash that I could tell, but I&#x27;ll be using this almost exclusively as a body wash from now</li>
            <li> The packaging is absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> Its nasty.</li>
            <li> I give it two stars for the product but horrible buy over amazon.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First, clean defense is one of my favorite body washes.  The clean feeling your are left with without a strong scent is why I will continue to use this product.  The packaging is absolutely horrible. I ordered 10 since they are thrown together in a box without padding there is a high chance the bottles will burst open. Unfortunately when I received the order 3 bottles were just as I described.  I had to wash the other 7 bottles, the bath sponges in the same shipment, and clean up the soap left that was oozing out of the box on my porch.  I would not purchase this from the same seller. T</li>
            <li> Smells good---Clean w/o drying</li>
            <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li> First time with this products and they are extreamly great, shaves are easist and softness is greats. Will buy it again soon.</li>
            <li> Actually DOES last long enough to keep you fresh, even if you inadvertently miss that random shower! I feel more confident when I use this, especially when used in tandem with the Dove Deodorant! Need miniaturization as well? Look no further... Worried about scents being non-masculine? I USED to! No longer, though! Dove has totally sold me on their line of men&#x27;s care!</li>
            <li> One of the best I ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;Burst of freshness and the amazing scent that stays with you for for a while make it a great start to the day!&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I haven&#x27;t seen the same deal on this product ever again, but this is a regular product in my bathroom since I first tried it a few months back.</li>
            <li> I switched to this soap right after it came out and now it&#x27;s the only one I will ever use.</li>
            <li> I would love to give this product five stars. I think all the Dove products I have tried deserve a star rating. However, I have been noticing that all of my recent ordering of this product has been consistently runny. At the store it is a MUCH thicker consistency. It is a shame, because I do love purchasing all my daily use items through amazon.</li>
            <li> Good wash as per my grandsons.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the body wash itself, but the tube is a pain to squeeze the product out of and for the record I have strong hands.  I prefer the body wash with the micro beads, but overall the scent and product is good.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  In fact, after having received it from Vine, I bought it myself.  It is easier to use than regular soap and has a pleasant smell.  I had used Dove soap before, but this is even better.  I&#x27;m a 63 yo man and am not ashamed to admit that I like Dove products.....</li>
            <li> The 1st one i received had spilled in the box and had to wait for a replacement&lt;br /&gt;but the replacement came the next day which was great&lt;br /&gt;love the item for my husband</li>
            <li> it gets the job done.  although sometimes bottle lids don&#x27;t shut with ease after opening</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash at a discounted price! I love it! 10/10 Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Like most guys I&#x27;m not horribly opinionated on soap. If it gets things clean, I&#x27;m good. I have however been pretty loyal to the Dove brand since using this product because it doesn&#x27;t leave a slimy film all over. I even used it as a shampoo and it does a great job, though I would recommend Dove&#x27;s \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; product for that (which works equally well). The bottle design also makes sense, very little fuss, no ooze between showers. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Every night after gym, he goes from stinky and sweaty after 5 hours of training to an affectionate sweet-smelling hugger. So much more moisturizing than soap, his skin looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I like the Dove&#x27;s Clean Defense face and body wash, though I prefer the [[ASIN:B008VSYO5A Fresh Awake]] version. Clean Defense offers a pleasingly mild scent. The product works into nice lather, and it rinses away reasonably clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soothing clean that my skin feels afterward is notable; though I have had better results from pricier products soaps and washes, it would be nitpicking to claim that it is worth the extra money for such a modest performance benefit. This wash is very nice for the cost.</li>
            <li> I got this for my man and after using it for a few weeks his review is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It works, I end up clean and I smell good\\&quot; When asked about if it dries his skin out he said he didn&#x27;t think so.  I admit that it smells really good.  It leaves him smelling fresh and clean and, well, I like it.  He is not the type of man to be attracted to any specific brand of body wash, but he did peruse the dove section of the men&#x27;s products and bought another bottle of the same brand.  With him as a guinea pig - that is a very high opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally find the scent to be lighter and more attractive than the axe products that currently seem to be attracting so many men currently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost the whole bottle by now and do think Dove Men Care Body and Face Wash is a good product.  The bottle is sturdy and does not leak.  As a matter of fact you have to give it a good manly squeeze to squirt the soap out.  Which is fine.  In the vien of all these manly soaps it has a kind of musky cologne type smell.  Which is also fine.  It does not lather a lot but you feel it is getting you clean.  I have not really noticed any special moisturizing properties but that&#x27;s OK.  I give it 4 stars because, it&#x27;s just soap.  It smells nice and works and comes in a sturdy bottle.  There&#x27;s no reason to mark it lower because it does exactly what it should.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 because, after all, it&#x27;s just soap. :-)</li>
            <li> My husband started using this body wash about a week ago and likes it. It doesn&#x27;t leave his skin feeling dry as some other body washes do. He likes a good lather and this one lathers up well, better than the Suave brand he was using. The scent is nice and light, nothing too strong that conflicts with his cologne. All in all a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny, I don&#x27;t recall leasing certain parts of my body out for toxic waste disposal, yet... wait, what&#x27;s that? The deal fell though you say? That is, in fact, just my natural repulsive scent after any semi-strenuous activity you say? Well... this is embarrassing... but you don&#x27;t have to live a similar situation brothers and... um, maybe a sister or two... because there&#x27;s Dove Men Care Body and Face Wash Clean Defense in a 13.5 Ounce bottle!!(notice the 2 exclamation points)  All joking aside(don&#x27;t I wish), this stuff does work wonders leaving me clean and refreshed. A nice bonus is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave you a dried out husk, for those that also suffer sensitive skin.  You know, this stuff works so well that maybe, just maybe, I&#x27;ll rethink that toxic waste storage after all...</li>
            <li> This body wash (Clean Defense) is pretty standard.  I&#x27;m not personally thrilled with the scent because it reminds me of other men and what their shower products so often smell like.  Luckily, the smell seems to go away almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also started to notice that washing my hands with this or any other body wash makes putting my contacts in less comfortable.  It seems like if you don&#x27;t very thoroughly rinse it off your hands, you&#x27;ll get enough in your eyes to bring minor discomfort, which results in taking them out and putting them back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some dye in the mix to make it slightly yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fresh Awake version is almost exactly the same, but with a brighter color and a stronger - but similar - smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this for a shower any day, but I am mostly indifferent to it.</li>
            <li> My family and I have always used and trusted Dove products so I was glad to give this Dove Body and Face Wash a try.  This liquid soap is easily dispensed with the now common upside-down container and lathers up well on the skin.  It rinses off clean without any greasy residue and leaves a nice, clean, refreshing, piney, and masculine scent.  I have sensitive, dry skin and found this product to be the equivalent of Dove&#x27;s unscented sensitive skin bar soap; skin feels clean without being dry.  Overall, I would purchase this product in the future but I&#x27;d still prefer unscented soaps and body washes.</li>
            <li> I snagged this up for my husband to keep in his gym bag. He loved it so much he made sure he bought an extra one to take on his business trips, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He likes how clean it gets him, doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin, has a great clean smell (nothing girly here or overly strong cologne) and leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Yes&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend to others? Yes</li>
            <li> Amazon sent me a free bottle of this shower gel to review. It is effective and very concentrated -- you will get a lot of uses for your money. The scent is masculine and not overly strong. The gel cleans effectively, but seems to dry out the skin a bit.</li>
            <li> I got this in hopes of deodorizing my young teenage son. He is very good about hygiene but at the end of the day he could still make your eyes water. I tried this because I was hoping it was less annoying than the Axe products. It is definitely better smelling than Axe body wash. When he uses this you do not feel that your nostrils have been set on fire. He is also not smelly at the end of the day. We farm so this kid works hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem has been that it left his face very oily. His face and back broke out. It did relieve the dry skin on his hands and legs. So if you have dry skin this is probably just what you need. I will have to continue my quest for Axe free ways to deodorize my sweet boy.</li>
            <li> The Dove Clean Defense for Men is a nice bodywash.  We all liked it.  But whether you like it or not might depend on your nose, as well as what you like your skin to feel like when you get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOUCH AND FEEL&lt;br /&gt;My husband is one of those guys who likes to squeak when he gets out of the shower.  He wants all the normal body oils to be stripped away.  And he found this wash to leave him a little less squeaky clean than he prefers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, on the other hand, liked how my skin was left with some moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SCENT&lt;br /&gt;The Dove Clean Defense has got a strong manly smell.  My husband really likes it.  But he doesn&#x27;t wear a cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I like the smell on him.  It lingers a bit and is pleasant.  However, if your man wears a cologne, it might cause a clash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice product.  I&#x27;d recommend it to friends, though my household is likely to go back to using Dove beauty bars as ever single dermatologist I&#x27;ve ever met has recommended it, and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~</li>
            <li> Nothing really stood out about this body wash to me which would differentiate it from all the other body washes out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have that slightly gritty feel which some body washes have which I do like, but the fragrance was nothing special, and I found the wash left my skin a little dry so I needed to use an additional lotion on problem spots.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re doing body wash instead of bar soap, you gotta go Dove. Seriously.</li>
            <li> Cleans well but it doesn&#x27;t have much lather to it.</li>
            <li> I think the thing that I&#x27;ve liked the most about this Dove Men Care and Face Wash Clean Defense is the smell. This body wash smells really good. Given that I pack this body wash in my gym bag, I definitely like that it leaves me smelling clean before I go to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because I&#x27;m not entirely sold on this as a face wash. I&#x27;ve used it on my face a few times ans I didn&#x27;t really like how it made my face feel. There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with it as a face wash that I could tell, but I&#x27;ll be using this almost exclusively as a body wash from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new body wash, this Dove Men Care Body is a great option. It&#x27;s not too expensive and it smells better than many body washes. I&#x27;m not sold on it as a face wash, but it works great as a body wash.</li>
            <li> Nabbed this one for my husband, love that Dove&#x27;s doing products geared towards men since he likes how moisturizing mine is but doesn&#x27;t like the girly smell.</li>
            <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves the scent and so do I!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fabulous! It has a rich fresh red cedar woodsiness scent that is very long lasting on skin and in hair. I love this scent on my hubbie and I&#x27;ve used it as shampoo myself and it works just fine for that as well. I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I go back and forth between soap and liquid like this particular product - there&#x27;s no question that this is less drying than soap, and it does a very nice job cleaning with a fresh clean smell. It rinses away easily and does not leave behind any strong odor. I have no skin irritation and think this product does a good job moisturizing as it works. The bottle has a nice design with the cap at the base making it easier to use up the last few drops that otherwise would be difficult to get out.</li>
            <li> I mostly use liquid soaps for my gym bag, to avoid the mess of putting a wet bar into a zip loc baggie or something.  This is a good liquid soap, with a strong citrus-y smell, that does everything I expect it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, the fragrance is stronger than I normally expect, and stronger than most of the Dove products.  It doesn&#x27;t last that long on my skin, though, so it&#x27;s probably designed more to wake me up than to leave me smelling like a grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I liked this soap fine.  The cap is nicely designed to control the amount you squeeze out, and it left me feeling clean, which is what I basically expect from a soap.  It didn&#x27;t blow me away enough to make me change brands, but I had no complaints.</li>
            <li> I received my item and it looked used. The sides of the bottle were scratched. Its nasty. I bought this product afterward at the store. I give it two stars for the product but horrible buy over amazon.</li>
            <li> I tried this &amp;#34;clean defense&amp;#34; product expecting to maintain body odor to minimum throughout the day, but the effect was very minimal and not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Had to try this so my boyfried would stop using my girlie-scented stuff (just something unsexy about a man smelling like a mango).  This has a nice clean scent, is not overpowering, and rinses clean without leaving a skin residue like some competitive products.</li>
            <li> Dove is a brand with a feminine reputation, but it has become more common for guys to use and is often recommended to both genders by doctors for people with dry or sensitive skin.  That is what the Dove+ line is about. The bar soap adds a gritty texture and musky scent, and this Clean Defense body wash takes a similar approach. Unlike the creamy standard Dove body wash, it is a gel. I think it cleans well and the smell is nice and not irritating, but the standard kind (Sensitive Skin, Visible Toning, etc.) leaves my skin a little less dry</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hydrate as much as you&#x27;d think but cleans well</li>
            <li> Its body wash- cool. So why do I love it? The scent lasts all day. Seriously- after a full day, I can tell that this stuff is still working. I guess what I am saying is- I&#x27;d rather smell like this body wash after a 12 hour day than a hot dumpster. Hope that helps. Oh yea- its like shampoo and face wash too- so no need to carry more than this bottle to the shower etc.. whatever.</li>
            <li> Dove Men+Care is my husbands favorite line of products to use. We&#x27;re couponers, so every time we find coupons for Dove Men+Care, we snatch them up. As a female, I love the smells of these products. We both like that they smell manly(almost cologne like) without being overbearing. For me, I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, so that&#x27;s an extra special bonus. We highly recommend this whole line of products, especially the 2 n 1 and 3 n 1 products, because those save time and space without sacrificing its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I am comparing both the Clean Defense and Fresh Awake body and washes by Dove.  I have tried both so I figured it would be good to compare them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter really dries my skin out so I was interested to see if both would help with that problem. Both seem to help a bit and I like the smell and feel of both products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both look sort of like shave gels I have used.  They both feel nice on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean Defense has less of powerful scent. I have used this at night when I want to shower before bed.  It seems to fight dry skin and oil build up well. It feels great on my skin. When I am finished with my shower I notice even less of a scent than with Fresh Awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh Awake has  more of a manly scent than a perfume scent. It is more energizing than calming. It is something I would associate with use in the morning rather than before going to bed. I did not notice much of a scent after I was done showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both seem to help with my dryness though Clean Defense seems to work a bit better. I have tried each for about two weeks. Both are fine products.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried a number of body washes, axe, Irish spring and suave are his favorites.  I had him try dove men care soap one time and he loved the feeling of the soap and this fine little beads that made his skin smoother.  This body wash has those little micro beads that slough off some dead skin.  I love how his skin feels after he uses this.  He works outside all day and he is pretty dirty, calloused and rough.  He cleans up nice with dove&#x27;s men care.  I think that the smell is not as powerful as axe, it definitely smells good and clean and and cuddle worthy.  I have used some in a pinch when I ran out of my own dove.  It is not as thick of a lotion as dove normally makes, but it also doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like some overly perfumed body washes.</li>
            <li> My husband has slightly dry skin and this body wash promised to clean without drying skin and even moisturize with \\&quot;Micro Moisture\\&quot;. So he has been using this for a couple of weeks. It has a masculine scent that lasts a little while and he seems to get clean enough. This product falls short on it&#x27;s moisture promise though, there&#x27;s no difference in his skin dryness between when he uses this and when he uses soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would work better with a pump dispenser. The lid is on the bottom and it&#x27;s a bit of pain because once you get the soap in your hand you have close the lid and put it back. The top is pointed so it won&#x27;t stand upside down.</li>
            <li> Another nice body wash by Dove for Men.  It lathers nicely while only using a small amount; which is a huge plus compared to most other products.  It has a great smell on this one; your typical musky men&#x27;s smell that my wife likes.  It does a good job as a basic body wash; I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but it didn&#x27;t dry it out and it worked as expected.  I recommend all the Dove Men line!</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower to wash my face and body. It smells fresh going on, and seems to do a good job of getting me clean. My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry afterwards, as it sometimes does when I wash it with a bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Clean Defense\\&quot; body and face wash comes out in liquid form, and it&#x27;s not watery but not so thick that it needs to be watered down before application. I put it on a hand cloth and use that to rub it on and wash off. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was rather saddened at the husband&#x27;s report of this wash, as it seemed the Dove&#x27;s men line was a solid one.  Well, I suppose even a company like Dove can&#x27;t get everything right.  All in all, it&#x27;s a fine little body wash.  But when one considers price and everything, this falls short of being a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a body wash... I know body washes aren&#x27;t always considered the most manly ways of cleansing like a good ol&#x27; bar of soap, but Dove has made sure this differs from the ladies&#x27; stuff.  There&#x27;s a mild grit to it for deeper cleansing, and it&#x27;s a bit thicker than what I would use.  The smell is rather strong, but pleasant, so that can be taken for good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a face wash... seems like it was rather a marketing ploy than an actual purpose of cleaning the face.  My husband is generally happy with his bar of soap to wash his face, and this was simply too much.  Perhaps my husband has sensitive skin, but it was not happy with this product.  Slightly irritated, and no great cleansing power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this as a body wash, but this may not be the time to go out of one&#x27;s way to buy Dove.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap product. That&#x27;s what a \\&quot;body wash\\&quot; is, right? Soap?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I&#x27;m happy with how clean I&#x27;ve been. It&#x27;s great for washing my face in the shower. I suppose it&#x27;s OK for the rest of my body parts, but those parts don&#x27;t see much daylight and don&#x27;t necessarily get all that dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m kind of ambivalent on the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thought was, hey, that&#x27;s a very masculine fragrance. I don&#x27;t typically wear heavy fragrances or colognes, and when I do, they are much more subtle. This fragrance is pretty bold though...bold like \\&quot;I buy and sell guys like you all day long\\&quot;, kind of a bold smelling jerk now that I think about it. At first I was afraid this fragrance would come off to strong (like a teenage kid with Axe spray), but it doesn&#x27;t really linger at all. By the time I get to work, I just smell like regular old me again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the next morning I&#x27;m shocked by the smell again. And since the fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger long enough for me to smell like that throughout the day, I&#x27;m shocked by the same impression every morning: I&#x27;m showering with some other dude! Yikes. I mean, if I&#x27;m not going to smell like this product after I bathe and the product makes me feel like there&#x27;s an invisible stranger in there with me, then why not just use a super hot chick fragrance and shower with an invisible female?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do some of my best thinking in the shower, but now the whole experience is super confusing and not at all productive. I feel super awake though. Awake and confused. Awake and confused and kind of curious about where that other dude went and why he was there to begin with. Surely that \\&quot;I can buy and sell you\\&quot; guy could find a more attractive guy to bathe with than me, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at least I&#x27;m clean. Awake and confused and ambiguously clean.</li>
            <li> I put this and an Axe body wash in the shower for my husband to try at the same time and see which one he liked.  I actually had a strong opinion myself though, because the Axe has a wow! manly scent and this one has more of a clean scent.  So a big part of which product we both liked better had to do with that.  He&#x27;s more of a clean scent person, I like the scent of Axe when he used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather was good, and he said he felt clean without feeling like there was a residue.  He didn&#x27;t say he felt like his skin was moisturized - but then again, he never has dryness issues.  Good product.</li>
