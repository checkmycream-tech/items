    <ol>
            <li>This is great soap!</li>
            <li>Great product and service!</li>
            <li>This was a great buy and very happy</li>
            <li>Works good for us!</li>
            <li>The packing and shipment is great</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>A great product.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It is very effective also on my grandsons&#x27; hands even after playing in the dirt.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money and quality soap.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>So much hand soap for a great price!</li>
            <li>Works great for getting your hands CLEAN without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li>But since my kids go through soap so fast (a good thing I guess!)</li>
            <li>GREAT price and fast ship got these for daughter&#x27;s school use.</li>
            <li>I suppose most of the spilled soap oozed out of the box.  </li>
            <li>I think the foaming soap dispensers are better for kids as they get the soap more evenly distributed all over their hands and get them cleaner.</li>
            <li>They also seem to think it is more fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used Softsoap in our house for many years.</li>
            <li>My favorite is Yardley Of London antibacterial liquid hand soap, flowering english lavender - 16 Oz since it leaves a wonderful lavender scent on your hands.</li>
            <li>If you have a Costco membership it is probably better to get it from there.</li>
            <li>This product is great in all respects except for those with sensitive olfactory issues.  </li>
            <li>Works great for grimey clean up and normal hand washing.</li>
            <li>Light, easy scent and can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li>this is a great soap to have out for daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good quality just like any of the Soft Soap products.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>keeps the hands clean.</li>
            <li>This liquid hand soap, which can also be used as a body wash, gets my skin really clean</li>
            <li>Shake the bottle and you are good to go until the next refill.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft on the hands and smells nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Filling your soap dispensers this way saves money and you know you are getting a high quality product that keeps your family clean and safe.</li>
            <li>This hand soap smells nice and clean and does not dry out your hands.</li>
            <li>Amazon and their affiliates need to learn to pack breakable products with adequate packing materials.  </li>
            <li>like that is is very lightly fragranced, easy on the hands, and relatively inexpensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that its good soap.</li>
            <li>One way to keep them full is to fill the bottle about 20% full with this soft soap and fill the remainder with water.</li>
            <li>After a month, I still haven&#x27;t even finished the first bottle.</li>
            <li>keeps my hands smooth, I am able to fill multiple smaller dispensers for use around the house from these large bottles.</li>
            <li>It came exactly as described and will be ordering more in the near future!</li>
            <li>I have allergies to so many products that I have to be extremely careful about the products that I use on my hands.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>but I didnt like the smell of this soap that much.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid of this product, it is great!</li>
            <li>of this time it&#x27;s somewhat overpriced on this website; I guess that&#x27;s the premium price you pay for having these Softsoap refill bottles delivered straight to your doorstep.</li>
            <li>The whole family enjoys them.....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s fair to give only a 1 star rating due to the shipping</li>
            <li>That way we are using less plastic and get a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I quickly unpacked the box in my kitchen sink and discovered that almost the entire contents of one of the two bottles has leaked during shipping.  </li>
            <li>I will not be buying this particular Softsoap product again.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Since we had our old, almost empty bottle, my husband was able to pour the contents of the damaged bottle into the old one.  </li>
            <li>I recently received an order of 4 skeins of yarn that were better protected -- makes you wonder what people are thinking as they prepare packages for shipment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>May be should have checked first with a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>Better than small bottles for 1$ a piece.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is necessary to have lather for the soap to work properly, but I don&#x27;t feel like my hands get clean without lather...  </li>
            <li>and I do have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>like it because the soft soap is now foamy and its antibacterial formula cleans our hands and kills the germs.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these larger plastic refill bottles of Softsoap.</li>
            <li>The bottles were more than half empty.  </li>
            <li>We tend to buy these large refills and use them for keeping our small pump and other household soap dispensers filled.</li>
            <li>It takes twice as much soap to get half as much lather as other Softsoap products we&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>If you can, keep looking around for this soap at local supermarkets or other brick and mortar stores where you can probably get this without spending quite so much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But with this product, I barely get any lather with 4 or 5 pumps of the same soap dish.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty heavy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Would definitely recommend to smokers.&lt;br /&gt;Stayed at a friend&#x27;s house the other night.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for YEARS and have never had any problem with dry skin or allergic reactions</li>
            <li> big guys and little guys.</li>
            <li> My kids have extremely dry skin, and do not seem to have any issues due to this product.  </li>
            <li> as expected delivered as specified</li>
            <li> The bottles were packed diagonally, caps down, in a box labelled for gift cards; all 4 caps were loose.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty thick but not too thick and comes out of other pumps with ease.</li>
            <li> but unless they fix this there may be other irate customers.</li>
            <li> The product is not as \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; as other Softsoap products, and, like others, we had a problem in shipping.  </li>
            <li> as expected, just like in the photo!</li>
            <li> soap seems to be less soapy than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Looking down</li>
            <li> With previous products, one to two pumps of my liquid soap dish would give lots of lather &amp; bubbles.  </li>
            <li> I just had to respond to the previous review</li>
            <li> I now see why the price is less than the one I usually buy.</li>
            <li> Not cool!  </li>
            <li> This is the least expensive way to purchase Soft Soap.  </li>
            <li> I have a small bottle of the handsoap at each sink in my house.  </li>
            <li> Arrived 2 days late with an inch of liquid soap in the bottom of the box.  </li>
            <li> Never clogs up the soap dispenser or leaves scum.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s antibacterial) and the moisturizers in the soap keep my skin from getting dry even if I have to wash my hands a lot during cold and flu</li>
            <li> It is too bad that FedEx broke open one of the bottles all over my sidewalk.</li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this in all the soap dispensers in our house.  Light, easy scent and can&#x27;t beat the price.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product from another store and I like it.  This product lasts in my house for a long time.  I don&#x27;t have to keep buying new smaller bottles of the Softsoap Antibacterial handsoap every time the small bottles runs out.  This product saves me a lot of money.  I have a small bottle of the handsoap at each sink in my house.  When one runs out I just re-fill them using this product.  I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to so many products that I have to be extremely careful about the products that I use on my hands. This one proved to be a winner; I will be a repeat customer. It is very effective also on my grandsons&#x27; hands even after playing in the dirt. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, and never had any problems.  My kids have extremely dry skin, and do not seem to have any issues due to this product.  Works good for us!</li>
            <li> as expected delivered as specified</li>
            <li> The packing and shipment is great but I didnt like the smell of this soap that much. May be should have checked first with a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> This hand soap smells nice and clean and does not dry out your hands.</li>
            <li> Works great for getting your hands CLEAN without drying out your skin. Would definitely recommend to smokers.&lt;br /&gt;Stayed at a friend&#x27;s house the other night. Needed to shower, but they had forgotten to buy bodywash. There was plenty of this on the sink. So I helped myself. Didn&#x27;t notice a difference. Worked just as well as the bodywash.</li>
            <li> Good quality just like any of the Soft Soap products.</li>
            <li> As I picked up the box from my doorstep I could feel the soap oozing into my hands.  Looking down I see puddles of soap on my doorstep.  I quickly unpacked the box in my kitchen sink and discovered that almost the entire contents of one of the two bottles has leaked during shipping.  Not cool!  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s fair to give only a 1 star rating due to the shipping but unless they fix this there may be other irate customers.</li>
            <li> The product is not as \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; as other Softsoap products, and, like others, we had a problem in shipping.  The box was bigger than the product and only 1 piece of packing paper was added for protection -- one of the bottles was damaged and leaked.  Since we had our old, almost empty bottle, my husband was able to pour the contents of the damaged bottle into the old one.  Amazon and their affiliates need to learn to pack breakable products with adequate packing materials.  I recently received an order of 4 skeins of yarn that were better protected -- makes you wonder what people are thinking as they prepare packages for shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap seems to be less soapy than I expected.  It takes twice as much soap to get half as much lather as other Softsoap products we&#x27;ve used.  With previous products, one to two pumps of my liquid soap dish would give lots of lather &amp; bubbles.  But with this product, I barely get any lather with 4 or 5 pumps of the same soap dish.  I don&#x27;t know if it is necessary to have lather for the soap to work properly, but I don&#x27;t feel like my hands get clean without lather...  it could just be my perception about the cleanliness, but I do know that it is not money-wise to use 2 to 3 times the amount of product.  I will not be buying this particular Softsoap product again.  I now see why the price is less than the one I usually buy.</li>
            <li> GREAT price and fast ship got these for daughter&#x27;s school use. Better than small bottles for 1$ a piece.</li>
            <li> as expected, just like in the photo!</li>
            <li> On time; as advertised</li>
            <li> keeps the hands clean.</li>
            <li> Arrived 2 days late with an inch of liquid soap in the bottom of the box.  The bottles were packed diagonally, caps down, in a box labelled for gift cards; all 4 caps were loose.  The bottles were more than half empty.  I suppose most of the spilled soap oozed out of the box.  Terrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for YEARS and have never had any problem with dry skin or allergic reactions and I do have sensitive skin.  I just had to respond to the previous review, that customer must have had something else going on.  Don&#x27;t be afraid of this product, it is great!</li>
            <li> This product is great in all respects except for those with sensitive olfactory issues.  Is there a fragrance-free option?  Please?</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot! I also like the foaming soap dispensers and we have one at every bathroom sink in the house. One way to keep them full is to fill the bottle about 20% full with this soft soap and fill the remainder with water. Shake the bottle and you are good to go until the next refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because the soft soap is now foamy and its antibacterial formula cleans our hands and kills the germs. I think the foaming soap dispensers are better for kids as they get the soap more evenly distributed all over their hands and get them cleaner. They also seem to think it is more fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filling your soap dispensers this way saves money and you know you are getting a high quality product that keeps your family clean and safe.</li>
            <li> Larger soap container than in stores, so it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> It is too bad that FedEx broke open one of the bottles all over my sidewalk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap that comes in two bug jugs. I like soap and I like big jugs, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Arrived busted.  Other than that its good soap.</li>
            <li> We use this soap at the office where we have greasy, oily hands from machines and parts assembly. Works great for grimey clean up and normal hand washing. Leaves hands without greasy film.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money and quality soap.</li>
            <li> Great price but arrived leaking all over the inside of the packaging and the nozzle was bent in.</li>
            <li> keeps my hands smooth, I am able to fill multiple smaller dispensers for use around the house from these large bottles.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy and very happy I made the purchase. It came exactly as described and will be ordering more in the near future!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Softsoap in our house for many years. We tend to buy these large refills and use them for keeping our small pump and other household soap dispensers filled. That way we are using less plastic and get a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that is is very lightly fragranced, easy on the hands, and relatively inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are definitely soaps I prefer. My favorite is Yardley Of London antibacterial liquid hand soap, flowering english lavender - 16 Oz since it leaves a wonderful lavender scent on your hands. But since my kids go through soap so fast (a good thing I guess!) this is a great soap to have out for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty thick but not too thick and comes out of other pumps with ease.</li>
            <li> Softsoap came out a while back; but I remember that practically everyone wanted to try it the instant it hit the shelves. I can see why! This liquid hand soap, which can also be used as a body wash, gets my skin really clean (it&#x27;s antibacterial) and the moisturizers in the soap keep my skin from getting dry even if I have to wash my hands a lot during cold and flu season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of this time it&#x27;s somewhat overpriced on this website; I guess that&#x27;s the premium price you pay for having these Softsoap refill bottles delivered straight to your doorstep. If you can, keep looking around for this soap at local supermarkets or other brick and mortar stores where you can probably get this without spending quite so much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these larger plastic refill bottles of Softsoap. This is great soap!</li>
            <li> As advertised.  A great product.  Never clogs up the soap dispenser or leaves scum.  Soft on the hands and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Great product and service! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like the product but it is overpriced. I guess you are paying for the shipping. They&#x27;re pretty heavy. If you have a Costco membership it is probably better to get it from there.</li>
            <li> This is the least expensive way to purchase Soft Soap.  We just refill our smaller bottles.  Great product.</li>
            <li> We like this handsoap. Shipping box should be stronger. Arrived damaged and leaking but usable.</li>
            <li> The whole family enjoys them.....big guys and little guys.</li>
            <li> So much hand soap for a great price! Totally worth it! I am a germaphobe and I constantly wash my hands. After a month, I still haven&#x27;t even finished the first bottle. I love it!</li>
