            <li>These are very nice people and very helpful.</li>
            <li>I had a pair I purchased over two years ago that still are in pretty good shape, so</li>
            <li>The feel pretty good.</li>
            <li>Breast form would be better if it was curved on the back but very good quality for the money.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quick.</li>
            <li>fun to wear made of a great material and provide a realistic look for anyone</li>
            <li>The product was fine, no problems, no issues.</li>
            <li>Ok, at first I loved these because they were realistic</li>
            <li>So I was excited</li>
            <li>Came quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Just loved getting these to feminize my boy toy, he makes such a pretty girl</li>
            <li>These are EXACTLY what I was wanting when I ordered them!</li>
            <li>I will be buying another pair, these breast forms feel so much like real breast, and the weight, Oh my GOD!!!</li>
            <li>Fun to wear, looks real</li>
            <li>I got these for a party costume, was fun but can&#x27;t say how they would work for real day to day.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast, will be doing business here again!</li>
            <li>Nice move and feel and while not exactly matching the real thing</li>
            <li>Both were still a pretty realistic feel.</li>
            <li>My guy thinks that it has given me a little extra, I think they are great.</li>
            <li>Nothing like a real breast</li>
            <li>they bounce when you bounce and jiggle when you jiggle real comfy.</li>
            <li>Contacted Seller and was told that I was responsible for the damage.</li>
            <li>This product has an excelent feel of softness like that of real flesh after it warms up.</li>
            <li>Item is as described, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a natural 34B cup, and 38D is my alter ego!!!</li>
            <li>of course, I&#x27;m pretty old!</li>
            <li>and I have a new look!</li>
            <li>I only wish they came in african american colors, but other than that, I love them!!!.</li>
            <li>Realistic.</li>
            <li>Realistic look with a bit of makeup to match skin tone.</li>
            <li>They are as advertised an huge and on time should have taken care to get some smaller one&#x27;s butt thanks the same</li>
            <li>and since they are switch-able for left or right side use I can switch them out.</li>
            <li>it was a mess and took me an hour to clean it up!</li>
            <li>I will be interested to see if anyone else has the same problem I did.</li>
            <li>These forms are actually quite large.</li>
            <li>There are air bubbles under the clear skin coating...</li>
            <li>they are very usable for a short jaunt to the store, etc.</li>
            <li>They are not  heavy duty but suit the use I will be putting them to</li>
            <li>Refer to sizing charts on there website and consult them directly before purchase regarding your body size and desired breast size if your at all uncertain.</li>
            <li>today I go to open the box and see that one of them has completely deflated, and gooey sticky lube-like stuff was everywhere, and coming out of the box, all over my shelf!!!</li>
            <li>Unlike more expensive breastforms this product has a flat back as opposed to fitting over existing tissue.</li>
            <li>I did not handle these any differently than the pair that I have that are over 2 1/2 years old, go figure.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wear with all of my bras but that gives me an excuse to buy new bras</li>
            <li>The shipped fast, were well packed and function as expected!</li>

            <li> Be careful with size expectations.</li>
            <li> But I was storing them in a box not around any sharp objects or anything....</li>
            <li> I could see from the image it wasn&#x27;t flesh toned but with a little make up</li>
            <li> but I am totally changing my review now as a negative!</li>
            <li> I ordered the size 6 and 7, the 6 was a little on the softer side while the 7 was a bit firmer.</li>
            <li> Waste of money do not buy anything from them.</li>
            <li> Do not buy these, you will totally waste your money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bit too firm...</li>
            <li> A little small for 38 D.</li>
            <li> Not sure why?</li>
            <li> Not very good quality.</li>
            <li> The coloring and shading is very subtle.</li>
            <li> Just disappointed and frustrated.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to throw the tit away, and I&#x27;m very angered by it.</li>

            <li> I was totally pleased with the product. The fact that it is more pink than skin tone is irrelevant. I could see from the image it wasn&#x27;t flesh toned but with a little make up I should be able to make it closer resemble flesh tone. Nice move and feel and while not exactly matching the real thing it is a thousand times better than what I had. Unlike more expensive breastforms this product has a flat back as opposed to fitting over existing tissue. This makes for a much larger cup size than what you might be expecting.</li>
            <li> Ive always wanted breast forms from janetscloset because I thought they were the best of the best based on there website and cost of them (on their website) So I was excited have to find them on amazon for a cheaper price. But the breastforms are 100% not what I expected. They feel like water balloons but abit tougher... Nothing like a real breast &amp; I&#x27;ve had my fair share of breastforms. I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the specs of dirt literally inside the breastform nipple that you can see once I opened the box. They just feel &amp; can look so unnatural... Just disappointed and frustrated.</li>
            <li> Fun to wear, looks real</li>
            <li> Item met my expectation thank you</li>
            <li> I will be buying another pair, these breast forms feel so much like real breast, and the weight, Oh my GOD!!! i&#x27;m a natural 34B cup, and 38D is my alter ego!!! I love them!!! I only wish they came in african american colors, but other than that, I love them!!!. You cannot beat the price!!! They respond to every question that you may have , very good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kimberly A. Guyton, of Atlanta, Georgia</li>
            <li> authentic feel and weight. good look. fun to wear made of a great material and provide a realistic look for anyone</li>
            <li> Waste of money do not buy anything from them. No exchange or Rtn if the box is open how are ppl suppose to try things on</li>
            <li> Amazon needs to stop forcing us to write things in the comment box, or they will continue to get messages like this when no comments are necessary.  The product was fine, no problems, no issues.</li>
            <li> I wear a 42 C and the forms seem to be that size. A little small for 38 D. I love the feel of it.</li>
            <li> I were them ever day,and sleep in them at night. as soon as I get home I put them on and were them until the next morning.</li>
            <li> They are as advertised an huge and on time should have taken care to get some smaller one&#x27;s butt thanks the same</li>
            <li> I got these for a party costume, was fun but can&#x27;t say how they would work for real day to day.</li>
            <li> love these girls. they bounce when you bounce and jiggle when you jiggle real comfy. these girls have some weight. can&#x27;t wear with all of my bras but that gives me an excuse to buy new bras</li>
            <li> seems like great quality. color is not skin tone so do not expect to show any cleavage with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall I am happy!!!!</li>
            <li> Not very good quality. I did not have these for more than three months before the plastic film began to rip off the silicone. It happened from putting on the attachable nipples and taking them off. I had a pair I purchased over two years ago that still are in pretty good shape, so I know it is not from me not knowing how to handle them. I did notice the newer pair are made a little differently the the older pair, as they feel a little softer , and the color is much lighter. I plan on contacting Janet&#x27;s Closet on this matter , will plan on updating this.&lt;br /&gt;Update 7-21-14. Contacted Seller and was told that I was responsible for the damage. I was also informed that both of the breast forms had damage. I did not handle these any differently than the pair that I have that are over 2 1/2 years old, go figure. I am ordering another pair , hopefully that pair was just a lemon of some sort. I will be interested to see if anyone else has the same problem I did.</li>
            <li> Ok, at first I loved these because they were realistic and I had given them 4 stars but I am totally changing my review now as a negative! I will add that I bought them as film props, not actually to wear. But I was storing them in a box not around any sharp objects or anything....today I go to open the box and see that one of them has completely deflated, and gooey sticky lube-like stuff was everywhere, and coming out of the box, all over my shelf!!! it was a mess and took me an hour to clean it up! Unfortunately I had to throw the tit away, and I&#x27;m very angered by it. Do not buy these, you will totally waste your money.  Buy better quality non-leaky ones elsewhere!</li>

            <li> My MtF trans daughter, loved them! Thank you for making and selling a  great quality product!</li>
            <li> very nice product, and very realistic. shipping was fast, will be doing business here again!</li>
            <li> Just loved getting these to feminize my boy toy, he makes such a pretty girl</li>
            <li> Great loved them wish I would have orderd larger</li>
            <li> It is nice. I ordered the size 6 and 7, the 6 was a little on the softer side while the 7 was a bit firmer. Both were still a pretty realistic feel.</li>
            <li> This was a great value at a not so great time. I would recommend them to anyone in the market for an inexpensive set of breast&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The service was great and I have a new look! My guy thinks that it has given me a little extra, I think they are great.</li>
            <li> These are EXACTLY what I was wanting when I ordered them! The shipped fast, were well packed and function as expected! I love them!</li>
            <li> Transaction went very smoothly. Shipped very quick. Breast form would be better if it was curved on the back but very good quality for the money. Be careful with size expectations. These forms are actually quite large. Refer to sizing charts on there website and consult them directly before purchase regarding your body size and desired breast size if your at all uncertain. These are very nice people and very helpful. Shop smart and you wont be disappointed. : )</li>
            <li> The feel pretty good. Realistic. Came quickly as well. Only thing is... There are air bubbles under the clear skin coating... Not sure why? I would probably rate them better if the bubbles weren&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> Item was different than I imagined.</li>
            <li> Great breastforms! Realistic look with a bit of makeup to match skin tone. I have been given compliments, and asked if I had implants. Item is as described, and fast shipping. Said a week to 10 days, and I got them in 3 days. I will purchase from here again.</li>
