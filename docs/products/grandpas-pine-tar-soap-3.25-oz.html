            <li>now I have the magic of soap that smells like a campfire!</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>I searched the product and amazingly found it on amazon.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of filmy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>His review is that he liked it, but there are pine tar soaps that have a stronger smell.</li>
            <li>We all know what kind of options we have in terms of soap these days.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get this attached to material consumer products of any kind</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a kind of rustic-y, woodsy (pine/resin/smoke?)</li>
            <li>It kind of does smell like camp fire</li>
            <li>Lathers great, rinses clean.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with product bought it to keep my beard nice an soft and it does a very good job at it .</li>
            <li>The scent is VERY strong, but I didn&#x27;t even care.</li>
            <li>and I just feel using natural products is the best for me and my family.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, this soap makes my life better.  </li>
            <li>Makes his beard nice, and smells like a camp fire :)</li>
            <li>it smells good and gets ya clean.</li>
            <li>its kinda got a tire smell, but once you use and it and feel how good your skin feels, and how squeeky clean your skin is yet without any dryess, you will hopefully learn to LOVE the smell like I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice a strong and makes everything in my gym bag smell like it too.  </li>
            <li>This is so much more than soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually love it.</li>
            <li>I just love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I want an emollient that will cut through all of the dirt, sweat, blood, pitch, grease, or more blood that I might find myself covered in at any moment, and I want it to leave me smelling like a camp fire.</li>
            <li>This is a man&#x27;s soap that smells the way my beard, boots, and red flannel shirt look... magnificent.</li>
            <li>I want to love this soap, but it just cleans too well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>I also believe it is better for your skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the pine tar scent while I&#x27;m showering</li>
            <li>the soap gives me as much or more moisturizing as most soaps that tout their moisturizing abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, most days don&#x27;t offer anything better than my morning shower.  </li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t think it cleaned anybody more than Dial.</li>
            <li>It is simply the best.</li>
            <li>I do not think I can ever find a better soap.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to find one I can use at all.  </li>
            <li>what more is there to say.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimatelyâ€¦it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of using \\&quot;nostalgic\\&quot; brands because I don&#x27;t think that progress always leads to a better product, however, the one con I have with it was the smell.</li>
            <li>Smells ok.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and feel</li>
            <li>It intrigues peoples for sure.</li>
            <li>And love the product for my beard</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely, rinses clean, and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>I always feel nice and clean with using it.</li>
            <li>Foams nicely and washes away clean.</li>
            <li>If I ever get pregnant again, I&#x27;ll be sure to have some of this on hand, just in case!</li>
            <li>but this one leaves me feeling pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up nice and quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing to use a strong deodorant soap that doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers white, and gives a WONDERful squeaky clean feeling to everything.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff---makes me feel really clean.</li>
            <li>The soap was found to be very adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li>So if you want one that doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and knew I&#x27;d be getting a strongly scented soap, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong odor as he is showering, but the smell does not stay on his skin.</li>
            <li>The soap is fine</li>
            <li>Odd smell but works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that gave my skin relief when I broke out into a rash (PUPPS) at 36 weeks pregnant!!!!</li>
            <li>If you can stomach the scent it seemed like a nice soap, but I just couldn&#x27;t handle the scent it was just too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it when my head has been itchy and it worked fabulously.</li>
            <li>Cussing fantastic soap it is.</li>
            <li>From the master bath, the pleasant sweet pine and campfire aroma is strong enough to be noticed at the bedroom door.</li>
            <li>Unique smell but no lingering after odor.  </li>
            <li>I feel clean though.</li>
            <li>It gets me clean from hair to toes.  </li>
            <li>As a soap it performs admirably: leaves me clean but not squeaky, is acceptably moisturizing, &amp;c.</li>
            <li>My hair and body feel squeaky clean and do not have any soap residue after I use it.</li>
            <li>Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap leaves my face and beard squeaky clean, like nothing before.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing for dry rough hands, plus it leaves a delightful yet manly smell on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for psoriasis, but the woodsy smell is appealing and the soap leaves you feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown to love the soapy tar smell, but the real reason I keep this soap around is because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>If you love it, this soap is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this soap is good for anything because I only used it twice.  </li>
            <li>The reviews that say it smells like a campfire are true, however the smell dissipates quickly after the shower.</li>
            <li>This gives me a clean and fresh feel, and I believe it has helped eczema</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super drying on my skin though.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell that&#x27;s not exactly super pleasant.</li>
            <li>My wife had a rash while pregnant which was diagnosed as PUPPS.  </li>
            <li>This is only one of many old-fashioned products I use and love.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for my pregnant friend with itchy skin/PUPPS rash.</li>
            <li>I did a quick search on my phone and discovered someone recommending this product.</li>
            <li>The smell, makes me think of like a bold cinnamon.</li>
            <li>When I was pregnant, I got the PUPPS rash.</li>
            <li>The smell did seem to dissipate quickly</li>
            <li>I tried using it on my scalp, even though it isn&#x27;t shampoo, but didn&#x27;t find it to be any more effective than tar shampoos or other shampoos made for psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>if you found the review useful at all.</li>
            <li>It puts a smile on my face every time I use</li>
            <li>The benefits are far greater in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>This is a terrific soap: not only does it smell nice, it is effective.</li>
            <li>(Actually, it smells kind of like overcooked bacon, but the smell doesn&#x27;t stick to you at all, and mellows once the bar has been out of the packaging for a while.)  </li>
            <li>Amazing soap works to help aid in many ways clear out some minor imperfections or just for everyday use and will see great results</li>
            <li>Scent doesn&#x27;t linger on person after using it but clings to the mist in the air after a shower but goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I would  definitely recommend giving this soap a try and they even sell it in little travel sizes, perfect for trying out a product without buying a full sized bar.</li>
            <li>It smells a lot like woodsmoke to me, but the odor is gone right away after I bathe.</li>
            <li>The fact that this soap is still one of our modern world options should speak volumes about how special it is.  </li>
            <li>When you are pregnant, there isn&#x27;t much you can take to eliminate an itchy rash.  </li>
            <li>It leaves skin very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>just what I needed, thanks!!, been looking for this product since 2011, I would really recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li>a side note, it also smells pretty mannly</li>
            <li>I used this soap for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>Decent price and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>I guess from reading the reviews I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li>At first the smell took me aback, but like others said, this is not your scented peachy soap, this is a man&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li>After the first time I used this product I went through puberty again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my own fault for ordering this while having absolutely no idea what pine tar smells like, but man!</li>
            <li>Leaves my whiskers nice and soft even with daily use.  </li>
            <li>and I can say that I tried pretty much everything and anything (except the prescription drugs) to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>I am excited to have found this soap, and I will be returning to GNC to purchase quite a few more.</li>
            <li>wont notice much of a difference the first day, but stick with it</li>
            <li>This was an amazing cleanser and it cured my acne for about half a year.</li>
            <li>I developed a rash on my belly at 34 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>Yes, this stuff has a really strong smell, but overall didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>on top of all that, it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like many other soaps do.  </li>
            <li>Some people cannot get around the smell of the soap, but I really don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li>It just leaves me feeling really</li>
            <li>The scent is not what I was expecting, but is really growing on me.</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin all my life.</li>
            <li>The tar smell goes away fast.</li>
            <li>Made from saponified oils (real soap), not detergents (like Dove, etc), so</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle even if medicinal.</li>
            <li>Its really helping my skin conditions.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>No lotion has come close to helping my hands as much as this soap.</li>
            <li>It really stops the itch and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Real soap for real man.</li>
            <li>It is much easier and cleaner then tar oil.  </li>
            <li>One thing to be aware of is the bar shrinks faster then normal bars of soaps.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well, however.... it does smell like a fire pit.</li>
            <li>that is Really smells like a campfire...a very smoky campfire.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if I will smell like I&#x27;ve been sitting in campfire smoke for 3 days straight.</li>
            <li>I really like how this soap smells.  </li>
            <li>Wetness creates a soft layer that comes right off when you use it and makes the soap &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; faster.</li>
            <li>left my body and my hair literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly have any complaints, but it isn&#x27;t the miracle soap</li>
            <li>No flowers, no peach mango, no lovey cuddly dove imprinted on the bar.&lt;br /&gt;Its pine tar, for the most part, also has glycerin and such (only an issue when it comes to teethcare products).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, skin might dry out slightly but just use some good lotion with UV defense.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for clearing skin naturally and organically.  </li>
            <li>As far as cleaning, I use it for my hair, and it seems similar to other bar shampoos I&#x27;ve used - nothing amazing, but it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It costs more to get fragrance free than something with extra ingredients, which is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>This is a great alternative if you&#x27;re tired of having lots of chemicals in your skin care products, or are looking for a wildly different scent.  </li>
            <li>Nice subtle scent....of a campfire.  </li>
            <li>I used this soap for about a month and the spot on my elbow cleared up completely!  </li>
            <li>reason I had to try a dozen different soaps was to find something that didn&#x27;t make me sneeze + left me feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Have used much of this soap in the past, and enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>Then I put it in a canoe that I hollowed out of a giant redwood with my fingernails and sent it down the river... which is a better service than it</li>
            <li>Wether you like that or like artificial sprays, this soap will not result in conflicting smells.&lt;br /&gt;The pine tree being one of the worlds greatest medicinal wonderlands, this is to be expected from a soap with no perfumes or coloring.</li>
            <li>You can also lather (lathers clear) and use in hair.  </li>
            <li>This is not a dual action body scrub and moisturizer that pairs well with your passion fruit shampoo.</li>
            <li>(could be my blade was two weeks old).</li>
            <li>smells like old fire</li>
            <li>and you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This is considered an &#x27;Old Fashion&#x27; product, I assume because recipes like this one have been around for some time.  </li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>This soap leaves a bristling beard soft.  </li>
            <li>I could go without the smell, a cross between sitting by a smoky campfire and pine, but it helps so much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get it for dandruff or any skin condition; just because I like natural soap and the smell of pine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to stock up on it in case I can&#x27;t get it in the future.</li>
            <li>The scent is far too pungent for me.</li>
            <li>If you dont like it, well youre in luck, literally by the time you get dressed after leaving the shower, the smell is gone, and what remains is a natural body smell.</li>
            <li>I bathe each night with Dove Sensitive Skin soap.  </li>
            <li>Before I got my prescription steroid cream, this soap was the only thing that really seamed to help.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough for my face, yet it also works as an deodorant soap.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best in the shower but once rinsed is not that bad and doesn&#x27;t linger long term.  </li>
            <li>Most soaps seriously suck.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works on other types of rashes, but I would certainly try it!</li>
            <li>I have acne prone sensitive skin and this soap is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that I can use that doesn&#x27;t leave me with itchy, burning, irritated skin.</li>
            <li>About 10 days later it was completely gone.  </li>
            <li>This was my savior when I developed PUPPS my last month of pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>Let me say it does that job VERY well in addition to healing up rashes and other blemishes.</li>
            <li>If you are worried about the smell of it after you get out of the shower it becomes much more subtle after you get out and dry yourself off.</li>
            <li>Will not dry out your skin either.</li>
            <li>I will say, it does get all the dried up skin and oil off and leaves the skin feeling very clean, tight and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suffer from psoriasis and have had a patch on my elbow for nearly seven years that was suppressed using prescription gels, but would never completely go away.  </li>
            <li>in red blisters to small purple marks that do not itch and get sore much less easily.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything good or bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Best soap ever is all I can say!  </li>
            <li> delicious and manly!  </li>
            <li> The texture of Grandpa&#x27;s pine tar soap is wonderful.</li>

            <li> I have used this for stasis dermatitis on my legs and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome.</li>

            <li> so if there&#x27;s a man in your life, or if you&#x27;re a man, who will not wash with ocean breezes or vanilla Lillie&#x27;s, this would be a great choice.</li>
            <li> this soap is great.</li>
            <li> cleans great.</li>
            <li> I got this after some research and it works a bit but not as great as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> A great start to my day.</li>
            <li> This is great for skin rashes</li>
            <li> For men, this can lower their testosterone, and they don&#x27;t have great effects on women&#x27;s bodies</li>
            <li> I also considered that folks swear it smells like a camp fire, which is also a win in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is great soap, leaves you smelling and feeling great.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great soap for people with eczema.  </li>
            <li> Great soap for dandruff</li>
            <li> Also makes a great beard shampoo</li>
            <li> i had never tried tar soap before, this has the most amazing aroma i have ever smelled!!  </li>
            <li> so I thought this would be a good purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Now i think it smells good.  </li>
            <li> but works good.</li>
            <li> He loved it.</li>
            <li> Good for oily skin too.</li>
            <li> and my skin was never as smooth and beautiful as it is now.</li>
            <li> now I have the magic of soap that smells like a campfire!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li> I searched the product and amazingly found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> It lathers up nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of filmy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> His review is that he liked it, but there are pine tar soaps that have a stronger smell.</li>
            <li> We all know what kind of options we have in terms of soap these days.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get this attached to material consumer products of any kind</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a kind of rustic-y, woodsy (pine/resin/smoke?)</li>
            <li> It kind of does smell like camp fire</li>
            <li> Lathers great, rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product bought it to keep my beard nice an soft and it does a very good job at it .</li>
            <li> The scent is VERY strong, but I didn&#x27;t even care.</li>
            <li> and I just feel using natural products is the best for me and my family.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, this soap makes my life better.  </li>
            <li> Makes his beard nice, and smells like a camp fire :)</li>
            <li> it smells good and gets ya clean.</li>
            <li> its kinda got a tire smell, but once you use and it and feel how good your skin feels, and how squeeky clean your skin is yet without any dryess, you will hopefully learn to LOVE the smell like I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice a strong and makes everything in my gym bag smell like it too.  </li>
            <li> This is so much more than soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually love it.</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I want an emollient that will cut through all of the dirt, sweat, blood, pitch, grease, or more blood that I might find myself covered in at any moment, and I want it to leave me smelling like a camp fire.</li>
            <li> This is a man&#x27;s soap that smells the way my beard, boots, and red flannel shirt look... magnificent.</li>
            <li> I want to love this soap, but it just cleans too well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> I also believe it is better for your skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the pine tar scent while I&#x27;m showering</li>
            <li> the soap gives me as much or more moisturizing as most soaps that tout their moisturizing abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, most days don&#x27;t offer anything better than my morning shower.  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t think it cleaned anybody more than Dial.</li>
            <li> It is simply the best.</li>
            <li> I do not think I can ever find a better soap.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been able to find one I can use at all.  </li>
            <li> what more is there to say.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimatelyâ€¦it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of using \\&quot;nostalgic\\&quot; brands because I don&#x27;t think that progress always leads to a better product, however, the one con I have with it was the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells ok.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel</li>
            <li> It intrigues peoples for sure.</li>
            <li> And love the product for my beard</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely, rinses clean, and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> I always feel nice and clean with using it.</li>
            <li> Foams nicely and washes away clean.</li>
            <li> If I ever get pregnant again, I&#x27;ll be sure to have some of this on hand, just in case!</li>
            <li> but this one leaves me feeling pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Lathers up nice and quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing to use a strong deodorant soap that doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers white, and gives a WONDERful squeaky clean feeling to everything.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff---makes me feel really clean.</li>
            <li> The soap was found to be very adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li> So if you want one that doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and knew I&#x27;d be getting a strongly scented soap, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong odor as he is showering, but the smell does not stay on his skin.</li>
            <li> The soap is fine</li>
            <li> Odd smell but works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that gave my skin relief when I broke out into a rash (PUPPS) at 36 weeks pregnant!!!!</li>
            <li> If you can stomach the scent it seemed like a nice soap, but I just couldn&#x27;t handle the scent it was just too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it when my head has been itchy and it worked fabulously.</li>
            <li> Cussing fantastic soap it is.</li>
            <li> From the master bath, the pleasant sweet pine and campfire aroma is strong enough to be noticed at the bedroom door.</li>
            <li> Unique smell but no lingering after odor.  </li>
            <li> I feel clean though.</li>
            <li> It gets me clean from hair to toes.  </li>
            <li> As a soap it performs admirably: leaves me clean but not squeaky, is acceptably moisturizing, &amp;c.</li>
            <li> My hair and body feel squeaky clean and do not have any soap residue after I use it.</li>
            <li> Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap leaves my face and beard squeaky clean, like nothing before.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing for dry rough hands, plus it leaves a delightful yet manly smell on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for psoriasis, but the woodsy smell is appealing and the soap leaves you feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown to love the soapy tar smell, but the real reason I keep this soap around is because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> If you love it, this soap is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this soap is good for anything because I only used it twice.  </li>
            <li> The reviews that say it smells like a campfire are true, however the smell dissipates quickly after the shower.</li>
            <li> This gives me a clean and fresh feel, and I believe it has helped eczema</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super drying on my skin though.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell that&#x27;s not exactly super pleasant.</li>
            <li> My wife had a rash while pregnant which was diagnosed as PUPPS.  </li>
            <li> This is only one of many old-fashioned products I use and love.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for my pregnant friend with itchy skin/PUPPS rash.</li>
            <li> I did a quick search on my phone and discovered someone recommending this product.</li>
            <li> The smell, makes me think of like a bold cinnamon.</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant, I got the PUPPS rash.</li>
            <li> The smell did seem to dissipate quickly</li>
            <li> I tried using it on my scalp, even though it isn&#x27;t shampoo, but didn&#x27;t find it to be any more effective than tar shampoos or other shampoos made for psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> if you found the review useful at all.</li>
            <li> It puts a smile on my face every time I use</li>
            <li> The benefits are far greater in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrific soap: not only does it smell nice, it is effective.</li>
            <li> (Actually, it smells kind of like overcooked bacon, but the smell doesn&#x27;t stick to you at all, and mellows once the bar has been out of the packaging for a while.)  </li>
            <li> Amazing soap works to help aid in many ways clear out some minor imperfections or just for everyday use and will see great results</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t linger on person after using it but clings to the mist in the air after a shower but goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I would  definitely recommend giving this soap a try and they even sell it in little travel sizes, perfect for trying out a product without buying a full sized bar.</li>
            <li> It smells a lot like woodsmoke to me, but the odor is gone right away after I bathe.</li>
            <li> The fact that this soap is still one of our modern world options should speak volumes about how special it is.  </li>
            <li> When you are pregnant, there isn&#x27;t much you can take to eliminate an itchy rash.  </li>
            <li> It leaves skin very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> just what I needed, thanks!!, been looking for this product since 2011, I would really recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li> a side note, it also smells pretty mannly</li>
            <li> I used this soap for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li> Decent price and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> I guess from reading the reviews I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li> At first the smell took me aback, but like others said, this is not your scented peachy soap, this is a man&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li> After the first time I used this product I went through puberty again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my own fault for ordering this while having absolutely no idea what pine tar smells like, but man!</li>
            <li> Leaves my whiskers nice and soft even with daily use.  </li>
            <li> and I can say that I tried pretty much everything and anything (except the prescription drugs) to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I am excited to have found this soap, and I will be returning to GNC to purchase quite a few more.</li>
            <li> wont notice much of a difference the first day, but stick with it</li>
            <li> This was an amazing cleanser and it cured my acne for about half a year.</li>
            <li> I developed a rash on my belly at 34 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> Yes, this stuff has a really strong smell, but overall didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> on top of all that, it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like many other soaps do.  </li>
            <li> Some people cannot get around the smell of the soap, but I really don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> It just leaves me feeling really</li>
            <li> The scent is not what I was expecting, but is really growing on me.</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin all my life.</li>
            <li> The tar smell goes away fast.</li>
            <li> Made from saponified oils (real soap), not detergents (like Dove, etc), so</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle even if medicinal.</li>
            <li> Its really helping my skin conditions.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> No lotion has come close to helping my hands as much as this soap.</li>
            <li> It really stops the itch and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Real soap for real man.</li>
            <li> It is much easier and cleaner then tar oil.  </li>
            <li> One thing to be aware of is the bar shrinks faster then normal bars of soaps.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well, however.... it does smell like a fire pit.</li>
            <li> that is Really smells like a campfire...a very smoky campfire.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if I will smell like I&#x27;ve been sitting in campfire smoke for 3 days straight.</li>
            <li> I really like how this soap smells.  </li>
            <li> Wetness creates a soft layer that comes right off when you use it and makes the soap &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; faster.</li>
            <li> left my body and my hair literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly have any complaints, but it isn&#x27;t the miracle soap</li>
            <li> No flowers, no peach mango, no lovey cuddly dove imprinted on the bar.&lt;br /&gt;Its pine tar, for the most part, also has glycerin and such (only an issue when it comes to teethcare products).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> , skin might dry out slightly but just use some good lotion with UV defense.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for clearing skin naturally and organically.  </li>
            <li> As far as cleaning, I use it for my hair, and it seems similar to other bar shampoos I&#x27;ve used - nothing amazing, but it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It costs more to get fragrance free than something with extra ingredients, which is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> This is a great alternative if you&#x27;re tired of having lots of chemicals in your skin care products, or are looking for a wildly different scent.  </li>
            <li> Nice subtle scent....of a campfire.  </li>
            <li> I used this soap for about a month and the spot on my elbow cleared up completely!  </li>
            <li> reason I had to try a dozen different soaps was to find something that didn&#x27;t make me sneeze + left me feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> Have used much of this soap in the past, and enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li> Then I put it in a canoe that I hollowed out of a giant redwood with my fingernails and sent it down the river... which is a better service than it</li>
            <li> Wether you like that or like artificial sprays, this soap will not result in conflicting smells.&lt;br /&gt;The pine tree being one of the worlds greatest medicinal wonderlands, this is to be expected from a soap with no perfumes or coloring.</li>
            <li> You can also lather (lathers clear) and use in hair.  </li>
            <li> This is not a dual action body scrub and moisturizer that pairs well with your passion fruit shampoo.</li>
            <li> (could be my blade was two weeks old).</li>
            <li> smells like old fire</li>
            <li> and you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This is considered an &#x27;Old Fashion&#x27; product, I assume because recipes like this one have been around for some time.  </li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves a bristling beard soft.  </li>
            <li> I could go without the smell, a cross between sitting by a smoky campfire and pine, but it helps so much</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get it for dandruff or any skin condition; just because I like natural soap and the smell of pine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to stock up on it in case I can&#x27;t get it in the future.</li>
            <li> The scent is far too pungent for me.</li>
            <li> If you dont like it, well youre in luck, literally by the time you get dressed after leaving the shower, the smell is gone, and what remains is a natural body smell.</li>
            <li> I bathe each night with Dove Sensitive Skin soap.  </li>
            <li> Before I got my prescription steroid cream, this soap was the only thing that really seamed to help.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough for my face, yet it also works as an deodorant soap.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best in the shower but once rinsed is not that bad and doesn&#x27;t linger long term.  </li>
            <li> Most soaps seriously suck.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works on other types of rashes, but I would certainly try it!</li>
            <li> I have acne prone sensitive skin and this soap is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that I can use that doesn&#x27;t leave me with itchy, burning, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> About 10 days later it was completely gone.  </li>
            <li> This was my savior when I developed PUPPS my last month of pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> Let me say it does that job VERY well in addition to healing up rashes and other blemishes.</li>
            <li> If you are worried about the smell of it after you get out of the shower it becomes much more subtle after you get out and dry yourself off.</li>
            <li> Will not dry out your skin either.</li>
            <li> I will say, it does get all the dried up skin and oil off and leaves the skin feeling very clean, tight and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suffer from psoriasis and have had a patch on my elbow for nearly seven years that was suppressed using prescription gels, but would never completely go away.  </li>
            <li> in red blisters to small purple marks that do not itch and get sore much less easily.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything good or bad</li>
            <li> So glad Amazon offers these hard to find products that are in limited production and found in very few places these days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smelled so bad and so strong that I had to wrap the whole soap box in plastic wrap when I put it in the garbage since it was smelling up the entire room just sitting there in the trash.</li>
            <li> The relief didn&#x27;t last for too long, but it definitely helped.  </li>
            <li> tar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To extend the life of natural soap bars, let them dry out between uses rather than sit in a wet soap holder.</li>
            <li> Its aromatic qualities are spicy and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> my daughter gets boils, runs in the family, instead of painfully extracting them,i clean it with the tar soap when i first notice it.</li>
            <li> but it goes away shortly after leaving the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and</li>
            <li> But this thick-lathering soap transformed my wild horse hair into shiny, tame human hair.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Thousands of dollars left in spas for various treatments, spent on products,vitamins, cleansing inside and out \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; products-you name it!</li>
            <li> I even used it on my long hair.</li>
            <li> What I hadn&#x27;t anticipated is that it makes my bathroom smell, especially when the bar of soap is wet.</li>
            <li> lathers well and cures and soothes skin irritation an minor wounds and promotes&lt;br /&gt;healing.</li>
            <li> The pine scent is a matter of taste, but it is gone in about 30 seconds after you&#x27;re dry.  </li>
            <li> (yes, there is a difference between dandruff and dry scalp).</li>
            <li> also works with infected glands and dry scalp or itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It works on my husbands stubborn dry skin.</li>
            <li> all I could smell on my clothes was this soap even though it was in a zip lock bag &amp; was dry when packed.</li>
            <li> I prefer it to mainstream deodorant soaps because it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or contain any fragrances.  </li>
            <li> This soap was recommended to me for the dreaded dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> You will instantly stars chopping down trees while wrestling bears.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend used this soap, but prefers the liquid shampoo of the same brand because it seems less drying.</li>
            <li> The only issue is it has an odd odor when not in use.</li>
            <li> I can use this soap year round and my skin does not dry out.</li>
            <li> My head becomes very dry, and starts to itch and flake.  </li>
            <li> My wife was going crazy with itch on her last trimester of being pregnant</li>
            <li> I have Eczema and have to be careful what I use on my face</li>
            <li> The bar of soap did make the bathroom smell until I got a closed soap holder to keep it in when not in use.</li>
            <li> Like an aged bbq pit.</li>
            <li> My husband has eczema and psoriasis and his head especially will split open and bleed or have thick layers of skin that build up and itch.</li>
            <li> I had to air out all my other purchases for days to get rid of the smell on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not think it helped my acne or any other skin conditions though.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this soap I would get huge painful pimples, now when I break out the pimples are smaller, less noticeable, fewer in number, less painful, and heal much quicker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate, because I really wanted to like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the smell is very \\&quot;manly\\&quot; and not something I want on my skin.</li>
            <li> My thick, course, frizzy hair has never been well-tamed by any of the numerous moisturizing shampoos, conditioners, and leave-in treatments I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Pine tar soap is a love it or hate it sort of thing.</li>
            <li> Men love the smell of this soap and women hate it I&#x27;m told.</li>
            <li> I had 2 1/2 months to go when I came down with PUPPS.  </li>
            <li> After a few recommendations from other beardos, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> Guess you can&#x27;t return a half used bar of tar.</li>
            <li> Remember the movie Annie Hall and her black soap?</li>
            <li> Granted, you slightly smell like you have just stood in front of a smoking pit all day.  </li>
            <li> I got a close shave with very little razor drag</li>
            <li> I put down the five pound turkey leg I had been gnawing on, looked them dead in the eye and said, \\&quot;Once.</li>
            <li> My skin was always very dry, with no pimples or visible pores, and in my mid-thirties I started getting huge painful acne and clogged pores all over my face!</li>
            <li> But, the smell just lingers for a little while.  </li>
            <li> I had a rash on my leg all summer and after a few days of using this, it was clearing up.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few soaps out there that doesn&#x27;t contain xenoestrogens, chemicals which the body reacts to as if they were estrogen.  </li>
            <li> I know there are several poor reviews based on the smell of this product however if you are looking for this to help with psoriasis it works</li>
            <li> My doctor said it was the 2nd worse case she&#x27;d ever seen.  </li>
            <li> This soap might be a cure for dandruff, but it  just makes my dry scalp worse</li>
            <li> On the contrary I use very little lotion or moisturizer these days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tar soap in the past for my skin care.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I wanted a soap that would do it all bath, shave head and face, for lengthily motorcycle something in a small package, I found it Granpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap.</li>
            <li> We tried lots of ointments which failed, but finally tried this soap and it cleared it up in a few days!</li>
            <li> No more scratching myself like a maniac after a shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most horrible itch!</li>
            <li> and the smell is a small price to pay for relief.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be swearing BY it, or AT it, just yet.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, and if you don&#x27;t like it at least it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I bought this in part because I&#x27;m a sucker for marketing that leans on &#x27;old-fashioned&#x27;; if there&#x27;s the suggestion something&#x27;s unchanged since the 19th century</li>
            <li> Totally saved me from PUPPPs, a very very uncomfortable pregnancy rash, and is doing wonders for my husbands eczema.</li>
            <li> Anti-stretch mark ointments cause serious rash.</li>

            <li> I had a terrible case of PUPP rash when I was pregnant with my daughter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m posting this as a warning to other unsuspecting people who think to order this because of its high rating but having never personally experienced the disgusting scent of pine tar.</li>
            <li> I like this soap because it is black and smells crazy.</li>
            <li> It lathers very thick.  </li>
            <li> Even worse on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a work soap but after I showered I smelled worse than before the shower.</li>
            <li> The smell not great</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my skin got too used to it [which often happens to me]</li>
            <li> I used to have terrible seborrheic dermatitis on my face until I started using this product daily.  </li>
            <li> If you have this, you know that it itches worse than chicken pox.  </li>
            <li> Products was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> it makes people smell as bad as the soap smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as my shampoo, and it dries out my scalp so badly because (I&#x27;m assuming)</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t buy this again because of the smell, but it&#x27;s not so bad</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with this soap.</li>
            <li> Your wife or girlfriend will hate it.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible!</li>
            <li> The worst part was that nothing worked.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for psoriasis, but the woodsy smell is appealing and the soap leaves you feeling clean.  Pls rate as helpful if you found the review useful at all.</li>
            <li> Have used much of this soap in the past, and enjoy using it.  Unique smell but no lingering after odor.  Definitely different.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find any weeds under a pine tree.  Likewise, you won&#x27;t have pesky bacteria on your skin after you shower.  The pine scent is a matter of taste, but it is gone in about 30 seconds after you&#x27;re dry.  I love this stuff---makes me feel really clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my own fault for ordering this while having absolutely no idea what pine tar smells like, but man! It smells terrible! I&#x27;m posting this as a warning to other unsuspecting people who think to order this because of its high rating but having never personally experienced the disgusting scent of pine tar. Believe me, it smells nothing like pine trees or any variation like I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire box it arrived in (and everything else in it) reeked with this smell when I opened it. My husband (that I got it for since it&#x27;s supposed to be a fancy \\&quot;manly smelling\\&quot; soap wouldn&#x27;t even try it. I had to air out all my other purchases for days to get rid of the smell on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smelled so bad and so strong that I had to wrap the whole soap box in plastic wrap when I put it in the garbage since it was smelling up the entire room just sitting there in the trash. Just thinking about it brings the horrid scent back. We never could bring ourselves to wash with it, so I don&#x27;t know it it makes people smell as bad as the soap smells.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this!</li>
            <li> Totally saved me from PUPPPs, a very very uncomfortable pregnancy rash, and is doing wonders for my husbands eczema. I cannot guarentee it will work for you, but in a week I went from&lt;br /&gt;covered in red blisters to small purple marks that do not itch and get sore much less easily.  This is so much more than soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, it also smells pretty mannly so if there&#x27;s a man in your life, or if you&#x27;re a man, who will not wash with ocean breezes or vanilla Lillie&#x27;s, this would be a great choice.</li>
            <li> My skin was always very dry, with no pimples or visible pores, and in my mid-thirties I started getting huge painful acne and clogged pores all over my face! I have no clue why it started and I can say that I tried pretty much everything and anything (except the prescription drugs) to get rid of it. Thousands of dollars left in spas for various treatments, spent on products,vitamins, cleansing inside and out \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; products-you name it! The worst part was that nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;The price of my miracle is only $4.00! Now I only use sunscreen, and some transparent powder when I go out. Nothing else and my skin was never as smooth and beautiful as it is now. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This soap is the best and I wish I&#x27;ve found it earlier!</li>
            <li> Products was a disappointment. I&#x27;ve used tar soap in the past for my skin care. This did not work at all. Guess you can&#x27;t return a half used bar of tar.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about 3 years now and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if they quit making it.  I have acne prone sensitive skin and this soap is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that I can use that doesn&#x27;t leave me with itchy, burning, irritated skin. It also has helped my acne.  I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have had acne ever since my teens. Prior to using this soap I would get huge painful pimples, now when I break out the pimples are smaller, less noticeable, fewer in number, less painful, and heal much quicker. Yes, the smell did take some getting used to but now I don&#x27;t even notice it. It has a medicinal odor but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin. It lathers nicely, rinses clean, and leaves no residue. I can use this soap year round and my skin does not dry out. On the contrary I use very little lotion or moisturizer these days. I would  definitely recommend giving this soap a try and they even sell it in little travel sizes, perfect for trying out a product without buying a full sized bar.</li>
            <li> I smell like a BBQ... or fireplace! I actually love it. It&#x27;s super drying on my skin though. Even worse on my face. I feel clean though.</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of this stuff. It lathers up nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of filmy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the smell is quite strong. I love it. But if you do not like a woodsy pine smell, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> From the master bath, the pleasant sweet pine and campfire aroma is strong enough to be noticed at the bedroom door. But even in your hands it never overwhelms.&lt;br /&gt;As a body soap, it cleans thoroughly, refreshes, and rinses cleaner than the Dial Basic soap I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;As a shampoo, Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap is a revelation. My thick, course, frizzy hair has never been well-tamed by any of the numerous moisturizing shampoos, conditioners, and leave-in treatments I&#x27;ve tried. But this thick-lathering soap transformed my wild horse hair into shiny, tame human hair.&lt;br /&gt;It left my body and my hair literally squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a work soap but after I showered I smelled worse than before the shower. The soap is fine but I can&#x27;t get past the smell. It smells like a house fire. I had to store the bar of soap in a zip lock bag to keep it from stinking up the house.</li>
            <li> Someone once asked me if I had ever tried Axe body-wash. I put down the five pound turkey leg I had been gnawing on, looked them dead in the eye and said, \\&quot;Once. Then I put it in a canoe that I hollowed out of a giant redwood with my fingernails and sent it down the river... which is a better service than it deserved.\\&quot; I am a man, and I don&#x27;t want any liquid soap that leaves you with some nondescript \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; smell. When I wash myself in anything that is not the blood of my enemies, I use pine tar soap. I want an emollient that will cut through all of the dirt, sweat, blood, pitch, grease, or more blood that I might find myself covered in at any moment, and I want it to leave me smelling like a camp fire. This is not a dual action body scrub and moisturizer that pairs well with your passion fruit shampoo. This is a man&#x27;s soap that smells the way my beard, boots, and red flannel shirt look... magnificent.</li>
            <li> I want to love this soap, but it just cleans too well.  I&#x27;ve been using it as my shampoo, and it dries out my scalp so badly because (I&#x27;m assuming) it strips all the oils away.  My head becomes very dry, and starts to itch and flake.  This soap might be a cure for dandruff, but it  just makes my dry scalp worse (yes, there is a difference between dandruff and dry scalp).</li>
            <li> I used this soap for the first time this morning. I wanted a soap that would do it all bath, shave head and face, for lengthily motorcycle something in a small package, I found it Granpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap. This soap does everything it says it does. I&#x27;m more than satisfied. I have Eczema and have to be careful what I use on my face this soap is great. I got a close shave with very little razor drag (could be my blade was two weeks old). The smell not great so I don&#x27;t smell the bar.</li>
            <li> I suffer from psoriasis and have had a patch on my elbow for nearly seven years that was suppressed using prescription gels, but would never completely go away.  I used this soap for about a month and the spot on my elbow cleared up completely!  I tried using it on my scalp, even though it isn&#x27;t shampoo, but didn&#x27;t find it to be any more effective than tar shampoos or other shampoos made for psoriasis.  I am excited to have found this soap, and I will be returning to GNC to purchase quite a few more.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, but leaves you and the surrounding area smelling like you just sealed your driveway. My fault as it says that in the name.</li>
            <li> My husband loves pine tar soap so I thought this would be a good purchase. His review is that he liked it, but there are pine tar soaps that have a stronger smell. So if you want one that doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, this is the one for you. Since he wanted a stronger scent he suggested four stars.</li>
            <li> cleans great. smells like old fire</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap to help relieve the itching of pregnancy rash.  It WORKED!!  I don&#x27;t know if it works on other types of rashes, but I would certainly try it!</li>
            <li> I got this soap because I was hoping it would help with my itchy skin, but I could only use it once because it smelled like burnt plastic and although it lathered white it left a brown film on my skin. I was very unhappy with this soap. It doesn&#x27;t smell like a pine tree or like pine tar at all. If you can stomach the scent it seemed like a nice soap, but I just couldn&#x27;t handle the scent it was just too much.</li>
            <li> It gets me clean from hair to toes.  Works well as shampoo.  The only downside is my wife hates the smell.</li>
            <li> Some people cannot get around the smell of the soap, but I really don&#x27;t mind and I just feel using natural products is the best for me and my family.  I also believe it is better for your skin.  Decent price and quick delivery.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Resolved pregnancy related itching within a couple days.  Amazing stuff.  Does make you smell like a campfire, but I&#x27;ll take that any day over the itchy alternative</li>
            <li> Smells like a campfire but it works amazing!!!! It&#x27;s the only thing that gave my skin relief when I broke out into a rash (PUPPS) at 36 weeks pregnant!!!! A true god send!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative if you&#x27;re tired of having lots of chemicals in your skin care products, or are looking for a wildly different scent.  I&#x27;ve heard from multiple sources that this also helps people with skin problems.</li>
            <li> The soap was found to be very adequate for my needs. The delivery time was great!</li>
            <li> my daughter gets boils, runs in the family, instead of painfully extracting them,i clean it with the tar soap when i first notice it. also works with infected glands and dry scalp or itchy skin. wont notice much of a difference the first day, but stick with it and you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have been using Grandpa&#x27;s Wonder Pine Tar Soap for a couple of years now.  I love the pine tar scent while I&#x27;m showering but it goes away shortly after leaving the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and the soap gives me as much or more moisturizing as most soaps that tout their moisturizing abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unlike some moisturizing soaps, Granpa&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling like there&#x27;s a layer moisturing cream on my skin. It just leaves me feeling really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really good stuff.  I order it by the dozen bars.</li>
            <li> Just a heads up, this doesnt smell like the pine tar that people use in baseball. Im upset but its kinda my fault for assuming it would.</li>
            <li> I guess from reading the reviews I had higher expectations. I don&#x27;t particularly have any complaints, but it isn&#x27;t the miracle soap I felt like everyone was describing.</li>
            <li> My husband has eczema and psoriasis and his head especially will split open and bleed or have thick layers of skin that build up and itch. I came across this at our local health food store. He tried it and his head cleared up overnight! I&#x27;ve used it when my head has been itchy and it worked fabulously. I even used it on my long hair. It does have a strong smell that&#x27;s not exactly super pleasant. I reccomend this soap to anyone with skin issues!</li>
            <li> Its a smelly soap but my husband loves it.  Its helped his skin AND scalp.</li>
            <li> My wife was going crazy with itch on her last trimester of being pregnant and I did some research to help find something that would alleviate the pain.  I got this after some research and it works a bit but not as great as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> This is considered an &#x27;Old Fashion&#x27; product, I assume because recipes like this one have been around for some time.  Haw can you pass up smelling like a pine tree?  Its aromatic qualities are spicy and long lasting.  We all know what kind of options we have in terms of soap these days.  The fact that this soap is still one of our modern world options should speak volumes about how special it is.  Honestly, this soap makes my life better.  For me, most days don&#x27;t offer anything better than my morning shower.  I don&#x27;t get this attached to material consumer products of any kind but this one leaves me feeling pretty good.  A great start to my day.</li>
            <li> Amazing soap works to help aid in many ways clear out some minor imperfections or just for everyday use and will see great results, skin might dry out slightly but just use some good lotion with UV defense.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far. The scent is not what I was expecting, but is really growing on me. It&#x27;s nice a strong and makes everything in my gym bag smell like it too.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin all my life. This was an amazing cleanser and it cured my acne for about half a year. Unfortunately, my skin got too used to it [which often happens to me] so I eventually stopped it because it was ineffective. I still totally recommend this product. It leaves skin very soft and smooth.  The tar smell goes away fast.</li>
            <li> My wife had a rash while pregnant which was diagnosed as PUPPS.  We tried lots of ointments which failed, but finally tried this soap and it cleared it up in a few days!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the best soap for my skin. It didn&#x27;t do anything good or bad therefore I am just content with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Was just tooooooo smelly.  Out it went.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves a bristling beard soft.  Smells manly.</li>
            <li> Yes, this stuff has a really strong smell, but overall didn&#x27;t bother me. However, I don&#x27;t think it cleaned anybody more than Dial.</li>
            <li> At first the smell took me aback, but like others said, this is not your scented peachy soap, this is a man&#x27;s soap. I&#x27;ve grown to love the soapy tar smell, but the real reason I keep this soap around is because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. No more scratching myself like a maniac after a shower.</li>
            <li> This soap has helped greatly lessen the itchiness I have in relation to a pregnancy skin rash! I could go without the smell, a cross between sitting by a smoky campfire and pine, but it helps so much I just deal with that!!</li>
            <li> This is only one of many old-fashioned products I use and love.  I bought this for my niece who had a skin rash that flared up during her pregnancy.  This is great for skin rashes you don&#x27;t want to use chemical and commercial products on.  Very helpful for clearing skin naturally and organically.  So glad Amazon offers these hard to find products that are in limited production and found in very few places these days.</li>
            <li> Pine tar soap is a love it or hate it sort of thing. If you love it, this soap is the real deal. Made from saponified oils (real soap), not detergents (like Dove, etc), so it&#x27;s gentle even if medicinal. I didn&#x27;t get it for dandruff or any skin condition; just because I like natural soap and the smell of pine tar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To extend the life of natural soap bars, let them dry out between uses rather than sit in a wet soap holder. Wetness creates a soft layer that comes right off when you use it and makes the soap &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; faster.</li>
            <li> It is simply the best. Upon opening the box, an aroma from the gods enters into your nostrils. Filling you with strength and vigor, and manliness. Cussing fantastic soap it is.</li>
            <li> I developed a rash on my belly at 34 weeks pregnant. It&#x27;s the most horrible itch! For all you mommys too be ..please try this soap it was the only thing that helped...I used it three times a day.</li>
            <li> Its really helping my skin conditions. I have bought my 7th soap now.</li>
            <li> This soap smells like a campfire. It punches you in the face with masculinity and beats you over the head with cleanliness. Your wife or girlfriend will hate it. Best soap.</li>
            <li> WARNING: This product may enhance your body&#x27;s largest organ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried dozens of different soaps, and this feels like the end point.  I do not think I can ever find a better soap.  It puts a smile on my face every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell like campfire, so if you are nature/camping-squeamish, you are out of luck.  Maybe try a clay-based soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I had to try a dozen different soaps was to find something that didn&#x27;t make me sneeze + left me feeling clean.  Most soaps seriously suck.  It costs more to get fragrance free than something with extra ingredients, which is ridiculous.  Also, I wanted a soap I could wash my hair with, because shampoos also make me sneeze and I haven&#x27;t been able to find one I can use at all.  I did just order Grandpa&#x27;s shampoo, so we&#x27;ll see how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. In case you are still feeling bewildered, your largest organ is your skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!! I had a rash on my leg all summer and after a few days of using this, it was clearing up.  About 10 days later it was completely gone.  No rash, no itching, nothing.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Pregnancy causes stretch marks. Anti-stretch mark ointments cause serious rash. Grandpa&#x27;s pine tar soap gets rid of serious rash. what more is there to say.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few soaps out there that doesn&#x27;t contain xenoestrogens, chemicals which the body reacts to as if they were estrogen.  For men, this can lower their testosterone, and they don&#x27;t have great effects on women&#x27;s bodies either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the stuff smells incredibly good!  If theme parks or someone else want an environment to smell like an ancient forest, they use pine tar to achieve it.  That&#x27;s what this smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on top of all that, it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like many other soaps do.  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I bought this in part because I&#x27;m a sucker for marketing that leans on &#x27;old-fashioned&#x27;; if there&#x27;s the suggestion something&#x27;s unchanged since the 19th century I&#x27;m all about it. I also considered that folks swear it smells like a camp fire, which is also a win in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimatelyâ€¦it&#x27;s okay. As a soap it performs admirably: leaves me clean but not squeaky, is acceptably moisturizing, &amp;c. I just can&#x27;t get around the smell: the stuff reeks like tires. I was hoping for a kind of rustic-y, woodsy (pine/resin/smoke?) sort of aroma and what I got is the bicycle shop across town. It&#x27;s unfortunate, because I really wanted to like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it a week, so maybe six showers. I do like the way it works; I just can&#x27;t handle that burning rubber smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this soap is good for anything because I only used it twice.  I couldn&#x27;t  take the smell and I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and knew I&#x27;d be getting a strongly scented soap, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It smells a lot like woodsmoke to me, but the odor is gone right away after I bathe. What I hadn&#x27;t anticipated is that it makes my bathroom smell, especially when the bar of soap is wet. As far as cleaning, I use it for my hair, and it seems similar to other bar shampoos I&#x27;ve used - nothing amazing, but it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this again because of the smell, but it&#x27;s not so bad I won&#x27;t use up what I have.</li>
            <li> After the first time I used this product I went through puberty again.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing for dry rough hands, plus it leaves a delightful yet manly smell on your skin.  No lotion has come close to helping my hands as much as this soap.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my pregnant friend with itchy skin/PUPPS rash. It works well to take the itch away, but I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> It works on my husbands stubborn dry skin. It does have a strong odor as he is showering, but the smell does not stay on his skin. The bar of soap did make the bathroom smell until I got a closed soap holder to keep it in when not in use.</li>
            <li> This is a man&#x27;s soap meant for cleaning manly things.  I took it out of the box and my son said that it smelled like Home Depot.  I can only assume that he was talking about the glorious smell of wood and power tools.</li>
            <li> Smells like the back aisle of a Tractor Supply store. It isn&#x27;t bad, and if you don&#x27;t like it at least it doesn&#x27;t last long. The soap lathers white, and gives a WONDERful squeaky clean feeling to everything. I rub it on my hair (and man does it lather!) and it cleared up some dandruff issues I had that Head &amp; Shoulders, Selson Blue, and even Nizoral couldn&#x27;t fix! I was standing in the grocery aisle, trying to decide if I was going to try Tea-Tree oil, or coal tar shampoo. I did a quick search on my phone and discovered someone recommending this product. I searched the product and amazingly found it on amazon. Thank GOD it is still being made today and hasn&#x27;t been banned. This stuff also cleared up some rashy-skin eczema I had. BUY IT &amp; TRY IT! I&#x27;m ready to stock up on it in case I can&#x27;t get it in the future. To the manufacturer : THANK YOU for continuing a legacy of maintaining a great product!</li>
            <li> Brought this on a recommendation from a friend with a beard.  It lathers very thick.  Love the smell.</li>
            <li> This gives me a clean and fresh feel, and I believe it has helped eczema (there&#x27;s no telling since I also use a variety of lotions).</li>
            <li> Strips away all oil and grime.  I only use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> i had never tried tar soap before, this has the most amazing aroma i have ever smelled!!  the instant i opened the box i  couldnt wait to take a shower!!!</li>
            <li> just what I needed, thanks!!, been looking for this product since 2011, I would really recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I have PUPPPs and this is probably the only thing getting me through these last weeks of pregnancy. It really stops the itch and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> making you not smell like @#$%. it smells good and gets ya clean. a working mans soap. no girly scent here.</li>
            <li> Smells great...manly. Cross between leather and campfire. Lathers up nice and quick.</li>
            <li> Real soap for real man. That sums it all.</li>
            <li> I used to have terrible seborrheic dermatitis on my face until I started using this product daily.  I no longer need to take sketchy steroidal creams to keep the itching and redness away- now I have the magic of soap that smells like a campfire!</li>
            <li> I tried a bar of Grandpa&#x27;s pine tar soap based on several recommendations I had read online. The soap lathered well and my skin felt nourished and moisturized after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of using \\&quot;nostalgic\\&quot; brands because I don&#x27;t think that progress always leads to a better product, however, the one con I have with it was the smell. The scent is far too pungent for me. The bathroom smelled like it had been doused in pine solvent after I had used this product. I like the pine smell in a house, but I don&#x27;t know that I want to smell like that.</li>
            <li> Tis what id call a manly soap. No flowers, no peach mango, no lovey cuddly dove imprinted on the bar.&lt;br /&gt;Its pine tar, for the most part, also has glycerin and such (only an issue when it comes to teethcare products). The smell, makes me think of like a bold cinnamon. If you dont like it, well youre in luck, literally by the time you get dressed after leaving the shower, the smell is gone, and what remains is a natural body smell. Wether you like that or like artificial sprays, this soap will not result in conflicting smells.&lt;br /&gt;The pine tree being one of the worlds greatest medicinal wonderlands, this is to be expected from a soap with no perfumes or coloring.</li>
            <li> I have excema that is only help by using a tanning bed.  this soap is so wonderful in that it does not aggervate or irritate my skin at all.  its kinda got a tire smell, but once you use and it and feel how good your skin feels, and how squeeky clean your skin is yet without any dryess, you will hopefully learn to LOVE the smell like I did. Now i think it smells good.  I use this on my kids too occasionally, and it rinses off IMMEDIATELY with no residue.  I want my grandma to try to too, its very good stuff. I have tried everything, baby soap, etc, and nothing works like this.  I even use it on my face and I invest alot of money into my face w/ products</li>
            <li> I know there are several poor reviews based on the smell of this product however if you are looking for this to help with psoriasis it works and the smell is a small price to pay for relief.  It is soothing and moisturizing.  It has reduced redness and inflammation for me.  It is much easier and cleaner then tar oil.  You can also lather (lathers clear) and use in hair.  The smell of the tar is at it&#x27;s best in the shower but once rinsed is not that bad and doesn&#x27;t linger long term.  The benefits are far greater in my opinion.  One thing to be aware of is the bar shrinks faster then normal bars of soaps.</li>
            <li> Remember the movie Annie Hall and her black soap? I was always intrigued about it and I think this may well be it. It cleans very well, however.... it does smell like a fire pit. I bought it after reading it helps eczema and psoriasis on the face, and for fungal/yeast problems in the skin, like melasma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people swear by it... I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be swearing BY it, or AT it, just yet. I will say, it does get all the dried up skin and oil off and leaves the skin feeling very clean, tight and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars for performance... two for the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I prefer to use. lathers well and cures and soothes skin irritation an minor wounds and promotes&lt;br /&gt;healing. Smells ok.</li>
            <li> After a few recommendations from other beardos, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Best soap ever is all I can say!  Lathers great, rinses clean. Leaves my whiskers nice and soft even with daily use.  .....and the smell...delicious and manly!  Like an aged bbq pit.</li>
            <li> This is great soap, leaves you smelling and feeling great.</li>
            <li> This review is based on the product before I&#x27;ve actually used it.  Note that is Really smells like a campfire...a very smoky campfire.  I just didn&#x27;t see that mentioned anywhere before purchasing....and now when I need it for my skin I wonder if I will smell like I&#x27;ve been sitting in campfire smoke for 3 days straight.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great soap for people with eczema.  I bathe each night with Dove Sensitive Skin soap.  I then lather (brown soap, but lathers white) my eczema flare up sites with this soap and I wait about a minute, then rinse.  I find a big difference in the look of the flare up sites.  I also believe it helps a lot with the constant itch.  In the morning I apply Cerave lotion to the flare up sites.  Granted, you slightly smell like you have just stood in front of a smoking pit all day.  But, the smell just lingers for a little while.  It actually makes me hungry when I smell it.  Smells like smoked beef jerky.</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant, I got the PUPPS rash. If you have this, you know that it itches worse than chicken pox.  When you are pregnant, there isn&#x27;t much you can take to eliminate an itchy rash.  However, I read several message boards where people tried this, and it worked for me.  I suffered for about 2-3 weeks before I gave it a try, and waiting to buy it was the biggest mistake I made.  Within 1 day, the itch had subsided and in 2-3 days, the rash was gone.  If you have PUPPS, the medical diagnosis is that they only way to get rid of the rash is to deliver your baby.  I had 2 1/2 months to go when I came down with PUPPS.  If you have PUPPS, don&#x27;t wait...buy this soap!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel</li>
            <li> This was my savior when I developed PUPPS my last month of pregnancy.  I read somewhere that this soap helps- and it was the ONLY thing that worked to ease the itching.  The relief didn&#x27;t last for too long, but it definitely helped.  The scent is VERY strong, but I didn&#x27;t even care.</li>
            <li> The texture of Grandpa&#x27;s pine tar soap is wonderful. My hair and body feel squeaky clean and do not have any soap residue after I use it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product bought it to keep my beard nice an soft and it does a very good job at it .</li>
            <li> The reviews that say it smells like a campfire are true, however the smell dissipates quickly after the shower. I travel a lot &amp; when I unzipped my suitcase all I could smell on my clothes was this soap even though it was in a zip lock bag &amp; was dry when packed. The smell did seem to dissipate quickly but I don&#x27;t plan to travel with it. I do plan to keep this on hand at home however.</li>
            <li> I like this soap because it is black and smells crazy. It intrigues peoples for sure. I do not think it helped my acne or any other skin conditions though.</li>
            <li> This soap is excellent IMHO. The smell does take some getting used to as it is not a traditional smell but i also like that. I always feel nice and clean with using it. If you are worried about the smell of it after you get out of the shower it becomes much more subtle after you get out and dry yourself off.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific soap: not only does it smell nice, it is effective. I have used this for stasis dermatitis on my legs and it worked perfectly. I still use it there and on my bald noggin!!!</li>
            <li> Smelly stuff but works good. TY</li>
            <li> Smells like a campfire. Cleans well, and the smell doesn&#x27;t stay on the skin (how does that work?). I would order it again. Reminds me of living in the mountains.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible case of PUPP rash when I was pregnant with my daughter.  My doctor said it was the 2nd worse case she&#x27;d ever seen.  Before I got my prescription steroid cream, this soap was the only thing that really seamed to help.  If I ever get pregnant again, I&#x27;ll be sure to have some of this on hand, just in case!</li>
            <li> Nice subtle scent....of a campfire.  Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for my face, yet it also works as an deodorant soap.  I prefer it to mainstream deodorant soaps because it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or contain any fragrances.  (Actually, it smells kind of like overcooked bacon, but the smell doesn&#x27;t stick to you at all, and mellows once the bar has been out of the packaging for a while.)  It&#x27;s refreshing to use a strong deodorant soap that doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend used this soap, but prefers the liquid shampoo of the same brand because it seems less drying. Scent doesn&#x27;t linger on person after using it but clings to the mist in the air after a shower but goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Great soap for dandruff</li>
            <li> On time. And love the product for my beard</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome. Does not leave a residue on your skin. Will not dry out your skin either. It kind of does smell like camp fire but oh well I like it.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like the man that leads men into fierce battle, while at the same time you impress the ladies with you ruggedness, then look no further for a soap that the girly men run from. You will instantly stars chopping down trees while wrestling bears.  Also makes a great beard shampoo</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loved it. Makes his beard nice, and smells like a camp fire :)</li>
            <li> Odd smell but works great! Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap leaves my face and beard squeaky clean, like nothing before. The only issue is it has an odd odor when not in use. Make my bathroom smell like petroleum</li>
            <li> This soap was recommended to me for the dreaded dry winter skin. Let me say it does that job VERY well in addition to healing up rashes and other blemishes. Unfortunately the smell is very \\&quot;manly\\&quot; and not something I want on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like how this soap smells.  I use it on my beard two or three times a week.  It cleans well without stripping all of the oils out of my whiskers.</li>
            <li> Men love the smell of this soap and women hate it I&#x27;m told. Foams nicely and washes away clean. Good for oily skin too.</li>
            <li> I am not done with the bar to make an assessment yet</li>
    </ol>
