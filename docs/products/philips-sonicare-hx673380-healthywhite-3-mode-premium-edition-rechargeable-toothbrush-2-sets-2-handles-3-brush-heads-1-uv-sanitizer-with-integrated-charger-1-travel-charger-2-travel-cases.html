            <li>Many types of cleaning, good design.</li>
            <li>teeth feel super clean, the Diamond Brush head is a great upgrade, and the travel case is brilliant.  </li>
            <li>I urge you to consult you own dentist.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews and was impressed with how people seemed to really like this product.</li>
            <li>They love them and their teeth look good too.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this package included two bases, because my husband and I like to have our own handsets and chargers and</li>
            <li>The timer is great and the 3 modes are useful.  </li>
            <li>My dentist has complimented me on my brushing, and has said this toothbrush is an important part of good oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>I apprecaite being able to change the levels of cleaning as desired.  </li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes..</li>
            <li>I love it though, so does my husband.</li>
            <li>Keep Smiling everyone :)</li>
            <li>I love the UV sanitizer and use it every night.</li>
            <li>Hoping to be as pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li>As a user of the Rotadent for a while, I must say that this is an improvement in many ways.  </li>
            <li>I love my sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for many years and have been extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it. :)</li>
            <li>This model is better than the HealthyWhite brush.</li>
            <li>I like this more than the Oral B I used to have.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>It totally massages your gums and cleans your teeth leaving your mouth feeling awesome.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this about six months at this point, and I must say that my wife and I love it.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>It feels so good on my teeth and gums and tickles at first</li>
            <li>Vendor did a good job of replacing the first one sent that was corroded (which couldn&#x27;t be seen through the packaging).</li>
            <li>We are long time Sonicare users and this model is the best one we&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to update and was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>I bought the /80 model, but if I had seen it at the time, the HX6733/70 package offered what looks like the best package price if you need a travel charger to get one toothbrush in a separate bathroom, and still have the UV sanitizer/charger for a single brush for you.</li>
            <li>With regular flossing and use of my Sonicare, I get good reviews from my dentist!  </li>
            <li>Two handles makes it so you don&#x27;t have to share, but if one runs out of energy is that you can easily share if needed.  </li>
            <li>The sanitizer is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>travel case was fine this weekend and the brush held</li>
            <li>The cleaning modes are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The whole family has their own</li>
            <li>I get so many complements on my smile.</li>
            <li>I have friends who spend hundreds of dollars on purses and shoes, but purchase cheap toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Comfortable travel cases.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it helps me to clean every quadrant of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a family or traveling because of the 2 handles and extra charger.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is also very useful in cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>The travel cases will be very useful too.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>This is good to use when you first get a sonicare because it is a pretty powerful toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Squeaky clean, all day.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer and a strong advocate for Philips Sonicare &amp; the wonderfully positive impact it has on oral health!</li>
            <li>it really noticeably better than those $8 electric toothbrushes you can get at Walmart?\\</li>
            <li>Well packaged product and quick response from the seller.  </li>
            <li>Got my product quick and timely.</li>
            <li>This tooth brush works pretty good, it is soft and gentle with your gums, i think that 4 minutes is a lot</li>
            <li>The second one worked just fine and the person who got it liked so much, that he ordered one for his son.</li>
            <li>Healthy White package because I liked the idea of having the sensitive brushing option.  </li>
            <li>but well worth the investment</li>
            <li>toothbrush has improved my oral health and the whiteness of my smile.  </li>
            <li>It works perfect for double vanity sinks.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel as smooth and clean as after a professional dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Our teeth felt noticably cleaner right away</li>
            <li>These are pretty good toothbushes, but they quickly lose power if pressed too hard: something breaks inside them and there&#x27;s no way to fix it as they cannot be easily disassembled.</li>
            <li>Even though it does clean at a higher speed, the bristles are much softer, so it feels easier on the gums.</li>
            <li>The extra 30 seconds for whitening is nice and we really like the UV sterilzation.</li>
            <li>This is a super toothbrush, my wife and I brush twice a day, really cleans and also polishes our teeth.</li>
            <li>White teeth, Nice travel box, works great, comes with secondary travel size charger, and I get to sanitize the heads too!  </li>
            <li>After brushing with this toothbrush, my teeth felt clean and smooth and didn&#x27;t even have plaque buildup by the time I brushed them again at night.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying the set if you have more people using, it last longer and cheaper compare to buy one at a time.</li>
            <li>Had to return and reorder because the sanitizer didn&#x27;t work on the first one I ordered.</li>
            <li>but when I do... it is DEFINITELY BETTER than the standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>the first week I used it, I was too ruff</li>
            <li>Everything worked perfectly after that, no further trouble!  </li>
            <li>HX6733/80 HealthyWhite 3 Mode Premium Edition Rechargeable is so much better than the E series toothbrushes that have those cap type larger brush heads that get all moldy underneath.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be easier to slide into the habit since this was my first ever electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>difference is that this toothbrush uses tiny but very fast vibrations, while the other kind just has mechanical parts that spin and shimmy over your teeth -- not so much better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love the travel carry cases and the charge lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Just got these last week and the difference between these brushes and our Oral Bs is pretty huge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We only have 2 handles for 3 people, but that&#x27;s working out fine.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>Entirely worth the money so far.</li>
            <li>Excellent-my teeth feel much cleaner than w/</li>
            <li>Fast delivery-just a very impressive,overall experience.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I am not using this as much as I thought...</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can really tell a difference after just a couple of days of us all using it.  </li>
            <li>It really scrubs your teeth and your gums.  </li>
            <li>The vibration is so intense</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast.</li>
            <li>Our teeth are so much cleaner at this point rather than when we were using a manual tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>After several years my original Sonicare was still working</li>
            <li>I get a dental clean daily and my dentist noticed the differet.</li>
            <li>Tooth brush just doesn&#x27;t clean well enough.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are so smooth and brighter and the clean feeling last a long time thru the day.</li>
            <li>It turns off when you have brushed for a full 2 mins.</li>
            <li>He did not suggest a particular model just the brand.  </li>
            <li>I like that this particular brush has a \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li>she recommends this one, decide if you want or need this particular configuration.  </li>
            <li>The HX6733/80 has a main charger and a travel charger.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend that you purchase it.</li>
            <li>But it was a little daunting to see how many options there were to consider.  </li>
            <li>Previously used an Oral-B sonic and I can&#x27;t say enough about how much better the Sonicare cleans!  </li>
            <li>I really like sonicare hope the charge stays on a trip unlike my old one.</li>
            <li>well worth the price, as anything related to health should be.</li>
            <li>About a week after I started using it, I began get compliments on my smile and teeth daily.</li>
            <li>me a new one without a question.</li>
            <li>I really research each product before I purchase anything, especially something that costs this much.  </li>
            <li>Love it, not sure how i ever lived without it.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow!  </li>
            <li>but the brushing action seemed hesitant, almost slower in some way!  </li>
            <li>Read other reviews and thought, &amp;#34;wow these people are reaaallllyyyy excited about this toothbrush, kinda weird&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner and are already starting to look whiter.  </li>
            <li>It really is a couple steps ahead of my last toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Never would of believed that much difference in using standard vs sonicare.</li>
            <li>it was only 1 year old!  </li>
            <li>I have been using a Sonicare for the last 15 years so when my last one finally quit, this was a natural choice.</li>
            <li>One person can use the main charger and the other person can use the travel charger which is a standing charger but, just smaller and takes us less space than the main one.</li>
            <li>With outside vendors that could all change tomorrow, but as far as I can see the only difference in the $196 version /80 model and the $165 model /70 is a single extra tooth brush head.</li>

            <li> but well worth the investment</li>
            <li> toothbrush has improved my oral health and the whiteness of my smile.  </li>
            <li> It works perfect for double vanity sinks.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel as smooth and clean as after a professional dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Our teeth felt noticably cleaner right away</li>
            <li> These are pretty good toothbushes, but they quickly lose power if pressed too hard: something breaks inside them and there&#x27;s no way to fix it as they cannot be easily disassembled.</li>
            <li> Even though it does clean at a higher speed, the bristles are much softer, so it feels easier on the gums.</li>
            <li> The extra 30 seconds for whitening is nice and we really like the UV sterilzation.</li>
            <li> This is a super toothbrush, my wife and I brush twice a day, really cleans and also polishes our teeth.</li>
            <li> White teeth, Nice travel box, works great, comes with secondary travel size charger, and I get to sanitize the heads too!  </li>
            <li> After brushing with this toothbrush, my teeth felt clean and smooth and didn&#x27;t even have plaque buildup by the time I brushed them again at night.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying the set if you have more people using, it last longer and cheaper compare to buy one at a time.</li>
            <li> Had to return and reorder because the sanitizer didn&#x27;t work on the first one I ordered.</li>
            <li> but when I do... it is DEFINITELY BETTER than the standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> the first week I used it, I was too ruff</li>
            <li> Everything worked perfectly after that, no further trouble!  </li>
            <li> HX6733/80 HealthyWhite 3 Mode Premium Edition Rechargeable is so much better than the E series toothbrushes that have those cap type larger brush heads that get all moldy underneath.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be easier to slide into the habit since this was my first ever electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> difference is that this toothbrush uses tiny but very fast vibrations, while the other kind just has mechanical parts that spin and shimmy over your teeth -- not so much better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love the travel carry cases and the charge lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Just got these last week and the difference between these brushes and our Oral Bs is pretty huge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We only have 2 handles for 3 people, but that&#x27;s working out fine.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Entirely worth the money so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent-my teeth feel much cleaner than w/</li>
            <li> Fast delivery-just a very impressive,overall experience.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am not using this as much as I thought...</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can really tell a difference after just a couple of days of us all using it.  </li>
            <li> It really scrubs your teeth and your gums.  </li>
            <li> The vibration is so intense</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast.</li>
            <li> Our teeth are so much cleaner at this point rather than when we were using a manual tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> After several years my original Sonicare was still working</li>
            <li> I get a dental clean daily and my dentist noticed the differet.</li>
            <li> Tooth brush just doesn&#x27;t clean well enough.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are so smooth and brighter and the clean feeling last a long time thru the day.</li>
            <li> It turns off when you have brushed for a full 2 mins.</li>
            <li> He did not suggest a particular model just the brand.  </li>
            <li> I like that this particular brush has a \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li> she recommends this one, decide if you want or need this particular configuration.  </li>
            <li> The HX6733/80 has a main charger and a travel charger.</li>
            <li> Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend that you purchase it.</li>
            <li> But it was a little daunting to see how many options there were to consider.  </li>
            <li> Previously used an Oral-B sonic and I can&#x27;t say enough about how much better the Sonicare cleans!  </li>
            <li> I really like sonicare hope the charge stays on a trip unlike my old one.</li>
            <li> well worth the price, as anything related to health should be.</li>
            <li> About a week after I started using it, I began get compliments on my smile and teeth daily.</li>
            <li> me a new one without a question.</li>
            <li> I really research each product before I purchase anything, especially something that costs this much.  </li>
            <li> Love it, not sure how i ever lived without it.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!  </li>
            <li> but the brushing action seemed hesitant, almost slower in some way!  </li>
            <li> Read other reviews and thought, &amp;#34;wow these people are reaaallllyyyy excited about this toothbrush, kinda weird&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner and are already starting to look whiter.  </li>
            <li> It really is a couple steps ahead of my last toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Never would of believed that much difference in using standard vs sonicare.</li>
            <li> it was only 1 year old!  </li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare for the last 15 years so when my last one finally quit, this was a natural choice.</li>
            <li> One person can use the main charger and the other person can use the travel charger which is a standing charger but, just smaller and takes us less space than the main one.</li>
            <li> With outside vendors that could all change tomorrow, but as far as I can see the only difference in the $196 version /80 model and the $165 model /70 is a single extra tooth brush head.</li>
            <li> Sanitizer easily pull out with the brush head and if you have fat fingers you&#x27;ll find it a little hard to put the brush</li>
            <li> I like having a built in function to know when I&#x27;ve brushed for long enough.</li>
            <li> I contacted Philips on their website by chat and will be receiving a new replacement handle in a few days.  </li>
            <li> I can feel the difference in my teeth all day long.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe we went this long without it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s charge for a long weekend of use without problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it was still working, it was clearly not working as well as it had and</li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery lasts a very long time between charges.</li>
            <li> Very long battery life.</li>
            <li> no more quickie brushing, timer holds brusher accountable to do a complete job and also when to switch areas of mouth and when to recharge.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it five stars it that this model is much louder than the ones I have had in the past, I&#x27;m not sure why</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B toothbrush for the past 10 years until it died recently.  </li>
            <li> When you invest in something this expensive, you&#x27;re probably really concerned about your dental care.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush takes a little getting used to, as it does a fierce little scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> so my gums were a little sore.</li>
            <li> So I waited a few day than started using it again.</li>
            <li> This set of two was less expensive than an individual one.</li>
            <li> is usually 9 each.</li>
            <li> There is not a better electric toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to write five star reviews because I&#x27;m worried that readers won&#x27;t take my reviews seriously.  </li>
            <li> After 9 months of having it my tooth brush failed, i called Phillips customer service</li>
            <li> quit just shy of 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because my kids were getting bad grades from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Three bad chargers with them...</li>
            <li> The power base was working &amp; it was powering up the toothbrush</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it, not sure how i ever lived without it. I would highly recommend these! Well well well worth the price, as anything related to health should be.</li>
            <li> Well packaged product and quick response from the seller.  The tooth brush set has travel box to put away and protect tooth brush. The toothbrush is also very useful in cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Just got these last week and the difference between these brushes and our Oral Bs is pretty huge. Even though it does clean at a higher speed, the bristles are much softer, so it feels easier on the gums. My teeth feel very clean. I love the fact that this package included two bases, because my husband and I like to have our own handsets and chargers and this way I only had to buy one brush set. The travel cases will be very useful too. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. Entirely worth the money so far.</li>
            <li> The big question for me when I was thinking of buying this toothbrush was \\&quot;is it really noticeably better than those $8 electric toothbrushes you can get at Walmart?\\&quot; I&#x27;m happy to say that I can now answer that with an enthusiastic \\&quot;ABSOLUTELY!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is that this toothbrush uses tiny but very fast vibrations, while the other kind just has mechanical parts that spin and shimmy over your teeth -- not so much better than a manual toothbrush. I can feel the difference in my teeth all day long. After brushing with this toothbrush, my teeth felt clean and smooth and didn&#x27;t even have plaque buildup by the time I brushed them again at night. Squeaky clean, all day. That&#x27;s the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and that timing feature is great too. I like having a built in function to know when I&#x27;ve brushed for long enough.</li>
            <li> Very pleased w/this.Excellent-my teeth feel much cleaner than w/my oral b toothbrush. Fast delivery-just a very impressive,overall experience. Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> This is a great teeth cleaning unit.  Two handles makes it so you don&#x27;t have to share, but if one runs out of energy is that you can easily share if needed.  The cleaning modes are fantastic.  Previously used an Oral-B sonic and I can&#x27;t say enough about how much better the Sonicare cleans!  I apprecaite being able to change the levels of cleaning as desired.  The sanitizer is easy to use.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> we had one handle for four of us to used and the mettle part came off  with the brush head one day. I recommend buying the set if you have more people using, it last longer and cheaper compare to buy one at a time. i give 4stars because of the tray in the UV Sanitizer easily pull out with the brush head and if you have fat fingers you&#x27;ll find it a little hard to put the brush in.&lt;br /&gt;once you using sonicare you don&#x27;t go back to hand brush. during the week I feel like not brushing my teeth (waiting for this set to arrive).</li>
            <li> We actually downgraded when we bought these.  But, they are doing the job great..Love these toothbrushes..The whole family has their own</li>
            <li> Our Oral-B&#x27;s were worn out and our dentist recommended Sonicare.  He did not suggest a particular model just the brand.  This duo with sanitizer and travel charge was a greta price.  All I can say is wow!  It takes a couple days to get used to how aggressive these toothbrushes are, but I can say my mouth has never felt cleaner.  The rechargeable battery lasts a very long time between charges. (Up to four weeks) I like the timing feature that times and signals each quadrant of your mouth for optimal cleaning.</li>
            <li> Had to return and reorder because the sanitizer didn&#x27;t work on the first one I ordered. The second one worked just fine and the person who got it liked so much, that he ordered one for his son.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the Sonicare toothbrush 2 years ago and I&#x27;ve been shopping prices ever since.  Very pleased with the price, delivery speed and product quality!  The toothbrush takes a little getting used to, as it does a fierce little scrubbing.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt, but takes some coordination to move it around my mouth.  I love it though, so does my husband. My teeth feel as smooth and clean as after a professional dental cleaning.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am not using this as much as I thought...but when I do... it is DEFINITELY BETTER than the standard toothbrush.  When I use it, I go with the 3 minute timer...so I don&#x27;t use this when I am rushed for time.  Definite value and benefit.</li>
            <li> no more quickie brushing, timer holds brusher accountable to do a complete job and also when to switch areas of mouth and when to recharge. cleaner disinfects and makes hygiene a breeze.</li>
            <li> This Tooth brush system is amazing. I have always wanted one and made the decision to finally get it. I know you think this is a pricy for a tooth brush, but well worth the investment,This is not just a tooth brush this is a overall health care system for your mouth. the first week I used it, I was too ruff so my gums were a little sore. So I waited a few day than started using it again.It feels so good on my teeth and gums and tickles at first but you get used to it. My teeth are so smooth and brighter and the clean feeling last a long time thru the day. I get so many complements on my smile. I tell them I use the Sonic Care system along with Crest Pro-Health 3D White tooth paste. Bling!!! Keep Smiling everyone :)&lt;br /&gt;Donna G.&lt;br /&gt;Naperville IL.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe we went this long without it.  My teeth feel so much cleaner and are already starting to look whiter.  I love the UV sanitizer and use it every night.</li>
            <li> This is the second Sonicare set that I have purchased in several years.  After several years my original Sonicare was still working but I wanted to update and was not disappointed!  After I had used this newer set for about 1 year, the power coming from the handle seemed off....The power base was working &amp; it was powering up the toothbrush but the brushing action seemed hesitant, almost slower in some way!  Although it was still working, it was clearly not working as well as it had and it was only 1 year old!  So I e-mailed Philips about my Sonicare product and a representative called me back at home. They immediately mailed a replacement handle at no cost to me and simply asked that I return the defective handle in the postage paid envelope included in the mailing.  Everything worked perfectly after that, no further trouble!  Philips stood by their product and that is a wonderful thing!  I LOVE the sonicare toothbrush and my dental hygienist agrees!  In addition to the 2 I bought for myself, I have bought one for my husband, one for my oldest son and a double set for my younger son and daughter-in-law! I am a loyal customer and a strong advocate for Philips Sonicare &amp; the wonderfully positive impact it has on oral health!</li>
            <li> We owned a sonicare several years ago.  Hoping to be as pleased with this one.  Vendor did a good job of replacing the first one sent that was corroded (which couldn&#x27;t be seen through the packaging).</li>
            <li> I have friends who spend hundreds of dollars on purses and shoes, but purchase cheap toothbrushes. This toothbrush is a deal, me and my partner have been sharing the same handle for over 1.5 years now. We do change the heads, which are pricey because sold in bulk, sold separately is usually 9 each. I get a dental clean daily and my dentist noticed the differet.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare for the last 15 years so when my last one finally quit, this was a natural choice. There is not a better electric toothbrush on the market. Dental hygienist always comment about my home care being exceptional and I owe it all to the Sonicare brand. The only reason I did not give it five stars it that this model is much louder than the ones I have had in the past, I&#x27;m not sure why but it is. Not really a big deal but this thing actually wakes me up if my Wife is brushing in the master bath after I have gone to sleep.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B toothbrush for the past 10 years until it died recently.  It did a great job on my teeth and gums.  I had to try the Phillips Sonicare to see what it was like. It really is a couple steps ahead of my last toothbrush. My teeth feel really smooth and clean.  I like that this particular brush has a \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; setting.  This is good to use when you first get a sonicare because it is a pretty powerful toothbrush.  Also, the two pack set is perfect for husband and wife.  Great seller!  Got my product quick and timely.</li>
            <li> Easy and comfortable to use. Many types of cleaning, good design. Very long battery life. Comfortable travel cases. Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my kids were getting bad grades from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can really tell a difference after just a couple of days of us all using it.  The timer is great and the 3 modes are useful.  My teeth feel like I just left the dentist and my kids teeth are both whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We only have 2 handles for 3 people, but that&#x27;s working out fine.  We keep one handle in each bathroom and if a kid needs to use a different bathroom they just bring their brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case was fine this weekend and the brush held it&#x27;s charge for a long weekend of use without problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product all around.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does an excellent job of cleaning your teeth.  It is convenient to take on a trip with the travel charger and carry case.</li>
            <li> Great while they lasted (about a year.)</li>
            <li> As a user of the Rotadent for a while, I must say that this is an improvement in many ways.  The charging station itself is alone enough to switch; let&#x27;s just hope, that unlike the Rotadent, it doesn&#x27;t die after a month. Three bad chargers with them...ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel super clean, the Diamond Brush head is a great upgrade, and the travel case is brilliant.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love my sonic toothbrush.  About a week after I started using it, I began get compliments on my smile and teeth daily. Its an excellent product, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to write five star reviews because I&#x27;m worried that readers won&#x27;t take my reviews seriously.  I really research each product before I purchase anything, especially something that costs this much.  I attribute my five star ratings to taking the steps necessary to understand the product and what it will and won&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush has improved my oral health and the whiteness of my smile.  My dentist has complimented me on my brushing, and has said this toothbrush is an important part of good oral hygiene.  I can&#x27;t imagine what else Phillips could offer in a toothbrush set!  It&#x27;s easy to use and it helps me to clean every quadrant of my mouth.  When you invest in something this expensive, you&#x27;re probably really concerned about your dental care.  I urge you to consult you own dentist.  If he/she recommends this one, decide if you want or need this particular configuration.  I like the travel cases and charger, and brush sanitizer.  This meets my needs and lifestyle perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for many years and have been extremely satisfied.  Tooth brush just doesn&#x27;t clean well enough.  With regular flossing and use of my Sonicare, I get good reviews from my dentist!  This set of two was less expensive than an individual one.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good toothbushes, but they quickly lose power if pressed too hard: something breaks inside them and there&#x27;s no way to fix it as they cannot be easily disassembled.</li>
            <li> Not lots to say.  White teeth, Nice travel box, works great, comes with secondary travel size charger, and I get to sanitize the heads too!  Love it, love it, love it. :)</li>
            <li> We are long time Sonicare users and this model is the best one we&#x27;ve used yet. Our teeth felt noticably cleaner right away and I like that the brush heads no longer rely on magnets for movement. The extra 30 seconds for whitening is nice and we really like the UV sterilzation. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Read other reviews and thought, &amp;#34;wow these people are reaaallllyyyy excited about this toothbrush, kinda weird&amp;#34;. BUT.....they were correct. It&#x27;s awesome for a toothbrush. Teeth feel just like when you leave the dentist after a cleaning. Will save me from causing damage and &#x27;over brushing gum line&#x27;. Easy to use. Only wish there were 2 charges instead of 1. Using just a regular toothbrush again would feel prehistoric. Never would of believed that much difference in using standard vs sonicare.</li>
            <li> My package came with the Flexcare model with two diamond brushes, as pictured not titled. This model is better than the HealthyWhite brush.</li>
            <li> I like this more than the Oral B I used to have.  It really scrubs your teeth and your gums.  I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a cleaning.  I highly recommend this.  A+</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love these toothbrushes.  Love the travel carry cases and the charge lasts for a long time.  The sanitizer is a wonderful addition.</li>
            <li> This is so awesome. I wish I had switched earlier in life. I am almost 50 and have receding gum lines which causes my nerves to be exposed. This is a timed cleaning tool. It turns off when you have brushed for a full 2 mins. I find myself brushing longer than I ever did before.  It totally massages your gums and cleans your teeth leaving your mouth feeling awesome.</li>
            <li> We are still getting used this.  The vibration is so intense no matter which mode you use.  It was a good buy.</li>
            <li> This is a super toothbrush, my wife and I brush twice a day, really cleans and also polishes our teeth.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare HX6733/80 HealthyWhite 3 Mode Premium Edition Rechargeable is so much better than the E series toothbrushes that have those cap type larger brush heads that get all moldy underneath. The HX6733/80 has a main charger and a travel charger. It works perfect for double vanity sinks. One person can use the main charger and the other person can use the travel charger which is a standing charger but, just smaller and takes us less space than the main one.</li>
            <li> Love this item. Use daily. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews and was impressed with how people seemed to really like this product. But it was a little daunting to see how many options there were to consider.  I went with the Philips Sonicare HX6733/80 Healthy White package because I liked the idea of having the sensitive brushing option.  I thought it might be easier to slide into the habit since this was my first ever electric toothbrush. It&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you buy, check out the cost for buying one vs two tooth brushes at a time.  The /90 model is for two in the same bathroom, with the UV sanitizer ($161). I bought the /80 model, but if I had seen it at the time, the HX6733/70 package offered what looks like the best package price if you need a travel charger to get one toothbrush in a separate bathroom, and still have the UV sanitizer/charger for a single brush for you. With outside vendors that could all change tomorrow, but as far as I can see the only difference in the $196 version /80 model and the $165 model /70 is a single extra tooth brush head.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush works pretty good, it is soft and gentle with your gums, i think that 4 minutes is a lot but it the recommended. After 9 months of having it my tooth brush failed, i called Phillips customer service and they overnight me a new one without a question. Great job at Phillips for their customer support.</li>
            <li> The best electric toothbrush that I have owned. My teeth have never felt cleaner!  It&#x27;s great for a family or traveling because of the 2 handles and extra charger.  I have one toothbrush handle quit just shy of 2 years.  I contacted Philips on their website by chat and will be receiving a new replacement handle in a few days.  The warranty held up!</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast. My dentist recommended this product but his price was mre than I wanted to spend. I came home and looked it up on Amazon and found it there cheaper. I bought the double since it was a Wedding gift for my son &amp; daughter-in-law. They love them and their teeth look good too. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about six months at this point, and I must say that my wife and I love it.  The brushes hold their charge forever it seems.  The cleaning of the heads is great through the UV system.  Our teeth are so much cleaner at this point rather than when we were using a manual tooth brush.  I would highly recommend that you purchase it.</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile ago from Costco 2nd as the title says I am giving the spare that comes with this to my mom. I really like sonicare hope the charge stays on a trip unlike my old one.</li>
            <li> Did a lot of research about this before I purchased. Had great reviews and they were correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that has teeth !</li>
