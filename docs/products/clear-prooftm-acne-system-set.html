            <li>Love MK acne system set.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I believe you will see better faster results.</li>
            <li>1 pimple stays on my face for literally 8 weeks or more.  </li>
            <li>though-make sure you follow the insturctions.  </li>
            <li>I love the moisturizer</li>
            <li>This product works better than anything else that I have used.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>Just a couple more days</li>
            <li>Am so excited and can&#x27;t wait to see the result of my skin after one week!</li>
            <li>I got to try the whole system free from Chatterbox and was happy to try it and review it.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin that is acne prone!</li>
            <li>For naturally oily skin this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Works great for my 15 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>ProActiv worked somewhat on the acne, but really flared the eczema, even with a good lotion.</li>
            <li>I give it a full 5 stars!</li>
            <li>The item was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>The toner is quite strong.</li>
            <li>This has cleared my acne tremendously!</li>
            <li>There should not be a huge difference like that...</li>
            <li>The moisturizer feels light on my face when I use it...</li>
            <li>It works great for me if I only use it once per day.</li>
            <li>My skin was almost acne free</li>
            <li>I must stress that it really is important to keep your hands off your face.</li>
            <li>I got this originally as a gift from my sister in law (a mary kay rep).  </li>
            <li>often-still totally worth a try though my skin is really looking a LOT better!  </li>
            <li>I see many positive reviews for this system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a full month now with no results.    </li>
            <li>So I had to stop using the full system.</li>
            <li>I do it because it is the true</li>
            <li>He ordered it asap and loves it just as much as me :)</li>
            <li>and I  naturally have very oily skin makes it fairly surprising.</li>
            <li>I have switched to a mild cleanser.... cetaphil... Which has cleared up 90% of my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had skin problems since elementary school, and this is the only face stuff that will keep me good.</li>
            <li>If I could go back and give this to my 13 year-old self, I would have been much more confident growing up instead of trying to cover up with a ton of make-</li>
            <li>I love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone with acne,</li>
            <li>First time I used it I thought my face was going to burn off!</li>
            <li>To be fair, I live in Hawaii and had been going to the beach quite frequently at the time I tried this out but considering the fact that I was using the moisturizer</li>
            <li>but I know that after using it at camp for a few days she came home and looked great.</li>
            <li>I use the entire line (including the pore-reducing serum, which is sold separately) and now my skin looks smooth, acne-free, and healthy.</li>
            <li>I recently had the opportunity to review the MaryKay #ClearProof Acne System Compliments of Influenster.com in return for my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>The toner and moisturizer especially are fantastic and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>After I stopped using the MK acne set, I noticed that my acne got much more clear.</li>
            <li>If left on its own I experience breakouts and always have to cleanse and tone.</li>
            <li>I love this system for my adult acne.</li>
            <li>I have had consistent, mild acne since I was 15.</li>
            <li>Should have looked into birth control pills first since hormones are the cause of most adult acne, not hygiene.</li>
            <li>It took a few months (about 4) to really notice changes but I stuck with it and my skin has never been so great.  </li>
            <li>I wrote a very detailed blog review that includes several photos and links.  </li>
            <li>I have very very oily and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>This did clear up my acne super quick but then made my face scaly and flakey.</li>
            <li>The first time, I started to use this product, it burned my face.</li>
            <li>I started using this the first night it came in the mail.</li>
            <li>It seemed to have an effect within the first couple of days.</li>
            <li>and I think since she likes it so much that the price was worth it.</li>
            <li>The first review was not as favorable</li>
            <li>but after the 3rd to 5th time,...it felt better...</li>
            <li>If you are interested in this product line I would suggest taking a look at my review.</li>
            <li>Really works !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from drug store products to top of the line products such as Rodan and Fields.</li>
            <li>but I had to for this because it really works!</li>
            <li>First couple of weeks I began to see results.</li>
            <li>but, thanks to some reviews, I was forewarned and made sure to use extra moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Will keep using it and will reduce usage to bare minimum when I fell comfortable to do so.</li>
            <li>On top of that it made my face burn and my skin dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews that people were getting very dry and flaky from this product.</li>
            <li>so I think pretty highly of the product too.</li>
            <li>So I stopped using it for a whole week.</li>
            <li>I stopped using the toner and my face did not burn quite as much.</li>
            <li>This product got to me really fast and was just want I wanted.</li>
            <li>These products are working very well on my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>She also has eczema,  so walking that line between treating the acne and not irritating</li>
            <li>And now I&#x27;m using it once a day because my face has cleared out so much</li>
            <li>This product truly does work fast.</li>
            <li>but it can be too drying if you use it too much.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I noticed results after just one week, this stuff really does work.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Just three days later my face was acne free and glowing.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend this product, thanks.</li>
            <li>The downside is it really dries out my skin.</li>
            <li>After applying it 2x daily with a cotton swab for a week, the top layer of skin on my fingers was completely stripped.</li>
            <li>I love this product, only thing that helps with my adult acne.</li>
            <li>This product is great and really works, does dry out your skin a little</li>
            <li>I was not too sure of this product when I first received it, but after a few days I started to notice my skin was getting clearer.</li>
            <li>I decided to try out the Clear Proof System and it really works!</li>
            <li>one full spray of Lemon Essential Oil wiped all over, and then moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have suffered with low to mild acne for years.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it works for the lucky people who think they have acne but only get a breakout once a month.</li>
            <li>I would say I have mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>I had to buy this since she was totally sold on it from the very first time she ever tried it.</li>
            <li>This product has significantly reduced my breakouts and I will continue to use it for a long time!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was in junior high again.</li>
            <li>I stopped using the astringent, and It is working a little better.</li>
            <li>But the problem began on day 3, I noticed some new texture to my face.</li>
            <li>Yes, the acne was dying on my face and new ones weren&#x27;t popping up</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell bad, which is a huge plus for me, so I felt good that I would stick with using it.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I only use it once a day, because it dries out my skin with more than 1 use, and my other washes I still use the Timewise cleanser.</li>
            <li>I tried this hoping it would completely clear my face.</li>
            <li>and I already notice how clear my skin looks.</li>
            <li>is clear .  </li>
            <li>My face completely  cleared up in a month.  </li>
            <li>My skin type is oily, but sensitive near my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>My skin cleared up and it helped with stopping acne before it developed.</li>
            <li>We will see what happens, but so far it&#x27;s been clearing up quite a</li>
            <li>I use this for my adult acne.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this system</li>
            <li>This makes my Mary Kay last much longer and keeps my skin from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its is not difficult to use, however be careful when applying.</li>
            <li>NOW what I do is (and this is working amazingly well the last few weeks!!!)</li>
            <li>and I just kept gettin new ones especially in my chin area.</li>
            <li>My face is burned and is VERY ITCHY AND DRY.</li>
            <li>But guys it can be really drying so jus use daily for the 1st or 2nd week..</li>
            <li>I bought this to clear up some minor adult acne and have been using it for 2 months.</li>
            <li>We are going to try Effaclar next and see if that will help clear her skin.</li>
            <li>I will continue to order this since it&#x27;s the only product that has helped with my adult acne.</li>
            <li>which apparently it was because...</li>
            <li>Around my period I do break out with 1-3 pimples but that&#x27;s a huge improvement from the past, so I give Clearproof five stars!</li>
            <li>My coworkers even noticed me breaking out all of the sudden because they knew I had such a clear face when I started to work their.</li>
            <li>After using several days, I saw a major difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li>Really works on acne and dark marks.</li>
            <li>and as I said it did look much clearer and less oily and broke out when she came home</li>
            <li>The cleanser specifies to clean your skin BEFORE you use it, the cleanser is not good at removing makeup at all.  </li>
            <li>It did start to clear my skin however after the third or fourth day my skin became extremely dry.</li>

            <li> He ordered it asap and loves it just as much as me :)</li>
            <li> and I  naturally have very oily skin makes it fairly surprising.</li>
            <li> I have switched to a mild cleanser.... cetaphil... Which has cleared up 90% of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had skin problems since elementary school, and this is the only face stuff that will keep me good.</li>
            <li> If I could go back and give this to my 13 year-old self, I would have been much more confident growing up instead of trying to cover up with a ton of make-</li>
            <li> I love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone with acne,</li>
            <li> First time I used it I thought my face was going to burn off!</li>
            <li> To be fair, I live in Hawaii and had been going to the beach quite frequently at the time I tried this out but considering the fact that I was using the moisturizer</li>
            <li> but I know that after using it at camp for a few days she came home and looked great.</li>
            <li> I use the entire line (including the pore-reducing serum, which is sold separately) and now my skin looks smooth, acne-free, and healthy.</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to review the MaryKay #ClearProof Acne System Compliments of Influenster.com in return for my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> The toner and moisturizer especially are fantastic and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> After I stopped using the MK acne set, I noticed that my acne got much more clear.</li>
            <li> If left on its own I experience breakouts and always have to cleanse and tone.</li>
            <li> I love this system for my adult acne.</li>
            <li> I have had consistent, mild acne since I was 15.</li>
            <li> Should have looked into birth control pills first since hormones are the cause of most adult acne, not hygiene.</li>
            <li> It took a few months (about 4) to really notice changes but I stuck with it and my skin has never been so great.  </li>
            <li> I wrote a very detailed blog review that includes several photos and links.  </li>
            <li> I have very very oily and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This did clear up my acne super quick but then made my face scaly and flakey.</li>
            <li> The first time, I started to use this product, it burned my face.</li>
            <li> I started using this the first night it came in the mail.</li>
            <li> It seemed to have an effect within the first couple of days.</li>
            <li> and I think since she likes it so much that the price was worth it.</li>
            <li> The first review was not as favorable</li>
            <li> but after the 3rd to 5th time,...it felt better...</li>
            <li> If you are interested in this product line I would suggest taking a look at my review.</li>
            <li> Really works !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from drug store products to top of the line products such as Rodan and Fields.</li>
            <li> but I had to for this because it really works!</li>
            <li> First couple of weeks I began to see results.</li>
            <li> but, thanks to some reviews, I was forewarned and made sure to use extra moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Will keep using it and will reduce usage to bare minimum when I fell comfortable to do so.</li>
            <li> On top of that it made my face burn and my skin dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews that people were getting very dry and flaky from this product.</li>
            <li> so I think pretty highly of the product too.</li>
            <li> So I stopped using it for a whole week.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the toner and my face did not burn quite as much.</li>
            <li> This product got to me really fast and was just want I wanted.</li>
            <li> These products are working very well on my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> She also has eczema,  so walking that line between treating the acne and not irritating</li>
            <li> And now I&#x27;m using it once a day because my face has cleared out so much</li>
            <li> This product truly does work fast.</li>
            <li> but it can be too drying if you use it too much.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after just one week, this stuff really does work.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Just three days later my face was acne free and glowing.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend this product, thanks.</li>
            <li> The downside is it really dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> After applying it 2x daily with a cotton swab for a week, the top layer of skin on my fingers was completely stripped.</li>
            <li> I love this product, only thing that helps with my adult acne.</li>
            <li> This product is great and really works, does dry out your skin a little</li>
            <li> I was not too sure of this product when I first received it, but after a few days I started to notice my skin was getting clearer.</li>
            <li> I decided to try out the Clear Proof System and it really works!</li>
            <li> one full spray of Lemon Essential Oil wiped all over, and then moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with low to mild acne for years.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it works for the lucky people who think they have acne but only get a breakout once a month.</li>
            <li> I would say I have mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> I had to buy this since she was totally sold on it from the very first time she ever tried it.</li>
            <li> This product has significantly reduced my breakouts and I will continue to use it for a long time!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was in junior high again.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the astringent, and It is working a little better.</li>
            <li> But the problem began on day 3, I noticed some new texture to my face.</li>
            <li> Yes, the acne was dying on my face and new ones weren&#x27;t popping up</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell bad, which is a huge plus for me, so I felt good that I would stick with using it.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I only use it once a day, because it dries out my skin with more than 1 use, and my other washes I still use the Timewise cleanser.</li>
            <li> I tried this hoping it would completely clear my face.</li>
            <li> and I already notice how clear my skin looks.</li>
            <li> is clear .  </li>
            <li> My face completely  cleared up in a month.  </li>
            <li> My skin type is oily, but sensitive near my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> My skin cleared up and it helped with stopping acne before it developed.</li>
            <li> We will see what happens, but so far it&#x27;s been clearing up quite a</li>
            <li> I use this for my adult acne.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this system</li>
            <li> This makes my Mary Kay last much longer and keeps my skin from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its is not difficult to use, however be careful when applying.</li>
            <li> NOW what I do is (and this is working amazingly well the last few weeks!!!)</li>
            <li> and I just kept gettin new ones especially in my chin area.</li>
            <li> My face is burned and is VERY ITCHY AND DRY.</li>
            <li> But guys it can be really drying so jus use daily for the 1st or 2nd week..</li>
            <li> I bought this to clear up some minor adult acne and have been using it for 2 months.</li>
            <li> We are going to try Effaclar next and see if that will help clear her skin.</li>
            <li> I will continue to order this since it&#x27;s the only product that has helped with my adult acne.</li>
            <li> which apparently it was because...</li>
            <li> Around my period I do break out with 1-3 pimples but that&#x27;s a huge improvement from the past, so I give Clearproof five stars!</li>
            <li> My coworkers even noticed me breaking out all of the sudden because they knew I had such a clear face when I started to work their.</li>
            <li> After using several days, I saw a major difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> Really works on acne and dark marks.</li>
            <li> and as I said it did look much clearer and less oily and broke out when she came home</li>
            <li> The cleanser specifies to clean your skin BEFORE you use it, the cleanser is not good at removing makeup at all.  </li>
            <li> It did start to clear my skin however after the third or fourth day my skin became extremely dry.</li>
            <li> And I think the small bottle of the blemish cream is the one that really improves your face.</li>
            <li> Left my face itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> alright.&lt;br /&gt;hasnt made anything worse but doesnt seem to improve tremendously either.</li>
            <li> and I think ill be acne free.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was pretty desperate to find something that would cure my 36 year old acne because they were really big red mountains all over my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything as far as acne treatment; From prescription topicals, to antibiotics, to even going through a round of Accutane.</li>
            <li> Product failed to clean my face.</li>
            <li> The acne system helped my acne, but after about 3-4 weeks of use, my skin became so dry.</li>
            <li> It does dry her skin out if used on recommended basis and she had oily skin to begin with</li>
            <li> but if you use the moisturizer when it starts to feel dry</li>
            <li> However, I am prone to dry skin</li>
            <li> and I avoid using the toner on the dry areas.</li>
            <li> Selling my 17 year old daughter on a Mary Kay product was hard</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had as bad or as many break outs since I started using this</li>
            <li> After using this Mart Kay clear proof set for about 4-5 months, I noticed a negatively drastic change in my acne.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a few pimples show up here and there while doing this.</li>
            <li> but it can be drying and irritating if I use too much or too</li>
            <li> It did work on my acnes, but it turns out my face too dry, after 2 months of use, half of my acnes recovered, but my skin is peeling off like hell.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> do still get occasional pimples and small breakouts while using this, but that is hormonal...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping as time goes on my dark spots and scares</li>
            <li> in all, I do not recommend the MK clear proof set since it did not work for me and made my acne much much worse.</li>
            <li> And  I don&#x27;t know if this will be helpful, I am dark skinned.</li>
            <li> I started out once a day but have now dropped down to just once</li>
            <li> After using this system for 3 days I noticed a major reduction in the little ugly pimples as much as they are almost unnoticable under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have bought her a few other products before -just over the counter face washes and some toner</li>
            <li> The product did absolutely nothing to aid with my breakout, however it did give me the absolute worst case of dry, flaky skin I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Dramatically reduced the sizes of my pimples in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I tend to use the toner less and less because I feel it doesn&#x27;t help and sometimes develops acne when I use it too often.</li>
            <li> I am black and have tried every acne system out there to no avail.</li>
            <li> And  noticed it is also clearing black spots caused by acne.</li>
            <li> Definitely let the toner completely dry before you apply the benzoyl peroxide cream or it might burn, and that is NOT pleasant!</li>
            <li> and after I had my second child my face has broken out like it never has before.</li>
            <li> A few small tips</li>
            <li> I would have to apply the moisturizer two times after washing my face, just to keep my face from looking dull and overly tight.</li>
            <li> I get compliments everyday!  </li>
            <li> The shipping came as expected 2 day shipping , &amp; I recommend any one who is dealing w/ acne an is tired of</li>
            <li> For the past week, I&#x27;ve been using Rodan and Fields Unblemish.</li>
            <li> but I usually use 2 layers of it because the system can be drying for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this the past 6 months and have seen a drastic change in my skin.</li>
            <li> The real test will be this winter when my acne rosacea flares up and my skin gets angry due to the cold and wind exposure.  </li>
            <li> the eczema is really hard.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it to anyone with big painful zits like me !</li>
            <li> I had whiteheads, nodules, papules and just common acne.</li>
            <li> I have breakouts lately &amp; since i used this set before I know it will always work wonders.</li>
            <li> try to introduce the product to your regimen  slowly for it to adjust..</li>
            <li> It got rid of (dried out) EVERYTHING in a matter of 5 days!!</li>
            <li> My skin looked no better, and it felt worse.</li>
            <li> No better or worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy expensive but a money back guarantee</li>
            <li> It made my acne 10 times worse.</li>
            <li> This product made it worse.</li>
            <li> I had completely broken out from working at McDonalds after 7 months.</li>
            <li> My Boyfriend had worse acne than me an noticed that my skin was clearing up</li>
            <li> boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> My face had red pimples on the sides of my cheeks which looked horrible.</li>
            <li> She has been using it for about 10 days and unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t working for her.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> That helps my skin not get irritated and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have very bad cystic acne all over the lower half of my face and neck all the time.</li>
            <li> I am trying to fix it but don&#x27;t even know what to do because i don&#x27;t want to make matters worse!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was experiencing a fairly bad break out and</li>
            <li> A couple months ago my skin got so bad</li>
            <li> I have had some bad acne growing up.</li>
            <li> It never had gotten so bad before.</li>
            <li> Around September/October I get really bad acne</li>
            <li> My biggest pet peeve about this line is that it does not contain any sunscreen which is bad for my pasty burn-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> Even with makeup , it looked so damn ugly.</li>
            <li> There are some deep-rooted spots that are still on their way out, but my painful zits and whiteheads are</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to go away :(</li>
            <li> I still have very bad breakouts but not as bad as before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I was going through a really terrible 9month spurt of acne.</li>
            <li> my acne was so horrible...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 and have had terrible acne and oily skin since I was about 11 or 12.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Disappointed. I bought this to clear up some minor adult acne and have been using it for 2 months. The toner is quite strong. After applying it 2x daily with a cotton swab for a week, the top layer of skin on my fingers was completely stripped. Left my face itchy and dry. Since using this product I&#x27;ve had numerous cystic pimples(first time ever) that have left my face scarred and puffy. Should have looked into birth control pills first since hormones are the cause of most adult acne, not hygiene. This product does not prevent acne, it only dries out existing acne(and the surrounding skin in the process). Overall, this only exacerbated the problem, not reduced it. Be careful with this one.</li>
            <li> If I could rate this product no stars, I would. It&#x27;s the worst product I have ever used. It made my acne 10 times worse. I&#x27;ve used it for a full month now with no results.    If anyone wants a good product, buy nanocleanse!</li>
            <li> Works great! Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Can some one tell how to use this product please?? The first time, I started to use this product, it burned my face. But I think it&#x27;s because I used it 3 times a day and I have very sensitive skin. So I stopped using it for a whole week. I restarted to use it last week and I haven&#x27;t seen any difference as yet. Maybe I don&#x27;t use it how I suppose to so please someone help me!!!!!</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was pretty desperate to find something that would cure my 36 year old acne because they were really big red mountains all over my face. I&#x27;d been using Mary Kay skin products for years and knew they had good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;So I started using this the first night it came in the mail. It didn&#x27;t smell bad, which is a huge plus for me, so I felt good that I would stick with using it. It seemed to have an effect within the first couple of days. Yes, there is some drying but, thanks to some reviews, I was forewarned and made sure to use extra moisturizer. But the problem began on day 3, I noticed some new texture to my face. Then on day 4 I realized I was getting a rash. Yes, the acne was dying on my face and new ones weren&#x27;t popping up but I also seemed to be allergic to it. So I had to stop using the full system. I still use the spot cream when things show up, and it does help.&lt;br /&gt;But NOW what I do is (and this is working amazingly well the last few weeks!!!) use my Timewise cleanser, followed by a cotton ball soaked in witch hazel and one full spray of Lemon Essential Oil wiped all over, and then moisturizer. This is keeping away the biggest and ugliest acne. I&#x27;ve only had a few pimples show up here and there while doing this.</li>
            <li> It did work on my acnes, but it turns out my face too dry, after 2 months of use, half of my acnes recovered, but my skin is peeling off like hell.</li>
            <li> Products works wonderful on my oily skin</li>
            <li> It works!  Selling my 17 year old daughter on a Mary Kay product was hard but when she heard girls in her soccer team were using it she tried it.  Her skin is now (two months later) flawless.  She no longer needs the medication the doctor provided.</li>
            <li> My favorite face application system.  I have suffered with low to mild acne for years.  This has cleared my acne tremendously!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was experiencing a fairly bad break out and nothing else seemed to work so I thought I&#x27;d break out the big guns. It was between this and Proactiv but I decided on Mary Kay because the reviews led me to believe this would be a bit gentler on my skin....boy, was I wrong. The product did absolutely nothing to aid with my breakout, however it did give me the absolute worst case of dry, flaky skin I have ever had. To be fair, I live in Hawaii and had been going to the beach quite frequently at the time I tried this out but considering the fact that I was using the moisturizer and I  naturally have very oily skin makes it fairly surprising. To add insult to injury, it made my skin smell musty and moldy.</li>
            <li> Dramatically reduced the sizes of my pimples in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Got zero results..Product failed to clean my face.</li>
            <li> For naturally oily skin this is a great product. I haven&#x27;t had as bad or as many break outs since I started using this</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin that is acne prone! I don&#x27;t leave home with out it!</li>
            <li> I see many positive reviews for this system. Maybe it works for the lucky people who think they have acne but only get a breakout once a month. I have very bad cystic acne all over the lower half of my face and neck all the time. This product made it worse. On top of that it made my face burn and my skin dry and flaky. I stopped using the toner and my face did not burn quite as much. I used 3/4 of the bottle then I finally gave up and admitted defeat. My skin looked no better, and it felt worse. It also hurt to physically touch my face.</li>
            <li> This set is amazing! I highly recommend this product to anyone. My skin was cleared in about 3 weeks only using it once a day.. I give it a full 5 stars!</li>
            <li> The stuff thats the 2nd application gave me a chemical burn on my face, but if you bypass using that one, the set is alright.&lt;br /&gt;hasnt made anything worse but doesnt seem to improve tremendously either.</li>
            <li> This product got to me really fast and was just want I wanted.</li>
            <li> It burns my skin it actually made my face peel.</li>
            <li> Great product it got my acne under control</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this. clearing up her acne and scars.</li>
            <li> Amazing ! My face completely  cleared up in a month.  Every week you see progress. I will be purchasing more soon</li>
            <li> This temporarily solved my acne. My skin type is oily, but sensitive near my eyes and mouth. I was going through a really terrible 9month spurt of acne. I had whiteheads, nodules, papules and just common acne. The acne system helped my acne, but after about 3-4 weeks of use, my skin became so dry. I would have to apply the moisturizer two times after washing my face, just to keep my face from looking dull and overly tight. I had to stop using this product and once I did my acne cleared up a bit. I have switched to a mild cleanser.... cetaphil... Which has cleared up 90% of my face.</li>
            <li> My 14 yo has never had any problems with acne until just recently and her forehead began breaking out a bit. Another girl at her camp had this product and shared it with my daughter. She came home and swears she used the product ONE time and her pimples disappeared. I doubt that but I know that after using it at camp for a few days she came home and looked great. I have bought her a few other products before -just over the counter face washes and some toner -but I had to buy this since she was totally sold on it from the very first time she ever tried it. I know she will use it regularly and I think since she likes it so much that the price was worth it. I know she used it the week at camp and as I said it did look much clearer and less oily and broke out when she came home so I think pretty highly of the product too.</li>
            <li> These products are working very well on my daughter&#x27;s skin. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> My daughter has acne issues. I never had that problem, so I have no experience with it. She also has eczema,  so walking that line between treating the acne and not irritating the eczema is really hard. ProActiv worked somewhat on the acne, but really flared the eczema, even with a good lotion. So, we tried this. It works SO well, and yet doesn&#x27;t cause irritation. We will definitely keep buying this.</li>
            <li> The best product for acne ,my nephew ask me to buy it again ,forget about proactive it not wok . I get nothing to give a great review  I do it because it is the true and I&#x27;m a very honest woman .</li>
            <li> I had completely broken out from working at McDonalds after 7 months. My face had red pimples on the sides of my cheeks which looked horrible. Even with makeup , it looked so damn ugly. My coworkers even noticed me breaking out all of the sudden because they knew I had such a clear face when I started to work their. Thus I decided to buy it. And after buying this I do not regret buying this. This is the best acne system ever. I began to see results the 2nd day. I used it 2x a day. And now I&#x27;m using it once a day because my face has cleared out so much and I&#x27;ve only been using it for like a week now since it was delivered last week. This product truly does work fast. I would recommend it to anyone. And for the price, you can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> A couple months ago my skin got so bad I felt like I was in junior high again. After years of use, the MaryKay Timewise 3-in-1 cleanser wasn&#x27;t helping with my acne problems. I decided to try out the Clear Proof System and it really works! My skin cleared up and it helped with stopping acne before it developed. I only use it once a day, because it dries out my skin with more than 1 use, and my other washes I still use the Timewise cleanser. The moisturizer feels light on my face when I use it...I actually prefer it over the Timewise moisturizer. And I think the small bottle of the blemish cream is the one that really improves your face. I tend to use the toner less and less because I feel it doesn&#x27;t help and sometimes develops acne when I use it too often. If what you are doing now is not working, I would suggest giving this system a try.</li>
            <li> This is the second review i do for this product. The first review was not as favorable but I&#x27;d like to take that back. After using this product for about 3 weeks my face is clearer than its ever been in years. I will continue to order this since it&#x27;s the only product that has helped with my adult acne. And trust me I have tried everything.</li>
            <li> Its amaizing the change i my face.</li>
            <li> it does not work on my skin! i&#x27;m the same with my acne ,i use it for a month!!!</li>
            <li> It works well but it can be too drying if you use it too much.  It works great for me if I only use it once per day.</li>
            <li> We have tried numerous products to treat my daughters teen acne. This by far is one of the best! I noticed her face clearing up after one use! It does dry her skin out if used on recommended basis and she had oily skin to begin with but overall it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> This system caused my face to burn and itch and I had to discontinue using it. This same system from Mary Kay&#x27;s official website did not cause those reactions. There should not be a huge difference like that...</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE , LOVE this MK line. It has worked wonders for me. I know it may not work for everyone and my friend who tried it said it burns...it did sting a bit when I 1st started using it but after the 3rd to 5th time,...it felt better...I fought thru the sting becuz my acne was so horrible...I guess I convinced myself that it was just doing its job...which apparently it was because...It got rid of (dried out) EVERYTHING in a matter of 5 days!! I use the entire line (including the pore-reducing serum, which is sold separately) and now my skin looks smooth, acne-free, and healthy. I get compliments everyday!  Never looked better!</li>
            <li> I would say I have mild to moderate acne. I tried this hoping it would completely clear my face. It did start to clear my skin however after the third or fourth day my skin became extremely dry. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this unless you have severe acne. I do still use the spot treatment gel and I love it.</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to review the MaryKay #ClearProof Acne System Compliments of Influenster.com in return for my honest opinion.  I wrote a very detailed blog review that includes several photos and links.  If you are interested in this product line I would suggest taking a look at my review. #Contest  http://mkcpas.blogspot.com/</li>
            <li> this stuff works great-we&#x27;re going to reorder now bcuz these products are the only ones ive found that works....good luck</li>
            <li> I love this product. I bought this set a week ago and I already notice how clear my skin looks. I use it twice a day morning and night. Its is not difficult to use, however be careful when applying. DO NOT apply around your eye area I made that mistake and I woke up with my eyes swollen. I&#x27;m satisfied and hope this product continues to work for me. I am black and have tried every acne system out there to no avail. I&#x27;m hoping as time goes on my dark spots and scares will fade away from using the product.</li>
            <li> Great buy worth the price</li>
            <li> I received this set as a gift from my mom. I&#x27;ve used it now for a month with no results. No better or worse. Womp womp.</li>
            <li> Purchased this set for my daughter.  She has been using it for about 10 days and unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t working for her.  She is not seeing any improvement.  I am so glad that it has worked well for others.  We are going to try Effaclar next and see if that will help clear her skin.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, this works great!</li>
            <li> I only wish the moisturizer had sunscreen in it.  Other than that, this is a great system for people with mild acne problems.  The toner and moisturizer especially are fantastic and my skin has never looked better.  The real test will be this winter when my acne rosacea flares up and my skin gets angry due to the cold and wind exposure.  I got to try the whole system free from Chatterbox and was happy to try it and review it.</li>
            <li> I was not too sure of this product when I first received it, but after a few days I started to notice my skin was getting clearer. After using several days, I saw a major difference in my complexion. My skin was almost acne free and it was a lot smoother. I love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone with acne,</li>
            <li> The shipping came as expected 2 day shipping , &amp; I recommend any one who is dealing w/ acne an is tired of it Use this item Really works ! No lies</li>
            <li> «:::P:::» «:::E:::» «:::R:::» «:::F:::» «:::E:::» «:::C:::» «:::T:::»</li>
            <li> Mary kay works great.  Love it. Thank you</li>
            <li> This product is great and really works, does dry out your skin a little</li>
            <li> This product is great for people, like myself with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I had already tried the kit before, and it has worked the best for my acne. I&#x27;ve had skin problems since elementary school, and this is the only face stuff that will keep me good.</li>
            <li> I have had some bad acne growing up. I started using this because nothing else was working. It works so good! My Boyfriend had worse acne than me an noticed that my skin was clearing up and I told him what I was using. He ordered it asap and loves it just as much as me :)</li>
            <li> Love MK acne system set. I have breakouts lately &amp; since i used this set before I know it will always work wonders. Fast shipping. Ty for the freebie!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews like this but this product RUINED my face. My face is burned and is VERY ITCHY AND DRY. I am trying to fix it but don&#x27;t even know what to do because i don&#x27;t want to make matters worse!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was about 12 and I&#x27;ve tried countless products to battle it. Nothing ever worked so when I started Clearproof I was skeptical. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and I love it. It took a few months (about 4) to really notice changes but I stuck with it and my skin has never been so great.  In the beginning I did have a problem with dryness and burning from the system but after a while my skin adjusted and now I use it twice a day with no problems. Around my period I do break out with 1-3 pimples but that&#x27;s a huge improvement from the past, so I give Clearproof five stars!</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and still suffer from moderate acne. I&#x27;ve tried everything from drug store products to top of the line products such as Rodan and Fields. After using this Mart Kay clear proof set for about 4-5 months, I noticed a negatively drastic change in my acne. It never had gotten so bad before. It turned from being moderate to severe at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was about a year ago. After I stopped using the MK acne set, I noticed that my acne got much more clear. There weren&#x27;t welts and sores on my face anymore, yet I still had some noticeable scars and blemishes. For the past week, I&#x27;ve been using Rodan and Fields Unblemish. It&#x27;s crazy expensive but a money back guarantee so I decided to try it. We will see what happens, but so far it&#x27;s been clearing up quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I do not recommend the MK clear proof set since it did not work for me and made my acne much much worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 and have had terrible acne and oily skin since I was about 11 or 12. I&#x27;ve tried Proactive and what seems like every drugstore product but nothing has worked for me. My mom bought this system for me about 3 months ago and I haven&#x27;t had one breakout since! I literally can&#x27;t believe the change in my skin. It is a tad bit drying but if you use the moisturizer when it starts to feel dry it&#x27;s completely fine! If I could go back and give this to my 13 year-old self, I would have been much more confident growing up instead of trying to cover up with a ton of make-up.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I never write reviews for stuff but I had to for this because it really works! It&#x27;s been a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> My daughter says this is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this product, only thing that helps with my adult acne.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mary Kay products for years.  I use this for my adult acne. Works great. I buy it for my sons I must stress that it really is important to keep your hands off your face. Don&#x27;t pick or touch acne and I believe you will see better faster results. I think this is a great product.  Kissed ships promptly. Great service. You are my go to for this product.</li>
            <li> First couple of weeks I began to see results. But I started to break out again. I&#x27;m trying to eat healthier and drink a lot of water along with washing my face twice a day with this product but it doesn&#x27;t seem to go away :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for over 6 months and I am very pleased, I have tried tons and tons of products and I&#x27;m definitely reordering soon,.</li>
            <li> The best acne cleanser etc on the market .  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have seen results in jus 2 days!! Am so excited and can&#x27;t wait to see the result of my skin after one week! It practically cleared up my cystic acne! But guys it can be really drying so jus use daily for the 1st or 2nd week.. try to introduce the product to your regimen  slowly for it to adjust.. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I love it !! would I buy this product again ? YES !! Around September/October I get really bad acne and I have not had any breakouts.face is clear .  Follow the instructions</li>
            <li> This did clear up my acne super quick but then made my face scaly and flakey.</li>
            <li> I got this originally as a gift from my sister in law (a mary kay rep).  I have big, red cystic acne.  1 pimple stays on my face for literally 8 weeks or more.  I noticed results after just one week, this stuff really does work.  A few small tips though-make sure you follow the insturctions.  The cleanser specifies to clean your skin BEFORE you use it, the cleanser is not good at removing makeup at all.  Definitely let the toner completely dry before you apply the benzoyl peroxide cream or it might burn, and that is NOT pleasant! First time I used it I thought my face was going to burn off! since the products can irritate my skin I only use just enough benzoyl peroxide cream to cover the skin and I just skim it over the top and let it absorb on its own, I don&#x27;t rub it in.  That helps my skin not get irritated and uncomfortable. I love the moisturizer but I usually use 2 layers of it because the system can be drying for my skin.  My biggest pet peeve about this line is that it does not contain any sunscreen which is bad for my pasty burn-prone skin.  Overall I really like this system but it can be drying and irritating if I use too much or too often-still totally worth a try though my skin is really looking a LOT better!  Definitely recommend it to anyone with big painful zits like me !</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Works great for my 15 year old daughter.  Very happy with the product. would buy again. She likes the gel</li>
            <li> I have had consistent, mild acne since I was 15. I started using this product in November (about a week before Thanksgiving). It is now the end of January (so about 2 months?) and my face has almost entirely cleared of acne. There are some deep-rooted spots that are still on their way out, but my painful zits and whiteheads are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I tried proactive it just didn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job but this sure does !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything as far as acne treatment; From prescription topicals, to antibiotics, to even going through a round of Accutane. Let me tell you, this stuff is AMAZING. If you are faithful with using it twice a day, you WILL see results. I&#x27;ve been using this the past 6 months and have seen a drastic change in my skin. If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, give it a chance!</li>
            <li> This products work well on my skin, but it is hurt. All of my acne is gone, and I don&#x27;t regret buying this stuff. Thank you</li>
            <li> This product works better than anything else that I have used. I plan to continue using this product, and would recommend it to anyone with acne problems.</li>
            <li> Bought and used this acne medication. Just three days later my face was acne free and glowing. I have very very oily and acne prone skin. If left on its own I experience breakouts and always have to cleanse and tone. Will keep using it and will reduce usage to bare minimum when I fell comfortable to do so. I have already stocked up so I don&#x27;t break this journey. And  noticed it is also clearing black spots caused by acne. Awesome product . And  I don&#x27;t know if this will be helpful, I am dark skinned.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. I still have very bad breakouts but not as bad as before. I stopped using the astringent, and It is working a little better. The lotion is good though for oily skin though. It is the best lotion I have found for my skin.</li>
            <li> Got this for all my three teenage kids that have acne.  Works very well.  I do recommend this product, thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this system for my adult acne. I read many reviews that people were getting very dry and flaky from this product. To keep from over - drying, I use this system only at night before bed. In the mornings, I use Cetaphil Daily Face Wash and Cetaphil lotion with SPF. This makes my Mary Kay last much longer and keeps my skin from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;I do still get occasional pimples and small breakouts while using this, but that is hormonal...no face wash can balance tour hormones. This product has significantly reduced my breakouts and I will continue to use it for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;My teenaged daughter also uses the products and loves them!</li>
            <li> Great product!! Really works on acne and dark marks.</li>
            <li> Wow this works great! I am 28 and after I had my second child my face has broken out like it never has before. I tried diffrent washes and mositurizers and I just kept gettin new ones especially in my chin area. They hurt and looked terrible. After using this system for 3 days I noticed a major reduction in the little ugly pimples as much as they are almost unnoticable under my makeup. Just a couple more days and I think ill be acne free. Yay! Plus i have always loved Mary Kay products to thats a huge plus.</li>
            <li> The item was shipped very quickly. I have been using it for about a week now and I am seeing an improvement. The downside is it really dries out my skin. However, I am prone to dry skin so I did expect it. I started out once a day but have now dropped down to just once and I avoid using the toner on the dry areas.</li>
