    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this soap, as I have very sensitive skin.  I added a water filter to the shower to cut chemicals and with a history of cystic acne, I switched from sulphur soap to this one.  Actually, sulphur soap and cream worked better.  Even though the water was hot, I did not feel the clean that I get from the sulphur soap.&lt;br /&gt;I did get an idea from a review to try neem soap, but first will try the black soap from Africa.</li>
            <li> cleared up rash on toddler</li>
            <li> The soap is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave a film.  I have sensitive skin and am able to use it on my face without breaking out.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE this product. It is a very good deal on the whole pack. Just wish the actual soap bars were at least as big as dial soap bars. (PS) I DID NOT pay $57 for it. It was on sale for $16-$17.</li>
            <li> This soap is okay. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be glycerine based though. The upside is that it was a multi-pack and had a great price.</li>
            <li> Great soap bar. It will help kill any bacteria in armpits causing odor.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  Arrived before promised date.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for your skin. I&#x27;ve tried many other soaps with tea tree oil, but this is the best so far. Clears up my skin and leaves it soft and smooth, not tight and dry.</li>
            <li> I have occasional problems with Hidradentitis Suppurativa as a result of taking Testosterone hormone replacement therapy. Especially if I don&#x27;t watch what I eat that aggravates occurrences. No chocolate or caffeinated beverages - it&#x27;s like Acne. I had been looking for products that would help treat it, and learned inadvertently that a craft Clove Oil soap that I had been using for years helped. But, since I also knew that Tea Tree Oil was an effective topical antiseptic, I looked for and found this product. I&#x27;ve been impressed with how much better it controls and helps heal my skin condition. But I&#x27;m been even more impressed with how it makes my skin feel. It&#x27;s naturally more moist. Rough knee and elbow skin, and the occasional irritable under arm reactions I&#x27;ve had using mild deodorants are gone. It smells nice as well. I have no basis of comparison with similar products, but I intend to continue using this soap for as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Smells great and each bar thoroughly wrapped.  Bars are quite small but perfect size if using on your face.</li>
            <li> I usually have problem adult acne but this soap is keeping it at bay. It is not too harsh and definitely cleans well.</li>
            <li> Clear up my acne but not 100% , smell is very strong but not an issue for me. Love the pure ingredients used and the suds more lather than expected. All in all good stuff</li>
            <li> Its OK but will not buy again. But maybe a different scent</li>
            <li> Came in fast and works great</li>
            <li> My husband says he loves this soap..smells wonderful and leaves you feeling really clean without dry.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and arrived in time with no issues.</li>
            <li> Great soap...a big fan of tea tree anything.</li>
            <li> soap was expired when i received it....</li>
