    <ol>
            <li>, she did not have any reaction, and best of all no sunburn.  </li>
            <li>and this is the best.</li>
            <li>I must say this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li>My baby has eczema this one worked perfect on her skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m please with this product. :D</li>
            <li>This product smoothes my skin wonderfully and my skin tone evens out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>After reading great reviews, I ante&#x27;d up for this.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s skin reacts to a lot of sunscreens with rash, but this one works great.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a mineral sunscreen that had good reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is fairly sweat and water resistant.  </li>
            <li>It has, however, done a good job protecting her skin from the sun.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it&#x27;s great for me.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love to use your mustela</li>
            <li>It is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>And - important for kids - it does NOT BURN EYES!  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It is safe for baby, dos not stain clothes and protects him from getting sunburned.</li>
            <li>I love mustela products all together</li>
            <li>His pediatrician gave the all-clear to use this on him and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>It works great and has high ratings from EWG (Environmental Working Group).  </li>
            <li>My daughter is VERY fair skinned and has super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>it was easy to see where i applied it</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, has not caused any break outs, and kept her from any sunburn/tan.  </li>
            <li>With a reapplication after a couple of hours, a lot of time in the sand, and surf, our fair skinned daughter is barely sun-kissed and loving her first time on the beach.</li>
            <li>so I thought it would be good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this one, knock on wood, so far I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>Worth EVERY cent!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff so much!  </li>
            <li>Among many brans we tried, this mustela sun cream is the best in not harming my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skins especially for high protection rate of SPF 50.</li>
            <li>Amazing and old school.  </li>
            <li>I think the product is good, but the service life was too short.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>so i assumed this would be great and was little worried about the price, but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I used up 1.5 tubes during the summer and consider it well worth it.</li>
            <li>I recognize this is a good healthy product, but it definitely leaves a white film wherever you use it</li>
            <li>I think normal cheap sunscreen sold in local mart would be fine for most of people living in the states.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and is only sticky like all others for a minute then smooth and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>This is great for my kids as they usually spend 1</li>
            <li>We just got back from a week at the beach with everyday use and his skin is perfect.  </li>
            <li>When I can&#x27;t squeeze any more lotion out of the container, I cut off the top of it and get several more applications from it...not a drop is wasted.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m still using the baby wash and lotion on my four year old twins because they take such good care of their skin and have a long lasting great smell.  </li>
            <li>I think it worth it to keep my little man comfortable :-)</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I have been using all summer long.  </li>
            <li>than that I am satisfied with it and would like to order it again next summer.</li>
            <li>Water was rolling off much more than with regular sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and if it&#x27;s not enough, add more.</li>
            <li>It was good but really heavy.</li>
            <li>If that makes it effective, I don&#x27;t know, but as an adult with medium complexion skin, this looked too white.</li>
            <li>Like every Mustella brand product, it&#x27;s high quality for your baby, worth the price.</li>
            <li>My kids have super sensitive skin and this did not cause any rash or breakouts.</li>
            <li>he is fine, if I use anything else, he either comes with red spots (rash?) or a sunburn...</li>
            <li>When I tried pure and free by Neutrogena, his whole face turned red and itchy.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and get sunburn and heat rash and swelling all together if I went under the sun (with other SPF 45+ product on) for more than 30 min.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I think some people might put on too much.</li>
            <li>The Coppertone product is much, much cheaper and easier to find, so we will not buy the Mustela again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I took my 3-month-old camping at the beach and was very concerned about him getting sunburned.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle and he had no reaction to it.</li>
            <li>This is thick, perfect for little noses cheeks and shoulders.</li>
            <li>We keep searching the sunscreen as mild as possible and tried almost every kinds of brands, banana</li>
            <li>We just had a quick rinse after swimmming but did not have a soapy bath later on during the day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It is also highly rated by EWG.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item because of its high safety for infants.  </li>
            <li>(My daughter often forgets to tell us that her teacher at daycare applied the cream on her), it normally doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt her skin.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen has kept our 15 month old toddler safe while we are spending a few hours a day on the beach in NJ.</li>
            <li>However, we have a daughter whose skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>My baby has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My two daughters have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>We bought this sunscreen based on other reviews here and are not disappointed.</li>
            <li>One time purchase only although I love other Mustela products.</li>
            <li>We tried to use the shade most of the time and go late or early in the day but still used this quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I teach swimming outdoors in the hot Florida sun all day long in the summertime.</li>
            <li>Used this on my 9 mos old during a trip to hawaii...</li>
            <li>I do buy the sensitive skin one for his face though.</li>
            <li>A close second place is the California Baby sunscreen, and we often get that one at Whole Foods or Sunflower.</li>
            <li>Not not at all but almost no harm to my daughter&#x27;s quite sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My son has really sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed for my 2 year old daughter and me too.  </li>
            <li>Our children have never been burned, understanding that we don&#x27;t take them outside during high sun (10 am-2</li>
            <li>find it difficult to recommend at this price, because we have found Coppertone Water Babies Pure &amp; Simple to be just as effective.  </li>
            <li>and moreover we need to apply suncream pretty thick in order to protect the skins from hot sun for longer period of time.</li>
            <li>I would not buy it again because the lotion is too thick to easily apply without aggravating my baby.  </li>
            <li>major</li>
            <li>In the extremely hot weather of Texas, a sunscreen must carry item especially for the parents who have a kids like to go outside regardless of the temperature and UV rate outside.</li>
            <li>My baby has very sensitive skin and seemed to get rashes that come and go for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li>So far this is the only sunscreen that works for him.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan os Mustela products and this one has not disappointed me as usual.</li>
            <li>Hard to clean off .</li>
            <li>are/ were outside almost everyday in the summer swimming and this tube lasted me the whole summer!  </li>
            <li>However, how much do you need to put on a tiny infant who weighs less than 14 lbs?</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona with two active kids</li>

            <li> are/ were outside almost everyday in the summer swimming and this tube lasted me the whole summer!  </li>
            <li> However, how much do you need to put on a tiny infant who weighs less than 14 lbs?</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona with two active kids</li>
            <li> I even use this as my makeup base instead of my normal one because it works better!</li>
            <li> Their face would have white spots from being too long in the sun.</li>
            <li> Actually I not only use it for my kids, I use it in my neck/chest area and arms if I am planning to stay out long as this sunscreen truly blocks the rays for hours.</li>
            <li> Little guy has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Thinking her skin was irritating and sometimes have some reddish spots with other sunscreens even though we tried to wash the cream off as much as we can, this mustela cream sometimes left overnight without completely washed off</li>
            <li> It may leave a slight white film but remember that this is a physical blocker.</li>
            <li> expensive, but worth the peace of mind!</li>
            <li> So I guess the product was invertory for a long time!</li>
            <li> single.</li>
            <li> The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is pricey for such a small amount.  </li>
            <li> You can always remove this white film by just rubbing a little.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin a little white, so you can tell if you put it on.</li>
            <li> It takes a little extra rubbing to get it in, but once it&#x27;s in the skin, it doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> No rashes and absolutely no sunburn....</li>
            <li> No clogged pores, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This cream is pretty expensive in price and that&#x27;s why it lost one star but other</li>
            <li> My son has bad reactions (red, dry, bumpy, itchy skin) to every sunblock I have tried, this is the first one ever that I can use on him and he has no reaction.  </li>
            <li> With two very active children, we use a lot of this.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention its thick and sticky feeling all day long.</li>
            <li> I always put on a little</li>
            <li> a little white-ish.  </li>
            <li> the only problem is the price, and it is very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I was so worried about my pale little dude.</li>
            <li> My kids always get uneven tan on their face (forgot the name of dermatologist term)</li>
            <li> Apply only a thin layer on their face.</li>
            <li> I tried Aveeno baby, and Coopertone baby; both left her burnt and broken out with rash.  </li>
            <li> It is small, like extremely small, however a little does go a long way, plus this cream is thick!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of money for a small tube.  </li>

            <li> I teach swimming outdoors in the hot Florida sun all day long in the summertime. I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for several years now and have never burned. It was the only sunscreen that did not run in my eyes or burn my face when I reapplied it. I wear sun protective shirts and tights so that I only have to apply it to my face, hands, and feet. When I can&#x27;t squeeze any more lotion out of the container, I cut off the top of it and get several more applications from it...not a drop is wasted. Cannot recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> My kids always get uneven tan on their face (forgot the name of dermatologist term) Their face would have white spots from being too long in the sun. Mustela has solved this problem. Apply only a thin layer on their face.</li>
            <li> We used this on our infant daughter while in FL for vacation this summer.  I liked it so much that I have been using all summer long.  It goes on smooth, has not caused any break outs, and kept her from any sunburn/tan.  I will continue to use the lotion- its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love to use your mustela it was agreat choice for my body, I recmend every women to use it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re in year seven of using this product.  It is phenomenal.  It goes on feeling thick.  Leaves your skin white - and stays on all day.  Sweat, pool, ocean - you name it - it stays on!  BUT, you could use it on Mercury and come home that night without a hint of sunburn.  Amazing and old school.  We will buy it forever.  And - important for kids - it does NOT BURN EYES!  One tube lasts forever, too.</li>
            <li> We bought this sunscreen based on other reviews here and are not disappointed. The sunscreen has kept our 15 month old toddler safe while we are spending a few hours a day on the beach in NJ. With a reapplication after a couple of hours, a lot of time in the sand, and surf, our fair skinned daughter is barely sun-kissed and loving her first time on the beach. Only wish it came in larger quantity than 1.67 oz.</li>
            <li> It stays for hours, it doesn&#x27;t trigger any rashes, it truly protects.&lt;br /&gt;When I send my child to school with this sunblock he is fine, if I use anything else, he either comes with red spots (rash?) or a sunburn... SO this is it, we are sticking with Mustela from now on. Actually I not only use it for my kids, I use it in my neck/chest area and arms if I am planning to stay out long as this sunscreen truly blocks the rays for hours. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Used this on my 9 mos old during a trip to hawaii...it was easy to see where i applied it, she did not have any reaction, and best of all no sunburn.  Saw my husband sneaking in some at the end of the trip.  he used the waterbabies i initially bought for my daughter and burned, but no issues with mustela.  expensive, but worth the peace of mind!</li>
            <li> We are from Washington so we are very very white. I was so worried about my pale little dude. We use all the Mustela products on him daily so i assumed this would be great and was little worried about the price, but it is worth every penny. Goes on smooth and is only sticky like all others for a minute then smooth and clean smelling. Little guy has very sensitive skin and this does not in any way bother any part of him. I do buy the sensitive skin one for his face though. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona with two active kids and I have tried every. single. sunscreen. for kids and this is the best. It doesn&#x27;t stink, it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it doesn&#x27;t wear off, doesn&#x27;t itch or give them a rash and it doesn&#x27;t make their skin feel icky. the only problem is the price, and it is very hard to find in stores. A close second place is the California Baby sunscreen, and we often get that one at Whole Foods or Sunflower.</li>
            <li> Like every Mustella brand product, it&#x27;s high quality for your baby, worth the price. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy layer on your baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan os Mustela products and this one has not disappointed me as usual. It is safe for baby, dos not stain clothes and protects him from getting sunburned. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> We recently just got back from vacation in the Dominican Republic and I had taken this sunscreen along for the trip. I must say this is the best one yet. My kids have super sensitive skin and this did not cause any rash or breakouts. When the kids went into the water, the sunscreen didn&#x27;t run into their eyes, so no tears&#x3D;major plus! And it wasn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> In the extremely hot weather of Texas, a sunscreen must carry item especially for the parents who have a kids like to go outside regardless of the temperature and UV rate outside. I think normal cheap sunscreen sold in local mart would be fine for most of people living in the states. However, we have a daughter whose skin is very sensitive and moreover we need to apply suncream pretty thick in order to protect the skins from hot sun for longer period of time. We keep searching the sunscreen as mild as possible and tried almost every kinds of brands, banana ***, california baby, cooperton, and etc. Among many brans we tried, this mustela sun cream is the best in not harming my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skins especially for high protection rate of SPF 50. Thinking her skin was irritating and sometimes have some reddish spots with other sunscreens even though we tried to wash the cream off as much as we can, this mustela cream sometimes left overnight without completely washed off (My daughter often forgets to tell us that her teacher at daycare applied the cream on her), it normally doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt her skin. Not not at all but almost no harm to my daughter&#x27;s quite sensitive skin. This cream is pretty expensive in price and that&#x27;s why it lost one star but other than that I am satisfied with it and would like to order it again next summer.</li>
            <li> My baby has very sensitive skin. So far this is the only sunscreen that works for him. When I tried pure and free by Neutrogena, his whole face turned red and itchy. I also use this sunscreen on my face. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> My son has really sensitive skin.  This product is great.  He does not break out and he has never gotten a burn while wearing it.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is pricey for such a small amount.  I think it worth it to keep my little man comfortable :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for baby so I thought it would be good for my sensitive skin. It was good but really heavy. Hard to clean off .</li>
            <li> My baby has very sensitive skin and seemed to get rashes that come and go for no apparent reason. I had not tried the regular sunscreen for her, but I did not want to see whether the regular stuff was going to give her a rash or not. We are in Central Texas and she was out at the pool almost every day this summer. We tried to use the shade most of the time and go late or early in the day but still used this quite a bit. The stuff goes on well. It may leave a slight white film but remember that this is a physical blocker. You can always remove this white film by just rubbing a little. The sunscreen seems to &#x27;waterproof&#x27; the skin. Water was rolling off much more than with regular sunscreen. I have used this product throughout the summer and often left the sunscreen on her after swimming. We just had a quick rinse after swimmming but did not have a soapy bath later on during the day. The sunscreen never caused a rash, iritation or dripped into her eyes. She does have a tan now but never got even close to having the slightest redness in her skin. Yes, the stuff is fairly expensive. However, how much do you need to put on a tiny infant who weighs less than 14 lbs? People do not think twice about expensive outfits that kiddo will only wear once but consider this too expensive. I used up 1.5 tubes during the summer and consider it well worth it. Compare it two other physical blockers and see that the ingredients of the minerals in this product are higher than of other cheaper products, so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed! My baby has eczema this one worked perfect on her skin.</li>
            <li> I am grateful for this product. My two daughters have very sensitive skin and this is the ONLY thing that would not irritate the skin and would provide sufficient protection.</li>
            <li> This subscreen is too heavy to spread and shows very &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;. One time purchase only although I love other Mustela products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since last summer. This is great for my kids as they usually spend 1+ hour outdoor each day. More importantly, it&#x27;s great for me. I have super sensitive skin and get sunburn and heat rash and swelling all together if I went under the sun (with other SPF 45+ product on) for more than 30 min. Since I started using this one, knock on wood, so far I&#x27;m good. It makes your skin a little white, so you can tell if you put it on. But doesn&#x27;t make you ungly or oily. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mineral sunscreen that had good reviews on Amazon. Although some people think the product is too oily or greasy, I thought I would try it anyway. I really like it. It takes a little extra rubbing to get it in, but once it&#x27;s in the skin, it doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy. I think some people might put on too much. I always put on a little and if it&#x27;s not enough, add more. I&#x27;m please with this product. :D</li>
            <li> My daughter is VERY fair skinned and has super sensitive skin.  I tried Aveeno baby, and Coopertone baby; both left her burnt and broken out with rash.  After reading great reviews, I ante&#x27;d up for this.  Worth EVERY cent!  My kids are/ were outside almost everyday in the summer swimming and this tube lasted me the whole summer!  It is small, like extremely small, however a little does go a long way, plus this cream is thick!  Love it!  No rashes and absolutely no sunburn....actually not even a tan!  Love this stuff so much!  Will def purchase again!</li>
            <li> We use a lot of sunblock in our house.  With two very active children, we use a lot of this.  It works great and has high ratings from EWG (Environmental Working Group).  Because it is mineral based it will leave you skin a little white-ish.  It is fairly sweat and water resistant.  Our children have never been burned, understanding that we don&#x27;t take them outside during high sun (10 am-2 pm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it difficult to recommend at this price, because we have found Coppertone Water Babies Pure &amp; Simple to be just as effective.  It is mineral based and doesn&#x27;t have some of the nasty chemicals as almost all other sunblocks.  It is also highly rated by EWG.  The Coppertone product is much, much cheaper and easier to find, so we will not buy the Mustela again.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my 2 year old daughter and me too.  Just remember that it remains white after you apply.</li>
            <li> This is thick, perfect for little noses cheeks and shoulders. I also use it when we are at the park etc...</li>
            <li> I recognize this is a good healthy product, but it definitely leaves a white film wherever you use it that&#x27;s somewhat difficult to remove. If that makes it effective, I don&#x27;t know, but as an adult with medium complexion skin, this looked too white. Not to mention its thick and sticky feeling all day long.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because of its high safety for infants.  It&#x27;s a lot of money for a small tube.  I would not buy it again because the lotion is too thick to easily apply without aggravating my baby.  It doesn&#x27;t rub in well and leaves white residue on her skin.  It has, however, done a good job protecting her skin from the sun.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s skin reacts to a lot of sunscreens with rash, but this one works great.  She&#x27;s been taking swimming classes outdoors and used this for a couple of weeks without problem.</li>
            <li> My son has bad reactions (red, dry, bumpy, itchy skin) to every sunblock I have tried, this is the first one ever that I can use on him and he has no reaction.  We just got back from a week at the beach with everyday use and his skin is perfect.  I have tried other very expensive mineral based sunblocks as well, not just the standard brands.  I love mustela products all together, I&#x27;m still using the baby wash and lotion on my four year old twins because they take such good care of their skin and have a long lasting great smell.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I boought it last summer in JUNE, and last winter, I found that it was out of the date! I think the product is good, but the service life was too short. So I guess the product was invertory for a long time!</li>
            <li> I took my 3-month-old camping at the beach and was very concerned about him getting sunburned. I got him a sunsuit, a hat, and kept him in the shade. I still wanted to put sunscreen on him just in case, but sunscreen is not recommended for children under 6 months. His pediatrician gave the all-clear to use this on him and it is fantastic! It is so gentle and he had no reaction to it. A bit pricey, yes, but we still have so much left and I lathered him up several times 3 days in a row. Love this!</li>
            <li> This product smoothes my skin wonderfully and my skin tone evens out. No clogged pores, and a little goes a long way. I even use this as my makeup base instead of my normal one because it works better!</li>
