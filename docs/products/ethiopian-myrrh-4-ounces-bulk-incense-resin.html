            <li>Smells great!!  </li>
            <li>It was beyond my greatest expectations.</li>
            <li>If you go to a pine tree and pick off the flacks of the pine tree and spray a gloss on it to make it shiny is the perfect description.  </li>
            <li>Took forever to get to my house but this has to be the best myrrh I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>

            <li>Very potent!  </li>
            <li>I am still searching for the smell that I experienced as an altar boy years ago.  </li>
            <li>Great price for the amount received.</li>
            <li>This is a great gift to order at Christmas time if you want to see what Myrrh is and also great for church plays.</li>
            <li>LoL....</li>
            <li>LoL....</li>
            <li>Wonderful product and fabulous service!</li>
            <li>Not even for the good products ive got off of Amazon</li>
            <li>It comes smelling so good even before it is lit.</li>
            <li>But still a good purchase.</li>
            <li>consisted mostly of wood trash!</li>
            <li>Not as seen in this Picture and more bark then anything!</li>
            <li>It burns well and makes the house smell amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is long-burning and a nice size.</li>
            <li>I have to say, the fragrance is nice.</li>
            <li>This myrrh is really nice quality.</li>
            <li>It was divided and given as &amp;#34;gifts&amp;#34; to a number of appreciative people.  </li>
            <li>If anyone can point me in a better direction I&#x27;d be appreciative.</li>
            <li>what it was.&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked to have some more info about it.</li>
            <li>There was more in the package than I was thinking there would be so that was nice.</li>
            <li>I really love the smell of this Ethiopian Incense Resin keeps your home with a nice smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m fairly certain this was not that great in quality.  </li>
            <li>Looks really authentic.</li>
            <li>You could do better, but will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li>smells great, way too much bark.  </li>
            <li>I will definately buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought incense from Tom&#x27;s for use in church and have always been pleased.</li>
            <li>mostly tree bark.</li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>Most everyone knows the Christ child received gold, frankincense and myrrh from the magi, but who has seen this stuff?</li>
            <li>Curiosity now satisfied.</li>
            <li>If you dont mind grinding it all so you can weed out the 2-plus ounces of tree bark, then this might be ok for you.  </li>
            <li>If you go into it knowing others charge way more than 1 dollar per ounce (based on 4 ounces for 4 dollars), then you can see in the end what your dollars are paying for.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok myrrh, in bulk so the sizes of the myrrh will vary.</li>
            <li>Maybe more woody</li>
            <li>more accurate would be 1.5 ounces of myrrh.  </li>
            <li>so fine is like fine sand...</li>
            <li>and it was fine</li>
            <li>I cannot get it to light.</li>
            <li>and thankfully it was cheap</li>
            <li>but I only experienced powdered and grinded bark in my bag.  </li>
            <li>Very Fast &amp; Secure Shipping!</li>
            <li>The small amount of Myrrh gum that was there was of excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Because there are many people with respiratory issues, we have not burnt any as incense, but we do get many compliments at the holidays, since many people have never seen myrrh and it is a conversation starter to realize that this is the same stuff that is spoken of in the Bible.</li>
            <li>Does not remotely look as good as that harvest in the picture where you can see all of it is nuggets of resin</li>
            <li>For friends gift bags I mix the crushed myrrh and frankincense together for them... to make sure good</li>
            <li>this product was a FULL .4 oz UNDERWEIGHT.  </li>
            <li>the &#x27;sweet myrrh.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>the &#x27;sweet myrrh.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>I enjoy burning frankensence and myrrh over the holidays, this was just the right amount</li>
            <li>The stuff smokes copiously, enough to set the smoke detectors off in your house if you put too large a piece on the charcoal...and given that I have 18&#x27; ceilings in the great room</li>
            <li>While the aroma is mild and woodsy, it is probably the lowest grade stuff they could sell and still call it myrrh.  </li>
            <li>After i ordered other myrrh from another Amazon.com seller, this is by far the greatest quality.</li>
            <li>It is not unpleasant, just not what I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>It is nice smelling and it looks very similar to the picture</li>
            <li>Worth trying once.  </li>
            <li>and then everyone gets one complimentary nickle sized one, too; I guess...)</li>
            <li>The resin I hunted for actually seems quite nice.  </li>
            <li>.... 4 bucks is probably worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The resin I hunted for actually seems quite nice.  </li>
            <li>.... 4 bucks is probably worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said I have purchased a lot of other resins from this seller and they are all  good.  </li>
            <li>the shards attached to smaller pieces of wood/bark I grinded down as best I could, and it became a bark/resin inscense.  </li>
            <li>most definitely purchase again worth the wait</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the best Myrrh, it burns hot, has a definite smoky aroma, and seems less pure</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My first thought was someone sold me a bag of crap.....literally.  </li>
            <li>I think they might work better if mixed with some fast start charcoal.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong oder that I&#x27;m trying to match up with the incense that are burned in the catholic church</li>
            <li>This incense burn very well for a resin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this Myrrh highly!</li>
            <li>it will make your resin sparkle, making it MUCH easier to start recognizing difference between wood and resin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>then I&#x27;d expect but otherwise seems to be the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Placing the resin on a burning charcoal tablet produced the light fragrance expected, but with a noticeable woody smell and a bit more smoke than expected.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to do a quick experiment and try to separate the resin from the plant matter and find the actual percentage of bark to resin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in search for a high quality myrrh.</li>
            <li>Not much to burn, looks like fine sand</li>
            <li>and if you know you are buying really only 1.5 worth of resin</li>
            <li>and if you know you are buying really only 1.5 worth of resin</li>
            <li>It is a small bag full of very large chunks.</li>
            <li>First, the only reason it gets one star is because ZERO is not an option!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>stay clear of this stuff .</li>
            <li>So as far as I know this is really the only one you should avoid from this store/seller.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;4 ounces\\&quot; of incense I received was about 2 tenths of an ounce under weight even when including the packaging, and the resin contained a considerable amount of bark and wood fragments.</li>
            <li>I was surprised the item was not labeled.  </li>
            <li>Once all my resin was crushed (the resin itself was fresh....</li>
            <li>Pure myrrh is a light to dark amber colored semi-translucent resin that turns a bit white on the outside with age.  </li>
            <li>and it was not half powder like some I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is just an extremely low grade myrrh and all the actual resin has been sorted out into higher grades after the collection process.  </li>
            <li>Until this month I had only ever bought a type that was a light to medium brown color with about 30% being slightly opaque and almost none looked like bark flakes.  </li>
            <li>I do this because it is so wet and sticky, and VERY potent, that I can only burn small amounts at a time.  </li>
            <li>Either way there is little that is worth heating up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and product was as expected.</li>
            <li>A lot of the chunks were flat, some as large as my thumb, with bits of bark on one side and sand on the other.  </li>
            <li>almost all of mine was very sticky and gummy), what was left over was probably less than 2 ounces.</li>
            <li>you dont mind &#x27;cracking out&#x27; long enough to pick the 1.5 ounces (an estimate based on how much final product visually filled a 4 oz jar) of tears with tweezers (they are very small based on what I got / pebble size.... big ones would have been pea sized....</li>
            <li>I am not too upset at how little I got of actual resin tears, because it really does just take a itsy bitsy pinch of this stuff.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is not true myrrh or is just of low quality, but as other reviewers have commented, there are some sticks and highly resinated wood chips, as well as grains of resin in various sizes.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to know if it is really ethopian or not</li>
            <li> so I really had to think hard to match it up to one of the orders I placed.  </li>
            <li> Although my review is negative, I feel the product is a reasonable value and no attempt was made to contact the seller.</li>
            <li> In any incense mixture for spiritual purposes, myrrh acts to promote the manifestation of the forces attracted by the other incense blends.</li>
            <li> The rest was mostly a mixture of sand, grit and bark held together with resin...which is obviously the secondary sap gathered from scrapings that fell around the base of the trees after the pure resin had been harvested.  </li>
            <li> It was no different than nut shells wearing down...</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it a single star particle!</li>
            <li> The (less than) 4 oz package I received contained about a half dozen small, pure crystals.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Granted, there were a few resin-type chunks mixed in</li>
            <li> The product was as expected.  </li>
            <li> The product is not strongly scented and has what appears to be bark mixed in it.</li>
            <li> I did have a few sticks and small stones it the mix, but hey, it is a natural sap resin product.</li>
            <li> It contained a bunch of bark and other debris.  </li>
            <li> Other folks said there was gravel, sand, dirt in theirs....</li>
            <li> it is not recommended to burn it alone; unless it is mixed with an elevating incense it is liable to bring negative things to the person using it uncautiously........</li>
            <li> judging by the pictures I was expecting to receive a bag of dark amber resin chunks.  </li>
            <li> looks NOTHING like other stuff I have!  </li>
            <li> This dark brown type seems to be the typical Myrrh you find online</li>
            <li> I had to pick hairs, and broom bristles out of it, seriously it seams to be floor sweepings of a possibly legitimate company being sold, rather then tossed in the trash by employees.</li>
            <li> less than 30% Myrrh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  Half</li>
            <li> i like the smell it reminds me slightly of eucalyptus</li>
            <li> The product is not as pungent as I would have expected, wondering if it is is old or stale.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;dry\\&quot; grains have a slight, wood and spice scent.  </li>
            <li> the two pregrounded/preblended makes it easier to control how much or little the moment calls for.  </li>
            <li> and it can be a little off putting if you are used to seeing something else.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t doubt that it is from some fragrant resinous plant, but it isn&#x27;t very fragrant, and definitely not very pleasant (and I don&#x27;t mean the opium, medicinal scent that myrrh has).  </li>
            <li> The scent is not strong at all, and I&#x27;ve bought some that smells stronger than this one before.</li>
            <li> but there was also sand in the bottom of the bag, a few small sticks, a few rock flakes, what looked to be a couple of strands of animal hair, and a piece of corn.  </li>
            <li> Very little of it appeared to be like the resin in the picture; imagine what is pictured, stirred up with a bucket of plain ol&#x27; dirt, and you get a 4oz scoop of that in the mail.</li>
            <li> But when they burn, there isn&#x27;t any detectable myrrh smell, but there is a bit of burning wood and something \\&quot;salty\\&quot; and acrid, a bit like burning rubber, as well as off smell like seafood or raw shellfish.  </li>
            <li> that others I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> We have a small bowl in which we display the myrrh each Advent at my church.  </li>
            <li> To begin with, there was a random scrap of plastic mixed in with the myrrh.</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was in a small unlabeled packet that was already opened.  </li>
            <li> and I was not sure what it even was.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they harvest the stuff</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars since there were at least a few pieces of resin in the bag</li>
            <li> just, it was low quality with a lot of filler of useless wood.  </li>
            <li> This myrrh however was very hard and had a lot of twigs, bark, and other garbage.</li>
            <li> I mean, compared to the stuff I have been buying it looks like someone freeze dried burnt raisins.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it has chips and bark, and very few resin tears.</li>
            <li> it seriously smells like you stuck your nose in a bowl of ground black pepper!</li>
            <li> it seriously smells like you stuck your nose in a bowl of ground black pepper!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> consisted mostly of wood trash! My seller comment was repeatedly blocked and removed on the grounds it was a product review. So I put the comment hear. The small amount of Myrrh gum that was there was of excellent quality. That is the only reason it get two stars rather the none. I had to pick hairs, and broom bristles out of it, seriously it seams to be floor sweepings of a possibly legitimate company being sold, rather then tossed in the trash by employees.</li>
            <li> It is hard to know if it is really ethopian or not but the quality is acceptable. Myrrh fumes bring the astral realms closer to the earth, opening up the spiritual doorway so that the influences attracted by the frankincense may manifest (when it is used together/mixed). In any incense mixture for spiritual purposes, myrrh acts to promote the manifestation of the forces attracted by the other incense blends. By bringing the astral realms closer, it allows motion between them. it is not recommended to burn it alone; unless it is mixed with an elevating incense it is liable to bring negative things to the person using it uncautiously........</li>
            <li> Smells great!!  Looks really authentic.</li>
            <li> I am still searching for the smell that I experienced as an altar boy years ago.  This is not it,  It is not unpleasant, just not what I am looking for.  If anyone can point me in a better direction I&#x27;d be appreciative.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the best Myrrh, it burns hot, has a definite smoky aroma, and seems less pure that others I have purchased in the past.  Plenty of debris (sticks etc.) in the bag too.  You could do better, but will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li> We have a small bowl in which we display the myrrh each Advent at my church.  A matching bowl holds frankincense.  Because there are many people with respiratory issues, we have not burnt any as incense, but we do get many compliments at the holidays, since many people have never seen myrrh and it is a conversation starter to realize that this is the same stuff that is spoken of in the Bible.</li>
            <li> no good. do not not by this product. does not burn proper try several times. amazon has others to choose to buy buy them not this incense</li>
            <li> smells great, way too much bark.  Disappointing.contents. less than 30% Myrrh. more accurate would be 1.5 ounces of myrrh.  Very poor harvesting method. Basically scraped the tree not the resin. Does not remotely look as good as that harvest in the picture where you can see all of it is nuggets of resin</li>
            <li> It was beyond my greatest expectations.</li>
            <li> I frequently burn myrrh and other resin incense.This product is long-burning and a nice size. After i ordered other myrrh from another Amazon.com seller, this is by far the greatest quality. I will definately buy more from this seller.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;4 ounces\\&quot; of incense I received was about 2 tenths of an ounce under weight even when including the packaging, and the resin contained a considerable amount of bark and wood fragments. Placing the resin on a burning charcoal tablet produced the light fragrance expected, but with a noticeable woody smell and a bit more smoke than expected.  Although my review is negative, I feel the product is a reasonable value and no attempt was made to contact the seller.</li>
            <li> Great price for the amount received. Just what we needed.</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews of this item before making my purchase and took the poor reviews with a grain of salt; however, i should have heeded their warnings. To begin with, there was a random scrap of plastic mixed in with the myrrh. The majority of what was in the package both looked and smelled like dirt....literally like earth or soil. Very little of it appeared to be like the resin in the picture; imagine what is pictured, stirred up with a bucket of plain ol&#x27; dirt, and you get a 4oz scoop of that in the mail. Terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Pure myrrh is a light to dark amber colored semi-translucent resin that turns a bit white on the outside with age.  The (less than) 4 oz package I received contained about a half dozen small, pure crystals.  The rest was mostly a mixture of sand, grit and bark held together with resin...which is obviously the secondary sap gathered from scrapings that fell around the base of the trees after the pure resin had been harvested.  A lot of the chunks were flat, some as large as my thumb, with bits of bark on one side and sand on the other.  The stuff smokes copiously, enough to set the smoke detectors off in your house if you put too large a piece on the charcoal...and given that I have 18&#x27; ceilings in the great room, that&#x27;s a LOT of smoke.  While the aroma is mild and woodsy, it is probably the lowest grade stuff they could sell and still call it myrrh.  I recommend that you look elsewhere...I will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought incense from Tom&#x27;s for use in church and have always been pleased. This myrrh however was very hard and had a lot of twigs, bark, and other garbage. If you are looking for Myrrh, try elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I like ony the yellow grains not the brown.</li>
            <li> I was surprised the item was not labeled.  I received several packages and only by looking at my records did I know what it was.&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked to have some more info about it. It is nice smelling and it looks very similar to the picture</li>
            <li> Once again (I don&#x27;t know when I will learn) this product was a FULL .4 oz UNDERWEIGHT.  I just paid for 4 oz and got 3.6.  Bad form, guys, bad form.</li>
            <li> First, the only reason it gets one star is because ZERO is not an option!!&lt;br /&gt;  Half the bag contains Myrrh (if thats what it is) so fine is like fine sand... the rest of the tiny pieces look like dirt.. cant see ANY RESIN at all in the bag...  looks NOTHING like other stuff I have!  stay clear of this stuff .</li>
            <li> This incense burn very well for a resin. It has a strong oder that I&#x27;m trying to match up with the incense that are burned in the catholic church</li>
            <li> What I received was different than it looks in the picture. It is a small bag full of very large chunks. I cannot get it to light. Am I supposed to chop this up myself? Come on. I have to say, the fragrance is nice.</li>
            <li> The product is not strongly scented and has what appears to be bark mixed in it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  I never used myrrh before but I&#x27;m fairly certain this was not that great in quality.  I ended up throwing it out.  Myrrh is a resin and this had pieces of bark in it so when it burned it smelled like burning wood.</li>
            <li> I never ever, ever leave reviews. Not even for the good products ive got off of Amazon but this is just ridiculous.  I recieved 4 bags of what looks like tree bark. One of the bags looks like it may have some resin but mostly tree bark. If you go to a pine tree and pick off the flacks of the pine tree and spray a gloss on it to make it shiny is the perfect description.  Very disappointed! !!!!!</li>
            <li> Took forever to get to my house but this has to be the best myrrh I&#x27;ve ever purchased most definitely purchase again worth the wait</li>
            <li> There was more in the package than I was thinking there would be so that was nice. It smells very good. I keep it in pouches around the house and car.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Very Fast &amp; Secure Shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was in a small unlabeled packet that was already opened.  I had ordered several things at the same time and I was not sure what it even was.  It contained a bunch of bark and other debris.  The sender name did not match what was on the label of the package so I really had to think hard to match it up to one of the orders I placed.  Needless to say it does not resemble the product advertised at all!</li>
            <li> This myrrh is really nice quality. I started making a tincture out of it the day after i received it. I did have a few sticks and small stones it the mix, but hey, it is a natural sap resin product. I would recommend this Myrrh highly!</li>
            <li> Not much to burn, looks like fine sand</li>
            <li> This is a great gift to order at Christmas time if you want to see what Myrrh is and also great for church plays.</li>
            <li> It comes smelling so good even before it is lit. It burns well and makes the house smell amazing. Shipping was fast and product was as expected. Will buy more.</li>
            <li> I think they might work better if mixed with some fast start charcoal.  The fragrance is great, I think!?  See what you think?  Worth trying once.  Here&#x27;s an update.  I purchased some charcoal to get this to release its fragrance.  I don&#x27;t know why, but this does not smell anything like the MYRRH I am used to.  Frankly, I think it stinks..I tried twice.  Try it, if it is something you like, great day!  For me I&#x27;ll never buy this again.  I apologize for anyone who purchased this based on my earlier comment.  Keep in mind this is ONLY MY PERSONAL OPINION.</li>
            <li> Smelled like burnt rubber. Made my kids sick when I burned. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Most everyone knows the Christ child received gold, frankincense and myrrh from the magi, but who has seen this stuff? Curiosity now satisfied.</li>
            <li> This burns very well but the smell is god awful.  It smells like burning tires and lingers in the nose.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed with my purchase.  I&#x27;ve never bought Myrrh before but judging by the pictures I was expecting to receive a bag of dark amber resin chunks.  What I received, however, looked nothing like the pictures.  My first thought was someone sold me a bag of crap.....literally.  Granted, there were a few resin-type chunks mixed in but there was also sand in the bottom of the bag, a few small sticks, a few rock flakes, what looked to be a couple of strands of animal hair, and a piece of corn.  I&#x27;m not sure how they harvest the stuff but it looked like they just scraped it off the ground along with whatever else was there too.  I&#x27;d bought some Frankincense from this seller as well and it was fine but this seems sub-par.  I gave it two stars since there were at least a few pieces of resin in the bag and thankfully it was cheap so no big loss but still......corn?</li>
            <li> very good product for the price ,my rating will be 10+++++++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this produce to friends and family.</li>
            <li> i like the smell it reminds me slightly of eucalyptus i could def imagine the egyptians emblaming with this. i like it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy burning frankensence and myrrh over the holidays, this was just the right amount and it was not half powder like some I have purchased.</li>
            <li> If you dont mind grinding it all so you can weed out the 2-plus ounces of tree bark, then this might be ok for you.  Once all my resin was crushed (the resin itself was fresh.... almost all of mine was very sticky and gummy), what was left over was probably less than 2 ounces. If you go into it knowing others charge way more than 1 dollar per ounce (based on 4 ounces for 4 dollars), then you can see in the end what your dollars are paying for.  Other folks said there was gravel, sand, dirt in theirs.... but I only experienced powdered and grinded bark in my bag.  It was no different than nut shells wearing down... just, it was low quality with a lot of filler of useless wood.  The wood chips I will throw on the wood burning grill to add fragrance... the shards attached to smaller pieces of wood/bark I grinded down as best I could, and it became a bark/resin inscense.  The bark gives the myrrh a woodsey undertone.  I grind these together because it will not burn well for you in chunks.  The tears (what you probably are after) I grind up to make granules... I do this because it is so wet and sticky, and VERY potent, that I can only burn small amounts at a time.  I will grind my frankincense,  too.... the two pregrounded/preblended makes it easier to control how much or little the moment calls for.  For friends gift bags I mix the crushed myrrh and frankincense together for them... to make sure good balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you dont mind &#x27;cracking out&#x27; long enough to pick the 1.5 ounces (an estimate based on how much final product visually filled a 4 oz jar) of tears with tweezers (they are very small based on what I got / pebble size.... big ones would have been pea sized.... and then everyone gets one complimentary nickle sized one, too; I guess...) out of 4 ounces of product, then I have advice: do this with your bowl in the sun.... just so that sunlight is in the bowl... it will make your resin sparkle, making it MUCH easier to start recognizing difference between wood and resin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I myself decided I do not like myrrh.... but I cannot deduct stars for that.... it seriously smells like you stuck your nose in a bowl of ground black pepper! LoL.... I am going to try switching to Opoponox... the &#x27;sweet myrrh.&#x27;  I am not too upset at how little I got of actual resin tears, because it really does just take a itsy bitsy pinch of this stuff.  Very potent!  The resin I hunted for actually seems quite nice.  I am no expert, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL keep some around, however.... I suffer from sinusitus. Surgeries didnt even help.... started burning this stuff and (Warning.... gross) my sinuses began draining unbelievable amounts of puss!  So, I will burn a tiny bit here and there just to help medicinally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you buy this knowing you will be put to work to claim your resin.... and if you know you are buying really only 1.5 worth of resin.... 4 bucks is probably worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine from Atharva.od and resin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I myself decided I do not like myrrh.... but I cannot deduct stars for that.... it seriously smells like you stuck your nose in a bowl of ground black pepper! LoL.... I am going to try switching to Opoponox... the &#x27;sweet myrrh.&#x27;  I am not too upset at how little I got of actual resin tears, because it really does just take a itsy bitsy pinch of this stuff.

            <li> The product was as expected.  Thanks.  It was divided and given as &amp;#34;gifts&amp;#34; to a number of appreciative people.  A blessed Epiphany to all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok myrrh, in bulk so the sizes of the myrrh will vary. The scent is not strong at all, and I&#x27;ve bought some that smells stronger than this one before. So I was a bit disappointed. But still a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Not as seen in this Picture and more bark then anything! I wish I could give it a single star particle!</li>
            <li> The product is not as pungent as I would have expected, wondering if it is is old or stale.</li>
            <li> Until this month I had only ever bought a type that was a light to medium brown color with about 30% being slightly opaque and almost none looked like bark flakes.  So I was a little skeptical when I tried finding a cheaper alternative to the store that introduced me to resin incense.  This dark brown type seems to be the typical Myrrh you find online and it can be a little off putting if you are used to seeing something else.  I mean, compared to the stuff I have been buying it looks like someone freeze dried burnt raisins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I figured what do I know about how myrrh should look.  So I heated some up and did a comparison of the two types.  I am really disappointed.  Maybe this is just an extremely low grade myrrh and all the actual resin has been sorted out into higher grades after the collection process.  Either way there is little that is worth heating up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to do a quick experiment and try to separate the resin from the plant matter and find the actual percentage of bark to resin.  I&#x27;ll update this when I&#x27;m done so you will know what you are paying for, until then do yourself a favor and do not buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said I have purchased a lot of other resins from this seller and they are all  good.  So as far as I know this is really the only one you should avoid from this store/seller.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is not true myrrh or is just of low quality, but as other reviewers have commented, there are some sticks and highly resinated wood chips, as well as grains of resin in various sizes.  The \\&quot;dry\\&quot; grains have a slight, wood and spice scent.  But when they burn, there isn&#x27;t any detectable myrrh smell, but there is a bit of burning wood and something \\&quot;salty\\&quot; and acrid, a bit like burning rubber, as well as off smell like seafood or raw shellfish.  I don&#x27;t doubt that it is from some fragrant resinous plant, but it isn&#x27;t very fragrant, and definitely not very pleasant (and I don&#x27;t mean the opium, medicinal scent that myrrh has).  I also don&#x27;t understand why there is wood in it, since quality myrrh should be just the resin tears.</li>
            <li> Smells like dirt, not Myrrh. Not a good quality resin. I&#x27;m still in search for a high quality myrrh.</li>
            <li> Not truly Resin at all, it has chips and bark, and very few resin tears.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and fabulous service!</li>
            <li> excellent inciense with good aroma</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this Ethiopian Incense Resin keeps your home with a nice smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Seems to be Myrrh from what I can tell.  Maybe more woody then I&#x27;d expect but otherwise seems to be the real stuff.</li>
