            <li>There&#x27;s nothing more amazing than a guy that smell good.</li>
            <li>The bottle and box were nice.</li>

            <li>I bought for my husband and loved that scent very much!</li>

            <li>i love the smell and it also works with any kind of venue to let people know the sporty, free spirited person you are.</li>
            <li>All the girls will love whenever you go.</li>
            <li>i love it when i smelled it</li>
            <li>It got to me safely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more a sporty state of mind.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product, but it is the favorite cologne of my grandson,..</li>
            <li>However, my son was even more pleased with the Gucci Sport.</li>
            <li>He loves it, and his girlfriends love it as well.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE WAY THIS SMELLS.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with purchase</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely manly and the powerful attractive fragrance stays with you and leaves you feeling clean and deliciously perfumed.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it brings a very original cap.</li>
            <li>His girl friend tells him she wants to hug him again and again just to enjoy the splendid fragrance of Sport.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and it smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>the pepper smell died out a very light scent emerged but wasn&#x27;t like the original Macy&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>This is a great smelling cologne, my girlfriend can smell it on me for the whole day and always comments on how much she likes it!</li>
            <li>Not the best price nor my favorite smell; a little to sweet smelling for me.</li>
            <li>is very good and durable 100% recommend them came in the expected time</li>
            <li>This one is very sporty and smells nice.</li>
            <li>As a secure mounting/hanging point on an object.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this to secure to a flagpole, so I won&#x27;t remove a star for it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully you are not the kind of person to think &amp;#34;oh, an eyelet, this has to open from twisting&amp;#34;, and you are instead the kind of person to think &amp;#34;oh, an eyelet, I will test</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sweet at all, but very sophisticated and good for all the occasions during daytime or evening.</li>
            <li>Great for the summer, not very spicy.</li>
            <li>and hopefully something cool will happen&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very well pleased with all aspects of the purchase, and the item itself.</li>
            <li>and I love amazon&#x27;s fast shipping.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;re tons of decent day time colognes for $40 with much better longevity and sized 3.4oz not 3.0 like this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M READY FOR A NIGHT OUT!!</li>
            <li>but as it is it&#x27;s never too powerful</li>
            <li>right off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could have paid much more from a local store.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m assuming there are more people like me out there, that picked this bottle up, and believed that the eyelet would be secured to the bottle and that twisting would open it...</li>
            <li>It arrived on time plus it was well packaged and it was the real Gucci Sport!</li>
            <li>so I kno it pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh smelling for spring and summer days when you&#x27;re dressed down in something sporty, t-shirt and jeans, or a nice polo shirt.</li>
            <li>The Gucci by Gucci toilet water was really a great smelling toilet water (eau de toilette - EDT).</li>
            <li>Great product, and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>makes it very impractical.</li>
            <li>I bought it straight from amazon</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of the cologne and it is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>This product was actually more than I expected!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, green, sporty and sophisticated at the same time.</li>
            <li>Now the main question - would I buy it again?</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s green and a little flowery (but not floral and powdery) and sure not on sweet side.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 20 years old, and my generation of women are all about this smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments from the opposite sex and that&#x27;s what really matters.</li>
            <li>this is a really nice smelling cologne, I bought the guilty version and got a comment in the bar from it but haven&#x27;t heard back from her yet.</li>

            <li> Sporty, but elegant for, however, casual wear in day time.</li>
            <li> I bought this just to mix things up on my cologne game, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also long lasting (6-8 hours).</li>
            <li> It has a long lasting fragrance that leaves you thinking you&#x27;ve just breathed in a  fragrant field of flowers.</li>
            <li> Two Christmases ago my son received a bottle of Gucci by Gucci toilet water.</li>
            <li> You can wear it as casual or for special occasion.</li>
            <li> this purchase aroma doesn&#x27;t last ,customer said it is a  watered down replica.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;d typically make no sense to pull on it, because they are typically built to withstand such force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You could plate a small Skyscraper with the amount of extra glass they added on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot with a small carry on backpack or hand bag and the extra weight</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about this product; shipment was quick (before anticipated arrival date), product arrived without problems!</li>
            <li> I like this, like the scent and it tends to last late into the afternoon.</li>
            <li> pull on the tie down</li>
            <li> because that&#x27;s typically what eyelets are for.  </li>
            <li> It lasts about 4 hours on my t-shirt and way less than that on my skin.</li>
            <li> I do wish it was a little stronger</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and don&#x27;t actually use that eyelet to secure your bottle of Gucci by Gucci Sport to a rope, because the eyelet is horrible.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a few hours not all day.</li>
            <li> WHY DID THE MAKE THE BOTTLE SO HEAVY?</li>
            <li> This past Christmas he received Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme SPORT by Gucci for Men - 3 Ounce EDT Spray by Gucci.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d spend no more than $28.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s structural integrity by pulling really, really hard on it</li>
            <li> Weak and possibly fake.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Gucci Sport.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was difficult to find the 3 oz size, until we located this seller, and we will definitly use them again.</li>
            <li> ONE VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER.</li>

            <li> It was exactly as I expected it to be.  If you like to have a good business sweet smell, this is the product of you.</li>
            <li> Smells okay. Good spring scent. Lasts a few hours not all day. WHY DID THE MAKE THE BOTTLE SO HEAVY? You could plate a small Skyscraper with the amount of extra glass they added on the bottom of the bottle. I travel a lot with a small carry on backpack or hand bag and the extra weight makes it very impractical.</li>
            <li> I bought this just to mix things up on my cologne game, and I was not disappointed. I get compliments everywhere I go from women asking what that scent is. I&#x27;m 20 years old, and my generation of women are all about this smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is not the same as the one I bought from Saphora and there is no return/replace option.  I feel kind of stuck.</li>
            <li> This cologne is really great. It&#x27;s light, green, sporty and sophisticated at the same time. You can wear it as casual or for special occasion. It&#x27;s&#x27;the type you can keep forever and make your own scent to people.&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, it&#x27;s like Mont Blanc Individuel, lighter without the mint, cinnamon and violet. It&#x27;s also long lasting (6-8 hours).</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Gucci Sport.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell that actually last longer than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping. Simply great</li>
            <li> All the Gucci Colones are great. This one is very sporty and smells nice. Great for the summer, not very spicy.</li>
            <li> this purchase aroma doesn&#x27;t last ,customer said it is a  watered down replica. the smell is great and not detected after  an hour</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne, my girlfriend can smell it on me for the whole day and always comments on how much she likes it!</li>
            <li> this is a really nice smelling cologne, I bought the guilty version and got a comment in the bar from it but haven&#x27;t heard back from her yet.</li>
            <li> one of the best sporty fragrances i&#x27;ve tried. i love the smell and it also works with any kind of venue to let people know the sporty, free spirited person you are.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more amazing than a guy that smell good. All the girls will love whenever you go. That is it</li>
            <li> I could have paid much more from a local store.  Great deal!!  Will be buying again once I run out.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> very good perfume, the smell is divine. delivered on time&lt;br /&gt;it brings a very original cap. i love it when i smelled it</li>
            <li> This product smells like pepper and only lasted 20-30 minutes.  The bottle and box were nice. Afrer the pepper smell died out a very light scent emerged but wasn&#x27;t like the original Macy&#x27;s cologne. ONE VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER. NEVER WILL I BUY FROM WHOLE PERFUME ON AMAZON! !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> How to open the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just pull on the tie down ring / eyelet thing.  It comes right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m assuming there are more people like me out there, that picked this bottle up, and believed that the eyelet would be secured to the bottle and that twisting would open it... because that&#x27;s typically what eyelets are for.  As a secure mounting/hanging point on an object.  And it&#x27;d typically make no sense to pull on it, because they are typically built to withstand such force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully you are not the kind of person to think &amp;#34;oh, an eyelet, this has to open from twisting&amp;#34;, and you are instead the kind of person to think &amp;#34;oh, an eyelet, I will test it&#x27;s structural integrity by pulling really, really hard on it and hopefully something cool will happen&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are the former, you actually lose this time.  But unlike the latter, I bet 90% of the fragile stuff in your home isn&#x27;t destroyed, so you always got that going for you, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it smells pretty good.  Citrus-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and don&#x27;t actually use that eyelet to secure your bottle of Gucci by Gucci Sport to a rope, because the eyelet is horrible.  Your bottle will likely break.  I didn&#x27;t buy this to secure to a flagpole, so I won&#x27;t remove a star for it... but the engineers at Gucci have no idea how to build a functional, multi-purpose cologne bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the cologne and it is by far my favorite. And I recommend it for anyone to try</li>
            <li> Great smells that the ladies love! It got to me safely. I&#x27;ve wanted this stuff since back when I lived in Italy and Amazon had it for a great price</li>
            <li> Fresher and lighter fragrance to suit the demands of a spontaneous lifestyle. I don&#x27;t necessarily link it literally with sports. It&#x27;s more a sporty state of mind. Meaning, off-duty time and the attitude that comes from being relaxed and carefree.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product, but it is the favorite cologne of my grandson,..always on his list of &amp;#34;want&#x27;s&amp;#34;. It was difficult to find the 3 oz size, until we located this seller, and we will definitly use them again. Great product, and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband... smells so good!</li>
            <li> it is the best perfume I have, Gucci always good, however, this is exceptional, and attractive. , , , , ,</li>
            <li> This product was actually more than I expected! It arrived on time plus it was well packaged and it was the real Gucci Sport! I had this cologne before so I kno it pretty well. The price was good too. I would order something else from this seller any day. Thank you</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy. Weak and possibly fake. Got ZERO compliments from the ladies. All it did was make people sneeze. I wound up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Two Christmases ago my son received a bottle of Gucci by Gucci toilet water. This past Christmas he received Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme SPORT by Gucci for Men - 3 Ounce EDT Spray by Gucci. The Gucci by Gucci toilet water was really a great smelling toilet water (eau de toilette - EDT). However, my son was even more pleased with the Gucci Sport. It has a long lasting fragrance that leaves you thinking you&#x27;ve just breathed in a  fragrant field of flowers. It&#x27;s definitely manly and the powerful attractive fragrance stays with you and leaves you feeling clean and deliciously perfumed. His girl friend tells him she wants to hug him again and again just to enjoy the splendid fragrance of Sport.

            <li> After reading the reviews i thought the product would have had a stronger lasting power! After just an hour or so the scent fades&lt;br /&gt;and needs to be reappled.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husbands birthday.  It has a nice manly fragrance and not over powering.  I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my grandson for xmas. THis is one item of his choices. When he opened his gift he was in shock, He never thought he would get it. He loves it, and his girlfriends love it as well. See you next Xmas.</li>
            <li> the offer on the internet was very good. Saw the same product in the Gucci store more expensive .very happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments from the opposite sex and that&#x27;s what really matters. I do wish it was a little stronger but as it is it&#x27;s never too powerful</li>
            <li> I like this, like the scent and it tends to last late into the afternoon. Given the price I would probably buy again and even a second one to keep at my office.</li>
            <li> I bought for my husband and loved that scent very much! It&#x27;s not sweet at all, but very sophisticated and good for all the occasions during daytime or evening. Gucci is perfect as always!</li>
            <li> Es un excelente producto, lo recomiendo mucho y es exactamente como lo descrito por el vendedor, tambien el empaque fue adecuado y lleg&amp;oacute; en buenas condiciones, sin da&amp;ntilde;os ni problemas</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE WAY THIS SMELLS. MY WIFE ALSO LOVES IT. I WEAR IT THEN I&#x27;M READY FOR A NIGHT OUT!!</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about this product; shipment was quick (before anticipated arrival date), product arrived without problems! I am satisfied with purchase</li>
            <li> gucci always surprising with its aromas .... is very good and durable 100% recommend them came in the expected time</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, and the price...can&#x27;t beat. It&#x27;s fresh smelling for spring and summer days when you&#x27;re dressed down in something sporty, t-shirt and jeans, or a nice polo shirt. This gets the job done. I probably wouldn&#x27;t wear it for a night out with dressy clothes, I personally use my Chanel Platinum for those occasions. That stuff gets a lot of compliments!</li>
            <li> Very well pleased with all aspects of the purchase, and the item itself. The seller listed the product correctly, and shipped without incident. I would use this seller again in the future. I hope this helps out.</li>
            <li> Not the best price nor my favorite smell; a little to sweet smelling for me.</li>
            <li> I bought it straight from amazon and I love amazon&#x27;s fast shipping. The cologne is very nice and lovely, perfect for srping and summer days. It&#x27;s green and a little flowery (but not floral and powdery) and sure not on sweet side. Sporty, but elegant for, however, casual wear in day time. The only issue I have is its longevity. It lasts about 4 hours on my t-shirt and way less than that on my skin. Projection -  projects well, but only for like 2 hours. Now the main question - would I buy it again? Of course, but not for $40. I&#x27;d spend no more than $28. There&#x27;re tons of decent day time colognes for $40 with much better longevity and sized 3.4oz not 3.0 like this one. So I give it 3 out of 5 solid. Maybe even 3+. It smells good.</li>
