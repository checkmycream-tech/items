            <li>best part is the bristle do soap up well</li>

            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>Great brush - was hoping for a stiffer bristle brush, and this one fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>It was good, but the cord it came on came removed so I can no longer hang it up.</li>

            <li>A good brush.</li>
            <li>the price, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>The one piece construction is superior to the removable handle types out there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, this is a good brush.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>This is a good bath brush.</li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t order it because the photo of the product shows the handle without a loop at the end to hang it from a shower caddy, but the reviews were so good</li>
            <li>Good length and curve on handle.</li>
            <li>The handle looks serviceable and the brush seems to be of good quality.</li>

            <li>Good design and good quality.</li>
            <li>The price has proved to be a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seems to have helped keep the brush in good condition.</li>
            <li>The brushes were really good compared to others that I had tried.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the good reviews that it received.  </li>
            <li>Feels as good as the one I payed 50.00 for</li>
            <li>over all good quality brush.</li>
            <li>A good men&#x27;s bath</li>
            <li>It is a good man&#x27;s brown tortoise, and the bristles are a mix of nylon and boar&#x27;s bristle.  </li>
            <li>But it does work good at scrubbing the tires on my truck.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the plastic is good quality at all.</li>
            <li>You need to rinse all the soap off of your hand to get a good grip.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate it is a good quality product</li>
            <li>Eventually softened up and is good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, well designed, has good bristles, and is well balanced.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the brush looks great.</li>
            <li>Good value over all.</li>
            <li>The company did make good on the purchase price, however.  </li>
            <li>Good quality brush.  </li>
            <li>LOL  Enter Swissco Deluxe brush.  </li>
            <li>good for exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li>I love the best, and certainly this is the best bath brush I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get super sudsy like a loofah, but I think it&#x27;s perfectly sufficient for a brush.</li>
            <li>A VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the utility this brush provides and cannot imagine how it could be improved.</li>
            <li>Been looking for a brush with a bit more firmness in the bristles, this one works great for that.</li>
            <li>It works better than anything else I have tried to date, so I am happy.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent brush;  pluses include the long, curved handle and the perfect stiffness of bristle.  </li>
            <li>Nice coarseness, good exfoliating feeling.</li>
            <li>Works great, bristles feel good and it is easy to reach all the spots that I can otherwise reach.  </li>
            <li>and I love the curved handle!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Great bristles - don&#x27;t need a lot of pressure to get a good clean.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews before I purchased this brush and was very impressed with the positive feedback.  </li>
            <li>This has a nice look in the bath sleek and beautiful and has a nice angle that seems to be perfect for my husbands back.</li>
            <li>but fortunately it lived up to the great Reviews here.  </li>
            <li>Nice curve to the handle</li>
            <li>While this brush looks nice, it doesn&#x27;t feel that way.</li>
            <li>it gets the area that I cant reach and there is nothing better than a good scrubbing in an area that you cant reach</li>
            <li>and then you&#x27;ve got the water attacking the wood which isn&#x27;t so nice.</li>
            <li>Ez to use, hangs nicely in shower stall.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than many wimpy ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Handle is great shape and lenght</li>
            <li>The person was thrilled to receive it.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never had any problems getting a nice, soapy lather.  </li>
            <li>T is handy to use,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks nice.</li>
            <li>I used to own two boats; they had to be taken out of the water once a year to have the barnacles scraped off the bottom.</li>
            <li>If they could make this brush with a handle that really lets you grip, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>This was so nicely made that I ordered another one for a friend.  </li>
            <li>Well made, looks nice.  </li>
            <li>Perfect and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Nice bath brush.</li>
            <li>Good brush, I just wish it had a handle that offered more traction when covered in soap.</li>
            <li>Nice brush...</li>
            <li>Nice bristles too</li>
            <li>This brush is NICE.</li>
            <li>Nice, sturdy brush with not-too-hard, not-too-soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a nice feel - tingle but not irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so well that I bought two of them (one for each bath).</li>
            <li>Nice length, sturdy nylon bristles.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>easy rinse off and just a really good brush.</li>

            <li>I t is an excellent product for older people to use when showering or bathing as it does an outstanding job..</li>
            <li>Great item, useful and sturdy</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give the Swissco Deluxe Bath Brush a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>The brush is great but the loop of line to hang it isn&#x27;t worth anything.  </li>
            <li>I liked the reviews and love the brush.</li>
            <li>But this brush is still going strong!  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend for workmanship and durability!</li>
            <li>This one seemed to be the best available brush, and sold  a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This one still looks good and keeps clean.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, right curvature to the handle.</li>
            <li>but it gives a nice clean scrub!</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews of many different ones I went with the Swissco Deluxe and it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice brush to hang for easy use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Really ATTRACTIVE, PERFECT MED/firm Bristles (NOT TOO FIRM or SCRATCHY), Easy Clean/Sanitize.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine -- nice quality</li>
            <li>but I do love it.</li>
            <li>Just love this brush.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>I will go shopping for a better one and retire this to cleaning purposes.</li>
            <li>With the bike handle-bar tape wrap to increase size for gripping</li>
            <li>Yerba is better as hand brush without handle.</li>
            <li>you want and buy brushes more often.</li>

            <li>we are glad we chose this one</li>

            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful on my back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d gladly buy this product again if need be.</li>
            <li>I have had many bath brushes over the years.</li>
            <li>This is better.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a better brush that would not break and I read that this one wouldn&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li>I love the wood look to go with our steam room</li>
            <li>The ergonomic handle is a real plus since you can reach better and just about anywhere with great ease even the bottoms of your feet.</li>
            <li>Excellent back brush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than the ones you find at Walmart or Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li>I love using this brush.  </li>
            <li>Says it&#x27;s the perfect texture for scrubbing his back</li>
            <li>Also, the bristles seem to be more durable, they haven&#x27;t started to look worn or mashed.  </li>
            <li>This is more like it.  </li>
            <li>Feels awesome on my back.</li>
            <li>Much better than the plastic bristle models.</li>
            <li>Glad I did the research before buying this product.</li>
            <li>But as lovely as this is it&#x27;s not for me.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad i did</li>
            <li>Bought 3 of these, and probably should get some more.</li>
            <li>One of my better purchases.</li>
            <li>More like sandpaper than a bath brush.</li>
            <li>It is a much better design and a quality product.</li>
            <li>It is an OK brush</li>
            <li>My grandson was pleased to receive this</li>
            <li>This rope never dries, which I&#x27;m sure the microbes love.</li>
            <li>I am totally pleased with the value of this bath brush.  </li>
            <li>We were using the stick more than the scrubber head...</li>
            <li>The bristles are just the right stiffness to give a good scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>The brush is just the right firmness we like and feels good using it.</li>
            <li>The brush is a good size and the handle is angled just right.</li>
            <li>Bristles are, well, bristle-y, but about right for a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Creates a great lather also, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Well OK, a wooden handle would be nice, but I&#x27;ve had a great one one of those and the problem is the finish wears off</li>
            <li>Good craftsmanship and shipped fast!</li>
            <li>Handle is long and the curve is perfect.</li>
            <li>Pretty good brush.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband as he needed a new shower brush, he is very pleased with it!</li>
            <li>Started the New Year with  another happy purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The smooth plastic this is made of is attractive, sturdy and is holding up well to extended use, but it gets very slippery.</li>
            <li>I DO now use it as a dry brush and it feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The brush is a very good back brush if you like a loofah which I do.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, very nice, good looking, and stiffer bristles, which is what I am always&lt;br /&gt;looking</li>
            <li>The customer photo that someone else posted is more accurate for color.</li>
            <li>Im giving it 2 stars because it worked great on my feet removing old skin.</li>
            <li>The brush head is large and the strong bristles give you a good scrub, which is what I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But other than this, this is my best bath brush ever!</li>
            <li>It hangs up and is easy to get hold of.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a brush that wasn&#x27;t wood and that wouldn&#x27;t rot out very quickly</li>
            <li>Oh so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The plastic handle is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>It easily hangs on the shower hot/cold handles or shower head pipe.  </li>
            <li>The length of the handle allows for easy over the shoulder reach.  </li>
            <li>It performs well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>so easy to reach those &amp;#34;hard to get to places&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>After having thrown out too many bath brushes with wooden handles because of mildew, I was happy to find this one.</li>
            <li>Great idea to bend it for better back scratching with bristles that don&#x27;t stab you but bend and scrub as hoped for.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>Have used this for about a year now (2-3 times a week), and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>A decent brush with good bristles that hold body wash well.</li>
            <li>guess it would be OK if someone wants that kind of a &amp;#34;vigorous&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Really nice bath brush that does a good job of rubbing soap around and also getting that itching back during the winter months!  </li>
            <li>The bristles are strongly attached so they never fall out over time.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This brush works fine.</li>
            <li>works just fine.</li>
            <li>This works fine.</li>
            <li>Nice long handle with a good shape to grip.</li>
            <li>Length is fine</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>This brush is light, the bristles strong, and scrub well.</li>
            <li>The texture of the bristles is just as good as my first Swissco, and the plastic handle makes the whole brush more durable.  </li>
            <li>The description says \\&quot;Perfectly fit your hand for a secure grip which makes it so easy to use.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I have tried many more with limited success, but this brush is great.</li>
            <li>I like using the Yerba head alone in hand for arms, chest, legs, but it is rougher than Swissco so press lightly and wait til skin toughens or bristles soften with use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just smooth plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this brush to reach my back and it does a great</li>
            <li>It feels great scrubbing my back.</li>
            <li>I ordered it anyway, and to my happy surprise, it arrived WITH a white rope loop attached at the end of the handle to hang it up by.</li>
            <li>He says it is gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy  to clean.</li>
            <li>But if you are into removing dead skin cells this is an excellent brush.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t tell you how happy it made my back.  </li>
            <li>but it just looks like cheap plastic</li>
            <li>This brush works great for scrubbing my back with body wash, as well as putting lotion or body oil on it after my shower.  </li>
            <li>They are too cheap and break.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it was curved, rather than straight handled, but either it was damaged in shipping, or when shipped.</li>
            <li>As described, easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>The bristles are great and the shape of the handle does make washing my back easier.</li>
            <li>Feels great on my back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice, heavy plastic, but has a great appearance of tortoise.</li>
            <li>So far so good, what can I say about a brush.  </li>
            <li>Long, beautiful, luxurious.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, feels good, does the job, shows no sign of wear after 13 months of frequent use.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been good so far,</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a great brush, I&#x27;ve had one for a long time, it&#x27;s stayed as good as new.</li>
            <li>Very useful brush to wash those hard-to-reach areas of my body.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping, new, good price.</li>
            <li>The bristles are not stiff, they are more on the soft side, but it has a large brush which gathers lots of lather, works great!</li>
            <li>It holds soap really well &amp; is VERY easy to rinse off between uses.  </li>
            <li>just what I wanted real bristle and very long handle, appears to be perfect</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Great for my thicker skinned feet, but not soft back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used it all I could think was it would be better for cleaning a grill.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this bath brush in the mail.</li>
            <li>this brush is good quality and it is fine for brushing your back.</li>
            <li>back/bath brushes, 1 loofah sponge-on-a-stick, 2 loofah sponge pads on a cloth with rope handles and 2 nylon mesh back brushes and this is the best one by far.</li>
            <li>so it wouldn&#x27;t mildew, and snapped the head clean OFF.</li>
            <li>and I rarely say anything is easy to use anymore.  </li>
            <li>we using the brush to clean the bathroom tub and sink.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, the handle is long enough and the bristles are a perfect texture.</li>
            <li>This brush has a curved handle that is just right and has strong bristles.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are just right, giving me a nice scrubbing and the handle is nice and long.  </li>
            <li>Very nice bristles and very long handle.  </li>
            <li>The angle is perfect as well and gets those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>Great, except the braided cord becomes unknotted when wet</li>
            <li>Amazing and soft.</li>
            <li>Nice looking and soft bristles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good back and leg scrubber.</li>
            <li>WOULD LIKE STRAIGHT HANDLE BETTER.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush.</li>
            <li>It is true that this brush does not produce a lather but that does not diminish its cleaning ability.  </li>
            <li>I left it on and that gives the handle a really good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t as coarse as I thought they&#x27;d be (and that&#x27;s good).</li>
            <li>He, too, thought the bristles were too soft until he tried it and he liked it</li>
            <li>and I cannot say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>A nice medium between hard/stiff and soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Nice brush, bristles are a bit soft.  </li>
            <li>Good back brush.</li>
            <li>to let you know you&#x27;re super clean.  </li>
            <li>The brush soaps up nicely and the bristles offer just the right tactile feel for a satisfying back scrub.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable, well sized with just the right firmness of bristles.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;BEAUTIFUL&amp;#34;  AND &amp;#34; BEST QUALITY&amp;#34;,  per E-x-t-e-n-s-i-v-e  Research, (even much more expensive),</li>
            <li>looks super</li>
            <li>that the handle is attached not wedged into the head like those bamboo ones, and the reach is adequate.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a perfect length and arch to reach the hard-to-reach places on your back and the construction seems so much better than others I have purchased where the bristles started falling out after less than a year&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>Has a must have rope on it to hang it up in the shower and is very sturdy and feels great on your back.  </li>
            <li>and it was necessary to wrap the end with waterproof tape for better gripping.</li>
            <li>Anything this good is likely to disappear from the market, so I&#x27;m taking no chances and buying another right away as insurance.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it perfect is if the brisltes held soap a little better.</li>
            <li>Very pretty too.</li>
            <li>Good sturdy design, I hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit stronger than I like, but overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Best I have ever had beats the old wood brush hands down.</li>
            <li>One excellent characteristic is that it holds up well to ten minutes of boiling water exposure for sanitizing.</li>
            <li>This brush has great firm bristles and the arch in the handle</li>
            <li>The smooth plastic handle is very slippery when you have soap on your hands.</li>
            <li>This works very well and does not feel or look cheap.  </li>
            <li>The head is firm and does a great job in the shower.</li>
            <li>Lots like this one and Swissco makes quality combs so worth a try.</li>
            <li>Amazon wins with me.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li>I used to own a Swissco brush with a wooden (or maybe bamboo) handle.  </li>
            <li>Loving this brush sturdy and holds up to daily use .  </li>
            <li>The main thing is that it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I prefer a stiffer brush and this one seemed too soft to my hands but ended up being great for my back.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Otherwise this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Although this brush has a nice look and feel, the bristles were not  enough for me.</li>
            <li>The brush is well designed and worth the investment.</li>
            <li>The only problem with it is, the smoothness of the handle makes it a bit slippery, Otherwise, a nice quality product.</li>
            <li>Provides a nice angle of attack to get all of your back.  </li>
            <li>Tried some others that were just too soft, the Swissco is coarse enough, good scrub, good cleaning.</li>
            <li>Love the natural bristles...</li>
            <li>I picked up a cheap brush at a local Bed Bath and Beyond, and it&#x27;s much more to my liking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend and worth the money.</li>
            <li>First I thought it was from water in a new place i moved to, but then the times I did not use the brush, skin was OK.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how hard it was to find a good bath brush!  </li>
            <li>It is the right length, the right thickness ( don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ll break it) not too slippery ( if you rinse your hand) and the brushes are just right for me.</li>
            <li>The curved handle is just right,</li>
            <li>I think its just the right amount of toughness.</li>
            <li>the  right  </li>
            <li>The bristles are just about the right level of stiffness and have held up well.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are just right.</li>
            <li>The length of the handle isn&#x27;t quite right.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right.</li>
            <li>and the handle is curved just right for comfort.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just there, right where you put it.</li>
            <li>Bristles offer right mixture of softness vs. effectiveness.</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush and does exactly what I purchased it for, scrubs my back in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The length and curve of the handle make it perfect if you are not very flexible and don&#x27;t have a long reach.</li>
            <li>The brush I owned previously had a head that was attached to the handle by a pressure fit, and would frequently fall off the handle, making ME fly off</li>
            <li>The handle makes it very easy to get to all parts of my back.  </li>
            <li>I think for anybody who wants a more grippy handle, they can rough up this handle with a brillo pad or some sandpaper to make it more grippy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice long handle which is also needed for anyone with shoulder</li>
            <li>This thing looks pretty, and was cheap enough to easily discard when it stops looking presentable.</li>
            <li>I even like the little curve it has to the brush, makes it perfect for back scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Not too hard, not too soft, a perfect brush for brushing.</li>
            <li>Solid construction, plastic has a nice \\&quot;grain\\&quot; to it, tough bristles, holds a good suz, cleans easy and drains well.</li>
            <li>My standard for a great back brush is one I got years ago from an Avon rep.</li>
            <li>nice soft brush to clean you back with soap while in the shower.  </li>
            <li>No Workie,handle too short, do not waste your money, this does not do a good job, thrown it in the trash</li>
            <li>Works great not to rough or soft.</li>
            <li>It looked liked the brush had been used, next time I will order straight from the company.</li>
            <li>Actually, I use it on my whole bod and feet, feels pretty nice.</li>
            <li>The bristles are firm, just right for a good scrub.  </li>
            <li>This is a quality brush at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>A VERY gentle tug on some of the remaining bristles pulled out another 30 or so.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a Microfiber Exfoliating Back Scrubber (which I found to be a pill to keep clean &amp; free of mold).  </li>
            <li>My back is really smooth now since, I can clean it efficiently.</li>
            <li>Bristles are not too hard, seem well secured and feel great on the skin.</li>
            <li>great with exception, if your hands are covered in soap, prepare yourself, its hard as hell to hold on to.</li>
            <li>sincerely recommend this back brush.&lt;br /&gt;Boston</li>
            <li>This scrubby makes showers more efficient... and my back is cleaner.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I didn&#x27;t buy another wooden one with the detachable head.  </li>
            <li>They are made from flimsy cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste money.</li>
            <li>Upon the end of the first use, I gave it one shake to sling the water out</li>
            <li>my mother bought me as a teen, for more than 3 decades.</li>
            <li>I should have ordered a better one - either with a wooden handle or with a rubber grip.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described</li>
            <li>Works great for a back scratch at the end of a long day :0)</li>
            <li>This is the first brush I&#x27;ve bought with a plastic handle.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s pretty slippery).</li>
            <li>love the handle that looks like tortoise shell but is plastic, cleanable and will last longer.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the box and ran my hand across the brush about 30 bristles fell off in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the brush and it appears to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The plastic handle is better than a wooden one for cleanliness purposes and is better designed to help reach the back.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid I was expecting a higher quality product.</li>
            <li>I feel that this brush cleans great and effectively, no matter the</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been through many different ones!</li>
            <li>This one looked like what I wanted and the first time I used it, I was hooked.</li>
            <li>one cleans my back much better.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>This would have been dandy, if not for the fact that it broke when first used, the brush end broke off the handle end.  </li>
            <li>Definitely more durable that the wooden ones</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>I would buy this again, most likely.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I got this to be able to scrub my back.</li>
            <li>soft texture makes it a gentle tool for bath or shower and if you like a more gentle brush this will do the job.</li>
            <li>First, it works.</li>
            <li>Bristles kind of rough.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>The trick is to lather the soap on the brush first, then use it.</li>
            <li>Nice brush, good quality, this brush will not lose all the fiber in a short time, and it&#x27;s long enough</li>
            <li>Stiff bristles give a good scrub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty big guy at 6&#x27; 4&amp;#34; and this brush does a really good job reaching my back, legs, and feet.</li>
            <li>However, I have seen on some other products an application of a gripper, or groves, anything to help out would be nice.  </li>
            <li>It gets two stars for sturdy construction, which is much better than the brush I had previously which felt great but disintegrated after a few uses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the old fashioned wash rag for years, but never quite felt clean until I purchased this brush.  </li>
            <li>but brush to soft to clean.</li>
            <li>not as soft as my old fuller brush, but since they don&#x27;t make the one I had anymore, this one seems to work okay</li>
            <li>I have looked in several big box stores for a good, durable bath brush.  </li>
            <li>The straight handle is so much better for the back.</li>
            <li>The brush is comfortable in the hand and curved just right for washing your back.</li>
            <li>So pleased with this long handle bath brush.  </li>
            <li>The angle of the handle is great for getting the back and other parts of the body.</li>
            <li>The last one I had, had a wooden handle that fit into a slot on top of the brush.</li>
            <li>Those have very sturdy bristles and scrub nicely, but after a while the bristles get soft and some kind of dark mold or something begins to take over the on the wooden surface where the bristles are embedded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old brush alway hung correct lasting twenty plus years clean and strong.</li>
            <li>not real soft, a nice scrub for non sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This brush, I would say, is better suited for dry brushing.  </li>
            <li>This one is easy to manipulate to any area on your back, no prob!  </li>
            <li>But this back brush is sooooo easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The curve of the handle makes it easy to use for back scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>I can easily reach any spot on my back.  </li>
            <li>easy to reach back.</li>
            <li>The curved handle makes it easy to reach all the places on my back that I wish to scrub.  </li>
            <li>so you can get your back easily.  </li>
            <li>It is a good balance of rigidity and stiffness and I think this brush is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li>This brush seems very well made, with a strong long handle that is bent for better reach, my others have disintegrated or handle break within a short time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>but yet strong enough bristles.  </li>
            <li>Long enough with a good curve.</li>
            <li>My hands are extra large and I am fairly strong disc golf player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have no complaints and would certainly buy again -</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this as it was what i have been looking for</li>
            <li>This has a particularly long handle and is arched properly for the task, but the mixture of boar and synthetic bristles is, I suspect, best suited for wet use, for which the brush is designed.  </li>
            <li>The handle is nice and long, with just the right curve to reach the middle of my back easily from any angle.  </li>
            <li>really helps you reach your back easily.</li>
            <li>The smooth plastic handle is a little slippery if your hands are soapy, but the grip is fine otherwise.  </li>
            <li>I rub the soap on the bristles and it lathers up fine enough.</li>
            <li>The handle definitely is slippery if your hands are soapy, but if you wash any soap off your hands before handling the brush the grip should be fine.</li>
            <li>not recommend unless used commercially however length and finish are fine</li>
            <li>I have a very high threshold for pain</li>
            <li>Although it won&#x27;t connect to the internet, it works just fine on my long torso (I am 6&amp;#34; 03&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>Why is it so hard to find a good product we use daily?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the extremely hard and cheap one that I bought that tried to scrub or better yet scrape away my life.</li>
            <li>The handle is the right length and angle, the bristles are firm but very comfortable, it held the soap lather well and so forth.</li>
            <li>The long curved handle is strong and makes it easy to scrub my back and the bristles are nice and stiff.  </li>
            <li>That may very well be the case.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO  EVERYONE !  </li>
            <li>but I would have kicked someone you know where if anyone but myself was putting me through this much pain.</li>
            <li>The handle really isn&#x27;t that slippery when it is soaped up.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and is built well.</li>
            <li>The brush is bent concave instead of convex like some others.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really resemble</li>
            <li>It needs to be bigger around and not so smooth.</li>
            <li>brush really hurts my skin, and after i finish showering my skin itches.</li>
            <li>Thanks -</li>
            <li>Gentle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and looks as if it&#x27;s never been used it.</li>
            <li>and it allows me to lather soap really well.  </li>
            <li>and it is much sturdier than the one I had before.  </li>
            <li>, it really is durable -</li>
            <li>Did not give it 5 stars because it really does not look like tortoise shell..</li>
            <li>you are  really  </li>
            <li>Really like this.  </li>
            <li>but I really like this for the price.</li>
            <li>This device is very durable.  </li>
            <li>I really like this bath brush.</li>
            <li>The whole amazon review process is abused by shills and saboteurs, which you can read all about</li>
            <li>There is no give in the handle which means you can apply as much pressure as you want to the head without worrying about snapping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>thanks Steve</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews more carefully before ordering this.</li>
            <li>Seems very sturdy</li>
            <li>With wet or soapy hands this thing is more like a weapon.</li>
            <li>and it is very scratchy.</li>
            <li>However, the plastic handle is very slippery</li>
            <li>The brush is much rougher than I wanted.</li>
            <li>The handle is smooth plastic, but it has a rivet in the middle for your fingers to dig in.</li>
            <li>I really feel like thins</li>
            <li>This brush really exfoliates, it does get slippery though.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and work really well.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>Bought it for Christmas for the wife, but it&#x27;s really for me.</li>
            <li>It reaches and scubs very well.  </li>
            <li>Brush is very sturdy as well.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re sturdy yet gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just rough enough to give you a good scrubb and massage your skin.</li>
            <li>The angle on the handle is perfect for reaching behind the back.  </li>
            <li>Spent quite a bit of time searching for a good back brush to use in our shower.</li>
            <li>Brush head is nice and firm.</li>
            <li>It is also nice ot have the plastic handle that is not going to mildew or come aprt after a few months.</li>
            <li>After scrubbing my back, the water stings just a tad, letting me know that I have actually exposed new skin, as the brush successfully exfoliated the old.  </li>
            <li>Nice and stiff, you know where it&#x27;s been.  </li>
            <li>This has just the right amount of firmness to the bristles; not too soft and not too</li>
            <li>Buy this brush, it&#x27;s sturdy and effective, and the bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff.</li>
            <li>Long reaching easy to manuever.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was wonderful to use it on my back and it takes very little pressure to get a through cleaning of your back.</li>
            <li>Originally I had five stars for this shower back brush.  </li>
            <li>this product holds up much better than other brands that i&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>elegant  than the other brand, and  the plastic  </li>
            <li>Too bad the VP of finance didn&#x27;t go along with the engineers and make it the perfect brush in the first place.</li>
            <li>After 43 years my back is finally clean.</li>
            <li>So with this brush I can clean the neglected parts of my back.</li>
            <li>Helps keep your back clean</li>
            <li>Just what I needed to properly clean my back when in the shower.</li>
            <li>The bristles have just enough hardness and flexibility to give a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is some kind of gripper on the handle as it does tend to slip some, but that is a minor thing to us.</li>
            <li>This brush provides a nice scrub and is long enough to clean your back.</li>
            <li>I believe the brush should last a nice long while.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I actually found the curved shape ill-conceived, making only the top of the brush contact my back comfortably.</li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty stiff, which I love.</li>
            <li>This one is comfortable and has a long reach without the head falling off.  </li>
            <li>this is just what is needed for the rainy spring and hot summer (so far).</li>
            <li>Some people have gripes that it is slippery, but I have found this is only true if your hands are soapy.</li>
            <li>Would make a suitable floor scrub brush,too stiff to lather bar</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s slightly curved</li>
            <li>purchased *THIS PARTICULAR Style/Model:  &amp;#34;Swissco</li>
            <li>This is a decent brush.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>have always thought that as men, we can do better than a washcloth, or a simply bar of soap rubbed over one&#x27;s hairy body, with the subsequent attachment of all the unsightly hairs to the bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent quality.  </li>
            <li>like the natural bristles much better, but the wood is compromised by always being wet and</li>
            <li>Those lucky enough not to have shoulder issues it would not matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, tho, to really scrub your skin.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are stiff, but not to hard which is perfect.</li>
            <li>The Swissco Delux Bath Brush meets my needs; good reach length for the back with flexible but stiff bristles for a stimulating scrub.  </li>
            <li>The brush is not as stiff as the description suggests and doesn&#x27;t do a really good job of back scrubbing.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Found them in a catalog for much high price</li>
            <li>So I bought this with high hopes.</li>
            <li>Buy it, high recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this .</li>
            <li>*DELUXE (One-Piece) Bath Brush/Tortoise, (as other similar model/style, by Swissco, is 2-pc, and per reviews, falls apart) for my 6&#x27; 4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>To scratch one&#x27;s own back is divine, even when you have other options.</li>
            <li>While the bristles start out as being a bit tough, they have softened out over time and now deliver good exfoliation with no irritation.</li>
            <li>The design of the brush itself is nice, but the bristles are too hard and feel like they are scratching me.</li>
            <li>The handle has a nice curve that makes getting to those hard spots easier.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a substantial brush that could easily reach the middle of my back, and that had stiff enough bristles to do a good job of exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase as it is a great quality</li>
            <li>I like my back brush to SCRUB, so most back brushes have bristles that are too soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristles feel soft, but when you actually use it, it is quite firm, gives you a fairly invigorating scrub.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if thats a good thing yet or not - maybe they will last longer?</li>
            <li>I really liked the look of this brush so disregarded the negative reviews</li>
            <li>It works pretty good but the angle of the brush still makes it a bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li>The latter is especially important in the Winter, when the air is extra dry from heaters and such.  </li>
            <li>other than that, the ergonomic design works fine for me.</li>
            <li>im disabled and this brush has strong yet gentle bristles.</li>
            <li>Keep my back feeling right</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ecotools Bamboo Bristle Bath Brush  - feels great at first, but all bamboo brushed have gained mold in less than a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been in need of a new brush, so taking a chance</li>
            <li>I use this bath brush every day; it looks almost new.  </li>
            <li>Brush is nice, not too hard, not too soft.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I needed something that better helped me scrub difficult-to-reach places (back, mainly).</li>
            <li>The handle is a bit slick if you have soapy hands, but the bristles are the right stiffness and the one-piece design is much better than the wooden varieties.</li>
            <li>If I were to buy a brush again, I would look for a less slippery one, but this brush is good enough that I wouldn&#x27;t do so until this one wears out (or I actually drop it on my toe).</li>
            <li>handle is smooth, but I have no trouble holding onto it with a wet hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more opaque light reddish-brown with a few swirls of black.</li>
            <li>dry quickly and therefore resist mold and mildew.</li>
            <li>The wooden handle has more friction and grip when wet.</li>
            <li>all others broke very early after purchase.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft</li>
            <li>The long curved handle makes brushing the back easy but is slippery if you have soap on your hands.</li>
            <li>Great brush to reach those hard to reach places on your upper and lower back, your thighs, even your chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only problem is that the handle gets very slippery in the shower!  </li>
            <li>Best brush ever - still holds bristle share after months of heavy use - I&#x27;m a scrubber big time and this holds up with a long arm to reach the middle of my back.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted and needed plus the simple plastic cover protected the brush as needed.</li>
            <li>I need something that is more like 24 inches to reach all of my back due to some arthritis in my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I had bought a back brush in a drug store that broke the first week</li>
            <li>This Swissco is way better than the more expensive Fuller Brush back brush.</li>
            <li>The only problem is, he dropped the first one on our ceramic tile shower floor and it broke, so we had to buy another.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to wash my back and it does exactly that</li>
            <li>Nice and stiff, seems pretty durable, hard to wax poetic about a back washer.</li>
            <li>The design of the brush is perfect, the other ones I&#x27;ve owned had a straight handle which made it awkward to use.  </li>
            <li>Firm brush with a strong handle, not like the junk 2 piece ones.  </li>
            <li>and they are still as strong and firm as when purchased.  </li>
            <li>Not too soft not too hard just right to actually clean.</li>
            <li>I would go a little longer and a touch firmer, but this works fine.</li>
            <li>Very important to let the water and minor soap drain down and away from bristle attachment into head.</li>
            <li>brush ok but handle a little too short for me</li>
            <li>The bristles have lost little stiffness after more than a year, and only one or two ever fell out.</li>
            <li>This brush is nice looking and it gets the job done reaching those hard to reach places on your back.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles are softer than I&#x27;m used to (I&#x27;m used to a really stiff and abrasive brush), but it still scrubs and exfoliates perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I bought a total three of these brushes and all are holding up very well.</li>
            <li>No trouble with it in the shower so far.</li>
            <li>This was a purchase for my mother whom is 78 yrs young and needed help.</li>
            <li>It is an old Fuller brand with nylon bristles too far apart for soap lathering IMHO.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin you might want a softer brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Allows me to reach my back in the shower and exfoliates very well.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer a stiffer bristle to really stimulate the skin, and blood flow too it.</li>
            <li>It nearly took the skin off my body.</li>
            <li>Soft against you skin, so soothing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a year and like everything about it so far.  </li>
            <li>Seems like this is from the 70&#x27;s in that it feel cheap and like it&#x27;s been waiting on a shelf for a few years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also slips out of my hands frequently because of the slippery handle.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it.  </li>
            <li>i like that, but if you want a soft brush, this is not it.  </li>
            <li>my old one</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>They are soft.</li>
            <li>but they were all too soft.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not as soft as it should be.</li>
            <li>If I use it enough to spread around soap, it feels like it is ready to take off the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far no problems to report with this brush.  </li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t make a natural bristle with a plastic handle.</li>
            <li>I have found the answer to a body scrubber is not the rather soft bristles here.</li>
            <li>Not too soft.</li>
            <li>Very well made, should last forever.</li>
            <li>, It is classy but doesn&#x27;t attract a lot of germs.  </li>
            <li>This Swissco brush was more expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to reach all parts of my back and the brush isn&#x27;t too firm</li>
            <li>Stiff bristles give good cleaning action with little pressure.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a little stiff but that is probably a good thing.</li>
            <li>I found the bristles just right for wet brushing.</li>
            <li>I like that this is not a wooden one that is harder to keep clean and that cracks over time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the tortoise shell color, but it didn&#x27;t come in any other color.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t lather much, as others have noted, but lather doesn&#x27;t mean clean.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that once you add soap the handle is very slippery, making it easy to drop.  </li>
            <li>I purchase a high end brush from a bath specific store.  </li>
            <li>Once when I was attempting to clean some of my generous folds, half a ham sandwich fell out!  </li>
            <li>Occasionally, the brush is a little rough for my tastes and can feel quite scratchy, but it does have a nice design and an understated look to it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it particularly slick, but it is smooth so if you have soapy hands it may slip.</li>
            <li>Bristles are a bit rough at first</li>
            <li>Not the deep amber transparent/translucent you would normally associate with tortoise colored plastic.</li>
            <li>I like to be able to scrub my back and had tried the wooden devices sold at Target, etc., which fell apart after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li>First, I found the handle to be quite slippery when wet.</li>
            <li>bristles felt a little too stiff at first use, switched back to my natural boar bristle and realized this brush just felt better.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the plastic is a little slippery when wet and soapy, but I&#x27;ll bet it is more durable than wood</li>
            <li>It is easy to use from any angle and gets that hard to reach place just inside the shoulder blades.</li>
            <li>I have not had problems of the scrubber slipping as some other reviewers, a rubberized or textured grip would be an easy improvement.</li>
            <li>and it seems strong enough that I shouldn&#x27;t break the handle bearing down like the last one</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone that wants to clean their back well or hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>Just the right stiffness to really satisfy the itch and massage the back - but not so stiff as to be abrasive.</li>
            <li>but my skin really is just too sensitive for this harder bristle.  </li>
            <li>The curve handle makes it so much easier to reach your entire back effortlessly.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right, soft but firm.</li>
            <li>Also, this brush, at least for me, foams up just fine.</li>
            <li>Very durable brush; much sturdier than the wooden brushes I&#x27;d previously purchased.</li>
            <li>And the straight handle allows the brush to sit flat on my back.</li>
            <li>A little harsh on the bristles but other than that, it is great for one to reach the back and lower legs.</li>
            <li>and it still has the right amount of firmness without being too stiff and soft enough for decent back scrubbing.</li>
            <li>It sounds kind of hillbilly but the only brush I&#x27;ve found that is both long enough and stiff enough for me</li>
            <li>job,&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are firm and the handle is easy to hang up to dry.</li>
            <li>so its comfortable to use, and the extra long handle certainly helps getting to those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the handle it should have an anti-slip application since the smooth plastic handle can become slippery and hard to hold when soaped up.</li>
            <li>However Swissco long handle has smooth ROUND edges.</li>
            <li>Handle is long so doing the whole back is easier.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive to the touch skin, you might want a brush with softer bristles, but I can use this one on my back, arms, legs, chest, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the same old Fuller brush</li>
            <li>but when wet and soapy get&#x27;s very slippery, should have texture or molded in shape of some type.</li>
            <li>I got this brush because I wanted a curved fixed head back brush.</li>
            <li>The only problem thus far is once you get the handle soapy you can&#x27;t hang onto it.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a wooden brush with natural bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also good for dirty kneecaps and elbows.</li>
            <li>The handle is long enough with a little curve to make it easier to use and it rinses off easily under the shower.</li>
            <li>I actually use the brush for a back scratcher, I&#x27;m disabled and can&#x27;t reach my back easily with my hands.</li>
            <li>Getting a little older and can&#x27;t reach to wash my back very well.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are the right texture, where it&#x27;s hard enough to scrub your back to leave you with that clean feeling while not being too rough on your skin.</li>
            <li>I needed a new one not because it was wearing, but because of health concern having  something that long that in use on my body.</li>
            <li>The handle is definitely built tough as I bear down a fair amount</li>
            <li>Keeps those hard to reach areas clean.  </li>
            <li>While the bristles are good, not too stiff and not too soft, and the brush is long enough to reach the hard places, there is one basic flaw; the handle is slicker than goose poop.</li>
            <li>last set of 3 brushes made of wood and natural bristles did last a couple years but the brush head would routinely slip off the handle in use and sometimes land on my toes - ouch!.</li>
            <li>if this brush felt as soft to my mid back as it did to the palm of my hand, i would give it five stars.</li>
            <li>The cheap brush&#x27;s thin ribbon, used instead of the rope, dries completely between uses.</li>
            <li>I love that the brush is firm but not so firm that it hurts.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I won&#x27;t have to replace it for a few years, but even if it only lasts a year, it&#x27;ll have been worth it for the price and satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Someone said the bristles were not real hard and not real soft</li>
            <li>Not so hard it hurt my skin, but hard enough that I felt I was getting a good scrub</li>
            <li>Not sure why, but good bath brushes are really hard to find in drug stores!</li>
            <li>I had great hopes for this brush but was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li>Its medium firm so it does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I thought maybe they were a bit harsh.</li>
            <li>After using the Earth Therapeutics Feng Shui Back Brush with Ergo Grip, which two of them broke in the same place right above the rubber grip handle in less than 2 weeks, this brush out performs that brush by leaps and bounds.</li>
            <li>The bristles are strong but not so tough that they hurt.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the handle is flat and wide and does not allow for a good grip, and the plastic finish on the handle makes it slippery when soapy.  </li>
            <li>The only down side is the handle is VERY slippery with soapy hands.</li>
            <li>It is a very long handle and has just the right slight curve for reaching anywhere on your back.</li>
            <li>Well made, soft bristles and long enough to reach those itchy spots no matter where on your back they might be.</li>
            <li>I have ordered three other brushes and was unhappy with them as the handle slipped from the head of the first brush,  second brush broke in half, and the last brush was double the price and did not feel good during use.</li>
            <li>As others have said, it can be a little slippery if you get a bunch of soap on the handle, but no so much that I&#x27;ve ever dropped it or found it to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing that has given me some issues is the handle is very slippery when you have even a little soap on it.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are a little soft compared to a natural hog bristle wooden brush I owned that cracked and shed the prickly pieces all over the shower floor.  </li>
            <li>Its very well constructed, the bristles neither too soft nor too hard</li>
            <li>Having, suffered from a dull tortoise for years, imagine my delight when I found the answer to several litanies and more than a few human sacrifices.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> :o)</li>
            <li> Great brush - was hoping for a stiffer bristle brush, and this one fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> It was good, but the cord it came on came removed so I can no longer hang it up.</li>

            <li> the price, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> The one piece construction is superior to the removable handle types out there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, this is a good brush.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a good bath brush.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t order it because the photo of the product shows the handle without a loop at the end to hang it from a shower caddy, but the reviews were so good</li>
            <li> Good length and curve on handle.</li>
            <li> The handle looks serviceable and the brush seems to be of good quality.</li>

            <li> I bought this product based on the good reviews that it received.  </li>
            <li> Feels as good as the one I payed 50.00 for</li>
            <li> over all good quality brush.</li>
            <li> A good men&#x27;s bath</li>
            <li> It is a good man&#x27;s brown tortoise, and the bristles are a mix of nylon and boar&#x27;s bristle.  </li>
            <li> But it does work good at scrubbing the tires on my truck.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the plastic is good quality at all.</li>
            <li> You need to rinse all the soap off of your hand to get a good grip.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate it is a good quality product</li>
            <li> Eventually softened up and is good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, well designed, has good bristles, and is well balanced.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the brush looks great.</li>
            <li> Good value over all.</li>
            <li> The company did make good on the purchase price, however.  </li>
            <li> Good quality brush.  </li>
            <li> LOL  Enter Swissco Deluxe brush.  </li>
            <li> good for exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li> I love the best, and certainly this is the best bath brush I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get super sudsy like a loofah, but I think it&#x27;s perfectly sufficient for a brush.</li>
            <li> A VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the utility this brush provides and cannot imagine how it could be improved.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a brush with a bit more firmness in the bristles, this one works great for that.</li>
            <li> It works better than anything else I have tried to date, so I am happy.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush;  pluses include the long, curved handle and the perfect stiffness of bristle.  </li>
            <li> Nice coarseness, good exfoliating feeling.</li>
            <li> Works great, bristles feel good and it is easy to reach all the spots that I can otherwise reach.  </li>
            <li> and I love the curved handle!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Great bristles - don&#x27;t need a lot of pressure to get a good clean.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased this brush and was very impressed with the positive feedback.  </li>
            <li> This has a nice look in the bath sleek and beautiful and has a nice angle that seems to be perfect for my husbands back.</li>
            <li> but fortunately it lived up to the great Reviews here.  </li>
            <li> Nice curve to the handle</li>
            <li> While this brush looks nice, it doesn&#x27;t feel that way.</li>
            <li> it gets the area that I cant reach and there is nothing better than a good scrubbing in an area that you cant reach</li>
            <li> and then you&#x27;ve got the water attacking the wood which isn&#x27;t so nice.</li>
            <li> Ez to use, hangs nicely in shower stall.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than many wimpy ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Handle is great shape and lenght</li>
            <li> The person was thrilled to receive it.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never had any problems getting a nice, soapy lather.  </li>
            <li> T is handy to use,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks nice.</li>
            <li> I used to own two boats; they had to be taken out of the water once a year to have the barnacles scraped off the bottom.</li>
            <li> If they could make this brush with a handle that really lets you grip, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This was so nicely made that I ordered another one for a friend.  </li>
            <li> Well made, looks nice.  </li>
            <li> Perfect and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Nice bath brush.</li>
            <li> Good brush, I just wish it had a handle that offered more traction when covered in soap.</li>
            <li> Nice brush...</li>
            <li> Nice bristles too</li>
            <li> This brush is NICE.</li>
            <li> Nice, sturdy brush with not-too-hard, not-too-soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a nice feel - tingle but not irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so well that I bought two of them (one for each bath).</li>
            <li> Nice length, sturdy nylon bristles.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> easy rinse off and just a really good brush.</li>
            <li> I love Swissco products and I love a good tortoise shell as well.</li>
            <li> Been trying to find a good back brush for the shower for months and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great, and exactly was I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> I t is an excellent product for older people to use when showering or bathing as it does an outstanding job..</li>
            <li> Great item, useful and sturdy</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give the Swissco Deluxe Bath Brush a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> The brush is great but the loop of line to hang it isn&#x27;t worth anything.  </li>
            <li> I liked the reviews and love the brush.</li>
            <li> But this brush is still going strong!  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend for workmanship and durability!</li>
            <li> This one seemed to be the best available brush, and sold  a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This one still looks good and keeps clean.  </li>
            <li> Very nice, right curvature to the handle.</li>
            <li> but it gives a nice clean scrub!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews of many different ones I went with the Swissco Deluxe and it is perfect.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice brush to hang for easy use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Really ATTRACTIVE, PERFECT MED/firm Bristles (NOT TOO FIRM or SCRATCHY), Easy Clean/Sanitize.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine -- nice quality</li>
            <li> but I do love it.</li>
            <li> Just love this brush.</li>
            <li> I may buy more yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for 4 days now, and it&#x27;s one of the best bath back brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I have bought too many bath brushes to count and this one has standed the test of time.  </li>
            <li> I make sure to spray hydrogen peroxide on it and rub it with coconut oil for germ concerns.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Will provide years of use, w/basic care, (UNLESS STOLEN :)  </li>
            <li> I needed a back bath brush and this one looked to be the best one.</li>
            <li> Best back brush on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> to loop over most shower handles or faucets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I will go shopping for a better one and retire this to cleaning purposes.</li>
            <li> With the bike handle-bar tape wrap to increase size for gripping</li>
            <li> Yerba is better as hand brush without handle.</li>
            <li> you want and buy brushes more often.</li>
            <li> Love it  </li>
            <li> we are glad we chose this one</li>
            <li> and so glad I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I chose this brush.</li>
            <li> I am sure this story sounds familiar!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> If you can find a better bath brush, please let me know.</li>
            <li> Excellent bristle stiffness,great curve on handle to facilitate washing back.</li>
            <li> I really love this bath brush and I would recommend to everyone looking to buy the perfect brush for their back.</li>
            <li> and I love it .</li>
            <li> am pleased.</li>
            <li> Every man will like this brush for sure.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me since I had back surgery</li>
            <li> the perfect back brush...for me!</li>
            <li> The brush is okay quality.</li>
            <li> Use it mostly for my feet.</li>
            <li> The handle is shaped perfectly to allow access to all back areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with the brush</li>
            <li> love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Ordered two more</li>
            <li> It was not day for me to locate a good back brush and this one is great..</li>
            <li> There are better</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, too many of these scrubbers suck.  </li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> AWESOME BRUSH FOR THE BACK</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST BACK BRUSH THAT</li>
            <li> Needs a better grip on the handle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tolerable but if it felt any coarser i would surely have returned it.</li>
            <li> Not as smooth but gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful on my back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d gladly buy this product again if need be.</li>
            <li> I have had many bath brushes over the years.</li>
            <li> This is better.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a better brush that would not break and I read that this one wouldn&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li> I love the wood look to go with our steam room</li>
            <li> The ergonomic handle is a real plus since you can reach better and just about anywhere with great ease even the bottoms of your feet.</li>
            <li> Excellent back brush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the ones you find at Walmart or Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li> I love using this brush.  </li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s the perfect texture for scrubbing his back</li>
            <li> Also, the bristles seem to be more durable, they haven&#x27;t started to look worn or mashed.  </li>
            <li> This is more like it.  </li>
            <li> Feels awesome on my back.</li>
            <li> Much better than the plastic bristle models.</li>
            <li> Glad I did the research before buying this product.</li>
            <li> But as lovely as this is it&#x27;s not for me.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad i did</li>
            <li> Bought 3 of these, and probably should get some more.</li>
            <li> One of my better purchases.</li>
            <li> More like sandpaper than a bath brush.</li>
            <li> It is a much better design and a quality product.</li>
            <li> It is an OK brush</li>
            <li> My grandson was pleased to receive this</li>
            <li> This rope never dries, which I&#x27;m sure the microbes love.</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with the value of this bath brush.  </li>
            <li> We were using the stick more than the scrubber head...</li>
            <li> The bristles are just the right stiffness to give a good scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> The brush is just the right firmness we like and feels good using it.</li>
            <li> The brush is a good size and the handle is angled just right.</li>
            <li> Bristles are, well, bristle-y, but about right for a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Creates a great lather also, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Well OK, a wooden handle would be nice, but I&#x27;ve had a great one one of those and the problem is the finish wears off</li>
            <li> Good craftsmanship and shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Handle is long and the curve is perfect.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as he needed a new shower brush, he is very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Started the New Year with  another happy purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The smooth plastic this is made of is attractive, sturdy and is holding up well to extended use, but it gets very slippery.</li>
            <li> I DO now use it as a dry brush and it feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li> The brush is a very good back brush if you like a loofah which I do.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, very nice, good looking, and stiffer bristles, which is what I am always&lt;br /&gt;looking</li>
            <li> The customer photo that someone else posted is more accurate for color.</li>
            <li> Im giving it 2 stars because it worked great on my feet removing old skin.</li>
            <li> The brush head is large and the strong bristles give you a good scrub, which is what I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But other than this, this is my best bath brush ever!</li>
            <li> It hangs up and is easy to get hold of.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a brush that wasn&#x27;t wood and that wouldn&#x27;t rot out very quickly</li>
            <li> Oh so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The plastic handle is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> It easily hangs on the shower hot/cold handles or shower head pipe.  </li>
            <li> The length of the handle allows for easy over the shoulder reach.  </li>
            <li> It performs well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> so easy to reach those &amp;#34;hard to get to places&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> After having thrown out too many bath brushes with wooden handles because of mildew, I was happy to find this one.</li>
            <li> Great idea to bend it for better back scratching with bristles that don&#x27;t stab you but bend and scrub as hoped for.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Have used this for about a year now (2-3 times a week), and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> A decent brush with good bristles that hold body wash well.</li>
            <li> guess it would be OK if someone wants that kind of a &amp;#34;vigorous&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Really nice bath brush that does a good job of rubbing soap around and also getting that itching back during the winter months!  </li>
            <li> The bristles are strongly attached so they never fall out over time.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This brush works fine.</li>
            <li> works just fine.</li>
            <li> This works fine.</li>
            <li> Nice long handle with a good shape to grip.</li>
            <li> Length is fine</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This brush is light, the bristles strong, and scrub well.</li>
            <li> The texture of the bristles is just as good as my first Swissco, and the plastic handle makes the whole brush more durable.  </li>
            <li> The description says \\&quot;Perfectly fit your hand for a secure grip which makes it so easy to use.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I have tried many more with limited success, but this brush is great.</li>
            <li> I like using the Yerba head alone in hand for arms, chest, legs, but it is rougher than Swissco so press lightly and wait til skin toughens or bristles soften with use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just smooth plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to reach my back and it does a great</li>
            <li> It feels great scrubbing my back.</li>
            <li> I ordered it anyway, and to my happy surprise, it arrived WITH a white rope loop attached at the end of the handle to hang it up by.</li>
            <li> He says it is gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy  to clean.</li>
            <li> But if you are into removing dead skin cells this is an excellent brush.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tell you how happy it made my back.  </li>
            <li> but it just looks like cheap plastic</li>
            <li> This brush works great for scrubbing my back with body wash, as well as putting lotion or body oil on it after my shower.  </li>
            <li> They are too cheap and break.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it was curved, rather than straight handled, but either it was damaged in shipping, or when shipped.</li>
            <li> As described, easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> The bristles are great and the shape of the handle does make washing my back easier.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice, heavy plastic, but has a great appearance of tortoise.</li>
            <li> So far so good, what can I say about a brush.  </li>
            <li> Long, beautiful, luxurious.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, feels good, does the job, shows no sign of wear after 13 months of frequent use.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been good so far,</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s a great brush, I&#x27;ve had one for a long time, it&#x27;s stayed as good as new.</li>
            <li> Very useful brush to wash those hard-to-reach areas of my body.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping, new, good price.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not stiff, they are more on the soft side, but it has a large brush which gathers lots of lather, works great!</li>
            <li> It holds soap really well &amp; is VERY easy to rinse off between uses.  </li>
            <li> just what I wanted real bristle and very long handle, appears to be perfect</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Great for my thicker skinned feet, but not soft back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used it all I could think was it would be better for cleaning a grill.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this bath brush in the mail.</li>
            <li> this brush is good quality and it is fine for brushing your back.</li>
            <li> back/bath brushes, 1 loofah sponge-on-a-stick, 2 loofah sponge pads on a cloth with rope handles and 2 nylon mesh back brushes and this is the best one by far.</li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t mildew, and snapped the head clean OFF.</li>
            <li> and I rarely say anything is easy to use anymore.  </li>
            <li> we using the brush to clean the bathroom tub and sink.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, the handle is long enough and the bristles are a perfect texture.</li>
            <li> This brush has a curved handle that is just right and has strong bristles.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are just right, giving me a nice scrubbing and the handle is nice and long.  </li>
            <li> Very nice bristles and very long handle.  </li>
            <li> The angle is perfect as well and gets those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Great, except the braided cord becomes unknotted when wet</li>
            <li> Amazing and soft.</li>
            <li> Nice looking and soft bristles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> good back and leg scrubber.</li>
            <li> WOULD LIKE STRAIGHT HANDLE BETTER.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush.</li>
            <li> It is true that this brush does not produce a lather but that does not diminish its cleaning ability.  </li>
            <li> I left it on and that gives the handle a really good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t as coarse as I thought they&#x27;d be (and that&#x27;s good).</li>
            <li> He, too, thought the bristles were too soft until he tried it and he liked it</li>
            <li> and I cannot say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> A nice medium between hard/stiff and soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, bristles are a bit soft.  </li>
            <li> Good back brush.</li>
            <li> to let you know you&#x27;re super clean.  </li>
            <li> The brush soaps up nicely and the bristles offer just the right tactile feel for a satisfying back scrub.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable, well sized with just the right firmness of bristles.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;BEAUTIFUL&amp;#34;  AND &amp;#34; BEST QUALITY&amp;#34;,  per E-x-t-e-n-s-i-v-e  Research, (even much more expensive),</li>
            <li> looks super</li>
            <li> that the handle is attached not wedged into the head like those bamboo ones, and the reach is adequate.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a perfect length and arch to reach the hard-to-reach places on your back and the construction seems so much better than others I have purchased where the bristles started falling out after less than a year&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Has a must have rope on it to hang it up in the shower and is very sturdy and feels great on your back.  </li>
            <li> and it was necessary to wrap the end with waterproof tape for better gripping.</li>
            <li> Anything this good is likely to disappear from the market, so I&#x27;m taking no chances and buying another right away as insurance.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it perfect is if the brisltes held soap a little better.</li>
            <li> Very pretty too.</li>
            <li> Good sturdy design, I hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit stronger than I like, but overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever had beats the old wood brush hands down.</li>
            <li> One excellent characteristic is that it holds up well to ten minutes of boiling water exposure for sanitizing.</li>
            <li> This brush has great firm bristles and the arch in the handle</li>
            <li> The smooth plastic handle is very slippery when you have soap on your hands.</li>
            <li> This works very well and does not feel or look cheap.  </li>
            <li> The head is firm and does a great job in the shower.</li>
            <li> Lots like this one and Swissco makes quality combs so worth a try.</li>
            <li> Amazon wins with me.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li> I used to own a Swissco brush with a wooden (or maybe bamboo) handle.  </li>
            <li> Loving this brush sturdy and holds up to daily use .  </li>
            <li> The main thing is that it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I prefer a stiffer brush and this one seemed too soft to my hands but ended up being great for my back.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Otherwise this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Although this brush has a nice look and feel, the bristles were not  enough for me.</li>
            <li> The brush is well designed and worth the investment.</li>
            <li> The only problem with it is, the smoothness of the handle makes it a bit slippery, Otherwise, a nice quality product.</li>
            <li> Provides a nice angle of attack to get all of your back.  </li>
            <li> Tried some others that were just too soft, the Swissco is coarse enough, good scrub, good cleaning.</li>
            <li> Love the natural bristles...</li>
            <li> I picked up a cheap brush at a local Bed Bath and Beyond, and it&#x27;s much more to my liking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend and worth the money.</li>
            <li> First I thought it was from water in a new place i moved to, but then the times I did not use the brush, skin was OK.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how hard it was to find a good bath brush!  </li>
            <li> It is the right length, the right thickness ( don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ll break it) not too slippery ( if you rinse your hand) and the brushes are just right for me.</li>
            <li> The curved handle is just right,</li>
            <li> I think its just the right amount of toughness.</li>
            <li> the  right  </li>
            <li> The bristles are just about the right level of stiffness and have held up well.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are just right.</li>
            <li> The length of the handle isn&#x27;t quite right.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right.</li>
            <li> and the handle is curved just right for comfort.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just there, right where you put it.</li>
            <li> Bristles offer right mixture of softness vs. effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush and does exactly what I purchased it for, scrubs my back in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The length and curve of the handle make it perfect if you are not very flexible and don&#x27;t have a long reach.</li>
            <li> The brush I owned previously had a head that was attached to the handle by a pressure fit, and would frequently fall off the handle, making ME fly off</li>
            <li> The handle makes it very easy to get to all parts of my back.  </li>
            <li> I think for anybody who wants a more grippy handle, they can rough up this handle with a brillo pad or some sandpaper to make it more grippy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice long handle which is also needed for anyone with shoulder</li>
            <li> This thing looks pretty, and was cheap enough to easily discard when it stops looking presentable.</li>
            <li> I even like the little curve it has to the brush, makes it perfect for back scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Not too hard, not too soft, a perfect brush for brushing.</li>
            <li> Solid construction, plastic has a nice \\&quot;grain\\&quot; to it, tough bristles, holds a good suz, cleans easy and drains well.</li>
            <li> My standard for a great back brush is one I got years ago from an Avon rep.</li>
            <li> nice soft brush to clean you back with soap while in the shower.  </li>
            <li> No Workie,handle too short, do not waste your money, this does not do a good job, thrown it in the trash</li>
            <li> Works great not to rough or soft.</li>
            <li> It looked liked the brush had been used, next time I will order straight from the company.</li>
            <li> Actually, I use it on my whole bod and feet, feels pretty nice.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm, just right for a good scrub.  </li>
            <li> This is a quality brush at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> A VERY gentle tug on some of the remaining bristles pulled out another 30 or so.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Microfiber Exfoliating Back Scrubber (which I found to be a pill to keep clean &amp; free of mold).  </li>
            <li> My back is really smooth now since, I can clean it efficiently.</li>
            <li> Bristles are not too hard, seem well secured and feel great on the skin.</li>
            <li> great with exception, if your hands are covered in soap, prepare yourself, its hard as hell to hold on to.</li>
            <li> sincerely recommend this back brush.&lt;br /&gt;Boston</li>
            <li> This scrubby makes showers more efficient... and my back is cleaner.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I didn&#x27;t buy another wooden one with the detachable head.  </li>
            <li> They are made from flimsy cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste money.</li>
            <li> Upon the end of the first use, I gave it one shake to sling the water out</li>
            <li> my mother bought me as a teen, for more than 3 decades.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered a better one - either with a wooden handle or with a rubber grip.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described</li>
            <li> Works great for a back scratch at the end of a long day :0)</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve bought with a plastic handle.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s pretty slippery).</li>
            <li> love the handle that looks like tortoise shell but is plastic, cleanable and will last longer.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the box and ran my hand across the brush about 30 bristles fell off in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the brush and it appears to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The plastic handle is better than a wooden one for cleanliness purposes and is better designed to help reach the back.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid I was expecting a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> I feel that this brush cleans great and effectively, no matter the</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been through many different ones!</li>
            <li> This one looked like what I wanted and the first time I used it, I was hooked.</li>
            <li> one cleans my back much better.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> This would have been dandy, if not for the fact that it broke when first used, the brush end broke off the handle end.  </li>
            <li> Definitely more durable that the wooden ones</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> I would buy this again, most likely.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I got this to be able to scrub my back.</li>
            <li> soft texture makes it a gentle tool for bath or shower and if you like a more gentle brush this will do the job.</li>
            <li> First, it works.</li>
            <li> Bristles kind of rough.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> The trick is to lather the soap on the brush first, then use it.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, good quality, this brush will not lose all the fiber in a short time, and it&#x27;s long enough</li>
            <li> Stiff bristles give a good scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty big guy at 6&#x27; 4&amp;#34; and this brush does a really good job reaching my back, legs, and feet.</li>
            <li> However, I have seen on some other products an application of a gripper, or groves, anything to help out would be nice.  </li>
            <li> It gets two stars for sturdy construction, which is much better than the brush I had previously which felt great but disintegrated after a few uses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the old fashioned wash rag for years, but never quite felt clean until I purchased this brush.  </li>
            <li> but brush to soft to clean.</li>
            <li> not as soft as my old fuller brush, but since they don&#x27;t make the one I had anymore, this one seems to work okay</li>
            <li> I have looked in several big box stores for a good, durable bath brush.  </li>
            <li> The straight handle is so much better for the back.</li>
            <li> The brush is comfortable in the hand and curved just right for washing your back.</li>
            <li> So pleased with this long handle bath brush.  </li>
            <li> The angle of the handle is great for getting the back and other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> The last one I had, had a wooden handle that fit into a slot on top of the brush.</li>
            <li> Those have very sturdy bristles and scrub nicely, but after a while the bristles get soft and some kind of dark mold or something begins to take over the on the wooden surface where the bristles are embedded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old brush alway hung correct lasting twenty plus years clean and strong.</li>
            <li> not real soft, a nice scrub for non sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This brush, I would say, is better suited for dry brushing.  </li>
            <li> This one is easy to manipulate to any area on your back, no prob!  </li>
            <li> But this back brush is sooooo easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The curve of the handle makes it easy to use for back scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> I can easily reach any spot on my back.  </li>
            <li> easy to reach back.</li>
            <li> The curved handle makes it easy to reach all the places on my back that I wish to scrub.  </li>
            <li> so you can get your back easily.  </li>
            <li> It is a good balance of rigidity and stiffness and I think this brush is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> This brush seems very well made, with a strong long handle that is bent for better reach, my others have disintegrated or handle break within a short time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> but yet strong enough bristles.  </li>
            <li> Long enough with a good curve.</li>
            <li> My hands are extra large and I am fairly strong disc golf player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have no complaints and would certainly buy again -</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this as it was what i have been looking for</li>
            <li> This has a particularly long handle and is arched properly for the task, but the mixture of boar and synthetic bristles is, I suspect, best suited for wet use, for which the brush is designed.  </li>
            <li> The handle is nice and long, with just the right curve to reach the middle of my back easily from any angle.  </li>
            <li> really helps you reach your back easily.</li>
            <li> The smooth plastic handle is a little slippery if your hands are soapy, but the grip is fine otherwise.  </li>
            <li> I rub the soap on the bristles and it lathers up fine enough.</li>
            <li> The handle definitely is slippery if your hands are soapy, but if you wash any soap off your hands before handling the brush the grip should be fine.</li>
            <li> not recommend unless used commercially however length and finish are fine</li>
            <li> I have a very high threshold for pain</li>
            <li> Although it won&#x27;t connect to the internet, it works just fine on my long torso (I am 6&amp;#34; 03&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to find a good product we use daily?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the extremely hard and cheap one that I bought that tried to scrub or better yet scrape away my life.</li>
            <li> The handle is the right length and angle, the bristles are firm but very comfortable, it held the soap lather well and so forth.</li>
            <li> The long curved handle is strong and makes it easy to scrub my back and the bristles are nice and stiff.  </li>
            <li> That may very well be the case.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO  EVERYONE !  </li>
            <li> but I would have kicked someone you know where if anyone but myself was putting me through this much pain.</li>
            <li> The handle really isn&#x27;t that slippery when it is soaped up.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and is built well.</li>
            <li> The brush is bent concave instead of convex like some others.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really resemble</li>
            <li> It needs to be bigger around and not so smooth.</li>
            <li> brush really hurts my skin, and after i finish showering my skin itches.</li>
            <li> Thanks -</li>
            <li> Gentle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and looks as if it&#x27;s never been used it.</li>
            <li> and it allows me to lather soap really well.  </li>
            <li> and it is much sturdier than the one I had before.  </li>
            <li> , it really is durable -</li>
            <li> Did not give it 5 stars because it really does not look like tortoise shell..</li>
            <li> you are  really  </li>
            <li> Really like this.  </li>
            <li> but I really like this for the price.</li>
            <li> This device is very durable.  </li>
            <li> I really like this bath brush.</li>
            <li> The whole amazon review process is abused by shills and saboteurs, which you can read all about</li>
            <li> There is no give in the handle which means you can apply as much pressure as you want to the head without worrying about snapping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thanks Steve</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews more carefully before ordering this.</li>
            <li> Seems very sturdy</li>
            <li> With wet or soapy hands this thing is more like a weapon.</li>
            <li> and it is very scratchy.</li>
            <li> However, the plastic handle is very slippery</li>
            <li> The brush is much rougher than I wanted.</li>
            <li> The handle is smooth plastic, but it has a rivet in the middle for your fingers to dig in.</li>
            <li> I really feel like thins</li>
            <li> This brush really exfoliates, it does get slippery though.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and work really well.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> Bought it for Christmas for the wife, but it&#x27;s really for me.</li>
            <li> It reaches and scubs very well.  </li>
            <li> Brush is very sturdy as well.</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re sturdy yet gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just rough enough to give you a good scrubb and massage your skin.</li>
            <li> The angle on the handle is perfect for reaching behind the back.  </li>
            <li> Spent quite a bit of time searching for a good back brush to use in our shower.</li>
            <li> Brush head is nice and firm.</li>
            <li> It is also nice ot have the plastic handle that is not going to mildew or come aprt after a few months.</li>
            <li> After scrubbing my back, the water stings just a tad, letting me know that I have actually exposed new skin, as the brush successfully exfoliated the old.  </li>
            <li> Nice and stiff, you know where it&#x27;s been.  </li>
            <li> This has just the right amount of firmness to the bristles; not too soft and not too</li>
            <li> Buy this brush, it&#x27;s sturdy and effective, and the bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff.</li>
            <li> Long reaching easy to manuever.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was wonderful to use it on my back and it takes very little pressure to get a through cleaning of your back.</li>
            <li> Originally I had five stars for this shower back brush.  </li>
            <li> this product holds up much better than other brands that i&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> elegant  than the other brand, and  the plastic  </li>
            <li> Too bad the VP of finance didn&#x27;t go along with the engineers and make it the perfect brush in the first place.</li>
            <li> After 43 years my back is finally clean.</li>
            <li> So with this brush I can clean the neglected parts of my back.</li>
            <li> Helps keep your back clean</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to properly clean my back when in the shower.</li>
            <li> The bristles have just enough hardness and flexibility to give a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is some kind of gripper on the handle as it does tend to slip some, but that is a minor thing to us.</li>
            <li> This brush provides a nice scrub and is long enough to clean your back.</li>
            <li> I believe the brush should last a nice long while.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I actually found the curved shape ill-conceived, making only the top of the brush contact my back comfortably.</li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty stiff, which I love.</li>
            <li> This one is comfortable and has a long reach without the head falling off.  </li>
            <li> this is just what is needed for the rainy spring and hot summer (so far).</li>
            <li> Some people have gripes that it is slippery, but I have found this is only true if your hands are soapy.</li>
            <li> Would make a suitable floor scrub brush,too stiff to lather bar</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s slightly curved</li>
            <li> purchased *THIS PARTICULAR Style/Model:  &amp;#34;Swissco</li>
            <li> This is a decent brush.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> have always thought that as men, we can do better than a washcloth, or a simply bar of soap rubbed over one&#x27;s hairy body, with the subsequent attachment of all the unsightly hairs to the bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decent quality.  </li>
            <li> like the natural bristles much better, but the wood is compromised by always being wet and</li>
            <li> Those lucky enough not to have shoulder issues it would not matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, tho, to really scrub your skin.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are stiff, but not to hard which is perfect.</li>
            <li> The Swissco Delux Bath Brush meets my needs; good reach length for the back with flexible but stiff bristles for a stimulating scrub.  </li>
            <li> The brush is not as stiff as the description suggests and doesn&#x27;t do a really good job of back scrubbing.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Found them in a catalog for much high price</li>
            <li> So I bought this with high hopes.</li>
            <li> Buy it, high recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this .</li>
            <li> *DELUXE (One-Piece) Bath Brush/Tortoise, (as other similar model/style, by Swissco, is 2-pc, and per reviews, falls apart) for my 6&#x27; 4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> To scratch one&#x27;s own back is divine, even when you have other options.</li>
            <li> While the bristles start out as being a bit tough, they have softened out over time and now deliver good exfoliation with no irritation.</li>
            <li> The design of the brush itself is nice, but the bristles are too hard and feel like they are scratching me.</li>
            <li> The handle has a nice curve that makes getting to those hard spots easier.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a substantial brush that could easily reach the middle of my back, and that had stiff enough bristles to do a good job of exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase as it is a great quality</li>
            <li> I like my back brush to SCRUB, so most back brushes have bristles that are too soft.  </li>
            <li> The bristles feel soft, but when you actually use it, it is quite firm, gives you a fairly invigorating scrub.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if thats a good thing yet or not - maybe they will last longer?</li>
            <li> I really liked the look of this brush so disregarded the negative reviews</li>
            <li> It works pretty good but the angle of the brush still makes it a bit difficult to use.</li>
            <li> The latter is especially important in the Winter, when the air is extra dry from heaters and such.  </li>
            <li> other than that, the ergonomic design works fine for me.</li>
            <li> im disabled and this brush has strong yet gentle bristles.</li>
            <li> Keep my back feeling right</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ecotools Bamboo Bristle Bath Brush  - feels great at first, but all bamboo brushed have gained mold in less than a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been in need of a new brush, so taking a chance</li>
            <li> I use this bath brush every day; it looks almost new.  </li>
            <li> Brush is nice, not too hard, not too soft.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I needed something that better helped me scrub difficult-to-reach places (back, mainly).</li>
            <li> The handle is a bit slick if you have soapy hands, but the bristles are the right stiffness and the one-piece design is much better than the wooden varieties.</li>
            <li> If I were to buy a brush again, I would look for a less slippery one, but this brush is good enough that I wouldn&#x27;t do so until this one wears out (or I actually drop it on my toe).</li>
            <li> handle is smooth, but I have no trouble holding onto it with a wet hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more opaque light reddish-brown with a few swirls of black.</li>
            <li> dry quickly and therefore resist mold and mildew.</li>
            <li> The wooden handle has more friction and grip when wet.</li>
            <li> all others broke very early after purchase.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft</li>
            <li> The long curved handle makes brushing the back easy but is slippery if you have soap on your hands.</li>
            <li> Great brush to reach those hard to reach places on your upper and lower back, your thighs, even your chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only problem is that the handle gets very slippery in the shower!  </li>
            <li> Best brush ever - still holds bristle share after months of heavy use - I&#x27;m a scrubber big time and this holds up with a long arm to reach the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and needed plus the simple plastic cover protected the brush as needed.</li>
            <li> I need something that is more like 24 inches to reach all of my back due to some arthritis in my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I had bought a back brush in a drug store that broke the first week</li>
            <li> This Swissco is way better than the more expensive Fuller Brush back brush.</li>
            <li> The only problem is, he dropped the first one on our ceramic tile shower floor and it broke, so we had to buy another.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to wash my back and it does exactly that</li>
            <li> Nice and stiff, seems pretty durable, hard to wax poetic about a back washer.</li>
            <li> The design of the brush is perfect, the other ones I&#x27;ve owned had a straight handle which made it awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> Firm brush with a strong handle, not like the junk 2 piece ones.  </li>
            <li> and they are still as strong and firm as when purchased.  </li>
            <li> Not too soft not too hard just right to actually clean.</li>
            <li> I would go a little longer and a touch firmer, but this works fine.</li>
            <li> Very important to let the water and minor soap drain down and away from bristle attachment into head.</li>
            <li> brush ok but handle a little too short for me</li>
            <li> The bristles have lost little stiffness after more than a year, and only one or two ever fell out.</li>
            <li> This brush is nice looking and it gets the job done reaching those hard to reach places on your back.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are softer than I&#x27;m used to (I&#x27;m used to a really stiff and abrasive brush), but it still scrubs and exfoliates perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I bought a total three of these brushes and all are holding up very well.</li>
            <li> No trouble with it in the shower so far.</li>
            <li> This was a purchase for my mother whom is 78 yrs young and needed help.</li>
            <li> It is an old Fuller brand with nylon bristles too far apart for soap lathering IMHO.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin you might want a softer brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Allows me to reach my back in the shower and exfoliates very well.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer a stiffer bristle to really stimulate the skin, and blood flow too it.</li>
            <li> It nearly took the skin off my body.</li>
            <li> Soft against you skin, so soothing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a year and like everything about it so far.  </li>
            <li> Seems like this is from the 70&#x27;s in that it feel cheap and like it&#x27;s been waiting on a shelf for a few years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also slips out of my hands frequently because of the slippery handle.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it.  </li>
            <li> i like that, but if you want a soft brush, this is not it.  </li>
            <li> my old one</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> They are soft.</li>
            <li> but they were all too soft.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as soft as it should be.</li>
            <li> If I use it enough to spread around soap, it feels like it is ready to take off the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far no problems to report with this brush.  </li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t make a natural bristle with a plastic handle.</li>
            <li> I have found the answer to a body scrubber is not the rather soft bristles here.</li>
            <li> Not too soft.</li>
            <li> Very well made, should last forever.</li>
            <li> , It is classy but doesn&#x27;t attract a lot of germs.  </li>
            <li> This Swissco brush was more expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to reach all parts of my back and the brush isn&#x27;t too firm</li>
            <li> Stiff bristles give good cleaning action with little pressure.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little stiff but that is probably a good thing.</li>
            <li> I found the bristles just right for wet brushing.</li>
            <li> I like that this is not a wooden one that is harder to keep clean and that cracks over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the tortoise shell color, but it didn&#x27;t come in any other color.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t lather much, as others have noted, but lather doesn&#x27;t mean clean.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that once you add soap the handle is very slippery, making it easy to drop.  </li>
            <li> I purchase a high end brush from a bath specific store.  </li>
            <li> Once when I was attempting to clean some of my generous folds, half a ham sandwich fell out!  </li>
            <li> Occasionally, the brush is a little rough for my tastes and can feel quite scratchy, but it does have a nice design and an understated look to it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it particularly slick, but it is smooth so if you have soapy hands it may slip.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a bit rough at first</li>
            <li> Not the deep amber transparent/translucent you would normally associate with tortoise colored plastic.</li>
            <li> I like to be able to scrub my back and had tried the wooden devices sold at Target, etc., which fell apart after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> First, I found the handle to be quite slippery when wet.</li>
            <li> bristles felt a little too stiff at first use, switched back to my natural boar bristle and realized this brush just felt better.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the plastic is a little slippery when wet and soapy, but I&#x27;ll bet it is more durable than wood</li>
            <li> It is easy to use from any angle and gets that hard to reach place just inside the shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> I have not had problems of the scrubber slipping as some other reviewers, a rubberized or textured grip would be an easy improvement.</li>
            <li> and it seems strong enough that I shouldn&#x27;t break the handle bearing down like the last one</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone that wants to clean their back well or hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Just the right stiffness to really satisfy the itch and massage the back - but not so stiff as to be abrasive.</li>
            <li> but my skin really is just too sensitive for this harder bristle.  </li>
            <li> The curve handle makes it so much easier to reach your entire back effortlessly.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right, soft but firm.</li>
            <li> Also, this brush, at least for me, foams up just fine.</li>
            <li> Very durable brush; much sturdier than the wooden brushes I&#x27;d previously purchased.</li>
            <li> And the straight handle allows the brush to sit flat on my back.</li>
            <li> A little harsh on the bristles but other than that, it is great for one to reach the back and lower legs.</li>
            <li> and it still has the right amount of firmness without being too stiff and soft enough for decent back scrubbing.</li>
            <li> It sounds kind of hillbilly but the only brush I&#x27;ve found that is both long enough and stiff enough for me</li>
            <li> job,&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are firm and the handle is easy to hang up to dry.</li>
            <li> so its comfortable to use, and the extra long handle certainly helps getting to those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the handle it should have an anti-slip application since the smooth plastic handle can become slippery and hard to hold when soaped up.</li>
            <li> However Swissco long handle has smooth ROUND edges.</li>
            <li> Handle is long so doing the whole back is easier.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive to the touch skin, you might want a brush with softer bristles, but I can use this one on my back, arms, legs, chest, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same old Fuller brush</li>
            <li> but when wet and soapy get&#x27;s very slippery, should have texture or molded in shape of some type.</li>
            <li> I got this brush because I wanted a curved fixed head back brush.</li>
            <li> The only problem thus far is once you get the handle soapy you can&#x27;t hang onto it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a wooden brush with natural bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also good for dirty kneecaps and elbows.</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough with a little curve to make it easier to use and it rinses off easily under the shower.</li>
            <li> I actually use the brush for a back scratcher, I&#x27;m disabled and can&#x27;t reach my back easily with my hands.</li>
            <li> Getting a little older and can&#x27;t reach to wash my back very well.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are the right texture, where it&#x27;s hard enough to scrub your back to leave you with that clean feeling while not being too rough on your skin.</li>
            <li> I needed a new one not because it was wearing, but because of health concern having  something that long that in use on my body.</li>
            <li> The handle is definitely built tough as I bear down a fair amount</li>
            <li> Keeps those hard to reach areas clean.  </li>
            <li> While the bristles are good, not too stiff and not too soft, and the brush is long enough to reach the hard places, there is one basic flaw; the handle is slicker than goose poop.</li>
            <li> last set of 3 brushes made of wood and natural bristles did last a couple years but the brush head would routinely slip off the handle in use and sometimes land on my toes - ouch!.</li>
            <li> if this brush felt as soft to my mid back as it did to the palm of my hand, i would give it five stars.</li>
            <li> The cheap brush&#x27;s thin ribbon, used instead of the rope, dries completely between uses.</li>
            <li> I love that the brush is firm but not so firm that it hurts.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I won&#x27;t have to replace it for a few years, but even if it only lasts a year, it&#x27;ll have been worth it for the price and satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Someone said the bristles were not real hard and not real soft</li>
            <li> Not so hard it hurt my skin, but hard enough that I felt I was getting a good scrub</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but good bath brushes are really hard to find in drug stores!</li>
            <li> I had great hopes for this brush but was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its medium firm so it does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I thought maybe they were a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> After using the Earth Therapeutics Feng Shui Back Brush with Ergo Grip, which two of them broke in the same place right above the rubber grip handle in less than 2 weeks, this brush out performs that brush by leaps and bounds.</li>
            <li> The bristles are strong but not so tough that they hurt.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the handle is flat and wide and does not allow for a good grip, and the plastic finish on the handle makes it slippery when soapy.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is the handle is VERY slippery with soapy hands.</li>
            <li> It is a very long handle and has just the right slight curve for reaching anywhere on your back.</li>
            <li> Well made, soft bristles and long enough to reach those itchy spots no matter where on your back they might be.</li>
            <li> I have ordered three other brushes and was unhappy with them as the handle slipped from the head of the first brush,  second brush broke in half, and the last brush was double the price and did not feel good during use.</li>
            <li> As others have said, it can be a little slippery if you get a bunch of soap on the handle, but no so much that I&#x27;ve ever dropped it or found it to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing that has given me some issues is the handle is very slippery when you have even a little soap on it.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are a little soft compared to a natural hog bristle wooden brush I owned that cracked and shed the prickly pieces all over the shower floor.  </li>
            <li> Its very well constructed, the bristles neither too soft nor too hard</li>
            <li> Having, suffered from a dull tortoise for years, imagine my delight when I found the answer to several litanies and more than a few human sacrifices.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a bit stiff but for my purposes I like that, it REALLY exfoliates and scrubs deeply into the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve followed a bit of advice mentioned in a review somewhere by shaking as much water off the brush as possible and then letting it dry with the bristles facing down.  </li>
            <li> The only thing, as noted in other reviews, the handle was very slippery when wet and with soap.</li>
            <li> Brushes stiff but not too much.</li>
            <li> A FEW other reviewers have complained about: (1) &amp;#34;Stiff bristles&amp;#34; -- but they feel fine to me and really do the job; (2) &amp;#34;Curved handle&amp;#34; -- it works better for me than straight; (3) &amp;#34;Slippery grip&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The handle is also to short for complete coverage of my back although I am taller than average.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to scratch my back pretty hard in the shower.</li>
            <li> Made out of plastic and bristles are very stiff at first.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are stiff enough to feel like you&#x27;re getting clean but not so stiff that you feel that you&#x27;re losing a layer of skin.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff enough to get you clean, but not so stiff as to cut your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only retired it because someone used it for a toilet brush.</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough to reach my lower back</li>
            <li> but it is long enough to reach my back.</li>
            <li> I adored the brush, but had to throw it out after about 6 months since the wood was absorbing and retaining so much moisture in my very stuffy and humid bathroom that even when kept out of the tub area, it never completely dried at the base of the bristles.</li>
            <li> After I shower, I dry it off as much as possible and store it on a hook just outside my shower.</li>
            <li> They are also the perfect texture meaning they are never too stiff and harsh and never too soft and worthless.  </li>
            <li> I like it as a hand brush and prefer the Swissco for long handle, not removable, back</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough.</li>
            <li> long  enough  </li>
            <li> Have wanted one for a long time and it does help to reach the back area.  </li>
            <li> Should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a really long handle which get&#x27;s everywhere on your back.</li>
            <li> I know this one will last a long time.</li>
            <li> which in my experience doesn&#x27;t last long in the shower environment.</li>
            <li> Will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The handle is slightly longer than the average brush and is very helpful for reaching the lower part of your back.</li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to find a back brush with a straight handle that is</li>
            <li> I expect this one to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This bath brush should last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> The brush is easy to use and unlikely to break.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yerba is well made with long handle that slide/wedges in brush head for use as hand brush or long handled back brush.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that when your hands are wet and soapy you lose your grip on the plastic handle as compared to a wooden one.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a rubber handle or grip, as it becomes more difficult to handle when it&#x27;s wet and soapy.  </li>
            <li> A career of pounding cheeseburgers and buying ice cream in the convenient half-gallon single serving size has left me at a disadvantage in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It is just stiff and soft enough and every time I use it</li>
            <li> Swissco wants to slip/pivot in hand due to those round edges.</li>
            <li> After a few months the bristles are still holding up very well, so I&#x27;m hopeful this brush will last longer than my previous sisal brushes.</li>
            <li> Bristles a little too soft</li>
            <li> Sadly, he isn’t me, but if he scrubbed his back, he could be clean as me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easyer to reach those hard places that she could;nt reach.</li>
            <li> The brush head itself works well, but it gets very slippery and hard to hold on to</li>
            <li> For me, it works very well for reaching those hard to reach spots between the shoulder blades.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are firm but not stiff.</li>
            <li> But, it is long gone.</li>
            <li> The handle is long and curved and looks sturdy.</li>
            <li> I personally think the bristles are just right....not too rough at all.  </li>
            <li> I should have bought one long ago.</li>
            <li> Lasts long time</li>
            <li> The brush is about 16 1/2 inches long.</li>
            <li> long handle..</li>
            <li> This brush definitely has a sturdy feel to it, though it&#x27;s slippery when wet and soapy with no grip design on the handle.</li>
            <li> Bristles are quite rough on the back, but I did get used to it over time.</li>
            <li> I like the long handle.</li>
            <li> 19 -22 inches long?</li>
            <li> so I have doubts as to how long they will continue to be usable.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too soft, not to harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> Bristles a little stiff at first</li>
            <li> Extra long handle to reach way down the back.  </li>
            <li> Although one major selling point of this brush is its uniquely curved handle, I find it somewhat awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is the lack of a rubber type grip on the handle, but I can live without one.</li>
            <li> The wooden one deteriorated quickly and looked sad after a while.  </li>
            <li> ; -- I&#x27;m 73 yrs old with touch of arthritis and have no trouble; those with weak grip can add tape; (4) &amp;</li>
            <li> A few years ago, my in-laws gave me a bath set for my birthday that included a bath brush with  natural extra firm bristles and a wooden handle.</li>
            <li> By now, I would have replaced any other back brush 3-4 times.  </li>
            <li> The other low rating mentioned that the brush was very rough, again I totally disagree.</li>
            <li> I like the bristles--not too hard (like my wooden brush&#x27;s bristles) or too soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aquasentials Long Handle Bath Brush - too short for a \\&quot;long\\&quot; handle brush, plus the bristles are way too stiff for the back.</li>
            <li> Dry brush before you shower and use again in the shower with soap.</li>
            <li> Only reason not 5iver,needs friction grip to prevent slipping when soapy and wet</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for an elderly relative who has trouble reaching his back in the shower.  </li>
            <li> O.K. as a back up, not sturdy enough for an everyday use.</li>
            <li> Purchased after a surgery when my motion was limited.  </li>
            <li> I like the curved handle and the bristles are stiff enough to feel like they are actually scrubbing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s stiff enough to work for scrubbing my back</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for a tortoise look to the plastic to match my other bath accessories, but honestly it&#x27;s not at all what I was expecting or what the photo looks like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one in the past and it lasted nearly 10 years before I broke the handle.  </li>
            <li> It scrubbed as firmly as I wanted,  and dried completely in an hour,  despite being left in the shower area as a test.</li>
            <li> no parts to come loose.  </li>
            <li> Look down, back up, where are you?</li>
            <li> Only down side is that the cord it came with didn&#x27;t stay on long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Another lasted only half a bath.</li>
            <li> When I decided to replace it, I wanted the same firmness and almost abrasive bristles, but a plastic handle that would retain less moisture and hopefully extend the lifespan of the brush.</li>
            <li> I was using a wooden brush from Target previously.</li>
            <li> In some reviews of other brushes, people say the brushes are not right for their size etc, so if it helps I am 65, female &amp; 5ft 6in tall.</li>
            <li> After a few uses the handle would come loose, then my husband would fix it, eventually try to glue it in.&lt;br /&gt;The same thing would happen over and over.......  </li>
            <li> I paid a little extra but it paid off.  </li>
            <li> Brushes are not too soft nor too hard.  </li>
            <li> It is not to hard yet not to soft.  </li>
            <li> Not too hard and not too soft.</li>
            <li> They break, the bristles are too hard or too soft.</li>
            <li> It is not too hard, not too soft.  </li>
            <li> Gets to all my back parts and the bristles are tough but not harsh.</li>
            <li> Quite a bit easier to push/pull across back with less twisting torque due to lighter thinner head.</li>
            <li> I have a slight agreement with other reviewers about grip limitations (indented handle takes some personal adjustment to use).</li>
            <li> This brush is just the ticket for those hard to reach places like the back of my neck, heck, the back of my everything for that matter.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad and does the job okay,</li>
            <li> The bristles are just firm enough.</li>
            <li> Rough 50 grit sandpaper with masking tape DIY project anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Handle is too slippery to be used when wet.  </li>
            <li> They should have put a rough \\&quot;grip\\&quot; surface on the end of the handle.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this brush is NOT slippery when wet.</li>
            <li> I almost wish the bristles were even harder, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> The handle was shorter than expected as compared to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few sisal brushes with wooden handles.</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I can observe is that the handle is a narrow and has a polished surface, so it takes some getting used to holding it with soapy hands</li>
            <li> Soaking wet in the shower?</li>
            <li> The reason is because in BJJ you spend a lot of time on your back with a sweaty, heavy Gi.  </li>
            <li> Bristles were a bit harder than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not really up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> so when your hands are wet and soapy it tend to slip around.</li>
            <li> I  got this brush for my mom cause she has trouble reaching her legs and back during shower time</li>
            <li> slippery when wet ,i drop it all the time.it needs to be wood.</li>
            <li> expected from description.</li>
            <li> This brush was great...better than expected.  </li>
            <li> any brush after use when wet ALWAYS lay down horizontal with bristles pointing down not against a surface just open air.</li>
            <li> No more dry, itchy back!</li>
            <li> The bristles will get softer with use, so starting out stiff will add to its life.</li>
            <li> Bristles are still enough but not too stiff for me.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy, has fairly stiff bristles, the handle is slightly curved, and it&#x27;s long enough to reach mid-back.</li>
            <li> The product is simply durable made with serious lasting quality.  </li>
            <li> Some other reviews say the bristles are too rough.</li>
            <li> Second, unlike other reviewers, the bristles were too stiff for my taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, not too harsh, just what&#x27;s needed.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews mentioned concerns about mildew if you keep it in the shower when not in use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t reach some spots on my backs with my hands due to lower flexibility.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> A rubber cover on the handle (or some other non-skid material) would improve the product.  </li>
            <li> I only replaced it because the soap scum was getting harder and harder to remove.</li>
            <li> Should have bought 2 of these instead of the other one I bought.</li>
            <li> which I did read about in some of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Major problem is the handle, it is slippery, you can not hold onto it, the handle is too narrow and slick.</li>
            <li> There were a few reviews that only gave a few stars</li>
            <li> OK brush, but the slick plastic handle makes it almost impossible to grasp when your hands are soapy.</li>
            <li> It is hard enough to get a firm grip when it is dry.</li>
            <li> I can get to all of the hard to reach spots on my back!</li>
            <li> Reaches all the hard parts of my back that I could not reach.</li>
            <li> I can reach those hard to reach places on my back</li>
            <li> I use this brush every day, it gets those hard to reach spots on my back.</li>
            <li> Back brushes like this are hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Before I bought this brush I had a hard sponge on a wooden handle.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to scratch my back in those hard to reach places...</li>
            <li> I have had at least 6 different</li>
            <li> Back acne is a common problem for BJJ pracitioners.&lt;br</li>
            <li> #34;Can&#x27;t reach all parts of back&amp;#34; -- some people aren&#x27;t very flexible; (5) &amp;#34;Fell apart, lost bristles&amp;#34; -- could they be rating the wrong product??</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the end of the handle sometimes twists in my hands.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the slippery-when-wet handle, for which I deducted one star.  </li>
            <li> this thing is so rough!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try a little grip tape because the brush met my other requirements.</li>
            <li> I find the tools that are made specifically for this purpose are either too dull or ill designed for reaching the lower sections of my back (particularly when I am clothed).  </li>
            <li> They have stiff bristles that work well on the back and other hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the handle is a little slippery.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are VERY sharp.</li>
            <li> If not used for a long time can get very stiff again.</li>
            <li> The handle is made of smooth hard plastic that is impossible to grip when it&#x27;s wet and soapy.</li>
            <li> The brush head is separate from the handle, the typical design found at target and walmart that has the handle slide into the brush head.</li>
            <li> Seriously don&#x27;t use this on your back!!</li>
            <li> Wood resists water less than plastic over time.</li>
            <li> doesnt compare to the others that you buy from duane reade or rite aid that just snaps in half within 1 week of purchasing.  </li>
            <li> The all one piece made it sturdy as I had a previous one that was not all one piece</li>
            <li> Also one of the bristle tufts fell out of the plastic already, after less than two months of use.</li>
            <li> and I had a difficult time trying to reach my entire back with this.</li>
            <li> The previous three brushes I bought (from drug store) fell apart in a couple of weeks - the heads disintegrated</li>
            <li> The one I had previously allowed you to seperate the head from the handle</li>
            <li> It needs a slightly rounded or molded end.</li>
            <li> unlike others ive bought,it hasnt broken yet,which is a major point with me.</li>
            <li> The previous brush I had late sooo long held it&#x27;s quality</li>
            <li> Brush handle got slippery with soap unlike a wood handle brush and handle was a bit short - not good for a tall person.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago the handle broke about half way up from the brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The color is given as &amp;#34;Tortoise.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s an opaque reddish brown with a few black streaks.</li>
            <li> brush is sturdy, even has a little string to hang it up (not shown in the picture).</li>
            <li> firmness, could be a little firmer for my liking</li>
            <li> rounded handle would be a little easier to grasp.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little longer</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is, it is tough to hold onto when soap enters the equation.</li>
            <li> Seems tough enough and should hold up.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is that it is a bit hard for some parts of my body</li>
            <li> Yerba handle is thin and head is heavier and thicker making off center weight harder to handle than Swissco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few brushes over the years.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm, but but not too firm for use in the shower.</li>
            <li> The Yerba head is heavy and cumbersom but it works.  </li>
            <li> I think a few people said it&#x27;s slippery, and I would have to agree....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the brush now for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Bristles are firm and scrub well.</li>
            <li> Also the bristles are firm but not like being scoured.</li>
            <li> It would be a lot nicer a few inches longer, too.  </li>
            <li> They are too harsh and scratch your skin</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this two stars is because I think I can rehabilitate the poor thing; maybe use some bicycle handlebar tape like one reviewer did.</li>
            <li> the bristles feel firm when scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> It is too heavy</li>
            <li> I was leery of it being plastic, but it is heavy duty and does not feel flimsy at all.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> she uses it everyday</li>
            <li> Firm but not scratchy.</li>
            <li> The bush is a little stiff for my taste.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are stiff but not to stiff and have gotten a little softer since I&#x27;ve had the brush.</li>
            <li> previously bought and was not satisfied with...</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it takes before it loses enough bristles to be useless.  </li>
            <li> Bristles not overly stiff.</li>
            <li> and though they are a bit stiff, they do not scratch, a bit of a massage feel.</li>
            <li> I find the bristle rather stiff.</li>
            <li> too stiff  like boar (which can draw blood )</li>
            <li> It is somewhat stiff and will not get soapy.  </li>
            <li> Assuming one is in the shower, just hold the heat under the water for a moment and they soften up, though they aren&#x27;t all that stiff to begin with.</li>
            <li> The bristles are almost as stiff as sisal, and the plastic handle should avoid the problem with mold.</li>
            <li> The heading says it all: this brush is just too stiff for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as stiff as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> The bristles are still stiff.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a tad stiff, but I&#x27;ve grown to like it and wouldn&#x27;t want a softer brush now.</li>
            <li> Too stiff for me.</li>
            <li> And not so stiff it scrapes your skin off.</li>
            <li> Sometimes that is no easy to do.</li>
            <li> is too slick add a little soap its out of control.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very slick like other reviews say.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff and the handle is difficult to stop slipping from your hands when wet.</li>
            <li> She loves it, it has a slight curve to the handle and it help her reach those hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing that happen was that the little yarn that was attached to the end of the handle fell off within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> The handle is too small in size.</li>
            <li> This is a relatively small problem that doesn&#x27;t ruin this quality product for me.</li>
            <li> Bristles are FIRM in my opinion!  </li>
            <li> Sorry guys but the handle snapped after the third use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The curve of the handle makes it difficult to use on the back.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the bristles are very tough.</li>
            <li> The brush is very heavy or cumbersome to work with.</li>
            <li> Very few worn bristles</li>
            <li> But it was broken in half.</li>
            <li> This product is very stiff and hard to get the liquid body soap that I use to stay in the brush.</li>
            <li> The narrow neck where the handle meets the head looks like a weak point, but after all this time with vigorous use, mine shows no sign of stress.</li>
            <li> However, the slipperiness of the plastic handle does make it a little difficult to hold on tightly to the handle while scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> The bugs and ticks were making the skin itch and a product like this was needed to reach those hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> the brush has these 1/4\\&quot; hard rubber \\&quot;bristles\\</li>
            <li> If your hand is soapy you might have a hard time.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding one at a store.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> now use it to get dirt off my feet, but it&#x27;s too hard for my back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are uncomfortably hard.  </li>
            <li> No need for the bristles to be so hard.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to hold onto .handle  </li>
            <li> This brush does get slippery so makes it hard to handle despite the brush angle.</li>
            <li> It took me five brushes to find this little honey!!</li>
            <li> Some have complained that the bristles are too hard.</li>
            <li> That twisting heavier heads is awkward on back.</li>
            <li> Insanely over-priced for how cheap it was made.</li>
            <li> people have complained about the handle being too slippery.</li>
            <li> They were all either too soft, or way too scratchy that it was painful -</li>
            <li> keep my brush hanging in the shower - which the product comes a thick braided nylon rope (not pictured?)</li>
            <li> AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT I MEAN....</li>
            <li> The main annoying thing about this is that there is no rubber handle, so if you&#x27;re using soap(which</li>
            <li> and we have a very small shower</li>
            <li> whatever it is - it feels like very uncomfortable for using to scrub along the back.</li>
            <li> long handle attached Yerba brush is awkward compared to Swissco.</li>
            <li> The handle of this brush is very slick.</li>
            <li> A big problem is that the handle is all plastic and virtually impossible to grip and apply any pressure if it is soapy.</li>
            <li> This is a seriously durable product.  </li>
            <li> Before I used it, I filed shallow grooves around the handle with a triangle file.</li>
            <li> Hanging vertical is not nearly as good even if easier to do.</li>
            <li> The bristles are quiet stiff on mine and very unpleasant to use against the skin.</li>
            <li> The handle is also a little on the small size in terms of diameter and the plastic is very slick which makes it nearly impossible to hold onto with soapy hands.</li>
            <li> This is not a flimsy weak bath brush.  </li>
            <li> The curvature makes it easier to reach tough spots.</li>
            <li> As some have said, handle is a bit slippery, but really not that bad.</li>
            <li> The sponge kept coming off the handle and was, generally, poorly made.  </li>
            <li> And like that it&#x27;s plastic because the wooden ones get ugly!  </li>
            <li> That was annoying because the head would always come loose and fall off the handle.</li>
            <li> I still use it, but it&#x27;s a little painful.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, the texture takes a dramatic turn for the worse when i use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have hated it, IF it had arrived unbroken &amp; I could&#x27;ve actually used it.</li>
            <li> I hate how the wood on the other ones mold and fall apart.</li>
            <li> Totally annoying and not worth it.</li>
            <li> It started to seem complicated -- handle material, length and curvature of the handle, stiffness of bristles, lather rentention and mold factor.</li>
            <li> Now it is useless and I am using the Yerba</li>
            <li> sad, but I have to throw this one away.</li>
            <li> In this case this brush is quite difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Sadly, Kohler no longer sells brushes.</li>
            <li> Plus the brush bristles do not allow soap to lather so it is useless</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need any fake gods, angels, etc.</li>
            <li> I have had a rotator cuff issue and it has been difficult reaching and scrubbing my back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this same brush Is horrible.</li>
            <li> and that was useless -</li>
            <li> getting dirty or moldy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;m going to drop it.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> Highly Disappointed.....</li>
            <li> Impossible!</li>
            <li> Very bad design.</li>
            <li> To me this is very annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I waited to do a review on this back brush until I used it for 15 months.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best brush I have ever owned, it hasn&#x27;t lost a bristle yet and does&lt;br /&gt;a great job of cleaning my back.&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely recommend this back brush.&lt;br /&gt;Boston Bob</li>
            <li> I wosh the bristles were a bit stiffer but I do love it.</li>
            <li> It was good, but the cord it came on came removed so I can no longer hang it up.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a bit rough at first but it gives a nice clean scrub!</li>
            <li> Sturdy, does what it&#x27;s suppose to do</li>
            <li> this thing is so rough!!</li>
            <li> After 43 years my back is finally clean. Just love this brush. It&#x27;s just rough enough to give you a good scrubb and massage your skin. I use it on my back legs and feet. Great for srubbing the skin on your legs and feet after a good mtn bike ride or working in the yard to help get off any poison ivy oils. The curved handle makes it a lot easier to get to all the areas of your back and we have a very small shower and it still works great.</li>
            <li> This scrubby makes showers more efficient... and my back is cleaner. Win!</li>
            <li> this is just what is needed for the rainy spring and hot summer (so far). The bugs and ticks were making the skin itch and a product like this was needed to reach those hard to reach spots. I may buy more yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Good craftsmanship and shipped fast!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this brush. It is easy to use from any angle and gets that hard to reach place just inside the shoulder blades. The bristles are just firm enough. I do see signs of some spreading of the bristles after about 1 dozen uses but I would definitely replace it when the time comes.</li>
            <li> OK brush, but the slick plastic handle makes it almost impossible to grasp when your hands are soapy.</li>
            <li> Nice looking and soft bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is not, NOT a one piece brush.  The brush head is separate from the handle, the typical design found at target and walmart that has the handle slide into the brush head.</li>
            <li> Purchased after a surgery when my motion was limited.  Find that I am still using it after recovery.</li>
            <li> im disabled and this brush has strong yet gentle bristles. good back and leg scrubber. unlike others ive bought,it hasnt broken yet,which is a major point with me. all others broke very early after purchase. easy rinse off and just a really good brush.</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL. WOULD LIKE STRAIGHT HANDLE BETTER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for 4 days now, and it&#x27;s one of the best bath back brushes I&#x27;ve ever purchased. The bristles are the right texture, where it&#x27;s hard enough to scrub your back to leave you with that clean feeling while not being too rough on your skin. The curve handle makes it so much easier to reach your entire back effortlessly. After using the Earth Therapeutics Feng Shui Back Brush with Ergo Grip, which two of them broke in the same place right above the rubber grip handle in less than 2 weeks, this brush out performs that brush by leaps and bounds. The only negative is the lack of a rubber type grip on the handle, but I can live without one.</li>
            <li> I have bought too many bath brushes to count and this one has standed the test of time.  I paid a little extra but it paid off.  This brush, I would say, is better suited for dry brushing.  I tried using it as a shower brush but my skin really is just too sensitive for this harder bristle.  I DO now use it as a dry brush and it feels wonderful.  I am glad that I didn&#x27;t buy another wooden one with the detachable head.  This one is comfortable and has a long reach without the head falling off.  I make sure to spray hydrogen peroxide on it and rub it with coconut oil for germ concerns.</li>
            <li> Good quality and price</li>
            <li> Good handle. Good brush. Perfect in every way for me. I wanted to feel like I was scrubbing my back but not HURTING it. It took me five brushes to find this little honey!! I didn&#x27;t want a wimpy one...this isn&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t want a killer either. Love it. And like that it&#x27;s plastic because the wooden ones get ugly!  this is a great brush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush. I purchased it because the handle was angled.  I was not disappointed.  The angle on the handle is perfect for reaching behind the back.  The brush head is large and the strong bristles give you a good scrub, which is what I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews elsewhere but did not agree with the negatives mentioned. It is true that this brush does not produce a lather but that does not diminish its cleaning ability.  Someone mentioned that the handle is slippery. That may very well be the case.  This brush comes with a  sturdy plastic label which stays on the handle. To remove it you have to cut it. I left it on and that gives the handle a really good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last set of 3 brushes made of wood and natural bristles did last a couple years but the brush head would routinely slip off the handle in use and sometimes land on my toes - ouch!. Towards the end, the bristles would come off in clumps - euyew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> Too short for me, and slippery handle. I added some racket wrap to resolve the slipperiness. I&#x27;m thinking about adding a length of PVC pipe to lenghten it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;BEAUTIFUL&amp;#34;  AND &amp;#34; BEST QUALITY&amp;#34;,  per E-x-t-e-n-s-i-v-e  Research, (even much more expensive), purchased *THIS PARTICULAR Style/Model:  &amp;#34;Swissco *DELUXE (One-Piece) Bath Brush/Tortoise, (as other similar model/style, by Swissco, is 2-pc, and per reviews, falls apart) for my 6&#x27; 4&amp;#34; Brother, for Father&#x27;s Day !  Really ATTRACTIVE, PERFECT MED/firm Bristles (NOT TOO FIRM or SCRATCHY), Easy Clean/Sanitize. Will provide years of use, w/basic care, (UNLESS STOLEN :)  HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO  EVERYONE !  A VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER *****</li>
            <li> I needed a back bath brush and this one looked to be the best one. There were others to choose from. But, this one looked to be the best.</li>
            <li> I wanted a simple brush to scrub my back in the shower and then I read several Amazon reviews. It started to seem complicated -- handle material, length and curvature of the handle, stiffness of bristles, lather rentention and mold factor. So I took a great leap of faith with this Swissco brush and held my breath. It works quite well. The handle is the right length and angle, the bristles are firm but very comfortable, it held the soap lather well and so forth. I would recommend this brush for the layperson.</li>
            <li> Works great does what it needs.</li>
            <li> Good brush for the price.  Bristles not overly stiff.</li>
            <li> I love Swissco products and I love a good tortoise shell as well. Swissco has combined the two in this bath brush and it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely great, and exactly was I was looking for!  Brushes are not too soft nor too hard.  Nice curve to the handle so you can reach our lower back!</li>
            <li> I have had at least 6 different back/bath brushes, 1 loofah sponge-on-a-stick, 2 loofah sponge pads on a cloth with rope handles and 2 nylon mesh back brushes and this is the best one by far. The long curved handle is strong and makes it easy to scrub my back and the bristles are nice and stiff.  I like my back brush to SCRUB, so most back brushes have bristles that are too soft.  If you have sensitive to the touch skin, you might want a brush with softer bristles, but I can use this one on my back, arms, legs, chest, etc. without any issues.</li>
            <li> It is like having an arm extension!  I can get to all of the hard to reach spots on my back!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product. I&#x27;ve had a few brushes over the years. This one is excellent!</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Well after reading the reviews I went ahead and bought this. Someone said the bristles were not real hard and not real soft so I thought that&#x27;s what I probably want. Well all I can say is I think sandpaper would have worked as well. I have a very high threshold for pain but I would have kicked someone you know where if anyone but myself was putting me through this much pain. I had to look in the mirror to see if I drew blood. Im giving it 2 stars because it worked great on my feet removing old skin. Seriously don&#x27;t use this on your back!!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I needed something that better helped me scrub difficult-to-reach places (back, mainly). Worked like a charm.  The handle really isn&#x27;t that slippery when it is soaped up. The bristles aren&#x27;t as coarse as I thought they&#x27;d be (and that&#x27;s good). It is a good balance of rigidity and stiffness and I think this brush is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> My standard for a great back brush is one I got years ago from an Avon rep. I loved that thang! But, it is long gone. I have tried many more with limited success, but this brush is great. It is the right length, the right thickness ( don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ll break it) not too slippery ( if you rinse your hand) and the brushes are just right for me. I think I&#x27;ll order a second&lt;br /&gt;just in case!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Well made. Has helped my back immensely.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and is built well. I bought a total three of these brushes and all are holding up very well.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wife but am useing it too. it&#x27;s much easyer to reach those hard places that she could;nt reach.</li>
            <li> Spent quite a bit of time searching for a good back brush to use in our shower. This one seemed to be the best available brush, and sold  a reasonable price. It has fulfilled that promise. The bristles are firm, but but not too firm for use in the shower. My wife and I are both happy with it.</li>
            <li> Best back brush on Amazon.  Trust me, this is my third purchase.  This one is ergonomically correct, for me anyway.  The brush is bent concave instead of convex like some others.  This one is easy to manipulate to any area on your back, no prob!  The bristles are not stiff, they are more on the soft side, but it has a large brush which gathers lots of lather, works great!</li>
            <li> Good quality for a bath brush. Plastic handle which I though would be wooden. No trouble with it in the shower so far.</li>
            <li> nice soft brush to clean you back with soap while in the shower.  it hold the soap with out dropping it out on the floor before it get to your back</li>
            <li> This brush has great firm bristles and the arch in the handle really helps you reach your back easily. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is, it is tough to hold onto when soap enters the equation. I&#x27;m going to buy a can of rubber spray and make it the perfect brush. Too bad the VP of finance didn&#x27;t go along with the engineers and make it the perfect brush in the first place.</li>
            <li> A very nice scrub brush.  It is not to hard yet not to soft.  (don&#x27;t want to get in the the three bear thing) thus it does a great job.  Reaches all the hard parts of my back that I could not reach.</li>
            <li> No Workie,handle too short, do not waste your money, this does not do a good job, thrown it in the trash</li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to find a good product we use daily?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my brush hanging in the shower - which the product comes a thick braided nylon rope (not pictured?) to loop over most shower handles or faucets. It is a very long handle and has just the right slight curve for reaching anywhere on your back. I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 9\\&quot; 155 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this product daily for 9 months and it still has the right amount of firmness without being too stiff and soft enough for decent back scrubbing. It&#x27;s subjective - I know. I have not had problems of the scrubber slipping as some other reviewers, a rubberized or textured grip would be an easy improvement. Rough 50 grit sandpaper with masking tape DIY project anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously bought and was not satisfied with...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ecotools Bamboo Bristle Bath Brush  - feels great at first, but all bamboo brushed have gained mold in less than a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquasentials Long Handle Bath Brush - too short for a \\&quot;long\\&quot; handle brush, plus the bristles are way too stiff for the back. Great for my thicker skinned feet, but not soft back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lu La Bath Brush - the brush has these 1/4\\&quot; hard rubber \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; that are there for massaging purpose? protecting the softer nylon bristles? whatever it is - it feels like very uncomfortable for using to scrub along the back.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that is a one-piece brush - no parts to come loose.  Its very well constructed, the bristles neither too soft nor too hard so its comfortable to use, and the extra long handle certainly helps getting to those hard to reach places.  I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I wanted a substantial brush that could easily reach the middle of my back, and that had stiff enough bristles to do a good job of exfoliating.  This is the brush!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t beleive I showred all these years without one of these it makes a great difference in the level of cleanliness</li>
            <li> While this brush looks nice, it doesn&#x27;t feel that way. The first couple of times I used it all I could think was it would be better for cleaning a grill. The bristles are quiet stiff on mine and very unpleasant to use against the skin. I will go shopping for a better one and retire this to cleaning purposes.</li>
            <li> I like the curved handle and the bristles are stiff enough to feel like they are actually scrubbing.</li>
            <li> This was a purchase for my mother whom is 78 yrs young and needed help. She loves it, it has a slight curve to the handle and it help her reach those hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> Originally I had five stars for this shower back brush.  With the bike handle-bar tape wrap to increase size for gripping I loved the brush.  A few months ago the handle broke about half way up from the brush.  Because of that handle-bar tape it stayed together and I kept on using it.  A couple days ago it broke agains where the handle connects to the brush head.  Now it is useless and I am using the Yerba brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic should not break so I blame the plastic quality.  I could glue or expoxy but obviously it will break again.  I see there is another shower brush made out of bamboo.  For $10 I will order one to try and keep using the Yerba.  The Yerba head is heavy and cumbersom but it works.  I have the bike handle bar wrap on the Yerba too.  It is the best thing about these brushes, LOL  Maybe I can take the wrap off the Swissco.  Use it on Ecotools Bamboo shower brush.  That bike tape cost about $20 now, yikes, LOL  12yrs ago I paid $5?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this and Swissco. Lots like this one and Swissco makes quality combs so worth a try. Both have advantages and by comparison disadvantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yerba is well made with long handle that slide/wedges in brush head for use as hand brush or long handled back brush. I like it as a hand brush and prefer the Swissco for long handle, not removable, back brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With long handle attached Yerba brush is awkward compared to Swissco. Yerba handle is thin and head is heavier and thicker making off center weight harder to handle than Swissco. Swissco brush head is thinner and lighter and softer. Quite a bit easier to push/pull across back with less twisting torque due to lighter thinner head. However Swissco long handle has smooth ROUND edges. Swissco wants to slip/pivot in hand due to those round edges. Bike handlebar tape? Or rubber on grip? I like using the Yerba head alone in hand for arms, chest, legs, but it is rougher than Swissco so press lightly and wait til skin toughens or bristles soften with use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to choose one it would be Swissco even for $7 difference. Wood resists water less than plastic over time. Might try Earth Therapeutics SHORT BODY BRUSH for front and Swissco for back. Yerba is better as hand brush without handle. That twisting heavier heads is awkward on back. My hands are extra large and I am fairly strong disc golf player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With any brush after use when wet ALWAYS lay down horizontal with bristles pointing down not against a surface just open air. Sometimes that is no easy to do. Find a way. Very important to let the water and minor soap drain down and away from bristle attachment into head. Hanging vertical is not nearly as good even if easier to do. Or hang it anyway you want and buy brushes more often. My old brush alway hung correct lasting twenty plus years clean and strong. It is an old Fuller brand with nylon bristles too far apart for soap lathering IMHO.</li>
            <li> The brush is a bit short for back reach. Bristles have no  strength to scrub body. They are made from flimsy cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste money.</li>
            <li> Extra long handle to reach way down the back.  Found them in a catalog for much high price and I had to pay shipping in addition.  Amazon wins with me.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just the right stiffness to give a good scrubbing.  The handle makes it very easy to get to all parts of my back.  I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Bottom-line:&lt;br /&gt;1.  This is a decent brush.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It is slippery as people have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;3.  If I were to buy a brush again, I would look for a less slippery one, but this brush is good enough that I wouldn&#x27;t do so until this one wears out (or I actually drop it on my toe).</li>
            <li> This brush is great in the shower  Love it  I can reach those hard to reach places on my back</li>
            <li> This brush seems very well made, with a strong long handle that is bent for better reach, my others have disintegrated or handle break within a short time.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the bristle do soap up well and though they are a bit stiff, they do not scratch, a bit of a massage feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice, heavy plastic, but has a great appearance of tortoise. The bristles are pretty stiff, which I love. You know. To remove back barnacles and such.</li>
            <li> Great awesome good quality well made we really enjoy it excellent purchase looks super we are glad we chose this one</li>
            <li> i bought this brush 3 years ago and im still using it!!! this product holds up much better than other brands that i&#x27;ve bought. doesnt compare to the others that you buy from duane reade or rite aid that just snaps in half within 1 week of purchasing.  i have mirrors brushes and nail clippers from swissco and they are all great. im a customer for life</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, not too harsh, just what&#x27;s needed.  It hangs up and is easy to get hold of.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> So pleased with this long handle bath brush.  Everything about it pleases me and so glad I ordered it.  I have ordered three other brushes and was unhappy with them as the handle slipped from the head of the first brush,  second brush broke in half, and the last brush was double the price and did not feel good during use. Started the New Year with  another happy purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very durable brush; much sturdier than the wooden brushes I&#x27;d previously purchased. I expect this one to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> it gets the area that I cant reach and there is nothing better than a good scrubbing in an area that you cant reach</li>
            <li> Nice and stiff, seems pretty durable, hard to wax poetic about a back washer. Actually, I use it on my whole bod and feet, feels pretty nice. A bit metro, but, hey, whatever.</li>
            <li> A good brush. Stiff bristles give a good scrub. If you have sensitive skin you might want a softer brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is smooth, but I have no trouble holding onto it with a wet hand. If your hand is soapy you might have a hard time. Another reviewer mentioned a plastic label on the handle. Mine has nothing like that. Just smooth plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is given as &amp;#34;Tortoise.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s an opaque reddish brown with a few black streaks. It doesn&#x27;t really resemble faux tortoise shell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s a good product. A textured grip on the handle would make it five stars, but it&#x27;s perfectly usable as it is.</li>
            <li> The handle is too small in size. It needs to be bigger around and not so smooth. I find the bristle rather stiff.</li>
            <li> Holds the shower gel perfectly</li>
            <li> Bristles fall out after a couple of uses.  Handle is too slippery to be used when wet.  Insanely over-priced for how cheap it was made.</li>
            <li> Great item.  Only problem is that the handle gets very slippery in the shower!  I would buy this item again.</li>
            <li> I used this style brushed for two years. But always happened to buy them in stores where I can feel the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Out of convenience, I decided to order one on-line this time, and it was a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;This brush really hurts my skin, and after i finish showering my skin itches. First I thought it was from water in a new place i moved to, but then the times I did not use the brush, skin was OK. And I don&#x27;t have any pre-existing tissue sensitivity issues.&lt;br /&gt;Very sad, but I have to throw this one away.</li>
            <li> The handle is slightly longer than the average brush and is very helpful for reaching the lower part of your back.</li>
            <li> The brisstles are great....... But the handle is a ******. Upon the end of the first use, I gave it one shake to sling the water out so it wouldn&#x27;t mildew, and snapped the head clean OFF. I&#x27;ve used the same old Fuller brush my mother bought me as a teen, for more than 3 decades. I only retired it because someone used it for a toilet brush. So I bought this with high hopes. Highly Disappointed.....</li>
            <li> Great brush - was hoping for a stiffer bristle brush, and this one fit the bill perfectly. The one piece construction is superior to the removable handle types out there.  Thanks -</li>
            <li> Not too hard, not too soft, a perfect brush for brushing. You get the feel of quality when you use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to reach my back and it does a great job,&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are firm and the handle is easy to hang up to dry.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. No problem reaching any part of the back with this brush and it is sturdy, not worried about handle snapping off. I bought two because it&#x27;s so good !!</li>
            <li> I wanted a brush that wasn&#x27;t wood and that wouldn&#x27;t rot out very quickly and I&#x27;m so glad I chose this brush. The angle of the handle is great for getting the back and other parts of the body. While the bristles start out as being a bit tough, they have softened out over time and now deliver good exfoliation with no irritation. Also, this brush, at least for me, foams up just fine. Doesn&#x27;t get super sudsy like a loofah, but I think it&#x27;s perfectly sufficient for a brush. The only problem that seems to be universally agreed upon is the lack of a rubber grip. The smooth plastic this is made of is attractive, sturdy and is holding up well to extended use, but it gets very slippery. This is a relatively small problem that doesn&#x27;t ruin this quality product for me. Affordable and durable, I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This IS the best brush!  Long reaching easy to manuever.  Gentle but yet strong enough bristles.  Gives your back a tingle and cleans well without scratching you up!</li>
            <li> The brush is comfortable in the hand and curved just right for washing your back. It has lived up to my expectations. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered a better one - either with a wooden handle or with a rubber grip. The smooth plastic handle is very slippery when you have soap on your hands. They should have put a rough \\&quot;grip\\&quot; surface on the end of the handle. I do not think that would make it any more expensive to manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is a good brush. The handle is long and curved and looks sturdy. The bristles are a little stiff but that is probably a good thing. The bristles will get softer with use, so starting out stiff will add to its life.</li>
            <li> Allows me to reach my back in the shower and exfoliates very well. Some people have gripes that it is slippery, but I have found this is only true if your hands are soapy. In this case this brush is quite difficult to use. Otherwise, this brush is NOT slippery when wet.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase. It is a one piece brush.  The last one I had, had a wooden handle that fit into a slot on top of the brush. After a few uses the handle would come loose, then my husband would fix it, eventually try to glue it in.&lt;br /&gt;The same thing would happen over and over.......  I am sure this story sounds familiar!&lt;br /&gt;This brush is sturdy, even has a little string to hang it up (not shown in the picture). The bristles feel soft, but when you actually use it, it is quite firm, gives you a fairly invigorating scrub.  In fact I will buy one for my husband. He, too, thought the bristles were too soft until he tried it and he liked it (and he is quite a Mikey - remember the commercial).</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this bath brush in the mail. It is exactly as described and I love the curved handle! I think a few people said it&#x27;s slippery, and I would have to agree....you need to have a good hold on it, but I&#x27;ve never dropped it! I almost wish the bristles were even harder, but that&#x27;s just me. Works great for a back scratch at the end of a long day :0)</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and has a curved handle so that helps get everything.  Bristles are still enough but not too stiff for me.</li>
            <li> I love the best, and certainly this is the best bath brush I&#x27;ve ever seen. Well OK, a wooden handle would be nice, but I&#x27;ve had a great one one of those and the problem is the finish wears off and then you&#x27;ve got the water attacking the wood which isn&#x27;t so nice. One might like to have the brush part be removable from the handle, but then the brush starts to fall off when you use it. This sturdy plastic handle will not rot, and the brush won&#x27;t come off because it can&#x27;t. If you can find a better bath brush, please let me know.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. The handle is long enough. The brush is substantial enough. My only complaint is that the handle is a little slippery.</li>
            <li> Feels great. Ez to use, hangs nicely in shower stall.</li>
            <li> Excellent bristle stiffness,great curve on handle to facilitate washing back. Only reason not 5iver,needs friction grip to prevent slipping when soapy and wet</li>
            <li> This brush is light, the bristles strong, and scrub well. It feels great scrubbing my back. The angle makes a difference. It is not a gimmick. I used 4 times more expensive wooden brushes and only saw weaknesses in them.</li>
            <li> I really love this bath brush and I would recommend to everyone looking to buy the perfect brush for their back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a month now. I purchased this because loofahs gross me out. It&#x27;s very sturdy and looks as if it&#x27;s never been used it. Other reviews mentioned concerns about mildew if you keep it in the shower when not in use. After I shower, I dry it off as much as possible and store it on a hook just outside my shower. It seems to be doing the trick. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the brush now for a few weeks and I love it . I&#x27;ve had several brushes and none have compared with this one.  the bristles are stiff but not to stiff and have gotten a little softer since I&#x27;ve had the brush. The curved handle is just right, so I&#x27;m not hitting the sides of the shower when washing my back at any position. This is the brush that I have been looking for and if I need another it would be this one.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect for handling and reach&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are also great.  Not mushy like nylon, not too stiff  like boar (which can draw blood )&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased.</li>
            <li> The title says it all.  The handle is long enough to reach my lower back and it allows me to lather soap really well.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This brush works fine. I actually prefer a stiffer bristle to really stimulate the skin, and blood flow too it. I bought this because one review said it was too stiff...not for me. I use it for my entire body, except face.</li>
            <li> This is a good bath brush. It is sturdy, has fairly stiff bristles, the handle is slightly curved, and it&#x27;s long enough to reach mid-back. I almost didn&#x27;t order it because the photo of the product shows the handle without a loop at the end to hang it from a shower caddy, but the reviews were so good I ordered it anyway, and to my happy surprise, it arrived WITH a white rope loop attached at the end of the handle to hang it up by. Perfect. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this bath brush.</li>
            <li> After just several uses the bristles started coming out.  The handle was shorter than expected as compared to others. I delegated this brush to my guest bathroom until I replace it.</li>
            <li> Brush bristles are a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; firmness, could be a little firmer for my liking but it&#x27;s better than many wimpy ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Handle is great shape and lenght but when wet and soapy get&#x27;s very slippery, should have texture or molded in shape of some type.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted real bristle and very long handle, appears to be perfect we&#x27;ll see in time how it wears</li>
            <li> Good length and curve on handle. Brush head is nice and firm. Handle is a bit slippery when soapy. I&#x27;ll try a little grip tape because the brush met my other requirements.</li>
            <li> This was a gift . The person was thrilled to receive it.  The handle looks serviceable and the brush seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> works just fine. to the ones complaining the handle is slippery,i have to wonder if they ever used soap before.</li>
            <li> Maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have hated it, IF it had arrived unbroken &amp; I could&#x27;ve actually used it. It was packaged so neatly. Cushioned &amp; boxed. But it was broken in half. I returned it for a refund.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for an elderly relative who has trouble reaching his back in the shower.  He says it is gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> Well put together.  Firm brush with a strong handle, not like the junk 2 piece ones.  Definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li> not as soft as my old fuller brush, but since they don&#x27;t make the one I had anymore, this one seems to work okay</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush to hang for easy use in the shower.  I have had it for a year now and it is much sturdier than the one I had before.  The wooden one deteriorated quickly and looked sad after a while.  This one still looks good and keeps clean.  The only negative I have is that it is a bit hard for some parts of my body but it is invigorating.</li>
            <li> This brush has a curved handle that is just right and has strong bristles.  Every man will like this brush for sure.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me since I had back surgery I can&#x27;t reach some spots on my backs with my hands due to lower flexibility. So with this brush I can clean the neglected parts of my back. I love that the brush is firm but not so firm that it hurts. I think its just the right amount of toughness. I rub the soap on the bristles and it lathers up fine enough. The handle definitely is slippery if your hands are soapy, but if you wash any soap off your hands before handling the brush the grip should be fine.</li>
            <li> Bristles are firm and scrub well. This is the first brush I&#x27;ve bought with a plastic handle. My only gripe is that when your hands are wet and soapy you lose your grip on the plastic handle as compared to a wooden one.</li>
            <li> Performed as described</li>
            <li> I like that this is not a wooden one that is harder to keep clean and that cracks over time. Also the bristles are firm but not like being scoured.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest shower brush!  I used to own a Swissco brush with a wooden (or maybe bamboo) handle.  I loved it but it just didn&#x27;t last.  It grew moldy, the finish began to flake off of the wood and some of the bristles started falling out.  I was very happy with the bristle stiffness, however.  Not so hard it hurt my skin, but hard enough that I felt I was getting a good scrub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is the best of both worlds.  The texture of the bristles is just as good as my first Swissco, and the plastic handle makes the whole brush more durable.  As others have said, it can be a little slippery if you get a bunch of soap on the handle, but no so much that I&#x27;ve ever dropped it or found it to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it really is durable - I&#x27;ve been using it for two years, a shower every day (sometimes two) and it&#x27;s still in great condition.  Also - I know that some have said that it doesn&#x27;t lather well but I&#x27;ve never had any problems getting a nice, soapy lather.  I wholeheartedly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush.  I keep it in my shower and I have not had any issues with it getting dirty or moldy.  None of the bristles have fallen out.  I definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Reach is very good. The brushing end does get soft even when wet so it cleans very good. I am embarrassed to admit it but every time I use it the water color changes.</li>
            <li> the perfect back brush...for me!</li>
            <li> As others have stated, it gets slippery in a soapy hand.  It would be a lot nicer a few inches longer, too.  One excellent characteristic is that it holds up well to ten minutes of boiling water exposure for sanitizing.</li>
            <li> Works great not to rough or soft.</li>
            <li> This is a quality brush at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and good handle length.  Did not give it 5 stars because it really does not look like tortoise shell..</li>
            <li> Nice brush, good quality, this brush will not lose all the fiber in a short time, and it&#x27;s long enough</li>
            <li> The brush is okay quality. I was really hoping for a tortoise look to the plastic to match my other bath accessories, but honestly it&#x27;s not at all what I was expecting or what the photo looks like. It&#x27;s more opaque light reddish-brown with a few swirls of black. Not the deep amber transparent/translucent you would normally associate with tortoise colored plastic. The customer photo that someone else posted is more accurate for color.</li>
            <li> Well made, soft bristles and long enough to reach those itchy spots no matter where on your back they might be.</li>
            <li> Been trying to find a good back brush for the shower for months and this one is perfect. Bristles are not too hard, seem well secured and feel great on the skin. Creates a great lather also, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Reallly  GOOD !!!... i loved  it becauis it il long  enough  and the  hair is in  the  right  strenght so  you can  feel  you are  really  cleaning  your  back.......besid  it look mor  elegant  than the other brand, and  the plastic  material  does not have the problem of  the  wooden ones</li>
            <li> its a brush and i rub my bum with it&lt;br /&gt;did you thik i wouldnt give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Very nice brush.  Bristles are stiff enough to feel like you&#x27;re getting clean but not so stiff that you feel that you&#x27;re losing a layer of skin.  My only complaint is that once you add soap the handle is very slippery, making it easy to drop.  I wish there were a rubber grip.</li>
            <li> Really like this.  Use it in my shower every day.  I personally think the bristles are just right....not too rough at all.  Four stars because of the slippery handle.  I often just hold onto the back of the brush unless I am doing my back or the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li> I love my bath brush, its perfect.  Had a hard time finding one at a store.  Use it mostly for my feet.</li>
            <li> Nice and stiff, you know where it&#x27;s been.  This is my second purchase of this brush.  It works!  One two.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. T is handy to use,&lt;br /&gt;It is easy  to clean. It was sent promptly. Sturdy</li>
            <li> Loving this brush sturdy and holds up to daily use .  Have no complaints and would certainly buy again -</li>
            <li> Bristles a little stiff at first but I really like this for the price.</li>
            <li> Squeak! This bath brush is great for getting hard-to-reach areas on the body. Occasionally, the brush is a little rough for my tastes and can feel quite scratchy, but it does have a nice design and an understated look to it.</li>
            <li> This works fine. I wanted it to scratch my back pretty hard in the shower. Its medium firm so it does the job pretty well. Decent.&lt;br /&gt;If I was to design one I would go a little longer and a touch firmer, but this works fine. It comes with a string so you can hang it.</li>
            <li> The brush is a very good back brush if you like a loofah which I do.  It is somewhat stiff and will not get soapy.  But if you are into removing dead skin cells this is an excellent brush.</li>
            <li> Some other reviews say the bristles are too rough. Assuming one is in the shower, just hold the heat under the water for a moment and they soften up, though they aren&#x27;t all that stiff to begin with. Handle looks to be well designed too, so no risk of breaking unless abused.</li>
            <li> This back brush is just what we were looking for. The brush is just the right firmness we like and feels good using it. The only thing I would change is some kind of gripper on the handle as it does tend to slip some, but that is a minor thing to us. We also like how it looks, which is just like the picture.</li>
            <li> This product is very stiff and hard to get the liquid body soap that I use to stay in the brush. I need a softer brush.</li>
            <li> Have wanted one for a long time and it does help to reach the back area.  I had always wondered if I was reaching the necessary areas of the back.  It seems to serve the purpose.</li>
            <li> I like to be able to scrub my back and had tried the wooden devices sold at Target, etc., which fell apart after a few months of use.  This device is very durable.  I&#x27;ve used mine for probably six months now and the bristles are every bit as taunt as the day I received it.  The handle is shaped perfectly to allow access to all back areas.  I am very pleased with the utility this brush provides and cannot imagine how it could be improved.</li>
            <li> Nicely made and does a great job</li>
            <li> Great, except the braided cord becomes unknotted when wet so I need to figure out some type of loop to attach to hang in the shower</li>
            <li> Not too bad and does the job okay, but I think a bigger flex on the part u hold would make easier. The bristles are very soft, tho, to really scrub your skin.  Looks nice.</li>
            <li> I really like this bath brush. The handle is long enough with a little curve to make it easier to use and it rinses off easily under the shower. I&#x27;m not crazy about the tortoise shell color, but it didn&#x27;t come in any other color. It doesn&#x27;t clash with my bathroom colors, but it doesn&#x27;t add anything either. The main thing is that it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> bristles felt a little too stiff at first use, switched back to my natural boar bristle and realized this brush just felt better.  I like too that the handle is attached not wedged into the head like those bamboo ones, and the reach is adequate.  Would like to see someone make a handle about 6 to 10 inches longer which would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This works very well and does not feel or look cheap.  Great for post hip surgery.</li>
            <li> Great item, useful and sturdy</li>
            <li> Bristles are FIRM in my opinion!  Not sure if thats a good thing yet or not - maybe they will last longer?</li>
            <li> Helps keep your back clean</li>
            <li> The brush head itself works well, but it gets very slippery and hard to hold on to</li>
            <li> Very nice, right curvature to the handle.</li>
            <li> GREAT BRUSH, WISHED I ORDERED TWO.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush based on other reviews. I won&#x27;t do that anymore. I used to own two boats; they had to be taken out of the water once a year to have the barnacles scraped off the bottom. I wish I had this brush at that time. It nearly took the skin off my body. It&#x27;s like the metal brushes they use to remove rust. It gets two stars for sturdy construction, which is much better than the brush I had previously which felt great but disintegrated after a few uses. The whole amazon review process is abused by shills and saboteurs, which you can read all about if you Google the topic. Insasmuch as you cannot know if this review is a plant by a competitor, all you can do is take your chances and don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t tell you.</li>
            <li> Sturdy... works well..... a good value.  Hard to find in stores.  Should last a long time.  Good design and good quality.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve got it, It&#x27;s perfect for my needs.  I prefer a stiffer brush and this one seemed too soft to my hands but ended up being great for my back.  Also the combination of generous length and curved handle means that I can reach every inch of my back (and my legs) without a hassle.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with the brush and it seems strong enough that I shouldn&#x27;t break the handle bearing down like the last one I owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Edit):  I&#x27;ve had this brush for three months now and I cannot say enough good things about it.  The handle is definitely built tough as I bear down a fair amount and it doesn&#x27;t faze it in the slightest.  There is no give in the handle which means you can apply as much pressure as you want to the head without worrying about snapping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush.  I should have bought one long ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few sisal brushes with wooden handles. Those have very sturdy bristles and scrub nicely, but after a while the bristles get soft and some kind of dark mold or something begins to take over the on the wooden surface where the bristles are embedded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought I&#x27;d give the Swissco Deluxe Bath Brush a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did. The bristles are almost as stiff as sisal, and the plastic handle should avoid the problem with mold. After a few months the bristles are still holding up very well, so I&#x27;m hopeful this brush will last longer than my previous sisal brushes. The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I can observe is that the handle is a narrow and has a polished surface, so it takes some getting used to holding it with soapy hands (it&#x27;s pretty slippery). If they could make this brush with a handle that really lets you grip, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!!!  My BACK loves it!!!!!!!  Have only used it once and I can&#x27;t tell you how happy it made my back.  Oh so easy to use.  I am 76 and I rarely say anything is easy to use anymore.  But this back brush is sooooo easy to use.  Soft against you skin, so soothing.  If you are reading this  .......  do yourself a favor and get one.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a year and like everything about it so far.  The curve of the handle makes it easy to use for back scrubbing.  The bristles are just about the right level of stiffness and have held up well.  The price has proved to be a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve followed a bit of advice mentioned in a review somewhere by shaking as much water off the brush as possible and then letting it dry with the bristles facing down.  This seems to have helped keep the brush in good condition.</li>
            <li> The brush soaps up nicely and the bristles offer just the right tactile feel for a satisfying back scrub.  However, the slipperiness of the plastic handle does make it a little difficult to hold on tightly to the handle while scrubbing.  A rubber cover on the handle (or some other non-skid material) would improve the product.  Still, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I like the strength of the bristles of this brush.  The plastic handle is easy to hold.  I like the curved handle</li>
            <li> I use this brush every day, it gets those hard to reach spots on my back.</li>
            <li> Seems like this is from the 70&#x27;s in that it feel cheap and like it&#x27;s been waiting on a shelf for a few years. The main annoying thing about this is that there is no rubber handle, so if you&#x27;re using soap(which you probably are since this is for bath use) it slips out of your hand. Totally annoying and not worth it. I got this cause I thought it looked like tortoise shell but it just looks like cheap plastic</li>
            <li> Best brush ever - still holds bristle share after months of heavy use - I&#x27;m a scrubber big time and this holds up with a long arm to reach the middle of my back. Great bristles - don&#x27;t need a lot of pressure to get a good clean. Ordered two more</li>
            <li> This was so nicely made that I ordered another one for a friend.  The brushes were really good compared to others that I had tried.  The all one piece made it sturdy as I had a previous one that was not all one piece and it broke in a couple weeks.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase as it is a great quality</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the good reviews that it received.  I like the bristles--not too hard (like my wooden brush&#x27;s bristles) or too soft.  I also like the curve of the handle--works well for washing your back.  Unfortunately, the handle is flat and wide and does not allow for a good grip, and the plastic finish on the handle makes it slippery when soapy.  I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;m going to drop it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and needed plus the simple plastic cover protected the brush as needed. thanks Steve</li>
            <li> So far so good, what can I say about a brush.  Feels as good as the one I payed 50.00 for</li>
            <li> To scratch one&#x27;s own back is divine, even when you have other options. This thing looks pretty, and was cheap enough to easily discard when it stops looking presentable. My last one of these thugs had a removable brush head, which was an ill-conceived feature necessitating a lot of fishing. This one is swell.</li>
            <li> Have used this for about a year now (2-3 times a week), and it&#x27;s still going strong. I would only increase the stiffness of the bristles if I was asked what I would change about it.</li>
            <li> this brush is good quality and it is fine for brushing your back. It was not day for me to locate a good back brush and this one is great..</li>
            <li> This brush works great for scrubbing my back with body wash, as well as putting lotion or body oil on it after my shower.  The latter is especially important in the Winter, when the air is extra dry from heaters and such.  No more dry, itchy back!</li>
            <li> Long, beautiful, luxurious.  Makes me feel like I&#x27;m in a 1920&#x27;s film.  Very nice bristles and very long handle.  Does the job just great!!!</li>
            <li> The Swissco Delux Bath Brush meets my needs; good reach length for the back with flexible but stiff bristles for a stimulating scrub.  At the end of the handle it should have an anti-slip application since the smooth plastic handle can become slippery and hard to hold when soaped up.</li>
            <li> The heading says it all: this brush is just too stiff for me.  It hurts!&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t lather when I put bath get on it.&lt;br /&gt;I now use it to get dirt off my feet, but it&#x27;s too hard for my back.&lt;br /&gt;It also slips out of my hands frequently because of the slippery handle.</li>
            <li> The bristles are uncomfortably hard.  I still use it, but it&#x27;s a little painful.  No need for the bristles to be so hard.</li>
            <li> love the handle that looks like tortoise shell but is plastic, cleanable and will last longer.</li>
            <li> Brush has been serving me well for a couple of months. A nice medium between hard/stiff and soft bristles. I have a slight agreement with other reviewers about grip limitations (indented handle takes some personal adjustment to use). rounded handle would be a little easier to grasp.</li>
            <li> Major problem is the handle, it is slippery, you can not hold onto it, the handle is too narrow and slick. I  had to used Duck tape on the grip, did not help .</li>
            <li> I actually use the brush for a back scratcher, I&#x27;m disabled and can&#x27;t reach my back easily with my hands. But the brush works great!</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff and the handle is difficult to stop slipping from your hands when wet. There are better</li>
            <li> The bush is a little stiff for my taste.  I would have preferred softer bristles... over all good quality brush.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, new, good price. O.K. as a back up, not sturdy enough for an everyday use.</li>
            <li> Bristles a little too soft</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this brush. Just the right stiffness to really satisfy the itch and massage the back - but not so stiff as to be abrasive.</li>
            <li> Finally!  A good men&#x27;s bath brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always thought that as men, we can do better than a washcloth, or a simply bar of soap rubbed over one&#x27;s hairy body, with the subsequent attachment of all the unsightly hairs to the bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, too many of these scrubbers suck.  They are too feminine.  They are too cheap and break.  They are too harsh and scratch your skin off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I found this one.  It is a good man&#x27;s brown tortoise, and the bristles are a mix of nylon and boar&#x27;s bristle.  It is just stiff and soft enough and every time I use it I feel I am using a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent.</li>
            <li> Well made, looks nice.  Keeps those hard to reach areas clean.  What more can I say.</li>
            <li> Perfect and fast shipping. great quality</li>
            <li> Keep my back feeling right</li>
            <li> AWESOME BRUSH FOR THE BACK *****THIS IS THE BEST BACK BRUSH THAT I EVER USED......TRY IT AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT I MEAN....</li>
            <li> Thought handle was wood , the plastic handle slips in your hand if you have any soap on it, the curve in the handle would be perfect for Egor the hunchback and the bristles feel like nails , boars hair  my ass. But it does work good at scrubbing the tires on my truck. At 17 dollars I&#x27;m asking when I get my kiss because I got the rest.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the box and ran my hand across the brush about 30 bristles fell off in my hand.  A VERY gentle tug on some of the remaining bristles pulled out another 30 or so.  I&#x27;m still using the brush and it appears to work pretty well.  The curve of the handle is excellent.  We&#x27;ll see how long it takes before it loses enough bristles to be useless.  So far, I like it.  It&#x27;s not as stiff as I&#x27;d like but it&#x27;s stiff enough to work for scrubbing my back alright.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush and does exactly what I purchased it for, scrubs my back in the shower.  The description says \\&quot;Perfectly fit your hand for a secure grip which makes it so easy to use.\\&quot;  I took off 1 star for this misconception.  I wish it had a rubber handle or grip, as it becomes more difficult to handle when it&#x27;s wet and soapy.  A rubber grip handle would fix this problem. :o)</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews more carefully before ordering this. While the bristles are good, not too stiff and not too soft, and the brush is long enough to reach the hard places, there is one basic flaw; the handle is slicker than goose poop. It is hard enough to get a firm grip when it is dry. Soaking wet in the shower? Impossible! The only reason I gave this two stars is because I think I can rehabilitate the poor thing; maybe use some bicycle handlebar tape like one reviewer did. Even if it works though, I resent the time and expense required.</li>
            <li> I am a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) practitioner and with that territory comes back acne.  The reason is because in BJJ you spend a lot of time on your back with a sweaty, heavy Gi.  Back acne is a common problem for BJJ pracitioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up specifically for my post-training showers and it dramatically improved the skin quality on my back.  It is a bit stiff but for my purposes I like that, it REALLY exfoliates and scrubs deeply into the skin.</li>
            <li> Decent quality.  One thing that has given me some issues is the handle is very slippery when you have even a little soap on it.  Seems tough enough and should hold up.</li>
            <li> The plastic handle is better than a wooden one for cleanliness purposes and is better designed to help reach the back.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush. Some have complained that the bristles are too hard. When I first started using it, I thought maybe they were a bit harsh. But, within a week or so, my skin became accustomed to it and now I wouldn&#x27;t want the bristles to be any softer.</li>
            <li> Sorry guys but the handle snapped after the third use in the shower.  I don&#x27;t think the plastic is good quality at all.</li>
            <li> I need something that is more like 24 inches to reach all of my back due to some arthritis in my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty big guy at 6&#x27; 4&amp;#34; and this brush does a really good job reaching my back, legs, and feet. The bristles are just right. Not too hard and not too soft.</li>
            <li> I like the brush. I can easily reach any spot on my back.  the curved handle is a big wrist saver.  the bristle clusters do not touch, so you need to put the soap on your back and move it around(can&#x27;t put soap on the brush).  the bristles feel firm when scrubbing.  i like that, but if you want a soft brush, this is not it.  we&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time.</li>
            <li> Not too soft not too hard just right to actually clean. Lasts long time</li>
            <li> The solution for bacne. Dry brush before you shower and use again in the shower with soap. The brush is a good size and the handle is angled just right.</li>
            <li> I wish the bristles were just a tad stiffer and the handle ridged so the grip wouldn&#x27;t slip</li>
            <li> Works great, bristles feel good and it is easy to reach all the spots that I can otherwise reach.  Sturdy and is holding up well.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, well sized with just the right firmness of bristles.</li>
            <li> Nice bath brush. Nice long handle with a good shape to grip. The only thing that would make it perfect is if the brisltes held soap a little better. Otherwise this is well worth the money. It is also nice ot have the plastic handle that is not going to mildew or come aprt after a few months.</li>
            <li> I had great hopes for this brush but was quite disappointed. The brush is not as stiff as the description suggests and doesn&#x27;t do a really good job of back scrubbing. A big problem is that the handle is all plastic and virtually impossible to grip and apply any pressure if it is soapy.</li>
            <li> Brush handle got slippery with soap unlike a wood handle brush and handle was a bit short - not good for a tall person.  Bristles were a bit harder than I expected.  Not really up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Needs a better grip on the handle. Tends to slip</li>
            <li> I t is an excellent product for older people to use when showering or bathing as it does an outstanding job..</li>
            <li> brussels are  to stiff,,,no lather,,,just doesnt work as well as my old one</li>
            <li> I like this brush except for one thing it&#x27;s hard to hold onto .handle  is too slick add a little soap its out of control.</li>
            <li> Actually I was a bit dissappointed with it. It is too heavy so when your hands are wet and soapy it tend to slip around. You need to rinse all the soap off of your hand to get a good grip. Also one of the bristle tufts fell out of the plastic already, after less than two months of use. For the price I paid I was expecting a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> Others have noted the handle gets slippery when soapy...so I take the extra 2 seconds to rinse my hands before scrubbing. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great brush, I&#x27;ve had one for a long time, it&#x27;s stayed as good as new. Bristles are, well, bristle-y, but about right for a good scrubbing. This is a solid item. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only six foot and I had a difficult time trying to reach my entire back with this. It sounds kind of hillbilly but the only brush I&#x27;ve found that is both long enough and stiff enough for me is one made for cars. Just throwing that out there.</li>
            <li> The previous three brushes I bought (from drug store) fell apart in a couple of weeks - the heads disintegrated and/or bristles fell out. Another lasted only half a bath. This Swissco brush was more expensive but well worth it. It&#x27;s sturdy, feels good, does the job, shows no sign of wear after 13 months of frequent use. A FEW other reviewers have complained about: (1) &amp;#34;Stiff bristles&amp;#34; -- but they feel fine to me and really do the job; (2) &amp;#34;Curved handle&amp;#34; -- it works better for me than straight; (3) &amp;#34;Slippery grip&amp;#34; -- I&#x27;m 73 yrs old with touch of arthritis and have no trouble; those with weak grip can add tape; (4) &amp;#34;Can&#x27;t reach all parts of back&amp;#34; -- some people aren&#x27;t very flexible; (5) &amp;#34;Fell apart, lost bristles&amp;#34; -- could they be rating the wrong product?? This one is bomb-proof! The narrow neck where the handle meets the head looks like a weak point, but after all this time with vigorous use, mine shows no sign of stress. Anything this good is likely to disappear from the market, so I&#x27;m taking no chances and buying another right away as insurance. I&#x27;m very happy!!!</li>
            <li> This brush provides a nice scrub and is long enough to clean your back. I would recommend this to everyone. The brush is about 16 1/2 inches long. This includes the head of the brush.</li>
            <li> This is a seriously durable product.  I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year &amp; it&#x27;s still as solidly durable as day 1.  Great quality.  The bristles on mine have even been smashed out of proportion when traveling &amp; as soon as they hit water it&#x27;s like they go back to perfection as seen in the photo.  The product is simply durable made with serious lasting quality.  Buy it, high recommend.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever had beats the old wood brush hands down. Don&#x27;t hesitate it is a good quality product</li>
            <li> Back brushes like this are hard to find in stores.  This has just the right amount of firmness to the bristles; not too soft and not too stiff.&lt;br /&gt;It has a perfect length and arch to reach the hard-to-reach places on your back and the construction seems so much better than others I have purchased where the bristles started falling out after less than a year&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like using a kitchen scrub brush on your back.  I have used it enough to know it won&#x27;t &#x27;break in.&#x27;</li>
            <li> if this brush felt as soft to my mid back as it did to the palm of my hand, i would give it five stars. unfortunately, the texture takes a dramatic turn for the worse when i use it in the shower. it&#x27;s tolerable but if it felt any coarser i would surely have returned it. it&#x27;s not marketed as an exfoliating brush but they may want to consider re-branding it that way. other than that, the ergonomic design works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Although it won&#x27;t connect to the internet, it works just fine on my long torso (I am 6&amp;#34; 03&amp;#34;).  The bristles are firm, just right for a good scrub.  The smooth plastic handle is a little slippery if your hands are soapy, but the grip is fine otherwise.  I recommend it.  Update:  After dropping about 2-1/2 feet, the head of the brush smacked the tile floor.  The brush did NOT break, crack, or disfigure in any way.</li>
            <li> Like this brush. The bristles are just right, soft but firm. The curved handle makes it easier to reach my back. Seems very sturdy but it is plastic.</li>
            <li> So far so good. But this brush will suffer from comparison with a Kohler back brush that I used every day in the shower for over 20 years instead of a washcloth. I only replaced it because the soap scum was getting harder and harder to remove. Sadly, Kohler no longer sells brushes.</li>
            <li> Very useful brush to wash those hard-to-reach areas of my body.  Bristles are firm but not stiff.</li>
            <li> Not as smooth but gets the job done!</li>
            <li> The handle is way too slippery. With wet or soapy hands this thing is more like a weapon. I dropped mine every time I used it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these for years! Yeah!!!</li>
            <li> Does what it says. Wish it had a rubberized grip but it is long enough to reach my back. Great for tall people. Bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> Good brush, I just wish it had a handle that offered more traction when covered in soap.</li>
            <li> brush ok but handle a little too short for me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine -- nice quality</li>
            <li> Made out of plastic and bristles are very stiff at first.  Eventually softened up and is good. If not used for a long time can get very stiff again.</li>
            <li> Although this brush has a nice look and feel, the bristles were not  enough for me. They are soft. If are looking for a softer feel, then this would be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It feels wonderful on my back. I use it with a scrub I make out of olive oil and salt. It works great! I love that it&#x27;s slightly curved so it reaches all parts of my back.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something with softer bristes.  The bristles tend to scratch.  It was not what I was looking for.  Length is fine</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how hard it was to find a good bath brush!  I couldn&#x27;t find one in a store so went to Amazon.  After reading many reviews of many different ones I went with the Swissco Deluxe and it is perfect.  Just what I wanted and works great.  Has a must have rope on it to hang it up in the shower and is very sturdy and feels great on your back.  In some reviews of other brushes, people say the brushes are not right for their size etc, so if it helps I am 65, female &amp; 5ft 6in tall.</li>
            <li> I have been in need of a new brush, so taking a chance I purchased this one to replace my worn wooden two-piece scrubber with removable head. I have to say I like this one a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this is a piece brush. The one I had previously allowed you to seperate the head from the handle so you could strap the head to your hand and scrub with your hand. That was annoying because the head would always come loose and fall off the handle. With this one piece you never have to worry about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are softer than I&#x27;m used to (I&#x27;m used to a really stiff and abrasive brush), but it still scrubs and exfoliates perfectly fine. It also doesn&#x27;t lather much, as others have noted, but lather doesn&#x27;t mean clean. I feel that this brush cleans great and effectively, no matter the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have complained about the handle being too slippery. I didn&#x27;t find it particularly slick, but it is smooth so if you have soapy hands it may slip. It&#x27;s not a problem for me however. I think for anybody who wants a more grippy handle, they can rough up this handle with a brillo pad or some sandpaper to make it more grippy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m really happy with this brush. It&#x27;s sturdy, well designed, has good bristles, and is well balanced. A great purchase.</li>
            <li> I have looked in several big box stores for a good, durable bath brush.  I purchase a high end brush from a bath specific store.  It was the most expensive that they had and within two months, the brush was loosing bristles.  This bath brush is functional, durable, and attractive.  The curved handle is very nice.</li>
            <li> My guy uses these in the shower and he says this is the best one he has ever had. I was leery of it being plastic, but it is heavy duty and does not feel flimsy at all. The bristles are strong but not so tough that they hurt.</li>
            <li> Although one major selling point of this brush is its uniquely curved handle, I find it somewhat awkward to use.  It is made of quality materials that suggest that it will hold up well.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality brush. The head is firm and does a great job in the shower. The angle is perfect as well and gets those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> I tried to find a brush all over town but they were all too soft. Even this one could be stiffer but i&#x27;m happy with it. Handle could be longer but I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this product, only one suggestion to the maker. Mold some texture into the handle. It&#x27;s slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very slick like other reviews say. Before I used it, I filed shallow grooves around the handle with a triangle file. This greatly improved the grip with soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d gladly buy this product again if need be.</li>
            <li> The handle of this brush is very slick. I had to change my shower routine. I use the brush at the end of my shower on my back. Also good for dirty kneecaps and elbows.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the brush looks great. The only downside is that the bristles are very tough. I&#x27;m a guy and it&#x27;s not as soft as it should be.</li>
            <li> The brush is great but the loop of line to hang it isn&#x27;t worth anything.  It is fused with heat but eventually will come apart.</li>
            <li> Having, suffered from a dull tortoise for years, imagine my delight when I found the answer to several litanies and more than a few human sacrifices.&lt;br /&gt;I tell you, my tortoise gleams!&lt;br /&gt;People stop me on the street and ask,&amp;#34;Who polished your tortoise?&amp;#34; And my answer is a very proud &amp; loud,&amp;#34;..Why, I brush it myself!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really liked the look of this brush so disregarded the negative reviews and now I regret it. This brush does get slippery so makes it hard to handle despite the brush angle. Plus the brush bristles do not allow soap to lather so it is useless and it is very scratchy. Wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> Ive had this brush for several months. Nice brush, bristles are a bit soft.  The curvature makes it easier to reach tough spots. The acrylic handle and bristles dry quickly and therefore resist mold and mildew.</li>
            <li> Did what it was supposed to do, no issues.</li>
            <li> Nice brush...long handle..easy to reach back.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to properly clean my back when in the shower. At my age I can no longer wash my entire back with a wash cloath. This brush is great.</li>
            <li> A decent brush with good bristles that hold body wash well. However, the plastic handle is very slippery and it was necessary to wrap the end with waterproof tape for better gripping. The handle is also to short for complete coverage of my back although I am taller than average.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Microfiber Exfoliating Back Scrubber (which I found to be a pill to keep clean &amp; free of mold).  This brush allows me to not only scrub my back, but also my feet &amp; between my toes--something that I had not anticipated.  It holds soap really well &amp; is VERY easy to rinse off between uses.  It easily hangs on the shower hot/cold handles or shower head pipe.  After scrubbing my back, the water stings just a tad, letting me know that I have actually exposed new skin, as the brush successfully exfoliated the old.  The length of the handle allows for easy over the shoulder reach.  Additional angles are also pleasantly possible per experimentation.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, the handle is long enough and the bristles are a perfect texture. Should have bought 2 of these instead of the other one I bought.</li>
            <li> The brush is much rougher than I wanted. If I use it enough to spread around soap, it feels like it is ready to take off the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it would be OK if someone wants that kind of a &amp;#34;vigorous&amp;#34; scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does appear to be well made.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who says it&#x27;s the best brush he&#x27;s ever used! He&#x27;s been through many different ones!</li>
            <li> Been looking for a brush with a bit more firmness in the bristles, this one works great for that. As some have said, handle is a bit slippery, but really not that bad. (I may slide a foam bicycle handlebar grip over the end)All that being said...short of Sandra Bullock using it on your back for you (5 stars then)...great brush!!</li>
            <li> A few years ago, my in-laws gave me a bath set for my birthday that included a bath brush with  natural extra firm bristles and a wooden handle. I adored the brush, but had to throw it out after about 6 months since the wood was absorbing and retaining so much moisture in my very stuffy and humid bathroom that even when kept out of the tub area, it never completely dried at the base of the bristles. When I decided to replace it, I wanted the same firmness and almost abrasive bristles, but a plastic handle that would retain less moisture and hopefully extend the lifespan of the brush. This one looked like what I wanted and the first time I used it, I was hooked. It scrubbed as firmly as I wanted,  and dried completely in an hour,  despite being left in the shower area as a test. Hopefully I won&#x27;t have to replace it for a few years, but even if it only lasts a year, it&#x27;ll have been worth it for the price and satisfaction. I&#x27;ll definitely be getting another when mine wears out.</li>
            <li> I love it !! I use it daily from my back to the back of my caves it does a great job.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The handle is nice and long, with just the right curve to reach the middle of my back easily from any angle.  The bristles have lost little stiffness after more than a year, and only one or two ever fell out.</li>
            <li> Would make a suitable floor scrub brush,too stiff to lather bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;Can not recommend unless used commercially however length and finish are fine</li>
            <li> I recommend this one to everyone. It&#x27;s got a really long handle which get&#x27;s everywhere on your back. Nice bristles too</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased this brush and was very impressed with the positive feedback.  There were a few reviews that only gave a few stars and I totally disagree with them.  The design of the brush is perfect, the other ones I&#x27;ve owned had a straight handle which made it awkward to use.  The other low rating mentioned that the brush was very rough, again I totally disagree. The brush is well designed and worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I got this brush because I wanted a curved fixed head back brush. The design of the brush itself is nice, but the bristles are too hard and feel like they are scratching me. This would be a great brush if it was all boar hair, which would be softer.</li>
            <li> This is a solid curved-handle brush. I&#x27;ve used it for a month and it has yet to slip out of my hand. The handle is smooth plastic, but it has a rivet in the middle for your fingers to dig in.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as he needed a new shower brush, he is very pleased with it! Great quality!</li>
            <li> I used to use one that had loofa rather than bristles. I really feel like thins one cleans my back much better. The only down side is the handle is VERY slippery with soapy hands. They should make it textured and it would be perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I have had many bath brushes over the years. They break, the bristles are too hard or too soft. The length of the handle isn&#x27;t quite right. The brush is very heavy or cumbersome to work with. But this bath brush is the best! Gets to all my back parts and the bristles are tough but not harsh. My only complaint is that the end of the handle sometimes twists in my hands. It needs a slightly rounded or molded end. But other than this, this is my best bath brush ever!</li>
            <li> Really nice bath brush that does a good job of rubbing soap around and also getting that itching back during the winter months!  The bristles are a little soft compared to a natural hog bristle wooden brush I owned that cracked and shed the prickly pieces all over the shower floor.  The handle has a nice curve that makes getting to those hard spots easier.  From the way it is put together I believe the brush should last a nice long while.  It&#x27;s a keeper and would buy again!</li>
            <li> Handle is long so doing the whole back is easier. This replaced one I&#x27;ve had for a while. This is better. Bristles are stiff, but not to hard which is perfect. Good back brush.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this brush I had a hard sponge on a wooden handle.  That didn&#x27;t work well.  The sponge kept coming off the handle and was, generally, poorly made.  This brush appears well made and has already outlasted the sponge on a stick.  For me, it works very well for reaching those hard to reach spots between the shoulder blades.  It is a very welcome addition to my morning shower.</li>
            <li> Long enough with a good curve. Wood-appearing plastic. Brushes stiff but not too much. I was using a wooden brush from Target previously.</li>
            <li> I had bought a back brush in a drug store that broke the first week I used it, so I was looking for a better brush that would not break and I read that this one wouldn&#x27;t break.  I bought two of them, one for my sister.  I have been using it for a couple months and it&#x27;s great.  The bristles are just right, giving me a nice scrubbing and the handle is nice and long.  The only improvement they could make is to put a grip on the handle.  I know this one will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Hello, ladies, look at your man, now back to me, now back at your man, now back to me. Sadly, he isn’t me, but if he scrubbed his back, he could be clean as me. Look down, back up, where are you? You’re on a boat with the man your man could smell like. What’s in your hand, back at me....................I’m on a horse.</li>
            <li> The brush is easy to use and unlikely to break. The only problem with it is, the smoothness of the handle makes it a bit slippery, Otherwise, a nice quality product.</li>
            <li> So far no problems to report with this brush.  I&#x27;m able to reach all parts of my back and the brush isn&#x27;t too firm so it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> The length and curve of the handle make it perfect if you are not very flexible and don&#x27;t have a long reach. I love the wood look to go with our steam room and because it is plastic, it has not suffered fading or rotting in the humidity. The bristles are just right.</li>
            <li> I like how big this thing is. It&#x27;s been good so far, great product, well made. Good value over all.</li>
            <li> This brush is NICE. Handle is long and the curve is perfect. Does the job and feels like it will last. Everyone here loves it.</li>
            <li> This brush definitely has a sturdy feel to it, though it&#x27;s slippery when wet and soapy with no grip design on the handle. Bristles are quite rough on the back, but I did get used to it over time. Overall, it&#x27;s OK. Seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> This brush really exfoliates, it does get slippery though. Lol</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey but fortunately it lived up to the great Reviews here.  It performs well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This would have been dandy, if not for the fact that it broke when first used, the brush end broke off the handle end.  The company did make good on the purchase price, however.  I liked that it was curved, rather than straight handled, but either it was damaged in shipping, or when shipped.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the best bath brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve had one in the past and it lasted nearly 10 years before I broke the handle.  The bristles are strongly attached so they never fall out over time.  They are also the perfect texture meaning they are never too stiff and harsh and never too soft and worthless.  The ergonomic handle is a real plus since you can reach better and just about anywhere with great ease even the bottoms of your feet.</li>
            <li> Excellent back brush! This Swissco is way better than the more expensive Fuller Brush back brush. Get it. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. Works.  Brush is nice, not too hard, not too soft.</li>
            <li> we using the brush to clean the bathroom tub and sink.</li>
            <li> Spreads that soap and soothes that itch.</li>
            <li> I like the long handle. The only problem thus far is once you get the handle soapy you can&#x27;t hang onto it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a back brush. It brushes my back. Yes, the plastic is a little slippery when wet and soapy, but I&#x27;ll bet it is more durable than wood which in my experience doesn&#x27;t last long in the shower environment. I&#x27;d give it five stars if it had a knurled grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 2015-05--05&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this brush for over a year now. I use it daily and keep in the shower. It is in just the same condition as when I bought it. Definitely more durable that the wooden ones I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 2017-02-12&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using this brush. It is still in very good condition. The bristles are still stiff.</li>
            <li> The handle is a bit slick if you have soapy hands, but the bristles are the right stiffness and the one-piece design is much better than the wooden varieties. It appears to be indestructible.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the ones you find at Walmart or Bath and Body Works. I hate how the wood on the other ones mold and fall apart. No worries with this. Very sturdy and work really well. Will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Amazing and soft. Works really well!</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 star instead of a 5, because the handle is slippery to hold on to....which I did read about in some of the other reviews.  However, I have seen on some other products an application of a gripper, or groves, anything to help out would be nice.  I will try wrapping a wash cloth around the handle.  Other than that, very nice, good looking, and stiffer bristles, which is what I am always&lt;br /&gt;looking for.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush.  Built with solid material.  Brush is not flimsy.  Recommend anyone buy it.</li>
            <li> I  got this brush for my mom cause she has trouble reaching her legs and back during shower time and she loves it she said its perfect she uses it everyday recommend this to all</li>
            <li> Great brush. Better than expected. Yes, it is a tad stiff, but I&#x27;ve grown to like it and wouldn&#x27;t want a softer brush now. Highly recommend. Only down side is that the cord it came with didn&#x27;t stay on long.&lt;br /&gt;I will get another one should this one eventually bite the dust.</li>
            <li> I love using this brush.  It is a bit curved (angled) so easy to reach those &amp;#34;hard to get to places&amp;#34;.  The bristles have just enough hardness and flexibility to give a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Nice, sturdy brush with not-too-hard, not-too-soft bristles.  Provides a nice angle of attack to get all of your back.  Leaves a nice feel - tingle but not irritated skin.  Seems quite durable.</li>
            <li> My husband is the one who uses this brush and he loves it!  Says it&#x27;s the perfect texture for scrubbing his back and the handle is curved just right for comfort.  The only problem is, he dropped the first one on our ceramic tile shower floor and it broke, so we had to buy another.  So I guess my only improvement suggestion would be to make these brushes from bamboo rather than plastic!</li>
            <li> I bought it to wash my back and it does exactly that, Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this to all who realizes they need to wash their back</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He says he likes it because the handle isn&#x27;t wooden.  Also, the bristles seem to be more durable, they haven&#x27;t started to look worn or mashed.  I would buy this again, most likely.</li>
            <li> Nice coarseness, good exfoliating feeling. Tried some others that were just too soft, the Swissco is coarse enough, good scrub, good cleaning.</li>
            <li> A career of pounding cheeseburgers and buying ice cream in the convenient half-gallon single serving size has left me at a disadvantage in the shower.  This brush is just the ticket for those hard to reach places like the back of my neck, heck, the back of my everything for that matter.  Once when I was attempting to clean some of my generous folds, half a ham sandwich fell out!  Buy this brush, it&#x27;s sturdy and effective, and the bristles aren&#x27;t too stiff.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and he loves it! Good sturdy design, I hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Getting a little older and can&#x27;t reach to wash my back very well.  Probably hasn&#x27;t been washed in years.  LOL  Enter Swissco Deluxe brush.  Bought it for Christmas for the wife, but it&#x27;s really for me. Shhh, don&#x27;t tell her. This is more like it.  It reaches and scubs very well.  Not itchy anymore.  Brush appears to be very well made and is not too harsh.  Should have bought one years ago.</li>
            <li> After having thrown out too many bath brushes with wooden handles because of mildew, I was happy to find this one. Not sure why, but good bath brushes are really hard to find in drug stores!</li>
            <li> The curve of the handle makes it difficult to use on the back.My hands have difficulty using the angle of the handle. I also have shoulder problems. The straight handle is so much better for the back. I do not recommend this back brush. Why is it so hard to find a back brush with a straight handle that is 19 -22 inches long? We men with big backs need such a back brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush to reach those hard to reach places on your upper and lower back, your thighs, even your chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the old fashioned wash rag for years, but never quite felt clean until I purchased this brush.  The bristles are stiff enough to get you clean, but not so stiff as to cut your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, Oh.  You don&#x27;t need any fake gods, angels, etc. to let you know you&#x27;re super clean.  ;)</li>
            <li> Solid construction, plastic has a nice \\&quot;grain\\&quot; to it, tough bristles, holds a good suz, cleans easy and drains well. Feels awesome on my back.</li>
            <li> Great bath brush. Much better than the plastic bristle models.</li>
            <li> but brush to soft to clean. will not soap well ,slippery when wet ,i drop it all the time.it needs to be wood.</li>
            <li> Too stiff for me. Handle is also slippery with soapy hands.</li>
            <li> I bought this to scratch my back in those hard to reach places...I find the tools that are made specifically for this purpose are either too dull or ill designed for reaching the lower sections of my back (particularly when I am clothed).  This has a particularly long handle and is arched properly for the task, but the mixture of boar and synthetic bristles is, I suspect, best suited for wet use, for which the brush is designed.  It works better than anything else I have tried to date, so I am happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a wooden brush with natural bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I like the natural bristles much better, but the wood is compromised by always being wet and eventually fails.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad they don&#x27;t make a natural bristle with a plastic handle.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works perfectly. Glad I did the research before buying this product. Very pleased. A+</li>
            <li> Great bath brush!  They have stiff bristles that work well on the back and other hard to reach spots. This is not a flimsy weak bath brush.  I liked it so well that I bought two of them (one for each bath).</li>
            <li> Nice length, sturdy nylon bristles. not real soft, a nice scrub for non sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using this brush for a while and it is really great. My back is really smooth now since, I can clean it efficiently. The only bad thing that happen was that the little yarn that was attached to the end of the handle fell off within a couple of days. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to clean their back well or hard to reach places. Brush is very sturdy as well.</li>
            <li> I have had a rotator cuff issue and it has been difficult reaching and scrubbing my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews on this and took in consideration that it has an angled brush.  It really does make a difference. For those who have shoulder problems you need the angled brush. Those lucky enough not to have shoulder issues it would not matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was wonderful to use it on my back and it takes very little pressure to get a through cleaning of your back. It has a nice long handle which is also needed for anyone with shoulder issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this . I love it!</li>
            <li> But as lovely as this is it&#x27;s not for me.  I have found the answer to a body scrubber is not the rather soft bristles here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been searching for a shower brush that was that perfect soft/firm. They were all either too soft, or way too scratchy that it was painful - i took the chance by buying one online and I&#x27;m glad i did - this is perfect. I even like the little curve it has to the brush, makes it perfect for back scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, and.  expected from description. Perfect longer length. Perfect brush consistency. Not too soft. And not so stiff it scrapes your skin off.</li>
            <li> I got this to be able to scrub my back. It works pretty good but the angle of the brush still makes it a bit difficult to use. The bristles are a bit stronger than I like, but overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> its a brush..it operates as it should..soft texture makes it a gentle tool for bath or shower and if you like a more gentle brush this will do the job.</li>
            <li> Great idea to bend it for better back scratching with bristles that don&#x27;t stab you but bend and scrub as hoped for.</li>
            <li> I like the curved handle and it&#x27;s easy to hold.  Love the natural bristles...they&#x27;re sturdy yet gentle on the skin.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, absolutely wonderful. Bought 3 of these, and probably should get some more. One of my better purchases. Very nice bristles , very nice looking handle. It doesn&#x27;t bend all over the place when you put pressure on it. It&#x27;s just there, right where you put it. Very well made, should last forever. Very pretty too.</li>
            <li> Firm but not scratchy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product four years ago. I needed a new one not because it was wearing, but because of health concern having  something that long that in use on my body. The previous brush I had late sooo long held it&#x27;s quality but this same brush Is horrible. I have It two stars because it came in tacked. It looked liked the brush had been used, next time I will order straight from the company.</li>
            <li> A little harsh on the bristles but other than that, it is great for one to reach the back and lower legs.</li>
            <li> Alittle stiffer than I wanted , but it does the job and will probably lastlonger than my last such , but made with a wood handle brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband. I liked the reviews and love the brush. First, it works. Secondly, I like the materials, It is classy but doesn&#x27;t attract a lot of germs.  I wanted something non wood. This has a nice look in the bath sleek and beautiful and has a nice angle that seems to be perfect for my husbands back.</li>
            <li> Finally!  A brush that is angled to reach my back.  And with a brush head that won&#x27;t come off the handle!</li>
            <li> More like sandpaper than a bath brush.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush;  pluses include the long, curved handle and the perfect stiffness of bristle.  The only negative is the slippery-when-wet handle, for which I deducted one star.  However, I&#x27;d buy another without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brush. Would buy again</li>
            <li> The brush I owned previously had a head that was attached to the handle by a pressure fit, and would frequently fall off the handle, making ME fly off the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Swissco brush is permanently attached to the handle, so it doesn&#x27;t fall off.  The curved handle makes it easy to reach all the places on my back that I wish to scrub.  It is a much better design and a quality product.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft so I have doubts as to how long they will continue to be usable. The handle is also a little on the small size in terms of diameter and the plastic is very slick which makes it nearly impossible to hold onto with soapy hands. It is an OK brush but I will find something else to replace it in time.</li>
            <li> Like the length. Bristles kind of rough.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Stiff bristles give good cleaning action with little pressure.</li>
            <li> Works well ! reaches places your arm can&#x27;t . good for exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He says that he likes the bristles, but that the handle could be longer.</li>
            <li> As described, easy to keep clean. Bristles offer right mixture of softness vs. effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I thought the handle was made from wood but it&#x27;s actually plastic. But I do like the angle of the brush and it&#x27;s not too soft, not to harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> I found the bristles just right for wet brushing. The long curved handle makes brushing the back easy but is slippery if you have soap on your hands. However, I was told that one should not use soap at all when showering except where necessary.</li>
            <li> My grandson was pleased to receive this</li>
            <li> The bristles are great and the shape of the handle does make washing my back easier. I really like this brush The only thing, as noted in other reviews, the handle was very slippery when wet and with soap. What I did is I took a knife edge and scraped the handle to roughen the surface. This took care of the slippery and the brush works great.</li>
            <li> I drop this thing all the time! Have to wrap a wash cloth around the handle so it won&#x27;t slip out of my hand. To me this is very annoying.</li>
            <li> This brush is well made, but I didn&#x27;t like it for three reasons. First, I found the handle to be quite slippery when wet. Second, unlike other reviewers, the bristles were too stiff for my taste. Finally, I actually found the curved shape ill-conceived, making only the top of the brush contact my back comfortably. I picked up a cheap brush at a local Bed Bath and Beyond, and it&#x27;s much more to my liking. The wooden handle has more friction and grip when wet. The bristles are softer. And the straight handle allows the brush to sit flat on my back. One further note is that the Swissco brush has a synthetic rope at its end, used to hang it up. This rope never dries, which I&#x27;m sure the microbes love. The cheap brush&#x27;s thin ribbon, used instead of the rope, dries completely between uses.</li>
            <li> I like the angle of this brush, and unlike some reviewers have commented, I have no trouble at all holding on the the handle when my hands are wet or soapy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! It is exactly what I hoped it would be. Awesome quality too. This bath brush should last me a very long time. Thanks for making a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are VERY sharp. It hurts!! They started falling out after using it just once. The handle is made of smooth hard plastic that is impossible to grip when it&#x27;s wet and soapy. Very bad design.</li>
            <li> This brush is nice looking and it gets the job done reaching those hard to reach places on your back.  One reviewer said the soap didn&#x27;t lather well on it.  I think that may depend on the soap one is using.  The trick is to lather the soap on the brush first, then use it.</li>
            <li> Still in close to perfect condition.  I use this bath brush every day; it looks almost new.  Very few worn bristles and they are still as strong and firm as when purchased.  I had been using the $3-5$ type you buy at the drugstore, replacing them several time a year for either  bristle wear, mildew, or simply falling apart.  I am totally pleased with the value of this bath brush.  3 Years Later!!  I have never reviewed anything twice!  But this brush is still going strong!  By now, I would have replaced any other back brush 3-4 times.  Strongly recommend for workmanship and durability!</li>
            <li> We had a poufy webbed scrubber on a stick (think like the nylon bags your avocados or oranges come in) and that was useless - it did not have enough density to scrub your back and soap was always trapped in the core of it and made it discolor fast.  We were using the stick more than the scrubber head...or that&#x27;s what it felt like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got this and were delighted with it!  It is not too hard, not too soft.  Really great angle so you can get your back easily.  Great on the feet too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend and worth the money.</li>
            <li> This brush was great...better than expected.  I would certainly recommend this as it was what i have been looking for</li>
            <li> great with exception, if your hands are covered in soap, prepare yourself, its hard as hell to hold on to.</li>
            <li> Love it! I wish it was a little longer but it&#x27;s fine. Feels great on my back. Great scrubbing power. it&#x27;s not the extremely hard and cheap one that I bought that tried to scrub or better yet scrape away my life. I recommend this to people who wouldn&#x27;t mind the medium length.</li>
