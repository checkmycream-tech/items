            <li>I am blessed with fairly good skin</li>
            <li>, My husband who has tried just about every mask out there mud peel warming... etc... loved this mask.</li>
            <li>However I decided to wait it out for a good two minutes.  </li>
            <li>During this time of intensehell fire burning, I imagined what the flames of hell felt like and decided it was as good as time as ever to say my prayers for the evening and repent of my sins...</li>
            <li>I had been searching for a good mud mask for years.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I absolutely loved the result, and felt hooked on the product after just one use.</li>
            <li>Good or Bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin...</li>
            <li>I loved the cooling sensation on my face.</li>
            <li>The product was good.</li>
            <li>The product is really good.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a good way.</li>
            <li>It did really good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I also want to mention that this burns surprisingly a lot.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>, &#x27;GOOD&#x27; TO MY FACE AND NECK.</li>
            <li>The stamps of this product is tumbledown, it does not look like from good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>it immediately  burned when I applied (and not in a good way).</li>
            <li>However I gave it a try and absolutely loved the results.</li>
            <li>It works so good</li>
            <li>I always wanted a good mud mask for my skin.</li>
            <li>but it does its job good</li>
            <li>Definitely loved and recommend this product.</li>
            <li>However, I will say to keep it a good distance away from your eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for a breakout and</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>and I loved the way my skin felt after.</li>
            <li>good stuff .As</li>
            <li>have ever used but, saw good results from one use</li>

            <li>Good.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product for good results.</li>
            <li>I think I made a good decision to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second good thing I remember-</li>
            <li>I was not expecting the mask to make my skin tingle, but it did in a good way.</li>
            <li>It tightens the skin, and I believe it brings any impurities to the surface, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It works and smells good.</li>
            <li>so this was surprising.</li>
            <li>(oh the joy), so I am always shopping around for detoxing mud masks and was given a discount to sample and submit honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good value.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>Works really good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a really good mud mask for a while.</li>
            <li>Really good product, I like it.</li>
            <li>but I do feel like the mask made good on it&#x27;s promise.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt this good in years.</li>
            <li>and we skin feels so good.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin</li>

            <li>, I also want to mention that this burns surprisingly a lot.</li>
            <li>It smells good.  </li>
            <li>It also did a good job clearing some of my acne.</li>
            <li>Best face mask, it leaves my face smooth like silk.</li>
            <li>While this product doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant of smells it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that while my skin isn&#x27;t perfect, it has improved significantly!  </li>
            <li>Nice and pleasant mask that feels good after washing off.</li>
            <li>but it washed off easily!!</li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t the most beautiful thing ever</li>
            <li>The jar is the perfect size for me to fit my fingers into and the lid is nice and secure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and was in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>But surprisingly, it does more than that!</li>
            <li>This is very excellent and I very much recommend it!</li>
            <li>It was very easy to wash off and my skin looked amazing afterwards!  </li>
            <li>I am so very pleased with this mask.  </li>
            <li>But after it washes off it felt very refreshing.</li>
            <li>my skin feels so fresh :D</li>
            <li>Just do it, you will be sooooo happy I promise. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It smells really good and feels amazing when you put it on, very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the use of this mud.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>But no :) I am using the mud on my problematic skin now, used it for 4 times and I am so happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;No allergic reactions whatsoever.</li>

            <li>This works great for acne, scars and skin conditions of many types.  </li>
            <li>The eucalyptus makes it feel very refreshing.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - Refreshing mask that does a great job of exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to confidently say that I can and will continue to use this product for my skin revitalizing needs.</li>
            <li>a mask that leaves my skin hydrated is very important!</li>
            <li>am very pleased and cant wait to use it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then, I washed the remaining mud off with warm water and my skin felt really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a nice eucalyptus scent to it that reminds me of the spa at the Luxor in Vegas.. loved that</li>
            <li>Yep, it&#x27;s that good and the price is nice too.</li>
            <li>Maybe for therapeutic procedures its good because it has a nice minty smell.</li>
            <li>It just feels right to keep using a product that keeps producing wonderful results!</li>
            <li>and after I was able to pluck six hairs that magically showed up!!</li>
            <li>Very good and keep your skin clean.</li>
            <li>We then rinsed it off easily with a warm washcloth and loved the results!</li>
            <li>I toughed out the 10 minutes, which feel incredibly longer when your face feels like it was put inside the a jar filled with fire ants, and after taking off the mask, my skin felt amazing afterward.</li>
            <li>The smell is a great mint aroma, followed the direction on Amazon(container doesn&#x27;t have much on good detailed instructions.)</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin that can be easily irritated, and I was very happy when I came to the realization that the mask had not caused any kind of reaction and that I was actually very happy with the way my skin looks and feels after using the  Mask.</li>

            <li>love this product and would for sure recommend it!</li>
            <li>I will update as I use more product with more details!</li>
            <li>:) Love it!</li>
            <li>not quite sure if would purchase again, need more time will let you know as I continue using this one!</li>
            <li>:) i love it!</li>
            <li>skin felt nice and bright and clean after.</li>
            <li>easy on, easy off..feels great..</li>
            <li>I was excited that I got chosen to buy for a reduced price during a promotion and was so pleasantly suprised.  </li>
            <li>Pure &amp; Essential Minerals has done an excellent job of including ingredients that condition the skin without being too moisturizing, with the end result being what I consider to be the perfect mud</li>
            <li>I look forward to applying this once a week before my shower and then enjoying the  warm tingle for 15-20min before washing off.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mask I have ever used .</li>
            <li>opened the container and realized the mask was kind of runny instead of the more creamier consistency I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Another thing was that I wish I was able to tell what kind of improvements there were after using it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve experienced that, this mask is probably worth a try.</li>
            <li>It is advised to use the mask weekly for a blemish free bright and glowing complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smells good and smooth on the face.</li>
            <li>I have used it once so far and am really happy with it!</li>
            <li>It has a really nice feeling to it, like it is authentic.</li>
            <li>As a kid I loved playing in the mud I would create huge mud baths in our driveway.</li>
            <li>In this regard, I think the eucalyptus oil is a brilliant addition to the formula – it really works well with the mud to purify the skin.</li>
            <li>I liked it and will buy more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great success for me</li>
            <li>feel of the mask is a bit goopy when you place your fingers in it to scoop out but not anything more then what you would expect when sticking your hand into &amp;#34;MUD&amp;#34; but it goes on nicely on the face.</li>
            <li>well so that it didn&#x27;t leak and has professional labeling that makes it great for gift giving as well!</li>
            <li>but, I think it’s worth it just for how great my skin</li>
            <li>I honestly didn’t mind it and even enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this item through a promotion deal in return I had to leave an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>really nice product... love it....</li>
            <li>It is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff has the most amazing feel to it</li>
            <li>Rather, I honestly think that they should sell this product in a more hygienic packaging that won&#x27;t have the possibility of being exposed to contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made my skin have a wonderful natural glow.  </li>
            <li>and this one really gets the job done and drys wonderfully on the face very quickly.</li>
            <li>also love that this mask comes in a pretty good sized tub!</li>
            <li>WONDERFUL~ my first time trying any mud mask, and my daughter and I loved it so much that we will continue to purchase.</li>

            <li>wish the labeled indicated this because I would&#x27;ve used more of it</li>
            <li>I like this product more than the aztec clay.</li>
            <li>It was so refreshing</li>
            <li>Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t cause any break out, but also help me skin to absorb better with my skin care product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I received this in a promtion to review because I would never have bought it.</li>
            <li>When this runs out I will gladly buy it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love everything about this product.</li>
            <li>I can feel the burn, but it&#x27;s worth it if you want some good skin.</li>
            <li>The eucalyptus oil in it smells nice, but it isn&#x27;t the primary smell.</li>
            <li>but it came with an ebook about keeping a healthy skin</li>
            <li>Immediately after my skin is more even</li>
            <li>you can just tell it smells like that :-)</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>This mask was okay</li>
            <li>OMG the most wonder mud mask ever.</li>
            <li>so I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I really liked how my face felt after using this mask, I don&#x27;t think I will use the free e-book</li>
            <li>I suffer from Graves&#x27; Disease and the hormonal imbalances often times cause my skin to break out no matter what products I use or how healthy my diet is.</li>
            <li>I let it harden and after about 7 minutes I started to rub if off my skin and exfoliated my skin with my hands; all I did was rub it around with my fingers and got as most off as I could</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Made my face feel really nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t leave it on more than 10 minutes</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love this product, it works I can feel the tightness on my face.</li>
            <li>Will order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>The best way to figure it out is to have just enough so that it dries within 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Even so I am sure I would order it again........</li>
            <li>but it was so overwhelming I had to run to the bathroom and wipe it off my face.</li>
            <li>I love this Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>For the price it delivers everything it claims and my clients just love it.&lt;br /&gt;Gail</li>
            <li>and it feels really refreshing while it&#x27;s working!&lt;br</li>

            <li>I like it :)</li>
            <li>I love the tingle sensation and how refreshed my skin feels afterwards.</li>

            <li>pores appear smaller, and my face feels great after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>It also seemed to make my skin breakout more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was stoked when I got approved to review this mud mask because it couldn&#x27;t have come up at a better time.</li>
            <li>but it was good fun.</li>
            <li>I imagine I’ll be able to use this mask maybe a handful of times before I start to worry the product has been too contaminated to continue using on my face without prompting a breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I did notice a lot more acne.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I love the ingredients, the texture, and the way it feels during and after.</li>
            <li>After just one treatment, my skin looked better.</li>
            <li>I use it every week and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>This mask has changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>i just love it -</li>
            <li>Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s refreshing and smells</li>
            <li>Love using it once</li>
            <li>sometimes&lt;br /&gt;Twice!&lt;br /&gt;Great product and reviews didn&#x27;t lie for sure</li>
            <li>but the scent itself stung my eye) but got better after about a minute.</li>

            <li>My face felt nice and smooth afterward.</li>

            <li>Make sure not to get any on your clothes as it can stain.  </li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>We both noticed the initial tingle-which I associate with the Eucalyptus Oil-and it was great!</li>
            <li>so tha fact that this works great on my skin is a real plus.</li>
            <li>Nothing overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I love it and look forward to continue using it.</li>
            <li>That being said I used the product and enjoyed it</li>

            <li>This also made the blackheads on my nose look better and came out easier when I used my extraction tool and Paula&#x27;s Choice BHA 9.  </li>

            <li>I really enjoyed this mud mask.</li>
            <li>I can see getting many uses out of this container.</li>

            <li>One thing I really love is that they don’t test on animals.</li>
            <li>It can be challenging to find beauty products that are organic.  </li>
            <li>It has more than 21 skin-reviving minerals including, magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.  </li>

            <li>I really love this mask, I got it because it was well rated</li>
            <li>The longer you go without doing it, the more oils and toxins, the more pain.</li>

            <li>and you get a nice cool tingly sensation.</li>

            <li>I continuously felt the cool sensation after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>Overall, it has good results, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the burning sensation or the smell.</li>
            <li>I would really suggest this mask for many reasons.</li>
            <li>so I would recommend using it only on problem areas every couple of weeks instead of weekly and follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love it and works fast</li>
            <li>And I also notice that when I rinse my skin after, my skin feels really oily like the water sits on top.</li>
            <li>It is a good size jar that should last awhile!</li>
            <li>Hi there, I enjoyed using this product and feel it is of high quality!</li>
            <li>but then after a minute or two it lessened to just a cool tingle.  </li>
            <li>It truly cleans and reduces your pores, leaving your skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>The organic Shea Butter, Aloe and Jojoba oils really add a lovely moisturizing element.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face so smooth and it feels so fresh.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I am delighted to find something for my daughter that actually works.</li>
            <li>I love this mask so much.</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to using it every week because it does feel really, really good.</li>
            <li>just love how much it clears them up after using this</li>
            <li>It really made a difference with my skin as well, it looked refreshed and so healthy.</li>
            <li>Feels cool and soothing.</li>
            <li>As I was applying the mud to my face I was surprised by the nice tingling I was feeling (it felt like eucalyptus).</li>
            <li>After that it was a cool feeling like I have mint on my face.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin nice a soft feeling</li>
            <li>Overall good product.  </li>
            <li>It is not a bad smell if you get used to it.</li>
            <li>and I must say, not bad...</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely an allergy and not a bad batch, because I tested it on my boyfriend and he had no problems.  </li>
            <li>Face tingled for a while after taking the mask off, but it was not a bad feeling.</li>
            <li>The 5-10 minutes each week is definitely worth it and the mask is a great value (the 6oz container goes a long way)!</li>
            <li>When applying the mask you need to make sure you get an nice even layer and then let it dry about 15-20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>enjoyed this product, I loved the slight tingly/warming sensation I felt</li>

            <li>I had been looking for a good dead sea mud mask recently, and after seeing all these good comments about it, I decided to give it a try!</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth and actual clean kind of a feeling.</li>
            <li>Came off pretty easy too.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty easily after washing and rinsing but not drying my face.</li>
            <li>Great mask left my skin very soft easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The smell is indeed very strong but if you have ever been to the Dead Sea and experienced the smell of sulfur, you know you got the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had alot of mud masks and this one is by far the best one.it isnt thick like most of them.it goes on smooth .I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>It hardens pretty quick and is easy to get off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This &#x27;Pure&#x27; Dead Sea Mud Mask works great!</li>
            <li>Another great experience with a Pure &amp; Essential Minerals product.</li>
            <li>I usually use this after I wash off all my makeup, exfoliated, and than open my pores with warm water to get the best out of the mask.</li>
            <li>Not only is it a relaxing, pleasant, and refreshing experience, but it will leave your face feeling fresh and new.</li>
            <li>It made my face feel clean &amp; fresh.</li>

            <li>My skin felt clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>Like it says it gently dries on my face after about five minutes, when I take the mask off it leaves my skin so smooth, clean, fresh and blemish free.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels clean and fresh with a glow afterwards.</li>
            <li>My skin looks really fresh and clean.</li>

            <li>It works super well.</li>
            <li>Super watery</li>
            <li>mask was easy to apply, kind to my skin, and left my face feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was extremely quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but I haven&#x27;t felt okay with my skin since middle school.</li>

            <li>I love dead sea mask, it just makes your face and body feel so good inside.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more vibrant and youthful and everything from the scent of the treatment to the texture helped me feel pampered and relaxed.</li>
            <li>so I put this on and it helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Not too drying and mildly exfoliating when you remove it.  </li>
            <li>I also use it as a quick spot treatment for blemishes and irritations and it helps to reduce swelling and redness.</li>
            <li>It recommends you use this once a week to prevent drying out your skin, and at that rate this one container will last you many many months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li>The mask dries quickly and allows your skin to feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job at deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes, you wipe it off with a warm damp cloth and you are left with a silky smooth face that looks refreshed and glows.</li>
            <li>It makes your face breathe as it dries and it does so quickly.</li>
            <li>I Highly recomend this product, you can feel the freshness as soon as you apply the product on your face and top part of neck.</li>
            <li>Love this mask and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>After the use of this mask, my skin feels very smooth, soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It feels very clean and leaves a smooth and soft skin.</li>
            <li>I hope you get the chance to try it and enjoy it as much as I did!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and definitely will be purchasing again.  </li>
            <li>I get more breakouts and my skin is dryer than normal.</li>
            <li>The corners of my nose feel more like normal skin.</li>
            <li>Like it,  does sting when first put on but face feels smooth after</li>
            <li>It may not look great with its dark greyish color</li>
            <li>Overall, Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Just minutes ago i tried this product for the very first time.</li>
            <li>I tried other Mud Mask and by far this is the best one I have tried.</li>
            <li>From the very first time I tried it I felt the difference on my skin and had my roommate try it</li>
            <li>My skin felt so smooth after the first use.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve really used a mask, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it does make my skin very smooth and reduces oil in my T-zone.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my skin feel smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>I just love this mask, it leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>After laying there and relaxing for about 10 minutes, it dried and was very easy to remove and wash off with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for new masks to try, and I really love this one.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and this mask works amazingly.</li>
            <li>more clean, fresh, and natural.</li>
            <li>it was less than attractive to have a mud colored mask on in front of my dad and husband</li>
            <li>Would absolutely buy another product from the company and strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to spread on, a real pleasure to wear as it dries.</li>
            <li>Tingly but not too much for my skin though my daughter said it was a bit strong for her face.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy to use</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want you skin &amp;#34;overexposed&amp;#34; because the oils in this are strong and will really really tingle.</li>
            <li>I had so much redness and big bumps with acne, but in 3 applications I have seen remarkable improvment.</li>
            <li>It takes longer than some masks to dry – a good 15-20 minutes for me</li>
            <li>Pretty good results for a mask that I&#x27;ve only used once.</li>
            <li>Initially, it smells pretty good</li>
            <li>It washes off easily and my skin feels really refreshed.  </li>
            <li>the Dead Sea Mud Face Mask is very effective for clean the skin and remove the impurities, i recommend it</li>
            <li>I love the fact that all of the ingredients in this product are natural!</li>
            <li>this left my face feeling refreshed &amp; smooth!!</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin gets cleansed from deep within and enjoyed this mask a lot!</li>
            <li>had read reviews and my acne stopped after first use!</li>
            <li>Not only was my skin able to handle it, it also leaves my face glowing!</li>
            <li>Just received this yesterday and already notice results after my first mask!</li>
            <li>Love this mask it makes my face feel and look alive!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!!!</li>
            <li>It will really make your eyes water!!  </li>
            <li>Haha!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone and we will be back for more when this is gone easy.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and makes face look clear and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It really does purge and cleanse your face and leaves it feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li>My face does feel very smooth and soft after using it.</li>
            <li>and I have been looking for a good Mask that is natural as I am very sensitive to products.</li>
            <li>This mask has an incredibly strong scent – one of the major ingredients is eucalyptus oil, and you can’t miss the menthol odor at all, but it also has a strong earthy smell from the mud.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone looking for a smooth and clean glowing face.</li>
            <li>It gives a tingly feeling at first and once you take it off, your pores feel clean.</li>
            <li>Just remember to wash your face first, then stir the mask before applying it to your clean face.</li>
            <li>Even after the first use, my skin felt refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>My skin was super smooth, bright, and extra soft after using this just the first time!</li>
            <li>Has a slight tingle and the eucalyptus scent makes it very nice.  </li>
            <li>It washed off easily and I could really tell a difference in my skin right after using it.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of this Dead-Sea-Facial-Mask the benefits to keeping the skin healthy and acne free, and not to mention the glow your skin has from using good ingredients on your face and delicate area!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not wash your face or do any other kind of strong treatments before doing this mask.</li>
            <li>I noticed results right after the very first use- my skin immediately seemed more even and soft.</li>
            <li>This Dead Sea mud face mask is great.</li>
            <li>My face felt amazing after and felt like I was 5 years younger!</li>
            <li>I hope you get the chance to try it and enjoy it as much as I did!feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I will comeback in a few more days to give a more detailed review.</li>
            <li>Smell, feel, look and ease of use (though a bit messy, lol).</li>
            <li>I know the dead sea is supposed to be great for your skin</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>,-) Happy with Dead Sea Mud Musk</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and works great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be happy to review the product again after a few months of use.</li>
            <li>Whole face was bright red after.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel great after using the Dead Sea Mud mask.</li>
            <li>and I seen an episode of the Duggars when they went to the dead sea and had talked about the great benefits of the mud</li>
            <li>So exciting to get this product.</li>
            <li>Her face is more even tone, and clear of acne.</li>
            <li>I received the product complimentary to test and/or review.</li>
            <li>But it feels fresh after removing it ..</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look and feel fresh.</li>
            <li>I do not hold a stake in the success of this product or the company which created it.</li>
            <li>and the fact that it has all natural ingredients and not tested on animals  cant wait to used it again :-)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is good for sensitive skin (and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>Its clear and I look more refreshed.</li>
            <li>Best Dead Sea Mud product that I bought so far.</li>
            <li>After washing it off, my face felt fresh.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is natural products.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product and I expect the bottle to last me quite a while!</li>
            <li>but it is really useful.</li>
            <li>Was able to leave my skin feeling fantastic and very deeply cleaned.  </li>
            <li>Powerful stuff.</li>
            <li>Wow, I really love this</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t expect it to smell like fresh flowers</li>
            <li>product worked well and was a completely safe and natural product.  </li>
            <li>makes it totally worth it.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about it though is that as soon as you wash it off you can feel how soft and nourished  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still early to tell but my skin does seem to feel smoother and look more even toned.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>I had a lot of fun with it too, I made it into a &amp;#34;spa night&amp;#34; at my house.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to apply - what kid didn&#x27;t roll around in the mud for fun??</li>

            <li>And I love that this is made of all natural ingredients and</li>
            <li>so I rarely use masks</li>
            <li>We women have different grades of beauty products we own in our vanities.</li>
            <li>Made to naturally exfoliate, moisturize, cleanse and balance for healthy radiant skin.</li>
            <li>It smelled like eucalyptus and fresh mint.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest I still haven&#x27;t worn make up (and I won&#x27;t till next week)</li>

            <li>Like most competitive products out there where you have to use “THREE” bottles in order to have clear skin.. (please…).  </li>
            <li>talk about getting your money’s worth.</li>
            <li>then you wash off whatever is left with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It says I believe to only to use it once a week, and I&#x27;m still kind of experimenting with it.</li>
            <li>Everything from mix your own powder with water or Apple Cider Vinegar to already mixed in the jar like this one.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the results; they are Much better than I expected!</li>

            <li>Rinsed it off and unlike with many masks, which once rinsed off leave the skin feeling stripped and squeaky clean, this one left my skin feeling like I had already applied moisturizer and allowed it to absorb.</li>

            <li>, I squeeze and the dirt comes off right away.</li>
            <li>They gave me refund right aways.</li>
            <li>I tried the mask right away.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m pretty pleased and happy with this product and definitely will recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also feels very natural and not like its full of chemicals!</li>
            <li>The first thing that you&#x27;ll notice when you open the jar is it&#x27;s amazing aroma.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable that the product is in tub-like container in which you pretty much have to dip your fingers in to access.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and ready to receive dirt again.</li>
            <li>The only thing Is that it kind if burns when you first apply it but than after a while it goes away.</li>
            <li>and there and this mask really helps clean my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too soon to speak of lasting benefit, but I liked the first use.</li>
            <li>at first it feels really nice, cool and smooth, but it starts to burn my skin a little.</li>
            <li>and it may not be the most pleasant smell (in other words, it smells bad :D )</li>
            <li>I thought for some reason that it was going to be powder, but it is already mixed and was very easy for them to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting to feel the mud mask harden and restrict any major movements on your face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to help with skin your completion and smooth appearance.</li>
            <li>Compared to any of the clays or muds we&#x27;ve used before, this Dead Sea Mud Mask has shown the most impressive results as far as detoxifying skin and leaving it with a younger appearance.</li>
            <li>It most definitely is a cooling and mildly tingling mask.  </li>
            <li>It dried within 10 minutes and was easy to remove with a bit of warm water.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice it doesnt dry the skin it leaves it looking fresh .its</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Amazon customer for many years, prime the last 5 years</li>
            <li>My skin has had a nice glow, and has been very clear and soft.</li>
            <li>If you can get past the smell, the feeling afterwards is great.</li>
            <li>If you can get past the smell it does a great job......................</li>
            <li>When combined with the intense eucalyptus, it’s not all that pleasant… I do enjoy the smell of menthol, so if that was the only detectable scent, I’m sure it wouldn’t bother me in the slightest.</li>
            <li>If you can get past the smell then this product is great for you.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and pretty inex</li>
            <li>This is a great mask to use every few days and is not drying at all!</li>
            <li>They really nailed it on this one as far as Great Face Masks that actually work go.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels very tingly and cool on my face.</li>
            <li>I can’t wait to see what kind of results long term usage will bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling smooth and clean after the very first wash.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feels great, I love it, the first them though it stung a bit and made my skin a little red.</li>
            <li>It was also not difficult to wash all the residue off, and my skin felt refreshed and very squeaky clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and oily skin and have used masks for most of my adult life (I&#x27;m now in my sixties).</li>
            <li>Like all mud-masks, it is a bit messy but it came off pretty easily with warm water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a nice refreshment to the face, use after a long day!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more of this wonderful Deep Sea Mud Mask for myself and other family members to use!</li>
            <li>But, I will say that even after the first use I noticed right away that my face felt smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>Do not apply right after shower, nor after washing your face with hot water</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels younger, softer, clean, bright, popes are smaller, acne is going away...</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to strong smells like I am, then this product will work for you.</li>
            <li>It has eucalyptus oil in which I actually liked because it gives you that clean tingle feeling ( I suppose could also be from the aloe) but at the same time even if u don&#x27;t put it near your eyes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was too strong for my sensitive skin .</li>
            <li>Just received my Dead Sea mud facial mask and it&#x27;s awesome !</li>
            <li>I waited till it was dry, then started to wipe it off with warm water and a damp hand towel.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>The end result was good, smoother skin and less wrinkle lines.</li>
            <li>I love how this mask gently exfoliates and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It shipped super fast, was packaged</li>
            <li>They ship super fast and the customer service is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>think that the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is awesome!  </li>
            <li>However this mask truly delivers, after one use my face felt super soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It really shrinks pores and helps with my super oily skin.</li>
            <li>The dead sea are great ingredients and this product really embraces those ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and it does not dry or leave face more oily.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>My face always feels nice, soft and clean and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so clean and super soft.</li>
            <li>There is a rather strong smell with this mask, but it is natural minerals and there is no fragrance added to mask the smell.</li>
            <li>and so I am sensitive to extremely strong odors or fragrances.</li>
            <li>Seller was Super Fast</li>
            <li>once on the skin it feels really cooling and dries quick.</li>
            <li>My face felt very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels pretty cold on your face - if you use a mud mask you have to add water to you can elect to add warm water</li>
            <li>the consistency is light and it is overall very refreshing, it has some exfoliating particles that help with deep cleansing while the mud just refreshes and moisturizes your skin.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product because I love the way dead sea minerals make my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Dead sea mask made my skin feel so fresh , exactly like after a good scrub or photo rejuvenation but without the tenderness.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Please do make sure to wash it completely off your hands though so that you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes!</li>
            <li>Great mud facial, left skin smooth, soft, and nourished.</li>
            <li>I must say that I received this very very discounted to give my opinions.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li>I like this mask very much.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable for the results you can get.</li>
            <li>It feels nice, it feels like impurities are being lifted out and as the mask dries it definitely makes your facial skin tighten and continues to feel that way for a good while after the facial.</li>
            <li>I suspect there was a lighting/distraction trick used by the sales guy, since he wouldn&#x27;t let me walk to the other side of the kiosk to examine my image in more light.</li>
            <li>overall I thought it was pleasant and at least somewhat effective.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling super fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was lucky and bought it at a deeply discounted price, but would pay full price for this product!</li>
            <li>It feels so good when you put it on, and it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re at a little day spa.</li>
            <li>Really good product has a little sting to it going on the face , I&#x27;m guessing from the eucalyptus oil in it.</li>
            <li>After every use my skin feels so fresh and clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face soft and fresh and clean</li>
            <li>It is very intense at first, so</li>
            <li>Loved the little tingle sensation when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li>Dead Sea Mud Mask is a great and highly recommended mask for all skin types.</li>
            <li>It dries quick, dissolves quickly, consistency is smooth, is liquid (not sticky), and smells very clean (hardly any odor, period).</li>
            <li>I felt a hint of glow in the complexion after the first use.</li>
            <li>First time trying it</li>
            <li>a warning, when you first put in on, it tingles or burns, depending on what you did to your face beforehand.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and natural without any added fragrances.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I think I put it too close to my eyes the first time because the eucalyptus vapors made my eyes water a bit.</li>
            <li>But I wanted to try it asap because I love facial</li>
            <li>It really helped to even out my skin as well!</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time, I could feel and see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Just thinking of all the money I will save, and how I get to pamper myself with a facial every week makes me love this product even more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Has a tingling feeling when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>that I am willing to wear a bikini.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m willing to try just about anything to get rid of my zits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first noticed about this mask</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a big plus - I love using mud masks</li>
            <li>by the scent of the product when it first arrived.</li>
            <li>Ok...just used it first time</li>
            <li>This mud mask performs exactly as intended.</li>
            <li>morning, my skin looks even better than it did last night.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product and cannot wait to see what happens when I use it again next week.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied this product to my face</li>
            <li>I first put it on my skin burned, that is eucalyptus oil causing it.</li>
            <li>and I break out more than a normal 21 year old would.</li>
            <li>Essential oils are beneficial even when they are just inhaled so you get more than just the benefits in your skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>You get so many uses out of this jar because it&#x27;s so big!</li>
            <li>At first I tried to follow the instruction but it was hurting my skin.</li>
            <li>I have shift from doing my entire face to my most troublesome areas (nose, cheeks and chine).</li>
            <li>I looked very refreshed!</li>
            <li>I still remember the first time to use it after I got it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>So for the first 6 weeks</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because I have so-so skin (some acne, combination skin, and hyperpigmentation), I am always trying different products that might be able to help out.</li>
            <li>First time using the product, I put the mask on about 20 minutes before I got in the shower.</li>
            <li>I am constantly hunting for better beauty products.</li>
            <li>Ok so maybe my mud wasn&#x27;t the same as those sold in stores</li>
            <li>I love this facial mask and I like using it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I do recognize that it takes a lot for met give a stellar critique.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t burn and sting like it did when I first started using</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that my face felt soft, smooth, and skin looked brighter.  </li>
            <li>I have now found my favorite facial mask!</li>
            <li>so I would say even if it doesnt do anything in the first week or two</li>
            <li>I love this product except for one thing: the last ingredient, eucalyptus.</li>
            <li>this is my first time using this product and as soon as it touched my skin</li>
            <li>firstly, it still mind***s me to this day</li>
            <li>Only use once a week though, any more</li>
            <li>My face has never felt so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely repurchase it.</li>
            <li>Prior to applying this product, be sure to alert your family.  </li>
            <li>It did sting my eye a bit at first</li>
            <li>Fast shipping ..Love it !</li>
            <li>I love that from the second I put this mask on my face</li>
            <li>Really I do!  </li>
            <li>first washed my faced with my Paula&#x27;s Choice cleanser.  </li>
            <li>However this just totally amazed me on how the dryness was gone in many parts of my face.  </li>
            <li>It tangles but only because of the mint I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>When i first opened the jar it looked like someone had Just placed mud in there</li>
            <li>I could see the difference even when I used it the first time!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Now I have no idea on the shelf life for a mud mask, but I figure if you use it often that pretty soon you will be buying another one.</li>
            <li>only wish is that this would be reformulated to have a better scent and texture.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn at all like some masks do when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>It tingles at first when you put it on</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are no parabens or sulphates, which makes sense that this is a better deal when it comes to facial mask and your skin.</li>
            <li>I really did have quite the experience with this mask!</li>
            <li>but I really like it anyways!</li>
            <li>It was soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the fact, that the organic essential oils moisturize and hydrate your skin, helping to reduce wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>is the first mud mask I have ever tried</li>
            <li>I saw a drastic change the first time.</li>
            <li>It can burn a bit when you first put it on because of the peppermint oil</li>
            <li>and it was exactly like the mud.</li>
            <li>The description about this product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>your done‼  Plus the mud mask should last you for more than a month..</li>
            <li>When it first arrived I felt jipped by the size of the jar</li>
            <li>The mask has a burning feel when first applied</li>
            <li>The first time you use it, most likely it will feel like there is acid on your face.</li>
            <li>it was not this exact brand</li>
            <li>course being a guy, I was against the idea of doing something what I and most men would consider so feminine in regards to personal hygiene.</li>
            <li>Anyway when I first took it off I first thought, Woo I look like a baby, no wrinkles</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t put this in the fridge since the mint feeling is pretty overpowering and it won&#x27;t help it keep</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Just tried this for the first time.</li>
            <li>I feel like it worked on the first use.</li>
            <li>When I first apply it stings.</li>
            <li>I have been a big user of masks for many years.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling pretty refreshed.  </li>
            <li>After you wipe all of the blue off, you&#x27;ll feel your skin tighter and more polished.</li>
            <li>However, the first time I used this product I felt that it was working.  </li>
            <li>and I followed exactly what the instruction stated.  </li>
            <li>The mask stung the first time I tried it</li>
            <li>I put it on and immediately felt it getting hot on my face</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I thought my face was going to catch fire.</li>
            <li>That means that by buying it, you may be supporting incitement to genocide and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.</li>
            <li>I gave it a four star because when I first recieved this product, it burned my face, by that</li>
            <li>This is one my favorite facial masks.</li>
            <li>, it make you face look and feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li>It burned my face at the first time, but I felt better the next time..</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and it makes my skin so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>When you first put it on, it sort of burns and then tingles, but I think that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>First of all you can see how your skin tone evens out after the couple first uses.</li>
            <li>When I first used it I felt my skin was burning or smth.</li>
            <li>As I went to reviews to see if this was what others were experiencing,  I saw so many reviews of the same.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li>I like the smooth texture and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It shrunk my pores with the first application.  </li>
            <li>just pulls out all that yucky oil as well as impurities, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth as well as shrinking the appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on my face I burned</li>
            <li>When you first apply this mask,  it feels like a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>At 25, I have pretty acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>If the first batch I bought had been like my most recent one, I would have never re purchased it.</li>
            <li>Overall, satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask!</li>
            <li>I felt a litter burning/sting when I first apply on, then it went away while drying.</li>
            <li>make sure you store this product in the fridge after you open it.</li>
            <li>As you can gues, I&#x27;d love results as soon as possible!!!</li>
            <li>My face felt really soft and smooth after application.</li>
            <li>first time urer..</li>
            <li>I can feel my skin soft &amp;amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>My friend had to quit using it because she actually broke out more while using it.</li>
            <li>Also don&#x27;t forget to stir it up first.</li>
            <li>After 20 mins I removed it and my skin felt so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>For me that was a big deal, I had tried so many products claiming to be a miracle acne healer but they never seemed to work.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You don&#x27;t need a lot to cover your whole face!</li>
            <li>Love the silky feeling this mask left me with.</li>
            <li>There is no grittiness or burning sensation and it leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>definitely need to take better care of my skin.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things to do with my skin is to give it a facial.</li>
            <li>The mud contains more than twenty-one skin-reviving materials that include minerals such as magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.</li>
            <li>These minerals are important for skin care because they are known to treat, detoxify and cleanse the skin keeping it looking young and</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft and smooth my face feels after I wash it off.</li>
            <li>Or, entirely plausibly, I just didn&#x27;t realize that I only have wrinkles on one side to begin with.</li>
            <li>did apply it to my face, and at first noticed a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>Now my boyfriend even wants to try it!  </li>
            <li>It has a tingling cooling sensation when you first put it on, but once you wash it off...</li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>When the mask first touch my face</li>
            <li>For example when you eat pepper for the first time and it starts to burn your mouth</li>
            <li>well that’s how it felt when I first had the mask on my face.</li>
            <li>Shipping was also fast!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any dryness or irritation - my skin actually felt quite a bit more moisturized afterward.</li>
            <li>I left it on for around 10 minutes while it tingled and worked its magic, then I started to wash it off.</li>
            <li>The quality of this mask is exactly what your face deserve</li>
            <li>I always loved every product I owned that came from the dead sea.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I loved the Dead Sea Mud Mask.  </li>
            <li>I received the Dead Sea Mud Face Mask in good condition.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply, not too dry or sandy.</li>
            <li>I left the Dead sea mud mask on for about 10 minutes and was able to quickly remove it with warm water.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product is cruelty free and comes right from the dead sea.</li>
            <li>and it made my skin feel so clean and soft!</li>
            <li>The mask makes my skin feel smooth, and it also has a slight exfoliating property which I enjoyed.</li>
            <li>its also kind of liquid and does dry fast.</li>
            <li>If you want a spa like facial for Super cheap buy this.  </li>
            <li>will be applying it every week as I really like how my skin feels after using the mask and it is so easy to use, no mixing and pouring, apply directly from the jar.&lt;br /&gt;**I</li>
            <li>My skin feels very supple right after application.</li>
            <li>is that it is a ready to use product right from the jar.</li>
            <li>But this product really surprised me, in that it immediately made my face feel clean and very much rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of anything that smells fresh and clean, and this mask is totally worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>No harsh texture and no skin discolor left behide love it!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and makes skin super soft and clear.</li>
            <li>My face and neck feels more hydrated, smooth and tight.</li>
            <li>but my pores are still very clean from initial cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very clean when I combine it with a steam facial.</li>
            <li>It is ideal for folks that want to do a little extra for their skin.</li>
            <li>It does have a pretty strong tingle factor that might be a little too intense for someone with sensitive skin, but that is something I enjoy in a good facial.</li>
            <li>The mask was easy to apply with my figures and it has a thinner, lighter, slightly grainy consistency than I have experienced with other mud masks.  </li>
            <li>This jar is rather large in comparison to other products that I have bought with my favorite ingredient, a full 6 ounces.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome bargain for a dead sea mud mask, and if you&#x27;re curious about trying it</li>

            <li>and it makes the skin feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and I loved having a reason to sit in my room an extra few minutes this morning.</li>
            <li>My face just feels really clean, soft and toned.</li>
            <li>This scrub not only got along with my skin, but loved how it left my face feel.</li>
            <li>I applied the mask for one minute and I am glad that I didn&#x27;t hold it longer  because my face was on fire and for the whole week was very red.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far (in a 1 week period) and so far I love</li>
            <li>The results have proven that much more promising than I could have possibly have hoped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Mud Facial is ideal as a once a week mask.</li>
            <li>so many good reviews here(I was so wrong to believe those reviews and bought the item).  </li>
            <li>I had recently boughten the white jar of glam glow which I loved</li>
            <li>You will instantly feel your skin soft and nice.</li>
            <li>Super easy and won&#x27;t over dry skin.</li>
            <li>the Eucalyptus does a great job of hiding the natural smell of the Dead Sea</li>
            <li>I think the most important part of skin care is to keep dead skin off of the face.</li>
            <li>: It smells very strong which I expected</li>
            <li>: It smells very strong which I expected</li>
            <li>I had used the mask about three times with positive results.</li>
            <li>Second, for $25, you get a huge tub of the mask – bigger than what most night creams come in.  </li>
            <li>this will be a bit intense at first</li>
            <li>I have used Dead Sea Mud from other companies for years and like the products, but this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>But it fades pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I pit it on my sons eczema and it looks better than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li>For a long time my favorite was a clay mask, but I think this product just edged it out.</li>
            <li>Very glad that I purchased Dead Sea mud face mask</li>
            <li>it was like my skin felt full and soft.</li>
            <li>I have had mud facials before in my past and loved them.  </li>
            <li>so I do not recommend it to anyone with highly sensitive skin or easily rashes with new skin products.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to see that the Dead Sea Facial Mask had a plesent smell even though its color scared me a little. :)</li>
            <li>It gives such a clean and fresh feeling when your done.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely Dead Sea Mud mask that will leave your skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I love the texture, it is slightly thin, which makes it very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It washes off pretty easily compared to the aforementioned Queen Helene mask, which can be a real chore to get wash</li>
            <li>I searched for a Mud mask that would be suitable for sensitive skin and this is what I got, I read only positive reviews and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting that at first, so I immediately washed it off, but it turns out that is normal!</li>
            <li>I got this for $1.00 on Snagshout.com , but when I run out I will definitely pay full price!</li>
            <li>It came off easily when I rubbed it for the extra exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel super soft and</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Super soft</li>
            <li>Skin feels super soft and pleasan to touch after washing off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made my face feel soft and fresh the first use and is clearing out my flaws in my face.</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft and like velvet.</li>
            <li>After the first week of using it, it left my skin really smooth</li>
            <li>I prefer a thinner face mask more so of a thicker one, as it takes longer to dry.</li>
            <li>It was really easy to open and close.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, just make sure to moisturize well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels super soft after using the product</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use it more than once a week because I don&#x27;t want to dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my face feel and letting the mask dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First things first, this company absolutely rocked when it came to fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I put on the mask near the sink so if my face burned again, I could wash it of quickly.</li>
            <li>and it washed of easily the next morning</li>
            <li>It washed off just as easy and your nightly facial cleaner.  </li>
            <li>and I was worried it would dry my face out even more than it already is</li>
            <li>There is a fair amount so it will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>On a personal note, the eucalyptus is quite strong.</li>
            <li>first I used warm water to remove the mask after it dried, because let&#x27;s face</li>
            <li>I use another brand now from Amazon (true you organics dead sea mud mask) which is much better on my skin...</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving it a 4 star review is because the smell of this mud mask is a bit strong &amp; stinky to me, but I can over look that because of how well I feel this mask works.</li>
            <li>Not only is the odor strong, it provides a burning or tingling feeling as the mud goes on.</li>
            <li>I love the feel and smell of the mud and it comes off very easy and is very non irritating.</li>
            <li>The first time I put this mask on it got warm, like a deep down in your pores, is it burning, will my face be red or will my skin fall of type warm.</li>
            <li>My pores are so large I can see them with out the magnifying mirror and after removing the mask I saw a visible difference</li>
            <li>I have comination skin &amp; i have large pores after washing this mask there is some spot from mask in my face</li>
            <li>You did not need a large amount, it covered well.</li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very obsessed with my face in keeping it clean, so I&#x27;m often trying new products and let me say this is absolutely great!</li>
            <li>If I lay it on thick, it can take up to 20 minutes for it to dry, which is fine with me, because I&#x27;m happy to leave a mask on for up to 45 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>mask goes on smoothly and you only need a small amount to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of my new favorite skin care items.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast and it comes in a cute little box.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well, and made my skin SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>My face feels fresh and smooth and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>The mask is easy to clean off and does not leave your face dry or your skin tight like most masks.</li>
            <li>I always had very sensitive skin and tried many different masks over the years.</li>
            <li>So, I really do not get it - why so many positive reviews?</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever been to burning man and have gotten that fine dust in everything, this the same stuff.</li>
            <li>After washing it off, there wasn&#x27;t red irritated skin like I had expected, my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry and crave lotion, and I felt like it looked great!</li>
            <li>Externally, I started washing and mouisterizing in the am and pm and things were just fine...</li>
            <li>results i got were pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting anything else though considering the main ingredient!</li>
            <li>As a therapist who also does facials, I can say this is a very high quality mud mask.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was very reluctant to use it because of how most facial scrubs and masks</li>
            <li>As my face and neck get very dry at most times, I like to find products that would help my skin.</li>
            <li>I had a facial mask from a foreign country and that was pretty damn good.</li>
            <li>This Pure dead sea mud mask is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Pure and Essential Minerals are also cruelty free and vegan certified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Mud Mask from Pure &amp; Essential Minerals works great.</li>
            <li>Pros: Feels smooth on the skin, works FAST, started clearing up my acne after only a day.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>and I noticed a huge difference the next day.</li>

            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>The burn is intense, but it stopped after about a minute.</li>
            <li>Very upset with result of this product.</li>
            <li>I used it for a week straight before leaving a review.</li>
            <li>but so u know I&#x27;m real Lol.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This left my skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to use than the powder clay masks that you have to mix up</li>
            <li>will update this review in a month or so after I see how much it helps my eczema.</li>
            <li>It let me control how much I wanted to apply and went on</li>
            <li>very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got one already works very well</li>
            <li>This really is a must try...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know which of the ingredients was responsible for that reaction, all I know is my skin</li>
            <li>Very sticky.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I get much of a reduction, but my skin looks so much nicer after I do</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that the product really does what it says.</li>

            <li>Really tighten the skin.</li>
            <li>Everyone always comes to me asking my secret for my great skin and this is one thing I recommend.</li>
            <li>My skin was VERY soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it is important for problem skin folks such as myself use a mud mask to periodically to draw out impurities and this mask seems to work in spades.</li>
            <li>Absorbs amazingly fast, which means, my skin needs it.</li>
            <li>Really cleans out the toxins and impurities in your skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really describe it.</li>
            <li>very oily skin!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very deceptive</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really exfoliate, but I use a washcloth to remove the mask, so that helps.</li>
            <li>This is really working for my brother.</li>
            <li>You have to wash your face and hairline very well afterwards to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I feel like it get&#x27;s toxins out and really cleans skin of impurities.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>So even though it said &amp;#34;medium layer&amp;#34; I really should put a think layer on my face instead.</li>
            <li>and the deliver speed is really</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>It felt tingly the whole time it was on my face.</li>
            <li>The mask left my face feeling refreshed and really smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>The oils really help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My pores look smaller and my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used 4 times I can really see a difference in the way my face looks-more toned, smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to remove in the shower.</li>
            <li>it really does work</li>
            <li>and my skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li>it was a real treat to my skin.</li>
            <li>and I would absolutely buy again.</li>

            <li>After its all off it makes your skin feel amazingly soft and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I was really taken by the smell.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind to much because I have really oily skin, so that helped.</li>
            <li>Very slimy, mucky, and the product in the jar shook like a gelatin.</li>
            <li>I know that you get a very earthy scent.</li>
            <li>The cost is affordable and it works really well.</li>
            <li>My skin really does feel softer after using it.</li>
            <li>and I tend to leave it on for much longer than it states.  </li>
            <li>and I stopped drinking as much water</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this mask, you can actually feel it working the moment you apply it.</li>
            <li>but that could be because I dont have much im looking to improve with my skin...</li>

            <li>I really feel a difference after using it.</li>
            <li>It feels really tingly when it goes on</li>

            <li>/&gt;It is very terrible.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>however my skin broke out so much after that</li>
            <li>it really works well for others however that was not my experience.</li>

            <li>My skin was much smoother and even felt lighter.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really blame them for that.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and does as stated.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This mask seems to penetrate deeply enough to unclog the pores and keep them free from building up;no longer have oily skin</li>
            <li>and it feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li>The mask has a very pleasant,natural fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Be very cautious.  </li>
            <li>The mask feels very cooling on the face as it is drying.</li>
            <li>And it is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and found this a really gentle experience - the all natural and organic ingredients are a huge plus for me.</li>

            <li>The smell is okay, not very offensive.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin fresh and soft.  </li>
            <li>Skin does feel much smoother after using this product.</li>
            <li>I think in order to get more pore clearing results I would need to use it a few more days per week instead of only once.</li>
            <li>and I can say that my skin looks much smoother when I rinse the mask off.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>It has healing formula that is very refreshing!&lt;br</li>

            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>and this was so gentle on my skin.</li>

            <li>The difference - my pores have visibly reduced, skin appears radiant, smooth and my blemishes have improved.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Essential minerals!</li>
            <li>it helps my psorasis so much.</li>
            <li>I Havent Seen Much Of A Difference yet.</li>
            <li>Then I gently removed the rest.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After washing off in the shower, my entire face and neck were smooth as a bit &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>id the real deal.</li>
            <li>This mud mask is very moisturizing and not drying at all.  </li>
            <li>I really like how the products are organic, and as soon as I washed the mask off my face, my skin was much smoother and cleaner than before.  </li>
            <li>My face has a much healthier glow since Ive started using this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask has a very soothing effect on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Cleanser and moisturizer all in this product, I bought this because I used to have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Really watery consistency and burns my skin when I put it on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped my skin and acne- went off medication</li>
            <li>But Do Not buy if you have very sensitive/dry skin, this will burn.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect because I had never tried a mud mask before.</li>
            <li>Left my face feeling smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I admit it, I am addicted to face masks; I have tried many of them over the years.</li>
            <li>It smells nice which is a plus for dead sea mask.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that it has made a very big difference in the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried dead sea products before and actually liked</li>
            <li>jar clearly says to only use once a week which is a bummer as I would love to use this 2-3 times a week.  </li>
            <li>, it is thick, smooth and the scent isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>My face has a nice pink glow after using it and is soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Since it is a MUD mask, I think I was expecting a sort of musty gross smell, but I was very pleasantly surprised when it had more of a eucalyptus scent to it.  </li>
            <li>It smells heavenly, tingles enough to feel like it is working and left my skin looking and feeling very clean!</li>
            <li>The only strange thing was the smell, but it is easy to get over and the natural components are better for the skin than &amp;#34;good smelling&amp;#34; chemicals and fragrances.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first jar was thick and dark and rich and great for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>It also dries pretty quickly and it definitely feels as if my face is being cleansed and nourished.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin this might not be the right</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling very clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Especially once I washed it off; it left should a clean and smooth feel to my face.</li>
            <li>I know that this product was not targeted for other parts of the body, but I love it so much that I also use it on my elbows.</li>
            <li>Honestly, there probably aren&#x27;t any, and I won&#x27;t be the fashion victim who spends thousands on skin care for barely- or im-perceptible results.</li>
            <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t take any particular measures to prevent mold</li>
            <li>, well, it came from a sea in which something might have, say, died, but they&#x27;ve covered most of that up with the other organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>If only the packaging and scent weren’t so off-putting, I’d definitely repurchase this and add it to my usual rotation because the formula truly is awesome.</li>
            <li>mud felt fine on my face and it really does dry fast and hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just like many of the other reviewers...</li>
            <li>Hopefully I don&#x27;t break out more like other reviewers did.</li>
            <li>This unique mask and scrub works double time to detox skin.</li>
            <li>I could already see and feel a major difference after the first use!</li>
            <li>Also, the size is pretty big, I think i&#x27;ll last me quite a while! :)</li>
            <li>The history and directions on the packaging were clearly written and large enough for easy reading.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, huge open pores, and many blemishes &amp; black heads.</li>
            <li>Pure and Essential Minerals use 100% pure, natural and certified organic ingredients that are free of sulfates, phosphates and parabens.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if this is supposed tingle so much that it felt like my face was kind of burning.</li>
            <li>After 15-20 minutes, you rinse and are left with clean, yet moisturized skin.  </li>
            <li>then I rinsed it off and my skin was left feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>Only a small amount is needed to get a great result.</li>
            <li>I think the price is decent for this mask because it really feels as organic as it says.</li>
            <li>It deep clean your face.  </li>
            <li>The dead sea facial mask is amazing!</li>
            <li>Within the first week, my face looked better and all the acne had dried up.</li>
            <li>It was obviously easy to apply, but after an easier than expected removal, it left my skin feeling silky smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom and me feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>It applies really easily and takes about 10 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li>After application, it took about 12 minutes to dry and was really easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>For the first couple times I have used this, It worked really well, but I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Although I knew that it could be felt harsh at first time (by the reviews), I couldn&#x27;t stand even 5 more seconds.</li>
            <li>This mask dried in less than 5 minutes so this one is perfect for the busy moms out there.  </li>
            <li>It smelled good at first but then leaves a smell behind like dirt..</li>
            <li>This is a nice little home spa mud mask!</li>
            <li>I have used other mud masks in the past that I liked better.</li>
            <li>Rich Dead Sea minerals clean, heal, soften and revitalize your skin for that all day glow.</li>
            <li>After applying this mask my face started to burn, reminded me of this time I got a chemical burn in high school from applying too much Benzaclin at once (concentrated acne medicine).</li>
            <li>Actually using it right now!</li>
            <li>I shared it on my mom and uncle and they love the stuff it really helps with my black heads.</li>
            <li>I have tried at least a half dozen of these masks and this is the best one for my skin type.</li>
            <li>This mask is soft and leaves your face super soft</li>
            <li>My skin feels super soft and looks clear.  </li>
            <li>It begins drying pretty quickly though, so it isn&#x27;t an issue for long.</li>
            <li>very strong mask and need to be watchful over how long I leave on my skin....can see the healing effects but, it burned my face first 15 minutes of use...felt harsh yet, was weirdly refreshing all at the same time,</li>
            <li>Wetting it really cleaned the mask very clearly and fast.</li>
            <li>Not only is this made from very natural ingredients but it is also cruelty free and certified vegan.</li>
            <li>My skin was left feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The amount of pain this mask causes is not okay, but the result is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This Mud Mask has worked amazingly well for me in the past month.  </li>
            <li>I have never had my face clear up so fast!</li>
            <li>I am planning to try a full body mask later this week and will post an updated review then.</li>
            <li>It tingles for the first couple of minutes, but then completely goes away.</li>
            <li>The next morning the face looks fabulous , skin is soft and very moisturized  .</li>
            <li>I had planned a spa-type night with my two teenage girls, and when the opportunity to review this product came up, I  was so excited, as I had heard such good things about dead sea mud, salt, masks, etc.</li>
            <li>Well there is the Anti-aging properties such as tighten the pores promoting young, healthy natural skin.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling smooth and soft and really gave it an even look.  </li>
            <li>What I really like most about this product is that you don’t have to use it daily (but only once a week).  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was going to make my face shiny because I have naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li>After applying the mask only for 15 minutes, I rinsed with cool water and could feel the difference before my face reached the mirror.</li>
            <li>my skin becomes pretty soft afterward.</li>
            <li>I’m pretty sensitive about scents triggering headaches, but this one didn’t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>so I still have a full jar after using it almost weekly since last February when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad feeling, just different.</li>
            <li>The jar is easy to open and keeps the mask contained for no mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better if I can just go lay down and close my eyes, but I&#x27;d give this 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li>Pure&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask, however, contains no nasty ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I love my PURE Dead Sea Mud Mask and it has become my Friday night ritual after cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted when Pure &amp; Essential Minerals contacted me and asked if I would consider trying out their new Dead Sea Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The container itself may not look much but the product will last for many months as long as you use it twice a week with a reasonable amount of product.</li>
            <li>Unlike most other masks, this dries in a mere 5-10 minutes and does a great job</li>
            <li>And because of this, I am very scared to experience with new products on my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very apprehensive about trying new beauty products, but this one is going into my collection.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Dead Sea Mud Mask from PURE to anyone who wants to love their face!</li>
            <li>The price is more than I would typically pay for a jar of mud.</li>
            <li>That is basically more then half a year if used weekly!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love masks that when you put them on they feel like you have nothing on or a slight cooling feeling - but not burning/hot/</li>
            <li>I let it dry for 15 minutes and wash it off and it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply on but feel like peppermint and icy burn.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the slight tingle of the mask.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions and once I was done, my skin felt smooth and soft, definitely made me feel a bit pampered.</li>
            <li>It shrinks my pores which is a main concern of mine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really a mask kind of girl, but as I&#x27;m heading towards the mid 30&#x27;s, my skin has been changing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using spot treatments for breakouts, but wanted to try something different, in hopes that my face will love me back in return.</li>
            <li>It left my face soft and smooth after using it twice in a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very similar to other Mud masks, but I LOVE mud masks, so it&#x27;s alright by me!</li>
            <li>but I was lucky enough to be given the product at a cheaper price for review.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask felt so good on my face.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s tingled ALOT initially but quickly</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>&gt; When you open the container, It has a light natural smell to it.</li>
            <li>you can see, I really had an interesting experience with the Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>Luckily I got this from taking surveys, so money isn&#x27;t a big deal</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t perform as expected, but it&#x27;s ok so far...</li>
            <li>.BTW shipping was quick almost like next day thats a score  </li>
            <li>after 20 mins i can feel my skin restored back to many years younger.</li>
            <li>I was shopping for a facial mask that could handle my in between skin and bring back my face and neck skin area that has seen better days.</li>
            <li>My most recent purchase of it, however, has been a total letdown.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on it actually felt like it was stinging my face (which made me pretty nervous)</li>
            <li>The order arrived quickly even though I chose standard shipping.</li>
            <li>Left my skin extremely soft,  smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It comes in a decent jar so you can get a ton of uses from it.</li>
            <li>and it left my skin feeling really soft and smooth</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had some problems w/ redness, eczema and psoriasis, even on my face, mainly around my eyes.</li>
            <li>it smells a little strange but it leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have their face feel like new.</li>
            <li>It was a little strong tingling feeling at first</li>
            <li>Loaded with dead sea minerals, the mask sports a refreshing cucumber smell and is very gentle even on my sensitive, aging skin.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and leaves my skin soft soft soft and clear!</li>
            <li>I have ordered other Dead Sea mud face masks, and this is by far the most pure and authentic.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, it has not been tested on animals, and the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li>My skin was VERY soft!  </li>
            <li>Love it and it does work, but it makes a mess when you remove it.  </li>
            <li>It has a different texture and fragrance, but not unpleasant at all</li>
            <li>This time my face felt soft, hydrated, moisturized and just plain amazing.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.p</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to wash off as well, takes very little effort and unless you get it on your hair their is no discomfort in washing the product off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a single application, it left my face feeling smooth, soft and really clean.  </li>
            <li>It has a lighter feeling than other muds I have used, and it goes on smooth and fast.</li>
            <li>so i may as well ignore that.&lt;br /&gt;Its not very runny and stays fine on the face.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product and I am excited to try it again in the near future.</li>
            <li>Make sure not to get it too close to your eyes because the fumes can sting your eyes a little.</li>
            <li>The smell could be a little better but that in no reason to take stars away from it.</li>
            <li>I do also like the benefits of this Anti - Aging natural Mask product!!</li>
            <li>Definitely buying again after the first jar gets used up!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more minty than I wanted</li>
            <li>So I was a little nervous about it and thought I should probably do a spot test to make sure that I wasn&#x27;t going to have a reaction.</li>
            <li>But too strong and salt in it not for sensitive skin or dry skin.</li>
            <li>I will say that it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean, but my pores do not look any smaller or tightened at all.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my 53 year old skin and it left it feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This facial mask draws out impurities, toxins and excess oils leaving your skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>but I like it because it leaves a nice faint clean scent on my face all day.</li>
            <li>Now that I am (ahem) considerably older, I still  love masks and thisamazing Dead Sea Mud Mask is no exception.</li>
            <li>It seems more even toned, less oily, and just soft!</li>
            <li>It made my skin look and feel great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure &amp; Essential Minerals are proud that their Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask does not contain any chemicals, it’s 100% pure, natural and certified organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I really like being able to order new products from Amazon, as I tend to be very anxious to try them out, plus I can read lots of reviews.  </li>
            <li>face felt very smooth after my face was dry and my acne wasn&#x27;t as red as it was before I</li>
            <li>After drying and rinsing, it leaves the skin moist, supple, clean, and firmed, and neither oily nor dry.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, minimal scent.</li>
            <li>so far i really like it</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t sting too much.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>The texture seemed very spongy and soft.  </li>
            <li>The application was silky not thick and muddy</li>
            <li>this amazing mud face mask.&lt;br /&gt;i even sometimes put it on my back and chest for some extra deep cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>She said it really helped clear up her complexion.</li>
            <li>What is really fantastic is that is is gentle enough to use multiple times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I notice it really helps clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>it smells really minty and different, after the first use my skin was glowing.</li>
            <li>and as it dried I felt that tightening sensation that I love.</li>
            <li>I will apply the mask for a few more weeks and see if it makes any difference.</li>
            <li>I use this product twice a week and normally leave it on when it drys.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask has a beautiful deep grey color from the mineral-rich Dead Sea mud, which is blended with a few botanic and mostly organic ingredients to condition and protect the skin:  shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera juice, calendula oil, and hickory bark extract.  </li>
            <li>I think for oily or normal skin.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I did a facial night and used this for fun.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit like icy hot and feels like tingly during the mask but both are well worth the work the mask does.</li>
            <li>I love this dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li>THIS IS NORMAL,  </li>
            <li>Some products are more trouble to remove than the results they garner.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s normally.</li>
            <li>I would do it at maximum once a week for my normal skin.</li>
            <li>Is that normal?  </li>
            <li>I know what to expect and love about Dead Sea Mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea has many benefits</li>
            <li>I’ve tried many products, and yes… even the 3 step one and had NO results like this Dead Sea Mud Mask did for me.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and cannot wait to see the long term benefits of using this mask.</li>
            <li>(that would have been useful knowledge that the instructions left out)</li>
            <li>However, the oils in the mud totally got absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s normal and just means it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>Will update after using it a few more times.</li>
            <li>So.. I guess that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>I have many clients that are signed up for monthly mud wraps since we&#x27;ve introduced the Dead Sea Mud.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my different subscription boxes I&#x27;ve been able to try a wide variety of them.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised how smooth and soft my skin felt after using this facial mask.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this Dead Sea Mud Mask.  </li>
            <li>I have a normal skin type; i used this mask on my face twice a week.</li>
            <li>After using the mask, my skin felt more oily than hydrated, and after using it for a few weeks, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>Im not sure if the &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; in the cheaper versions are even real, however, I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>Love Dead Sea masks...</li>
            <li>I find the smell irritating fragrance wise and to my eyes.</li>
            <li>; Like some other people have reported, my skin, especially the skin around my sinuses, started burning strongly almost right away.</li>
            <li>But the second time I tried it, there was a slight nice tingle.</li>
            <li>My skin actually felt tighter-not dry, just better.</li>
            <li>After 25 minutes, I washed it off only to feel my face being super soft with a hint of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Her skin actually looks better after just one week and no new flare-ups have occurred.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li>After trying it once every week I finally learned the right way to use it for me.</li>
            <li>The right amount of muddiness and moisture ratio to properly apply the mask.</li>
            <li>This facial mask was right on time.</li>
            <li>To end this on a positive note, it leaves my skin so soft, and helps remove the oil buidup, and clear it up of acne.</li>
            <li>After my treatment with the  Dead Sea Facial Mask from Pure and Essential minerals was over, my skin did have a very nice natural glow and WAS NOT DRIED OUT as I had been concerned it may do.</li>
            <li>If you feel that it is too strong for your skin or feel dry afterwards, it&#x27;s possible that you&#x27;ve used too much too.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to get really nice and clear looking skin then this product is for you, just hope you can tough it out for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling super soft and helped to clear up stubborn cystic acne that I suffer from!</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes on my face, it dried nicely and was quick to wash off without a mess.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes of it on my face, it dried nicely and was quick to wash off without a mess.</li>
            <li>The other biggest benefit Ive noticed is how smooth my face feels after it cleansed and drew out the impurities.</li>
            <li>As its a little different than clay masks, its a nice change.</li>
            <li>You will feel cool and a little bit stimulated when you first put it on your face.</li>
            <li>This mask made my face feel refreshed and new.</li>
            <li>It has also helped to speed up the disappearance of the acne and it appears to be stopping new acne from forming.</li>
            <li>This product is a must-have for those who live with OILY skin.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new face mask as the one I use was changed.</li>
            <li>and so I was thinking that I was doomed to live with the skin I live in.</li>
            <li>You will feel like you have a brand new face after using this.</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel new once you use it.</li>
            <li>and I am often hesitant to try out new products.  </li>
            <li>it is suggested to wet the mask before wiping it clean.</li>
            <li>I always used Noxzema but as i got older my skin became sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Aztec Secret bentonite clay with great results and will go back to that.</li>
            <li>so I love using products that contain the dead sea mud and all its natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>, wasn&#x27;t working out regularly, and was also thrown into quick eating (fast food and such).</li>
            <li>I have a super dry skin</li>
            <li>but thats just the natural dead sea minerals doing their magic.</li>
            <li>I feel that in the long run, with such a good-sized container, the product might end up becoming contaminated from this method of use.</li>
            <li>It has a nice minty aroma, and then feels terrific rinsing off after it has dried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using organic and natural products for over 15 years, so I&#x27;m extremely particular about what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li>She has been able to calm her acne flare-ups without irritating her very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the product it did have a little bit of tingling/burning on the face, but quickly went away.</li>
            <li>Side note: Just be careful when you first open the jar and safety seal, it can spill a bit if you&#x27;re not holding it upright, and get too excited.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, and I have eczema.  </li>
            <li>It makes the skin very soft.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d warn people who have very sensitive skin to be careful.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and even rinsing my hair with shampoo gets my body rashes.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin because I have severe eczema.  </li>
            <li>My pores definitely felt tighter, and my skin was very very moisturized.</li>
            <li>if you have very sensitive skin I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in the product look very natural too.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Probably not for very sensitive skin types though.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you have a very sensitive skin, this is probably not the mask for you.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so we as hesitant to try this.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin was very soft.</li>
            <li>With this mask, my skin was very soft and it didn&#x27;t leave my face shiny like some others.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My face is very soft.</li>
            <li>I took the mask off after the recommended 10 minutes and my skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li>so it stings a little after wiping it off, but other than that my face feels really good</li>
            <li>I got my Dead sea Mud facial Mask and was super excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for three weeks now and it has started to clear my face up well!</li>
            <li>so I noticed that my skin stays clear longer!</li>
            <li>It will clear your nose!</li>
            <li>This product feels exactly the same.</li>
            <li>A lot of other mud masks have that chalky, pasty feel and this one definitely doesn&#x27;t - it&#x27;s a lot more supple, and that makes it easier to spread on your face evenly and keep it on your skin and not your clothing.</li>
            <li>what I did notice was that my face still felt really well-moisturized in spite of mud masks generally being so drying to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dark circles under eyes seemed lighter, skin tighter and smooth.  </li>
            <li>second time I mixed the mask properly in the jar itself and did not wash my face before applying and it was a much better experience than the 1st time.</li>
            <li>and my skin was beyond soft!</li>
            <li>I have tried better Dead Sea masks though !</li>
            <li>and u actually can feel the difference on the first use.</li>
            <li>It made my face so soft and took my oily shine away!</li>
            <li>and my skin feels cleaner afterwards and not dried out!</li>
            <li>Only works in first couple times.</li>
            <li>The fine lines around the eyes were smoother and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a mud mask before, so it was funny to open the jar and see that it&#x27;s literally just a jar of mud.</li>
            <li>The container is pretty big</li>
            <li>Only part I don&#x27;t care for is a severe burning sensation that I get when first applying.</li>
            <li>I noticed even after the first use, my skin tighter, and the pores in my sking were much smaller.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I noticed that the texture was pretty gross as well.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it burns and makes your eyes water when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>It always makes my face so soft, smooth and deep cleans all the while putting moisture back into my skin.</li>
            <li>(be sure you&#x27;re not allergic to anything before you use it though so that you don&#x27;t mistake allergic reaction for the usual pain).</li>
            <li>I love this mud mask I usually use a mint julep clay mask</li>
            <li>received early!</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed is that my pores are much smaller.</li>
            <li>My skin not only felt higher, it looked tighter.</li>
            <li>through the first bottle and on my second.</li>
            <li>The texture is pretty consistent to other mud/clay masks I’ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is actually the first face mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s definitely a difference in the skin after one use, my brother in law says I was glowing haha, so I recommend!</li>
            <li>I used it last night for the first time, and immediately after using I felt softer skin.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times now and it does really improve the texture of my skin and helps to clear my complexion which is always appreciated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beyond thrilled to have finally found a clay based mask that isn&#x27;t too drying or harsh for my sensitive normal/dry</li>
            <li>I usually buy the masks at Walmart and Target which are okay, but this mud mask kicks</li>
            <li>Upon receiving this product, I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>However, I am so glad I tried out this Dead Sea Mud Mask!  </li>
            <li>My face feels soft!</li>
            <li>and it is only soft if i apply some kind of heavy lotion the night before.</li>
            <li>The Eucalyptus is a little strong.</li>
            <li>texture is nice, smooth, with just a few little smaller particles in it.</li>
            <li>While I felt this made applying the mask a little more difficult, the Dead Sea Mud Mask otherwise performed wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I added this to my normal routine and to my surprise my blackheads on my nose large pores on my upper lip visibly diminished after just one use.  </li>
            <li>After I opened it the smell is very strong more than any mint in my used products and my face is painful after I used it.</li>
            <li>and it comes off very easy and is very non irritating.</li>
            <li>It also has a thick, soft, silky feel to it, which made it very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and this mask feels amazing.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea mud facial mask is pretty easy to apply and wash off.</li>
            <li>I have only used it on my face so far, but it left it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>However, the price is really high for such a so-so product, so I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend using this</li>
            <li>This dead sea mud mask was easy to apply and surprisingly did not dry out my skin like past facial masks.</li>
            <li>Ok EVERYONE,  are you ready to hear about my experience with Pure &amp; Essential Mineral&#x27;s Dead Sea Facial Mask?????????????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great as I have seen from other reviews but for me it just broke my face out bad.</li>
            <li>..as long as the price is right, I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li>I use it once a day, and may even increase it to twice a day, for about 15-20 minutes (or until it is completely dry) and when I remove it, my skin looks so fresh and revitalized.</li>
            <li>I found it easy to apply and not at all messy.</li>
            <li>It took mine about 15-20 mintues to fully dry but man was my outcome worth the wait.</li>
            <li>My skin also felt smoother and tighter but not dry, probably thanks to the shea butter, sunflower oil, and jojoba oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and dried well within 5-10 min.</li>
            <li>we used the pure dead sea mud mask for several nights, it really pulled those pores clean</li>
            <li>I love is that Pure And Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask it’s made with organic ingredients, they don’t test on animals and FDA approved!</li>
            <li>but if you have very dry skin this mask may dry you out more</li>
            <li>It took me whole day to calm skin down.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like the idea behind this product, but it possibly could&#x27;ve been formulated differently in order to be more aesthetically appealing.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something to clean and exfoliate without making my skin even more oily or going the extreme opposite and creating those gross dry patches.</li>
            <li>My face felt cool and not gunked up like other products that I have tried.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m not sure if this mask is as purifying as others I&#x27;ve loved (but are way more expensive), I do like it for the price.  </li>
            <li>Dead Sea Mud Mask spreads easily and evenly over your face, giving you complete control of where it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After several weeks of using the mask, my skin became much less oil and more balanced.</li>
            <li>Right before I get into the shower I wash my face and allow it to air dry.</li>
            <li>It went on very easily and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Proactiv, but it wasn&#x27;t working quick enough to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>The parts of my face that were healing from the rash that were left with dry scaly skin actually looked better and in some areas were gone altogether.  </li>
            <li>Love the idea, but did dry my face out a bit, so could only us it occasionally.</li>
            <li>Because of the constant acne and sensitive skin she has a hard time finding something for her face that doesn&#x27;t irritate it more!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before applying it I press a face cloth soaked in very hot water to my face - similar to how I prepare to shave with a razor - to open up pores.</li>
            <li>but  after i used the Pure and essential minerals</li>
            <li>: Pure is only the brand name, not a title.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Pure &amp; Essential Minerals</li>
            <li>I was asked to review Pure &amp; Essential Minerals-</li>
            <li>Pure &amp; Essential Minerals</li>
            <li>Pure &amp; Essential Minerals</li>
            <li>PURE &amp; Essential Minerals</li>
            <li>When I first put it on my face, it tingled quite a bit at first and that scared me a little.</li>
            <li>I received this PURE Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask via Brand Backer (Discloser: I am a blogger who received this for free to review).</li>
            <li>I am 28 and really struggle with adult acne, especially cystic acne along the chin and jawline.  </li>
            <li>I never seen my face so clear.</li>
            <li>It says to use once a week which I will follow.my face and neck feel so clean, but not dry or rough.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it on my blemishes over-night, but it didn&#x27;t clear them up.</li>
            <li>and it does clear up some acne.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face so soft and is really doing wonders on my giant pores.</li>
            <li>It helps to clear out impurities from pores and to tighten the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far (once a week for two weeks), but my face feels SO much softer after using it and</li>
            <li>It also helped reduce the size of my pours &amp; helped clear up my pimples.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing it and helping to clear it</li>
            <li>fifteen minute application completely removed all of my blackheads and left my skin tone really even.</li>
            <li>that it is already mixed and ready to go.</li>
            <li>also like that it has mostly natural ingredients and isn&#x27;t tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways if your skin is sensitive I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>Offers Scrub Moisturizer and Cleanser System - Anti Aging Clay &amp; Mud</li>
            <li>Also keep in mind since its all natural...</li>
            <li>Leaves my faced soft, moist and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t affect performance as far as I&#x27;ve noticed</li>
            <li>Probably my skin is too sensitive</li>
            <li>Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised, considering it is a &amp;#34;Dead Sea&amp;#34; mud mask, but I had to admit that I was a little...taken aback...</li>
            <li>The only downside is it really burns.</li>
            <li>I like it, my face feels soft ----</li>
            <li>my face feels soft and cleaner.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin soft and feeling refreshed</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it cleansing, but I really feel like my skin tightens after this product.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel soft</li>
            <li>I like it so far, it does give a tingling or a bit of burning sensation.</li>
            <li>but my skin has never been so soft</li>
            <li>Its all natural</li>
            <li>Made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;(A natural aroma that let&#x27;s me know it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I like that the mask is all natural and it does leave my skin feeling softer and well circulated.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>i would not recommend people with naturally oily skin to use this product.</li>
            <li>had it on for 30sec before I had to wash it off, I guess my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li>Not observe any change in my skin before and after using this item just not waste your money</li>
            <li>You can totally tell this stuff is REAL as it pulls and tingles ( a bit).</li>
            <li>but if someone wants to use it, that is an added extra bonus.</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels tighter (30 years old no wrinkles) after I use it.</li>
            <li>but my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried proactive, prescription medicine, thousands of cleansers and washes, natural aloe oil cleansers and vitamin E cream, and nothing.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin so soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I enjoy this using the Dead Sea Mask.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>At this time, my oldest child was near tears saying her face was also burning.</li>
            <li>I have never used eucalyptus near my face,  so maybe?</li>
            <li>All opinions expressed are my own.e never used eucalyptus near my face,  so maybe?</li>
            <li>I have always had sensitive skin and acne.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and rejuvenated after use.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is that the smell is very pungent.  </li>
            <li>Even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I was surprised by the almost burning sensation, seemingly caused by the eucalyptus plant.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>These minerals are also known to treat, detoxify, and cleanse our skin, to keep it us looking young and</li>
            <li>However, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>No, the smell really got to me and I am not a big fan of the scent.</li>
            <li>I realized this as a young adult i couldnt be like this for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>It also makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I got 10oz on eBay for $8 and it is completely identical to this 6oz jar.</li>
            <li>and it still turned my whole face red and broke out</li>
            <li>When using it, I suggest not putting the mask near the eye area because of the eucalyptus/menthol scent.</li>
            <li>I never felt my face to be so soft and look so radiant.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I could really feel the eucalyptus, especially in my eyes…</li>
            <li>do not waste your time and money for this product .</li>
            <li>Plus it has a soft botanical scent that makes you feel like your at a spa.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However with all that being said, I can&#x27;t say if it was product or the fact that my face was still sensitive and healing from the hell of a rash that I had.  </li>
            <li>I noticed automatically on how soft my face felt.</li>
            <li>did read online from some users that since this product is all natural it can spoil and it was advised to place in the fridge for longer shelf life.  </li>
            <li>I think my skin is too sensitive for this mud mask because when I put on the mask it burns for a bit.</li>
            <li>, I left it on for 15 minutes because I used a bit too much</li>
            <li>and I have seen a marked improvement in texture the of my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and refreshed feeling and I always feel my skin is nourished after I wash it off.</li>
            <li>My face felt cooled and comfortable, and the mask slowly dried in about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>but I just recently went through a very stressful time in my life</li>
            <li>These minerals detoxify and cleanse our skin, to keep it looking young and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is beneficial for anti-aging properties to tighten pores promoting young, healthy natural skin.  </li>
            <li>but, though my skin felt soft I still felt like I needed to add some moisture.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised at how well this mask makes my face feel and look.</li>
            <li>When I stick to this, my face clears up almost completely.</li>
            <li>DO NOT GET IT NEAR YOUR EYES.</li>
            <li>After that, use it regularly and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li>Also my face was SOFT.</li>
            <li>My skin is now silky and soft.</li>
            <li>; and he felt it and said &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34; because even he realized how soft this mask was making my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I haven&#x27;t had that much time to tell if it is making a long-term difference.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Afterwards my skin is really soft - so if I continue to use it 1-2x a week</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic or immediate results thus far.</li>
            <li>Like it so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as oily, my skin feels firmer and my pores appear smaller with much fewer blackheads,  </li>
            <li>When you put it on you immediately feel this tingling sensation that lasts about 2-3 minutes after you smear it on (for some really really sensitive skin people it may differ).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>When you put it on it goes on smoothly and creates a tingling sensation for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>This really does work (again, no miraculous results for me) and I definitely plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li>It really works especially on oily or combination skin like mine.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a natural mask that will clear out your pores, then this will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus its all natural, so the recommended weekly treatment is going to be apart of my routine.</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is too sensitive?</li>
            <li>If your skin are sensitive, don&#x27;t try it.</li>
            <li>I felt my face again and it was REALLY soft.  </li>
            <li>It arrived the next day thanks to prime.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone with Highly Sensitive Skin -</li>
            <li>I can pronounce all of the ingredients which are natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used twice so far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I started using it once a week, and am now using it twice a week.</li>
            <li>The beauty of this mask is that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my face and it has absolutely improved the overall texture and appearance of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and did not have any reactions to it.</li>
            <li>I received the product a couple weeks ago, and have probably used the mask a minimum of four times so far.</li>
            <li>one of the natural ingredients is eucalyptus oil).</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin then you might want to avoid this product.</li>
            <li>and my skin did feel soft.</li>
            <li>It had completely evacuated every one of my pores and the angriest of my zits</li>
            <li>&amp; I really like that it is only a 5-10 minute mask</li>
            <li>ingredients are natural</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin either).</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel tingly and refreshed - when it has been removed, makes my skin feel soft and ultra-clean.</li>
            <li>Helps to get my dead skin cells off and makes skin smooth</li>
            <li>have adult acne</li>
            <li>I removed it with a soft wash cloth and warm/hot water.  </li>
            <li>I’m thirty eight years old and</li>
            <li>The benefits of this mask are a plethora of things including tightening pores, promoting young natural skin.</li>
            <li>Although I do not consider myself having a wrinkle problem at my age, I do believe you are never too young to moisturize and take care of your skin.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m a natural skeptic of everything</li>
            <li>the acne is almost all gone and my skin tone is even enough now that if I really didn&#x27;t want to I wouldn&#x27;t need to wear foundation...</li>
            <li>This mud mask leaves my skin feeling so supple and soft after washing it off.</li>
            <li>I immediately notice how soft my skin felt</li>
            <li>makes your skin incredibly soft and cleanses the pores</li>
            <li>It cleans all the impurities and leaves my skin so soft .</li>
            <li>But for the price, none have done nearly the job this has in the amount of time it has been used.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>I left it on for about 15 minutes, and it really cleaned my pores.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>(I do not have particularly sensitive skin either).</li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive skin, then I recommend something else.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Mud Mask leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30s</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Mud Mask is really creamy and smooth, its not gritty at all.</li>
            <li>and it still feels relatively soft</li>
            <li>No face mask has ever made my skin this soft</li>
            <li>I love all products from Israel and especially those from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li>Love my Dead Sea mud facial mask!</li>
            <li>I liked the overall result of this product, but there was a stinging sensation in the beginning, which disappeared a few minutes later.</li>
            <li>My acne is the kind that REALLY sucks because not only do I look like I have pepperoni on my face</li>
            <li>Again I love my Dead Sea facial products.</li>
            <li>This is another one of my favorite products, that I would stand behind and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But your will find your face kind of lose wet after a few times use.</li>
            <li>I just applied a thick coat all over my face and it feels better.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Mud Mask is very easy to apply, not too dry or sandy.</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Mud Mask is very easy to apply, not too dry or sandy.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this pure brand dead sea mask for those that have large clogged up pores.</li>
            <li>I’ve used plenty of mud masks over the course of my life, and many had no strong odor, so there must be ways to get around the earthiness present in the mud.</li>
            <li>But, it does last a long time, makes my skin super silk like.</li>
            <li>And luckily, when it does hurt, the pain doesn&#x27;t last that long (although it may feel like it).</li>
            <li>If you do not completely LOVE it you can rest easy knowing that it comes with a complete refund for dissatisfaction.</li>
            <li>AND IT&#x27;S SO CLEAN AND TIGHT WITH MY PORES</li>
            <li>I have used many other brands, and for the money this is something I will definitely be coming back to for my Mud Mask Skincare needs!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way for me, as I mainly use it on my forehead, nose and cheeks, not on my jaw, chin, and neck (because I mainly just want to clean out those pores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But maybe other customers wouldn&#x27;t mind the intense smell as much as I did.</li>
            <li>Makes face feel refreshed after first use, and if there is a pimple this mask will reduce the size and dry it out.</li>
            <li>If that turns out to be true, that&#x27;ll be less than one dollar per mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn/irritate my eyes,although slightly feeling cool from the eucalyptus  oil.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less dry and more</li>
            <li>Almost all of the deep cleaning mask that I tried made my skin super dry and even break out.  </li>
            <li>It kind of stings when I apply it but not sure if it is a good thing or a bad thing.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it knowing that it&#x27;s from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li>I will add that during my most recent use (approximately week 3 or 4, cant&#x27; remember exactly)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask draws out oils from your face so after removing the mask,  you will need to follow it up with a high quality moisturizer to complete your facial process.  </li>
            <li>I loved how it went on smoothly with no grit, common in other mud masks and removed with very little messiness.</li>
            <li>I wish I could give this mask more than 5 stars, seriously</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea minerals clean, heal, soften and revitalize your skin for an all-day glow.  </li>
            <li>After I used the dead sea mask and an alcohol pad, my skin was clean.</li>
            <li>this was the second time experience with the mud mask, the first time I did the mistake of not mixing the mask properly before applying it on my face.</li>
            <li>It feels like Icy hot and peppermint extract - nowhere near &amp;#34;natural mud&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>These essential minerals are already in our bodies, but we lose them as we get older.  </li>
            <li>This is actually the first store-bought facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>After using this mask my skin wasn&#x27;t as red as it usually is and my skin tone looks more even.</li>
            <li>Not really sure if my skin is actually looking better</li>
            <li>but if you can get past that it is very well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the closest i&#x27;ve seen to actual decent results.</li>
            <li>Way higher quality than more expensive brands with fillers.  </li>
            <li>Pure dead sea mud is dark in color, this is way too light, it is diluted with oils and is not thick like mud at all.</li>
            <li>It starts off very mineral,  progressing to slightly fishy, and finishes off pure lake mud.</li>
            <li>It starts off very mineral,  progressing to slightly fishy, and finishes off pure lake mud.</li>
            <li>It was really really strong and to smell it for 10 minutes was a little hard to deal with but the results make it all worth it!</li>
            <li>It was almost a little too strong as it left my eyes watering as well.  </li>
            <li>The second time I ordered it the mud was light in color and appeared to be watered down.</li>
            <li>It burns a little but it leaves the skin feeling moist and looking full</li>
            <li>The mud is very fine, not gritty, or overly thick.  </li>
            <li>The price is right for me though compared to other face masks I have looked into this was among the cheapest.</li>
            <li>Why is mud from the Dead Sea special?</li>
            <li>It went on smooth, almost like my typical facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Alas, it hasn&#x27;t transformed me overnight into a carbon copy of a 25-year-old Christie Brinkley; but I&#x27;m happy to report a slight improvement in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>I did notice that after a few more uses, it did dry out my face a bit, which for me</li>
            <li>but in general she said I should use a mud face mask to help clear my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The second was light green and watery and never dried.</li>
            <li>Have tried a few different mud masks and this definitely produced the better results.</li>
            <li>Normally that only happens with synthetic fragrances, so maybe there was something in it that I didn&#x27;t see in the list of ingredients.</li>
            <li>but honestly I would not purchase it as I have tried other masks in the past that have shown me results within this time frame.</li>
            <li>I used this Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask weekly and found my oily skin has lessened dramatically, my patches of dry skin have balanced, skin is more refined, hydrated, and it only took a weekly treatment of 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our faces felt smooth and tight and my pores looked noticeably smaller.</li>
            <li>I did get a bit sunburned while on vacation and the mask helped calm it down.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is super invigorating!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a little different than other masks I&#x27;ve used, but it was nice.</li>
            <li>I really like Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and not too hard to wash off your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other masks and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new that I could make part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li>Left my face feeling like new.</li>
            <li>Remember that when using a new product you won&#x27;t start seeing big differences until a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>We only live once</li>
            <li>She has problem skin and breakouts and this is really helping to dry those pimples up.</li>
            <li>My husband also uses it on his dry hands and it heals fast.</li>
            <li>After I washed it off, my face felt very refreshed, but it did dry out my skin a bit.  </li>
            <li>Also very moisturizing for dry skin....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Directions state to put on face avoiding eyes and let dry 10-15 minutes then under warn water rub gently in a circular motion for maximum exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it for the 1st time last night and my skin is SO soft and completely clear.</li>
            <li>The second time I had a reaction around my eyes and the skin around them became very swollen and red.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m careful to not go near my eyes but even just having it on my nose really hurts my eyes.</li>
            <li>The dead sea mud facial mask is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I decided during the 10-15 minutes that I had the mask on, to google the net to see if anyone else had the same kerosene burn like sensation and realized that no, no, it really was just me and my face getting over the rash.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was pleasantly surprised that my face was not all red and irritated when I removed the mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its slightly grainy to exfoliate and after you take it off your face feels so fresh and moisturized even though its a mask.</li>
            <li>I might just have sensitive eyes, but I had to keep them closed (and no, I didn&#x27;t even have it very close to my eyes themselves...</li>
            <li>I received this dead sea mud facial mask that happened to come with a bonus FREE ebook for a consumer review.</li>
            <li>All my pores must be open and the mask readily went into the open pores, and burned my face!</li>
            <li>Organic Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask has a light scent.</li>
            <li>It is thick and creamy and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>texture is thick but can be smoothed onto your face easily and starts working immediately.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit thick, but it evens out easily.</li>
            <li>Its thick and goes on easy.</li>
            <li>This mask dried on quickly on my face.</li>
            <li>I love this mask because it&#x27;s actually works on my skin and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First let me share a little more about Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>Your face should feel refreshed, smaller pores and very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have used once and it left my face feeling very soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>My face is combination--it has traditionally been very oily, although as I&#x27;ve aged, it has dry areas; my skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>It only lasts a minute or two and does no damage, but wow!</li>
            <li>Left my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>I use this mask once a week and have been using for a month now (so 4 times) and I&#x27;ve seen a major improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft, but no long term effects.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite tingly when you first put it on, I&#x27;m guessing due to the eucalyptus oil.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricy and at the same time, you get what you pay for and It is well worth it!</li>
            <li>I used this when I had major sinus pain going on, as soon as I put the mask on</li>
            <li>I like that my skin felt firmer, softer, and not extremely shiny after use.</li>
            <li>I am a mask lover, and have tried my fair share of moisturizing masks, deep cleaning masks, masks to make your skin less dull, etc.  </li>
            <li>Application was easy, dried fast, and wasn&#x27;t overly messy during removal.</li>
            <li>Really rich texture, not too harsh, actually looks like mud, etc.</li>
            <li>Other than burning and turning my skin into scarlet red, I do not see any difference - normally mud masks cleanse your pores really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s minty fresh burns a little</li>
            <li>It feels minty fresh on my face and since it stung a little it made me think it was working.</li>
            <li>the Dead Sea Mud Mask was my first mask!</li>
            <li>Imagine applying whipped cream cheese mixed with a small amount of fine sugar to your face – except everything tingles and smells like Eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>Btw, I am a Black male, 22, with mild acne</li>
            <li>My skin was soft, felt clean, and glowed a bit; however that be due to my face just having been burned for 10 minutes due to this mud.</li>
            <li>So I contacted Pure &amp; Essential Minerals and they suggested mixing the mud properly before applying, also not to wash the face before applying because that will open the pores which may also give a burning sensation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to break out at least once a month and now my skin is pimple free.</li>
            <li>I can immediately see an improvement in my skin tone and skin&#x27;s general healthiness after using it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also this mask is a big size, you can use it to the whole face and it still can use for a long time.</li>
            <li>Not only is my face crystal clear</li>
            <li>This stuff smells like something scraped off of the bottom of a lake, which it is; but, I expected something more like the usual mud mask, which doesn&#x27;t stink.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this a few times now, and definitely enjoy it, but haven&#x27;t noticed any long term effects yet.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily for my daughter who in her late 20&#x27;s has developed some constant acne problems.</li>
            <li>The smell of the product might linger on your skin for a while even after washing it off, so I usually put on a lightly scented moisturizer to remove what is left of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell of the product might linger on your skin for a while even after washing it off, so I usually put on a lightly scented moisturizer to remove what is left of the smell.    </li>
            <li>definitely  started to see clear, even skin, and after two weeks my skin is practically the clearest it&#x27;s ever been..</li>
            <li>My pores also looked smaller, so I feel like this could help to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after using this facial mask!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using the Dead Sea Mud Face Mask, it will definitely continue to be one of my daily regimes going forward.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that I could actually notice a difference after just one use.</li>
            <li>The mask leave my face soft and moisturize, my mom actually asked how did my complexion look</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far.</li>
            <li>I barely used it once and within a couple of weeks it had mildew in it.  </li>
            <li>This mask clears up my pores where it is now barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft and by morning, I could see such a difference in my face.  </li>
            <li>I lasted barely the minimum 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I also like that it is not rough on my skin.</li>
            <li>When I washed it out of my hair, didn’t use any shampoo or conditioner so it can stay in longer even though its out of my hair (something a salon told me to do) and in the morning I took a shower, and my hair was so soft, I couldn’t remember the last time I had that feeling, at the salon years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s uncomfortable and eventually passes, but I think I will stick to more gentle treatments in the future.</li>
            <li>It left my skin soft and supple for days after I used the mark.  </li>
            <li>so far I only been using it for two weeks (twice a week)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but it left no irritation!</li>
            <li>BARELY VISIBLE.</li>
            <li>I just used this for my second time and my face feels sooo velvety soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this one time so far</li>
            <li>I have a 13 old daughter whose face is starting to break out</li>
            <li>and it doesnt leave them sensitive or red.</li>
            <li>The mask itself is much &amp;#34;soupier&amp;#34; than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only use once so far.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t notice any change in my wrinkles/lines or pores, but I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.  </li>
            <li>mask is designed to remove impurities and leave skin feeling a looking tighter and refreshed with a natural glow and almost instantly you can feel the tightening beginning.</li>
            <li>It left my face really soft.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for those with sensitive skin and acne problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a facial mask before since I have the break out outcome fears with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I only used it once so far</li>
            <li>For anyone looking for natural skin care, look no further.</li>
            <li>I recommend when washing it off, to just get the mask moist enough to exfoliate your face, using circular motions with your fingers before rinsing it completely off.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it out, I thought I had wide enough margins, but didn’t.</li>
            <li>The formula was great as it was thick enough to apply well but not too thick.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest the first time I used the mask, I thought about washing it off just after a few minutes as I was afraid the mask was burning my skin, but I decided to leave it on for the whole 10 minutes as suggested</li>
            <li>Also, while I like that they use natural ingredients and that you get quite a bit of product for the price point, the mask did burn my eyes the first few minutes I had it in until it dries.</li>
            <li>nothing better, nothing worse.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; right away which I was a little bummed about.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because this mud has such a high concentration of minerals and organic essential oils that puts it on such a higher level than the other stuff we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This mask makes this hard process EXETREMELY easy where I don&#x27;t even need to use a facial steamer anymore!</li>
            <li>And a little goes a long ways, so it is worth the money!</li>
            <li>A little of this goes a long way and its definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li>After I removed it my skin was pink for a few minutes but quickly returned to my normal color.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it did not dry as you would assume traditional mud would.</li>
            <li>I liked the thinner texture of the mask as opposed to the traditional thick paste of other masks.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>I’ve used a few different types of masks, and what I really like about this one is that you don’t have to mix it with anything, it applies easily and doesn’t leave a gritty mess in your sink when you rinse it</li>
            <li>I also had severe skin reaction in few seconds right after I put this mask on my face.</li>
            <li>The only thing I am not a fan of is that sting sensation I get when I first put it on and it lasts until I remove the product but other than this</li>
            <li>first time I used it, there was definitely a burning/hot sensation, probably due to the eucalyptus ingredient.</li>
            <li>I was so excited that I could hardly contain myself and counted the nights away till it came.  </li>
            <li>This mask feels AMAZING on the skin, granted a little disturbingly tingly at first</li>
            <li>mud worked amazingly well and cleared out a few deep blackheads that have been giving me extra trouble.  </li>
            <li>At first I was afraid that it might dry up my skin, but when I washed it off after the first use, my skin was clean and dewy.</li>
            <li>my teen has clogged up pores resulting in major blackheads!</li>
            <li>It is a all natural pure dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li>I used it that same night and the huge pimple I had on my cheek for the past two days wasn&#x27;t there the next morning.</li>
            <li>And it hard to clean</li>
            <li>It burned a little bit after a few minutes that got better.</li>
            <li>My skin is a little pink, but feel super soft.</li>
            <li>I also used my astringent (just a little witch hazel) and a quick extra rinse AFTER the mask to remove any extra remnants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in an extremely dry climate so</li>
            <li>Dermatologists recommend it once a week, but with my sensitive skin I usually only do a facial once a month.</li>
            <li>A pump or squeeze bottle that dispenses the product directly onto your hand without potentially contaminating the rest of the product still in the package would definitely be preferable.</li>
            <li>A pump or squeeze bottle that dispenses the product directly onto your hand without potentially contaminating the rest of the product still in the package would definitely be preferable.</li>
            <li>I probably will mix some moisturizing oil so that it does not dry my face.</li>
            <li>I have never experienced this soft and smooth feeling of my skin ever before.</li>
            <li>I have seen results of the mask working, has shrunk my pimples and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this after getting a demo of a FAR more expensive mask at the mall, which appeared to erase the lines on the side of my face to which it was applied.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t quite as thick as most masks that I&#x27;ve used - so you have to be somewhat careful when applying it, so it doesn&#x27;t run all over the place.</li>
            <li>She said that the first time it when on her skin tingled a little but didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>I broke out a little bit after my first use, but I felt like it pulled all of the oil and junk out of my pores.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll keep using it and​ report back with any major changes that we see.</li>
            <li>but first time I used, my skin hurt a little bit.</li>
            <li>It does burn a little at first when putting it on</li>
            <li>when I first put it on it was a little burning / tingly</li>
            <li>I received this at a highly discounted rate and it worked just as expected.</li>
            <li>It dried up very fast; I guess within 5/6 minutes.</li>
            <li>I felt a bit itchy at first when it dried out but after washing my face it does not dry the skin..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wet&amp; not a thick clay.</li>
            <li>This is the first Dead Sea Mud mask I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>am getting married in a few months</li>
            <li>and it stung for the first few minutes.</li>
            <li>The dead mask scared me at first.</li>
            <li>It really feels like it’s pulling out anything trapped in my pores without parching my skin, and after rinsing it off, I was left with a squeaky-clean feel that was fresh but not at all tight.</li>
            <li>I’m definitely going to be using this at least twice a month to ensure I clean out my pores.</li>
            <li>It provides a deep clean and is not too thick</li>
            <li>All in all, a real let down.</li>
            <li>was concerned if I was burning my face, it was very redden and chilled it down with (HD skincooler ice roller) ...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always use it, only because I can get lazy at night and don&#x27;t want to get up (9.5 months pregnant), but when I do, I notice a change in my skin the next morning.  </li>
            <li>The process is simple, just leave it on to dry for 10 minutes to allow full absorption of Dead Sea Minerals and extraction of any impurities.</li>
            <li>This is a good price compared with other similar products or an expensive trip to the spa.</li>
            <li>but it didnt leave it so dry and tight that I was scared to smile.</li>
            <li>Not &amp;#34; oh, it burns a little.&amp;#34; It shot right past that into your brain screaming &amp;#34;Get</li>
            <li>One really feels the tingling, it actually made her eyes water a little bit while my other daughter didn&#x27;t really experience a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend over any other Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>It does have a bit of an unpleasant smell to it, but I’ve started using this weekly and don’t notice it much any more.  </li>
            <li>My skin was so soft after use, without feeling oily or dry.</li>
            <li>I can tolerate it with a body butter, as the skin on your body is usually less reactive to germ exposure than the skin on your face, but I get really squicked by face products that come in tubs.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t really cleared my skin that I have noticed, because I still have the black heads on my skin.</li>
            <li>When you wash it off, it does leave your face amazingly soft without being overly dry like some masks.</li>
            <li>My face is less oily and so much softer and my blemishes have gone away.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply in a thin, even layer.</li>
            <li>When i placed it on there was a big burning sensation that happened for the first few minutes</li>
            <li>and I urge anyone interested in a mask to consider the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask.</li>
            <li>therefore it&#x27;s a must that I use a moisturizer of some sort exactly after I wash my face; however, this dead sea mud mask is the very opposite.  </li>
            <li>The Mask is a mixture between light brown and dark green in color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I much prefer to use Glamglow products on my face because I think they work better although they are very expensive</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned at first but, after a minute there was this big relief, a big cooling relief.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend even if you have a dry skin!!!  </li>
            <li>This pure dead sea mask has a very earthy smell to it, but the smell is very tame and did not bother me, even though I have a very sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>anyone looking for a natural high quality product that actually works, I can recommend the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask without reservation.</li>
            <li>It came of easy with no residue left behind in my pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed some really beneficial changes: my pores appear smaller and my skin is less oily in the days following the use of this mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells very mud like and vaguely surfuric, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I try to do full face about once a week, with every night or every other night, putting it on just the acne trouble zones.</li>
            <li>However, it does dry fairly quickly and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this mask to anybody, especially to people who have sensitive skin and are limited on products they can use.</li>

            <li>ingredients include Pure Dead Sea Mud, Organic Shea Butter, Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Aloe Vera Juice, Organic Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Jojoba Oil, Hickory Bark Extract, Organic Calendula Oil, Eucalyptus Oil, Filtered Water, Xanthan Gum.</li>
            <li>Pure Dead Sea Mud, Organic Shea Butter, Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Aloe Vera Juice, Organic Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Jojoba Oil, Hickory Bark Extract, Organic Calendula Oil, Eucalyptus Oil, Filtered Water, Xanthan Gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, very promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knock one star off only because the burning sensation was so strong, it was almost painful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a little concerned now about the comments that say it doesn&#x27;t have much of a shelf life and may mold.  </li>
            <li>Product is very watery and spilled a little in shipment.  </li>
            <li>I am reviewing my third purchase of PURE Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>PURE &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask...</li>
            <li>Mom Gives Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask</li>
            <li>Mom Gives Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask</li>
            <li>, I thought I was getting pure dead sea mud, guess I should have actually read the ingredients list.  </li>
            <li>After the third time I used it, it didn&#x27;t burn as much, just a little tingly sensation...</li>
            <li>recently had the pleasure of trying out the Dead Sea Mud Mask by Pure &amp; Essential minerals.</li>
            <li>Well I recently received my Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask on May 17th, 2014.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask is a bit different from the one I&#x27;m currently using and the ones I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>The Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask made it possible for me to pamper myself a bit and turn back the hands of time.</li>
            <li>this may smell bad but it works good.</li>
            <li>I guess with this mask you have to take the good with the bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I recommend this product for good results.</li>
            <li> I think I made a good decision to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second good thing I remember-</li>
            <li> I was not expecting the mask to make my skin tingle, but it did in a good way.</li>
            <li> It tightens the skin, and I believe it brings any impurities to the surface, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> It works and smells good.</li>
            <li> so this was surprising.</li>
            <li> (oh the joy), so I am always shopping around for detoxing mud masks and was given a discount to sample and submit honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good value.</li>

            <li> Really good product, I like it.</li>
            <li> but I do feel like the mask made good on it&#x27;s promise.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt this good in years.</li>

            <li> It smells good.  </li>
            <li> It also did a good job clearing some of my acne.</li>
            <li> Best face mask, it leaves my face smooth like silk.</li>
            <li> While this product doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant of smells it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that while my skin isn&#x27;t perfect, it has improved significantly!  </li>
            <li> Nice and pleasant mask that feels good after washing off.</li>
            <li> but it washed off easily!!</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t the most beautiful thing ever</li>

            <li> The item arrived quickly and was in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> But surprisingly, it does more than that!</li>
            <li> This is very excellent and I very much recommend it!</li>
            <li> It was very easy to wash off and my skin looked amazing afterwards!  </li>
            <li> I am so very pleased with this mask.  </li>
            <li> But after it washes off it felt very refreshing.</li>
            <li> my skin feels so fresh :D</li>
            <li> Just do it, you will be sooooo happy I promise. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It smells really good and feels amazing when you put it on, very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the use of this mud.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> But no :) I am using the mud on my problematic skin now, used it for 4 times and I am so happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;No allergic reactions whatsoever.</li>

            <li> This works great for acne, scars and skin conditions of many types.  </li>
            <li> The eucalyptus makes it feel very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - Refreshing mask that does a great job of exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to confidently say that I can and will continue to use this product for my skin revitalizing needs.</li>
            <li> a mask that leaves my skin hydrated is very important!</li>
            <li> am very pleased and cant wait to use it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then, I washed the remaining mud off with warm water and my skin felt really good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a nice eucalyptus scent to it that reminds me of the spa at the Luxor in Vegas.. loved that</li>
            <li> Yep, it&#x27;s that good and the price is nice too.</li>
            <li> Maybe for therapeutic procedures its good because it has a nice minty smell.</li>
            <li> It just feels right to keep using a product that keeps producing wonderful results!</li>
            <li> and after I was able to pluck six hairs that magically showed up!!</li>
            <li> Very good and keep your skin clean.</li>
            <li> We then rinsed it off easily with a warm washcloth and loved the results!</li>
            <li> I toughed out the 10 minutes, which feel incredibly longer when your face feels like it was put inside the a jar filled with fire ants, and after taking off the mask, my skin felt amazing afterward.</li>
            <li> The smell is a great mint aroma, followed the direction on Amazon(container doesn&#x27;t have much on good detailed instructions.)</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin that can be easily irritated, and I was very happy when I came to the realization that the mask had not caused any kind of reaction and that I was actually very happy with the way my skin looks and feels after using the  Mask.</li>
            <li> Well, It was a huge jar of the mud mask (6 oz.!!)</li>

            <li> i love it! :-)</li>
            <li> This product is better than most of the 100-500$ mud mask facials out there!</li>
            <li> love this product and would for sure recommend it!</li>
            <li> I will update as I use more product with more details!</li>
            <li> :) Love it!</li>
            <li> not quite sure if would purchase again, need more time will let you know as I continue using this one!</li>
            <li> :) i love it!</li>
            <li> skin felt nice and bright and clean after.</li>
            <li> easy on, easy off..feels great..</li>
            <li> I was excited that I got chosen to buy for a reduced price during a promotion and was so pleasantly suprised.  </li>
            <li> Pure &amp; Essential Minerals has done an excellent job of including ingredients that condition the skin without being too moisturizing, with the end result being what I consider to be the perfect mud</li>
            <li> I look forward to applying this once a week before my shower and then enjoying the  warm tingle for 15-20min before washing off.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mask I have ever used .</li>
            <li> opened the container and realized the mask was kind of runny instead of the more creamier consistency I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Another thing was that I wish I was able to tell what kind of improvements there were after using it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve experienced that, this mask is probably worth a try.</li>
            <li> It is advised to use the mask weekly for a blemish free bright and glowing complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smells good and smooth on the face.</li>
            <li> I have used it once so far and am really happy with it!</li>
            <li> It has a really nice feeling to it, like it is authentic.</li>
            <li> As a kid I loved playing in the mud I would create huge mud baths in our driveway.</li>
            <li> In this regard, I think the eucalyptus oil is a brilliant addition to the formula – it really works well with the mud to purify the skin.</li>
            <li> I liked it and will buy more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great success for me</li>
            <li> feel of the mask is a bit goopy when you place your fingers in it to scoop out but not anything more then what you would expect when sticking your hand into &amp;#34;MUD&amp;#34; but it goes on nicely on the face.</li>
            <li> well so that it didn&#x27;t leak and has professional labeling that makes it great for gift giving as well!</li>
            <li> but, I think it’s worth it just for how great my skin</li>
            <li> I honestly didn’t mind it and even enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this item through a promotion deal in return I had to leave an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> really nice product... love it....</li>
            <li> It is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff has the most amazing feel to it</li>
            <li> Rather, I honestly think that they should sell this product in a more hygienic packaging that won&#x27;t have the possibility of being exposed to contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my skin have a wonderful natural glow.  </li>
            <li> and this one really gets the job done and drys wonderfully on the face very quickly.</li>
            <li> also love that this mask comes in a pretty good sized tub!</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL~ my first time trying any mud mask, and my daughter and I loved it so much that we will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> mask is natural, soothing, great for all skin types and most importantly, effective!</li>
            <li> and it gives a good clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant scent, but it really does its job good.</li>
            <li> Seller sends really helpful emails after purchase with detailed directions on how to use for best results.</li>
            <li> Great left my face feeling great</li>
            <li> I love that I can pronounce all of the natural ingredients, and especially love how immediately I can feel the mud working and drying on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product, I would give it a 5 star, specially shipping</li>
            <li> When I first applied it, it felt great and even has a tingling sensation (to let you know that it’s working).  </li>

            <li> The scent of the scrub was kind of strong</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to make this part of my weekly regiment and see how much more my skin will improve.  </li>
            <li> I think I prefer Lavo&#x27;s volcanic mud mask more though.</li>
            <li> The smell is much better and you&#x27;re able to see the immediate effects of the mask.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel tighter after I rinse it off and how it almost has a cooling effect as I apply</li>

            <li> Item received for sincere review.</li>
            <li> I love the way that the mask feels when you put it on.</li>
            <li> This is magic in a container.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> A response like that makes me believe it&#x27;s working the magic it says it will.</li>
            <li> Our skin felt so smooth after the treatment and we plan on using it weekly!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comments on use:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Make sure you stir the mud well before using it!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; I recommend keeping the product refrigerated when not in use</li>
            <li> Everyone has commented how my skin looks more supple and I have a glow.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this as an excellent addition to any skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> It tingles a bit and feels refreshing while its on.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for that perfect facial to make your skin feel like a 10 !!!</li>
            <li> As I opened the jar it smelled really nice and while applying, the mask glided on smoothly over my face.</li>
            <li> The Eucalyptus oil was floating on the top and when I applied it felt like my face was burning.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I found this one to be the best overall.</li>
            <li> wish the labeled indicated this because I would&#x27;ve used more of it</li>
            <li> I like this product more than the aztec clay.</li>
            <li> It was so refreshing</li>
            <li> Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t cause any break out, but also help me skin to absorb better with my skin care product.  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I received this in a promtion to review because I would never have bought it.</li>
            <li> When this runs out I will gladly buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love everything about this product.</li>
            <li> I can feel the burn, but it&#x27;s worth it if you want some good skin.</li>
            <li> The eucalyptus oil in it smells nice, but it isn&#x27;t the primary smell.</li>
            <li> but it came with an ebook about keeping a healthy skin</li>
            <li> Immediately after my skin is more even</li>
            <li> you can just tell it smells like that :-)</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> This mask was okay</li>
            <li> OMG the most wonder mud mask ever.</li>
            <li> so I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I really liked how my face felt after using this mask, I don&#x27;t think I will use the free e-book</li>
            <li> I suffer from Graves&#x27; Disease and the hormonal imbalances often times cause my skin to break out no matter what products I use or how healthy my diet is.</li>
            <li> I let it harden and after about 7 minutes I started to rub if off my skin and exfoliated my skin with my hands; all I did was rub it around with my fingers and got as most off as I could</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Made my face feel really nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it on more than 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works I can feel the tightness on my face.</li>
            <li> Will order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> The best way to figure it out is to have just enough so that it dries within 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Even so I am sure I would order it again........</li>
            <li> but it was so overwhelming I had to run to the bathroom and wipe it off my face.</li>
            <li> I love this Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> For the price it delivers everything it claims and my clients just love it.&lt;br /&gt;Gail</li>
            <li> and it feels really refreshing while it&#x27;s working!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough wonderful things about this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> I am glad I was given a code to get this product at a dr&lt;br /&gt;Is counted rate.</li>
            <li> I like it :)</li>
            <li> I love the tingle sensation and how refreshed my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> Love it my face is smoother</li>
            <li> pores appear smaller, and my face feels great after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> It also seemed to make my skin breakout more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was stoked when I got approved to review this mud mask because it couldn&#x27;t have come up at a better time.</li>
            <li> but it was good fun.</li>
            <li> I imagine I’ll be able to use this mask maybe a handful of times before I start to worry the product has been too contaminated to continue using on my face without prompting a breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but I did notice a lot more acne.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I love the ingredients, the texture, and the way it feels during and after.</li>
            <li> After just one treatment, my skin looked better.</li>
            <li> I use it every week and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> This mask has changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE how it makes my face feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> In love with this mask.</li>
            <li> I am happy that i purchased this product because it really worked like a charm for my skin.</li>
            <li> i just love it -</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s refreshing and smells</li>
            <li> Love using it once</li>
            <li> sometimes&lt;br /&gt;Twice!&lt;br /&gt;Great product and reviews didn&#x27;t lie for sure</li>
            <li> but the scent itself stung my eye) but got better after about a minute.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I like that my skin looked rejuvenated and better.</li>
            <li> I Love This Mask...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t possibly be more pleased than I am with this mask.</li>
            <li> However I still enjoyed this one.</li>
            <li> My face felt nice and smooth afterward.</li>
            <li> but I am extremely glad I did.</li>
            <li> Make sure not to get any on your clothes as it can stain.  </li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> We both noticed the initial tingle-which I associate with the Eucalyptus Oil-and it was great!</li>
            <li> so tha fact that this works great on my skin is a real plus.</li>
            <li> Nothing overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love it and look forward to continue using it.</li>
            <li> That being said I used the product and enjoyed it</li>

            <li> I love mud?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I felt that my face was safe to &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; on with, I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This also made the blackheads on my nose look better and came out easier when I used my extraction tool and Paula&#x27;s Choice BHA 9.  </li>
            <li> This is the best facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this mud mask.</li>
            <li> I can see getting many uses out of this container.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condtion that requires me to swallow pills if I want to look better &#x27;cosmetically&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Really love this mask -</li>
            <li> And with the end results I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> All of the ingredients are beneficial to a healthy complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> While this product did make my most eczema prone parts of my face flare up - I still continue to use it in places that didn&#x27;t flare up</li>
            <li> and I love this mask.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> It looks refreshed and healthy.</li>
            <li> I just know to be sure &amp; use it at night,</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face mask.</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments.</li>
            <li> One thing I really love is that they don’t test on animals.</li>
            <li> It can be challenging to find beauty products that are organic.  </li>
            <li> It has more than 21 skin-reviving minerals including, magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks healthier and has a much more even skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and under my chin, the skin looks more tightened.</li>
            <li> Came in a box and was double sealed :D</li>
            <li> I will be sharing this with others for sure.</li>
            <li> I cant wait for them to get hooked like I am :)</li>
            <li> I love using masks.</li>
            <li> I am able to add this to my skin regimen without drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love that it comes pre-mixed because I need every time saver available!</li>
            <li> Lovely product.</li>
            <li> I really love this mask, I got it because it was well rated</li>
            <li> The longer you go without doing it, the more oils and toxins, the more pain.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products for my acne, but this has helped the most.</li>
            <li> I love the scent to.</li>
            <li> My blackhead looked better too.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that all of the ingredients in the jar are organic.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> and I was worried that this product will cause more irritation on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Im in Love with this mask 😍</li>
            <li> I just love the scent of the oils in this mask and love the moisturizing and conditioning properties of the mud.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I will update once I know! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more once I run out.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is okay.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for this, I would have rated better.</li>
            <li> Just an okay product in my opinion.</li>

            <li> My skin looked better since the first application.</li>

            <li> This mask is totally worth the money!  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I have to say this is the best product ever!!</li>

            <li> Love this so much!</li>

            <li> see a full detailed review here</li>
            <li> First of all I love that all the ingredients are organic.  </li>
            <li> but otherwise the mask worked pretty well. :)</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> and I was definitely not disappointed with my choice!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first day of using, most of my blackheads disappeared.  </li>
            <li> This project makes your skin feel great but for a price that lasts 10 minutes if you can survive for that long.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, apply a little bit over your face and leave it on for 5 to 10 minutes, wash it off with warm water then you have a nice silky smooth, soft and healthy looking face.</li>
            <li> My face also feels clean.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how easily it came off and how fresh my face felt after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many store brand masks and wanted to try something more natural.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after wards.</li>
            <li> This mud mask feels cool, creamy, and refreshing when first applied to the skin and then tingles a bit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a great feeling mask, but I much prefer my old mint-julep or grape seed masks or even salt or sugar scrubs to this one.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing and smells great, even if it is dead sea mud.</li>
            <li> I am always searching for something to leave my skin feeling clean.</li>

            <li> But it looks like people with very sensitive skin may have problems, because it is kind of intence when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it once a week for a month already...</li>
            <li> This mask leaves my face feeling soft, smooth, and most importantly clean!  </li>

            <li> i even tried those special washes advertised on tv.</li>
            <li> Then, I realized, because I put the mask on right after taking shower!</li>

            <li> The mud was excellent the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Before putting on the mask, I read the ingredients, most ingredients were organic, which is awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling super clean and it pulls out all of the impurities and unclogs my pores.</li>
            <li> I was worry about ordering this but having such a good review, I decide to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> But good product and will probably last me a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I did buy this on a promotion and didn&#x27;t pay full</li>
            <li> This Mud Facial Mask made my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> But, hey,  it&#x27;s mud, so, all&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> It seemed cool on my face.</li>

            <li> Will repurchase for sure (although it doesn&#x27;t take much, so it will be a while).</li>
            <li> I think this is the sort of product you need to use for a bit longer to see the full effects.</li>

            <li> I continuously felt the cool sensation after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Overall, it has good results, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the burning sensation or the smell.</li>
            <li> I would really suggest this mask for many reasons.</li>
            <li> so I would recommend using it only on problem areas every couple of weeks instead of weekly and follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love it and works fast</li>
            <li> And I also notice that when I rinse my skin after, my skin feels really oily like the water sits on top.</li>
            <li> It is a good size jar that should last awhile!</li>
            <li> Hi there, I enjoyed using this product and feel it is of high quality!</li>
            <li> but then after a minute or two it lessened to just a cool tingle.  </li>
            <li> It truly cleans and reduces your pores, leaving your skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> The organic Shea Butter, Aloe and Jojoba oils really add a lovely moisturizing element.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face so smooth and it feels so fresh.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I am delighted to find something for my daughter that actually works.</li>
            <li> I love this mask so much.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to using it every week because it does feel really, really good.</li>
            <li> just love how much it clears them up after using this</li>
            <li> It really made a difference with my skin as well, it looked refreshed and so healthy.</li>
            <li> Feels cool and soothing.</li>
            <li> As I was applying the mud to my face I was surprised by the nice tingling I was feeling (it felt like eucalyptus).</li>
            <li> After that it was a cool feeling like I have mint on my face.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin nice a soft feeling</li>
            <li> Overall good product.  </li>
            <li> It is not a bad smell if you get used to it.</li>
            <li> and I must say, not bad...</li>
            <li> Not bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely an allergy and not a bad batch, because I tested it on my boyfriend and he had no problems.  </li>
            <li> Face tingled for a while after taking the mask off, but it was not a bad feeling.</li>
            <li> The 5-10 minutes each week is definitely worth it and the mask is a great value (the 6oz container goes a long way)!</li>
            <li> When applying the mask you need to make sure you get an nice even layer and then let it dry about 15-20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> enjoyed this product, I loved the slight tingly/warming sensation I felt</li>
            <li> The Eucalyptus scent is strong and powerful and and Iove that fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I find it very unique to know that I am applying real mud from ground of the</li>

            <li> Great mask left my skin very soft easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The smell is indeed very strong but if you have ever been to the Dead Sea and experienced the smell of sulfur, you know you got the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had alot of mud masks and this one is by far the best one.it isnt thick like most of them.it goes on smooth .I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> It hardens pretty quick and is easy to get off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This &#x27;Pure&#x27; Dead Sea Mud Mask works great!</li>
            <li> Another great experience with a Pure &amp; Essential Minerals product.</li>
            <li> I usually use this after I wash off all my makeup, exfoliated, and than open my pores with warm water to get the best out of the mask.</li>
            <li> Not only is it a relaxing, pleasant, and refreshing experience, but it will leave your face feeling fresh and new.</li>

            <li> mask was easy to apply, kind to my skin, and left my face feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was extremely quick.</li>

            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Not too drying and mildly exfoliating when you remove it.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a quick spot treatment for blemishes and irritations and it helps to reduce swelling and redness.</li>
            <li> It recommends you use this once a week to prevent drying out your skin, and at that rate this one container will last you many many months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> The mask dries quickly and allows your skin to feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> It really does a great job at deep cleaning.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with this product and definitely will be purchasing again.  </li>
            <li> I get more breakouts and my skin is dryer than normal.</li>
            <li> The corners of my nose feel more like normal skin.</li>
            <li> Like it,  does sting when first put on but face feels smooth after</li>
            <li> It may not look great with its dark greyish color</li>
            <li> Overall, Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Just minutes ago i tried this product for the very first time.</li>
            <li> I tried other Mud Mask and by far this is the best one I have tried.</li>
            <li> From the very first time I tried it I felt the difference on my skin and had my roommate try it</li>
            <li> My skin felt so smooth after the first use.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve really used a mask, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it does make my skin very smooth and reduces oil in my T-zone.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> I just love this mask, it leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> After laying there and relaxing for about 10 minutes, it dried and was very easy to remove and wash off with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new masks to try, and I really love this one.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and this mask works amazingly.</li>
            <li> more clean, fresh, and natural.</li>
            <li> it was less than attractive to have a mud colored mask on in front of my dad and husband</li>
            <li> Would absolutely buy another product from the company and strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to spread on, a real pleasure to wear as it dries.</li>
            <li> Tingly but not too much for my skin though my daughter said it was a bit strong for her face.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy to use</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want you skin &amp;#34;overexposed&amp;#34; because the oils in this are strong and will really really tingle.</li>
            <li> I had so much redness and big bumps with acne, but in 3 applications I have seen remarkable improvment.</li>
            <li> It takes longer than some masks to dry – a good 15-20 minutes for me</li>
            <li> Pretty good results for a mask that I&#x27;ve only used once.</li>
            <li> Initially, it smells pretty good</li>
            <li> It washes off easily and my skin feels really refreshed.  </li>
            <li> the Dead Sea Mud Face Mask is very effective for clean the skin and remove the impurities, i recommend it</li>
            <li> I love the fact that all of the ingredients in this product are natural!</li>
            <li> this left my face feeling refreshed &amp; smooth!!</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin gets cleansed from deep within and enjoyed this mask a lot!</li>
            <li> had read reviews and my acne stopped after first use!</li>
            <li> Not only was my skin able to handle it, it also leaves my face glowing!</li>
            <li> Just received this yesterday and already notice results after my first mask!</li>
            <li> Love this mask it makes my face feel and look alive!</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!!!</li>
            <li> It will really make your eyes water!!  </li>
            <li> Haha!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone and we will be back for more when this is gone easy.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and makes face look clear and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It really does purge and cleanse your face and leaves it feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li> My face does feel very smooth and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> and I have been looking for a good Mask that is natural as I am very sensitive to products.</li>
            <li> This mask has an incredibly strong scent – one of the major ingredients is eucalyptus oil, and you can’t miss the menthol odor at all, but it also has a strong earthy smell from the mud.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone looking for a smooth and clean glowing face.</li>
            <li> It gives a tingly feeling at first and once you take it off, your pores feel clean.</li>
            <li> Just remember to wash your face first, then stir the mask before applying it to your clean face.</li>
            <li> Even after the first use, my skin felt refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li> My skin was super smooth, bright, and extra soft after using this just the first time!</li>
            <li> Has a slight tingle and the eucalyptus scent makes it very nice.  </li>
            <li> It washed off easily and I could really tell a difference in my skin right after using it.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of this Dead-Sea-Facial-Mask the benefits to keeping the skin healthy and acne free, and not to mention the glow your skin has from using good ingredients on your face and delicate area!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not wash your face or do any other kind of strong treatments before doing this mask.</li>
            <li> I noticed results right after the very first use- my skin immediately seemed more even and soft.</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea mud face mask is great.</li>
            <li> My face felt amazing after and felt like I was 5 years younger!</li>
            <li> I hope you get the chance to try it and enjoy it as much as I did!feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I will comeback in a few more days to give a more detailed review.</li>
            <li> Smell, feel, look and ease of use (though a bit messy, lol).</li>
            <li> I know the dead sea is supposed to be great for your skin</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> ,-) Happy with Dead Sea Mud Musk</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and works great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be happy to review the product again after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Whole face was bright red after.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel great after using the Dead Sea Mud mask.</li>
            <li> and I seen an episode of the Duggars when they went to the dead sea and had talked about the great benefits of the mud</li>
            <li> So exciting to get this product.</li>
            <li> Her face is more even tone, and clear of acne.</li>
            <li> I received the product complimentary to test and/or review.</li>
            <li> But it feels fresh after removing it ..</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look and feel fresh.</li>
            <li> I do not hold a stake in the success of this product or the company which created it.</li>
            <li> and the fact that it has all natural ingredients and not tested on animals  cant wait to used it again :-)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is good for sensitive skin (and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> Its clear and I look more refreshed.</li>
            <li> Best Dead Sea Mud product that I bought so far.</li>
            <li> After washing it off, my face felt fresh.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is natural products.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product and I expect the bottle to last me quite a while!</li>
            <li> but it is really useful.</li>
            <li> Was able to leave my skin feeling fantastic and very deeply cleaned.  </li>
            <li> Powerful stuff.</li>
            <li> Wow, I really love this</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t expect it to smell like fresh flowers</li>
            <li> product worked well and was a completely safe and natural product.  </li>
            <li> makes it totally worth it.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about it though is that as soon as you wash it off you can feel how soft and nourished  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still early to tell but my skin does seem to feel smoother and look more even toned.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> I had a lot of fun with it too, I made it into a &amp;#34;spa night&amp;#34; at my house.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to apply - what kid didn&#x27;t roll around in the mud for fun??</li>

            <li> so I rarely use masks</li>
            <li> We women have different grades of beauty products we own in our vanities.</li>
            <li> Made to naturally exfoliate, moisturize, cleanse and balance for healthy radiant skin.</li>
            <li> It smelled like eucalyptus and fresh mint.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest I still haven&#x27;t worn make up (and I won&#x27;t till next week)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy mom of 3 and spend most of my &amp;#34;spare time&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> but I would definitely purchase it on my own.</li>
            <li> Like most competitive products out there where you have to use “THREE” bottles in order to have clear skin.. (please…).  </li>
            <li> talk about getting your money’s worth.</li>
            <li> then you wash off whatever is left with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wash off and leaves your face feeling clear, clean, and brighter.</li>

            <li> But pretty cool product&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> It says I believe to only to use it once a week, and I&#x27;m still kind of experimenting with it.</li>
            <li> Everything from mix your own powder with water or Apple Cider Vinegar to already mixed in the jar like this one.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to help my skin look more alive.  </li>

            <li> Be mindful of that this product has a distinct smell to it</li>
            <li> this Dead Sea Mud Mask is by far the best</li>
            <li> product is certified vegan and is not tested on animals and most of the natural ingredients are organic.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh minty smells</li>

            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> I applied this on a freshly washed face.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a tingly feeling that made my face feel so fresh and</li>
            <li> and it just took twenty minutes total in my own bathroom.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>

            <li> My skin feels soft and refreshing after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to get the right amount on, but once you figure it out, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I tried out the Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask and loved it!  </li>
            <li> Gently and natural exfoliates during application, and hydrates skin while taking out toxins, leaving skin glowing, smooth, clean, and not even red (I have fair skin).</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time today and it has a strong minty odor which I don&#x27;t care for all that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the results; they are Much better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Most other mud masks I&#x27;ve used are more clay-like.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> When I first used this mask my skin felt super tingly an</li>
            <li> Your skin feels clean and pure.</li>
            <li> In the morning, my face looks very refreshing and for someone who doesn&#x27;t really get that much sleep, this is great to prevent my face from looking tired.</li>
            <li> Upon removal my skin felt soft, smooth, and clean.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li> Rinsed it off and unlike with many masks, which once rinsed off leave the skin feeling stripped and squeaky clean, this one left my skin feeling like I had already applied moisturizer and allowed it to absorb.</li>
            <li> The mask leaves your skin feeling incredibly clean, soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It feels very clean after and skins feels really soft.</li>
            <li> It helps to make my skin feel soft and very clean.  </li>

            <li> It was nice and thick and went on very easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very convinced this product is worth it!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling smooth and clean !</li>
            <li> It takes the impurities, excess oils, and grime right out of my skin.</li>
            <li> I used this right before I took a shower</li>
            <li> it starts to tingle on your face right away.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it right before a date...</li>
            <li> Came right off.</li>
            <li> Right after applying I get this tingling sensation on my skin which probably comes from the Eucalyptus Oil.</li>
            <li> I did not use it right now</li>
            <li> so we might as well do it right.</li>
            <li> Right?</li>
            <li> and I had to see for myself right away.</li>
            <li> got it right away...</li>
            <li> Just received this today and had to use it right away.  </li>
            <li> right  </li>
            <li> You can feel it cleaning and soothing your skin right away.</li>
            <li> saw results right</li>
            <li> However, it shows a difference on my skin right after I use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I waited the 10mins, but didn&#x27;t notice anything right away.</li>
            <li> i didnt give right away the previews</li>
            <li> RIGHT</li>
            <li> and I wanted to try it on right away.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m leaving this comment here with the mask on my face</li>
            <li> I have this mud on my face right now.</li>
            <li> Be right back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I squeeze and the dirt comes off right away.</li>
            <li> They gave me refund right aways.</li>
            <li> I tried the mask right away.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m pretty pleased and happy with this product and definitely will recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also feels very natural and not like its full of chemicals!</li>
            <li> The first thing that you&#x27;ll notice when you open the jar is it&#x27;s amazing aroma.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel comfortable that the product is in tub-like container in which you pretty much have to dip your fingers in to access.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and ready to receive dirt again.</li>
            <li> The only thing Is that it kind if burns when you first apply it but than after a while it goes away.</li>
            <li> and there and this mask really helps clean my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s too soon to speak of lasting benefit, but I liked the first use.</li>
            <li> at first it feels really nice, cool and smooth, but it starts to burn my skin a little.</li>
            <li> and it may not be the most pleasant smell (in other words, it smells bad :D )</li>
            <li> I thought for some reason that it was going to be powder, but it is already mixed and was very easy for them to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting to feel the mud mask harden and restrict any major movements on your face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to help with skin your completion and smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> Compared to any of the clays or muds we&#x27;ve used before, this Dead Sea Mud Mask has shown the most impressive results as far as detoxifying skin and leaving it with a younger appearance.</li>
            <li> It most definitely is a cooling and mildly tingling mask.  </li>
            <li> It dried within 10 minutes and was easy to remove with a bit of warm water.  </li>
            <li> It feels nice it doesnt dry the skin it leaves it looking fresh .its</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Amazon customer for many years, prime the last 5 years</li>
            <li> My skin has had a nice glow, and has been very clear and soft.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the smell, the feeling afterwards is great.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the smell it does a great job......................</li>
            <li> When combined with the intense eucalyptus, it’s not all that pleasant… I do enjoy the smell of menthol, so if that was the only detectable scent, I’m sure it wouldn’t bother me in the slightest.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the smell then this product is great for you.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and pretty inex</li>
            <li> This is a great mask to use every few days and is not drying at all!</li>
            <li> They really nailed it on this one as far as Great Face Masks that actually work go.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels very tingly and cool on my face.</li>
            <li> I can’t wait to see what kind of results long term usage will bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling smooth and clean after the very first wash.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feels great, I love it, the first them though it stung a bit and made my skin a little red.</li>
            <li> It was also not difficult to wash all the residue off, and my skin felt refreshed and very squeaky clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and oily skin and have used masks for most of my adult life (I&#x27;m now in my sixties).</li>
            <li> Like all mud-masks, it is a bit messy but it came off pretty easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a nice refreshment to the face, use after a long day!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more of this wonderful Deep Sea Mud Mask for myself and other family members to use!</li>
            <li> But, I will say that even after the first use I noticed right away that my face felt smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> Do not apply right after shower, nor after washing your face with hot water</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels younger, softer, clean, bright, popes are smaller, acne is going away...</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to strong smells like I am, then this product will work for you.</li>
            <li> It has eucalyptus oil in which I actually liked because it gives you that clean tingle feeling ( I suppose could also be from the aloe) but at the same time even if u don&#x27;t put it near your eyes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was too strong for my sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> Just received my Dead Sea mud facial mask and it&#x27;s awesome !</li>
            <li> I waited till it was dry, then started to wipe it off with warm water and a damp hand towel.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> The end result was good, smoother skin and less wrinkle lines.</li>
            <li> I love how this mask gently exfoliates and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It shipped super fast, was packaged</li>
            <li> They ship super fast and the customer service is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> think that the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is awesome!  </li>
            <li> However this mask truly delivers, after one use my face felt super soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It really shrinks pores and helps with my super oily skin.</li>
            <li> The dead sea are great ingredients and this product really embraces those ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and it does not dry or leave face more oily.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> My face always feels nice, soft and clean and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling so clean and super soft.</li>
            <li> There is a rather strong smell with this mask, but it is natural minerals and there is no fragrance added to mask the smell.</li>
            <li> and so I am sensitive to extremely strong odors or fragrances.</li>
            <li> Seller was Super Fast</li>
            <li> once on the skin it feels really cooling and dries quick.</li>
            <li> My face felt very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels pretty cold on your face - if you use a mud mask you have to add water to you can elect to add warm water</li>
            <li> the consistency is light and it is overall very refreshing, it has some exfoliating particles that help with deep cleansing while the mud just refreshes and moisturizes your skin.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product because I love the way dead sea minerals make my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Dead sea mask made my skin feel so fresh , exactly like after a good scrub or photo rejuvenation but without the tenderness.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Please do make sure to wash it completely off your hands though so that you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes!</li>
            <li> Great mud facial, left skin smooth, soft, and nourished.</li>
            <li> I must say that I received this very very discounted to give my opinions.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> I like this mask very much.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable for the results you can get.</li>
            <li> It feels nice, it feels like impurities are being lifted out and as the mask dries it definitely makes your facial skin tighten and continues to feel that way for a good while after the facial.</li>
            <li> I suspect there was a lighting/distraction trick used by the sales guy, since he wouldn&#x27;t let me walk to the other side of the kiosk to examine my image in more light.</li>
            <li> overall I thought it was pleasant and at least somewhat effective.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling super fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was lucky and bought it at a deeply discounted price, but would pay full price for this product!</li>
            <li> It feels so good when you put it on, and it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re at a little day spa.</li>
            <li> Really good product has a little sting to it going on the face , I&#x27;m guessing from the eucalyptus oil in it.</li>
            <li> After every use my skin feels so fresh and clean and soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face soft and fresh and clean</li>
            <li> It is very intense at first, so</li>
            <li> Loved the little tingle sensation when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask is a great and highly recommended mask for all skin types.</li>
            <li> It dries quick, dissolves quickly, consistency is smooth, is liquid (not sticky), and smells very clean (hardly any odor, period).</li>
            <li> I felt a hint of glow in the complexion after the first use.</li>
            <li> First time trying it</li>
            <li> a warning, when you first put in on, it tingles or burns, depending on what you did to your face beforehand.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and natural without any added fragrances.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I think I put it too close to my eyes the first time because the eucalyptus vapors made my eyes water a bit.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to try it asap because I love facial</li>
            <li> It really helped to even out my skin as well!</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time, I could feel and see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Just thinking of all the money I will save, and how I get to pamper myself with a facial every week makes me love this product even more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Has a tingling feeling when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> that I am willing to wear a bikini.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m willing to try just about anything to get rid of my zits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first noticed about this mask</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a big plus - I love using mud masks</li>
            <li> by the scent of the product when it first arrived.</li>
            <li> Ok...just used it first time</li>
            <li> This mud mask performs exactly as intended.</li>
            <li> morning, my skin looks even better than it did last night.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product and cannot wait to see what happens when I use it again next week.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied this product to my face</li>
            <li> I first put it on my skin burned, that is eucalyptus oil causing it.</li>
            <li> and I break out more than a normal 21 year old would.</li>
            <li> Essential oils are beneficial even when they are just inhaled so you get more than just the benefits in your skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> You get so many uses out of this jar because it&#x27;s so big!</li>
            <li> At first I tried to follow the instruction but it was hurting my skin.</li>
            <li> I have shift from doing my entire face to my most troublesome areas (nose, cheeks and chine).</li>
            <li> I looked very refreshed!</li>
            <li> I still remember the first time to use it after I got it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> So for the first 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I have so-so skin (some acne, combination skin, and hyperpigmentation), I am always trying different products that might be able to help out.</li>
            <li> First time using the product, I put the mask on about 20 minutes before I got in the shower.</li>
            <li> I am constantly hunting for better beauty products.</li>
            <li> Ok so maybe my mud wasn&#x27;t the same as those sold in stores</li>
            <li> I love this facial mask and I like using it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I do recognize that it takes a lot for met give a stellar critique.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t burn and sting like it did when I first started using</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that my face felt soft, smooth, and skin looked brighter.  </li>
            <li> I have now found my favorite facial mask!</li>
            <li> so I would say even if it doesnt do anything in the first week or two</li>
            <li> I love this product except for one thing: the last ingredient, eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> this is my first time using this product and as soon as it touched my skin</li>
            <li> firstly, it still mind***s me to this day</li>
            <li> Only use once a week though, any more</li>
            <li> My face has never felt so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will definitely repurchase it.</li>
            <li> Prior to applying this product, be sure to alert your family.  </li>
            <li> It did sting my eye a bit at first</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ..Love it !</li>
            <li> I love that from the second I put this mask on my face</li>
            <li> Really I do!  </li>
            <li> first washed my faced with my Paula&#x27;s Choice cleanser.  </li>
            <li> However this just totally amazed me on how the dryness was gone in many parts of my face.  </li>
            <li> It tangles but only because of the mint I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> When i first opened the jar it looked like someone had Just placed mud in there</li>
            <li> I could see the difference even when I used it the first time!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Now I have no idea on the shelf life for a mud mask, but I figure if you use it often that pretty soon you will be buying another one.</li>
            <li> only wish is that this would be reformulated to have a better scent and texture.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn at all like some masks do when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> It tingles at first when you put it on</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are no parabens or sulphates, which makes sense that this is a better deal when it comes to facial mask and your skin.</li>
            <li> I really did have quite the experience with this mask!</li>
            <li> but I really like it anyways!</li>
            <li> It was soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the fact, that the organic essential oils moisturize and hydrate your skin, helping to reduce wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> is the first mud mask I have ever tried</li>
            <li> I saw a drastic change the first time.</li>
            <li> It can burn a bit when you first put it on because of the peppermint oil</li>
            <li> and it was exactly like the mud.</li>
            <li> The description about this product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> your done‼  Plus the mud mask should last you for more than a month..</li>
            <li> When it first arrived I felt jipped by the size of the jar</li>
            <li> The mask has a burning feel when first applied</li>
            <li> The first time you use it, most likely it will feel like there is acid on your face.</li>
            <li> it was not this exact brand</li>
            <li> course being a guy, I was against the idea of doing something what I and most men would consider so feminine in regards to personal hygiene.</li>
            <li> Anyway when I first took it off I first thought, Woo I look like a baby, no wrinkles</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t put this in the fridge since the mint feeling is pretty overpowering and it won&#x27;t help it keep</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Just tried this for the first time.</li>
            <li> I feel like it worked on the first use.</li>
            <li> When I first apply it stings.</li>
            <li> I have been a big user of masks for many years.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling pretty refreshed.  </li>
            <li> After you wipe all of the blue off, you&#x27;ll feel your skin tighter and more polished.</li>
            <li> However, the first time I used this product I felt that it was working.  </li>
            <li> and I followed exactly what the instruction stated.  </li>
            <li> The mask stung the first time I tried it</li>
            <li> I put it on and immediately felt it getting hot on my face</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I thought my face was going to catch fire.</li>
            <li> That means that by buying it, you may be supporting incitement to genocide and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four star because when I first recieved this product, it burned my face, by that</li>
            <li> This is one my favorite facial masks.</li>
            <li> , it make you face look and feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> It burned my face at the first time, but I felt better the next time..</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and it makes my skin so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> When you first put it on, it sort of burns and then tingles, but I think that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> First of all you can see how your skin tone evens out after the couple first uses.</li>
            <li> When I first used it I felt my skin was burning or smth.</li>
            <li> As I went to reviews to see if this was what others were experiencing,  I saw so many reviews of the same.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li> I like the smooth texture and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It shrunk my pores with the first application.  </li>
            <li> just pulls out all that yucky oil as well as impurities, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth as well as shrinking the appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on my face I burned</li>
            <li> When you first apply this mask,  it feels like a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> At 25, I have pretty acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> If the first batch I bought had been like my most recent one, I would have never re purchased it.</li>
            <li> Overall, satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask!</li>
            <li> I felt a litter burning/sting when I first apply on, then it went away while drying.</li>
            <li> make sure you store this product in the fridge after you open it.</li>
            <li> As you can gues, I&#x27;d love results as soon as possible!!!</li>
            <li> My face felt really soft and smooth after application.</li>
            <li> first time urer..</li>
            <li> I can feel my skin soft &amp;amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> My friend had to quit using it because she actually broke out more while using it.</li>
            <li> Also don&#x27;t forget to stir it up first.</li>
            <li> After 20 mins I removed it and my skin felt so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> For me that was a big deal, I had tried so many products claiming to be a miracle acne healer but they never seemed to work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a lot to cover your whole face!</li>
            <li> Love the silky feeling this mask left me with.</li>
            <li> There is no grittiness or burning sensation and it leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> definitely need to take better care of my skin.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things to do with my skin is to give it a facial.</li>
            <li> The mud contains more than twenty-one skin-reviving materials that include minerals such as magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.</li>
            <li> These minerals are important for skin care because they are known to treat, detoxify and cleanse the skin keeping it looking young and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft and smooth my face feels after I wash it off.</li>
            <li> Or, entirely plausibly, I just didn&#x27;t realize that I only have wrinkles on one side to begin with.</li>
            <li> did apply it to my face, and at first noticed a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> Now my boyfriend even wants to try it!  </li>
            <li> It has a tingling cooling sensation when you first put it on, but once you wash it off...</li>
            <li> First off</li>
            <li> When the mask first touch my face</li>
            <li> For example when you eat pepper for the first time and it starts to burn your mouth</li>
            <li> well that’s how it felt when I first had the mask on my face.</li>
            <li> Shipping was also fast!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any dryness or irritation - my skin actually felt quite a bit more moisturized afterward.</li>
            <li> I left it on for around 10 minutes while it tingled and worked its magic, then I started to wash it off.</li>
            <li> The quality of this mask is exactly what your face deserve</li>
            <li> I always loved every product I owned that came from the dead sea.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I loved the Dead Sea Mud Mask.  </li>
            <li> I received the Dead Sea Mud Face Mask in good condition.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply, not too dry or sandy.</li>
            <li> I left the Dead sea mud mask on for about 10 minutes and was able to quickly remove it with warm water.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product is cruelty free and comes right from the dead sea.</li>
            <li> and it made my skin feel so clean and soft!</li>
            <li> The mask makes my skin feel smooth, and it also has a slight exfoliating property which I enjoyed.</li>
            <li> its also kind of liquid and does dry fast.</li>
            <li> If you want a spa like facial for Super cheap buy this.  </li>
            <li> will be applying it every week as I really like how my skin feels after using the mask and it is so easy to use, no mixing and pouring, apply directly from the jar.&lt;br /&gt;**I</li>
            <li> My skin feels very supple right after application.</li>
            <li> is that it is a ready to use product right from the jar.</li>
            <li> But this product really surprised me, in that it immediately made my face feel clean and very much rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of anything that smells fresh and clean, and this mask is totally worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> No harsh texture and no skin discolor left behide love it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and makes skin super soft and clear.</li>
            <li> My face and neck feels more hydrated, smooth and tight.</li>
            <li> but my pores are still very clean from initial cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very clean when I combine it with a steam facial.</li>
            <li> It is ideal for folks that want to do a little extra for their skin.</li>
            <li> It does have a pretty strong tingle factor that might be a little too intense for someone with sensitive skin, but that is something I enjoy in a good facial.</li>
            <li> The mask was easy to apply with my figures and it has a thinner, lighter, slightly grainy consistency than I have experienced with other mud masks.  </li>
            <li> This jar is rather large in comparison to other products that I have bought with my favorite ingredient, a full 6 ounces.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome bargain for a dead sea mud mask, and if you&#x27;re curious about trying it</li>

            <li> My face just feels really clean, soft and toned.</li>
            <li> This scrub not only got along with my skin, but loved how it left my face feel.</li>
            <li> I applied the mask for one minute and I am glad that I didn&#x27;t hold it longer  because my face was on fire and for the whole week was very red.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far (in a 1 week period) and so far I love</li>
            <li> The results have proven that much more promising than I could have possibly have hoped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Facial is ideal as a once a week mask.</li>
            <li> so many good reviews here(I was so wrong to believe those reviews and bought the item).  </li>
            <li> I had recently boughten the white jar of glam glow which I loved</li>
            <li> You will instantly feel your skin soft and nice.</li>
            <li> Super easy and won&#x27;t over dry skin.</li>
            <li> the Eucalyptus does a great job of hiding the natural smell of the Dead Sea</li>
            <li> I think the most important part of skin care is to keep dead skin off of the face.</li>
            <li> : It smells very strong which I expected</li>
            <li> : It smells very strong which I expected</li>
            <li> I had used the mask about three times with positive results.</li>
            <li> Second, for $25, you get a huge tub of the mask – bigger than what most night creams come in.  </li>
            <li> this will be a bit intense at first</li>
            <li> I have used Dead Sea Mud from other companies for years and like the products, but this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> But it fades pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I pit it on my sons eczema and it looks better than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> For a long time my favorite was a clay mask, but I think this product just edged it out.</li>
            <li> Very glad that I purchased Dead Sea mud face mask</li>
            <li> it was like my skin felt full and soft.</li>
            <li> I have had mud facials before in my past and loved them.  </li>
            <li> so I do not recommend it to anyone with highly sensitive skin or easily rashes with new skin products.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to see that the Dead Sea Facial Mask had a plesent smell even though its color scared me a little. :)</li>
            <li> It gives such a clean and fresh feeling when your done.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely Dead Sea Mud mask that will leave your skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love the texture, it is slightly thin, which makes it very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It washes off pretty easily compared to the aforementioned Queen Helene mask, which can be a real chore to get wash</li>
            <li> I searched for a Mud mask that would be suitable for sensitive skin and this is what I got, I read only positive reviews and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting that at first, so I immediately washed it off, but it turns out that is normal!</li>
            <li> I got this for $1.00 on Snagshout.com , but when I run out I will definitely pay full price!</li>
            <li> It came off easily when I rubbed it for the extra exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel super soft and</li>
            <li> It makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Super soft</li>
            <li> Skin feels super soft and pleasan to touch after washing off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made my face feel soft and fresh the first use and is clearing out my flaws in my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft and like velvet.</li>
            <li> After the first week of using it, it left my skin really smooth</li>
            <li> I prefer a thinner face mask more so of a thicker one, as it takes longer to dry.</li>
            <li> It was really easy to open and close.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, just make sure to moisturize well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels super soft after using the product</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use it more than once a week because I don&#x27;t want to dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my face feel and letting the mask dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First things first, this company absolutely rocked when it came to fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I put on the mask near the sink so if my face burned again, I could wash it of quickly.</li>
            <li> and it washed of easily the next morning</li>
            <li> It washed off just as easy and your nightly facial cleaner.  </li>
            <li> and I was worried it would dry my face out even more than it already is</li>
            <li> There is a fair amount so it will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> On a personal note, the eucalyptus is quite strong.</li>
            <li> first I used warm water to remove the mask after it dried, because let&#x27;s face</li>
            <li> I use another brand now from Amazon (true you organics dead sea mud mask) which is much better on my skin...</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it a 4 star review is because the smell of this mud mask is a bit strong &amp; stinky to me, but I can over look that because of how well I feel this mask works.</li>
            <li> Not only is the odor strong, it provides a burning or tingling feeling as the mud goes on.</li>
            <li> I love the feel and smell of the mud and it comes off very easy and is very non irritating.</li>
            <li> The first time I put this mask on it got warm, like a deep down in your pores, is it burning, will my face be red or will my skin fall of type warm.</li>
            <li> My pores are so large I can see them with out the magnifying mirror and after removing the mask I saw a visible difference</li>
            <li> I have comination skin &amp; i have large pores after washing this mask there is some spot from mask in my face</li>
            <li> You did not need a large amount, it covered well.</li>
            <li> Would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very obsessed with my face in keeping it clean, so I&#x27;m often trying new products and let me say this is absolutely great!</li>
            <li> If I lay it on thick, it can take up to 20 minutes for it to dry, which is fine with me, because I&#x27;m happy to leave a mask on for up to 45 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> mask goes on smoothly and you only need a small amount to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my new favorite skin care items.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast and it comes in a cute little box.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well, and made my skin SUPER soft.</li>
            <li> My face feels fresh and smooth and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> The mask is easy to clean off and does not leave your face dry or your skin tight like most masks.</li>
            <li> I always had very sensitive skin and tried many different masks over the years.</li>
            <li> So, I really do not get it - why so many positive reviews?</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever been to burning man and have gotten that fine dust in everything, this the same stuff.</li>
            <li> After washing it off, there wasn&#x27;t red irritated skin like I had expected, my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry and crave lotion, and I felt like it looked great!</li>
            <li> Externally, I started washing and mouisterizing in the am and pm and things were just fine...</li>
            <li> results i got were pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting anything else though considering the main ingredient!</li>
            <li> As a therapist who also does facials, I can say this is a very high quality mud mask.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was very reluctant to use it because of how most facial scrubs and masks</li>
            <li> As my face and neck get very dry at most times, I like to find products that would help my skin.</li>
            <li> I had a facial mask from a foreign country and that was pretty damn good.</li>
            <li> This Pure dead sea mud mask is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Pure and Essential Minerals are also cruelty free and vegan certified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask from Pure &amp; Essential Minerals works great.</li>
            <li> Pros: Feels smooth on the skin, works FAST, started clearing up my acne after only a day.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> and I noticed a huge difference the next day.</li>
            <li> Pros: Feels smooth on the skin, works FAST, started clearing up my acne after only a day.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> The burn is intense, but it stopped after about a minute.</li>
            <li> Very upset with result of this product.</li>
            <li> I used it for a week straight before leaving a review.</li>
            <li> but so u know I&#x27;m real Lol.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This left my skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to use than the powder clay masks that you have to mix up</li>
            <li> will update this review in a month or so after I see how much it helps my eczema.</li>
            <li> It let me control how much I wanted to apply and went on</li>
            <li> very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got one already works very well</li>
            <li> This really is a must try...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know which of the ingredients was responsible for that reaction, all I know is my skin</li>
            <li> Very sticky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I get much of a reduction, but my skin looks so much nicer after I do</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that the product really does what it says.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I try masks and feel my face flushing underneath the mask, and I didn&#x27;t really have that problem with this one.</li>
            <li> Really tighten the skin.</li>
            <li> Everyone always comes to me asking my secret for my great skin and this is one thing I recommend.</li>
            <li> My skin was VERY soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it is important for problem skin folks such as myself use a mud mask to periodically to draw out impurities and this mask seems to work in spades.</li>
            <li> Absorbs amazingly fast, which means, my skin needs it.</li>
            <li> Really cleans out the toxins and impurities in your skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really describe it.</li>
            <li> very oily skin!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very deceptive</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really exfoliate, but I use a washcloth to remove the mask, so that helps.</li>
            <li> This is really working for my brother.</li>
            <li> You have to wash your face and hairline very well afterwards to get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I feel like it get&#x27;s toxins out and really cleans skin of impurities.</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> So even though it said &amp;#34;medium layer&amp;#34; I really should put a think layer on my face instead.</li>
            <li> and the deliver speed is really</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> It felt tingly the whole time it was on my face.</li>
            <li> The mask left my face feeling refreshed and really smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> The oils really help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My pores look smaller and my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used 4 times I can really see a difference in the way my face looks-more toned, smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to remove in the shower.</li>
            <li> it really does work</li>
            <li> and my skin is so much softer.</li>
            <li> it was a real treat to my skin.</li>
            <li> and I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really fond of the smell</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much so</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> I really like this product looking forward to using it every week.</li>
            <li> My skin has really improved since i started using this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and it really relaxes me.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to re-order it.</li>
            <li> After its all off it makes your skin feel amazingly soft and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I was really taken by the smell.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind to much because I have really oily skin, so that helped.</li>
            <li> Very slimy, mucky, and the product in the jar shook like a gelatin.</li>
            <li> I know that you get a very earthy scent.</li>
            <li> The cost is affordable and it works really well.</li>
            <li> My skin really does feel softer after using it.</li>
            <li> and I tend to leave it on for much longer than it states.  </li>
            <li> and I stopped drinking as much water</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this mask, you can actually feel it working the moment you apply it.</li>
            <li> but that could be because I dont have much im looking to improve with my skin...</li>
            <li> Its been a month since i purchased this mask, its working very well even though i havent seen the differences that much.</li>
            <li> it helps me relax and makes my skin clear and fresh.</li>
            <li> (I have very oily skin).  </li>
            <li> but I look so much youthful.. almost like tasting the fountain of youth.  </li>
            <li> but it was even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> find that after use my skin feel very oily</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s really help my face skin</li>
            <li> I really feel a difference after using it.</li>
            <li> It feels really tingly when it goes on</li>
            <li> I like it very much,because it is very suited for me.</li>
            <li> and it left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> and  so on that i don&#x27;t really like having it on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very terrible.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> however my skin broke out so much after that</li>
            <li> it really works well for others however that was not my experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that I don&#x27;t need as much moisturizer through out the week after using this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really noticed any effects from using this.</li>
            <li> I dont really mind the smell since it doesnt bother me.</li>
            <li> her face has really cleared up.</li>
            <li> This product really speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> I do not like the smell too much</li>
            <li> It really works well</li>
            <li> I truly feel tat masks really have helped my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months and it really cleans out impurities from the pores.</li>
            <li> My skin was much smoother and even felt lighter.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really blame them for that.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and does as stated.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This mask seems to penetrate deeply enough to unclog the pores and keep them free from building up;no longer have oily skin</li>
            <li> and it feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li> The mask has a very pleasant,natural fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Be very cautious.  </li>
            <li> The mask feels very cooling on the face as it is drying.</li>
            <li> And it is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and found this a really gentle experience - the all natural and organic ingredients are a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> Seller is very responsive and caring.</li>
            <li> Expected texture and scent to be more cosmetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely cannot put this on my face where my nose holes are.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay, not very offensive.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin fresh and soft.  </li>
            <li> Skin does feel much smoother after using this product.</li>
            <li> I think in order to get more pore clearing results I would need to use it a few more days per week instead of only once.</li>
            <li> and I can say that my skin looks much smoother when I rinse the mask off.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> It has healing formula that is very refreshing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I do like this product the eucalyptus was too much for my skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> and this was so gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I put some Aveeno on my whole face and the burning stop and over time the irritation went away.</li>
            <li> The difference - my pores have visibly reduced, skin appears radiant, smooth and my blemishes have improved.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Essential minerals!</li>
            <li> it helps my psorasis so much.</li>
            <li> I Havent Seen Much Of A Difference yet.</li>
            <li> Then I gently removed the rest.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing off in the shower, my entire face and neck were smooth as a bit &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> id the real deal.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is very moisturizing and not drying at all.  </li>
            <li> I really like how the products are organic, and as soon as I washed the mask off my face, my skin was much smoother and cleaner than before.  </li>
            <li> My face has a much healthier glow since Ive started using this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mask has a very soothing effect on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Cleanser and moisturizer all in this product, I bought this because I used to have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Really watery consistency and burns my skin when I put it on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped my skin and acne- went off medication</li>
            <li> But Do Not buy if you have very sensitive/dry skin, this will burn.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect because I had never tried a mud mask before.</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I admit it, I am addicted to face masks; I have tried many of them over the years.</li>
            <li> It smells nice which is a plus for dead sea mask.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that it has made a very big difference in the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried dead sea products before and actually liked</li>
            <li> jar clearly says to only use once a week which is a bummer as I would love to use this 2-3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> , it is thick, smooth and the scent isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> My face has a nice pink glow after using it and is soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Since it is a MUD mask, I think I was expecting a sort of musty gross smell, but I was very pleasantly surprised when it had more of a eucalyptus scent to it.  </li>
            <li> It smells heavenly, tingles enough to feel like it is working and left my skin looking and feeling very clean!</li>
            <li> The only strange thing was the smell, but it is easy to get over and the natural components are better for the skin than &amp;#34;good smelling&amp;#34; chemicals and fragrances.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first jar was thick and dark and rich and great for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> It also dries pretty quickly and it definitely feels as if my face is being cleansed and nourished.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin this might not be the right</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling very clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Especially once I washed it off; it left should a clean and smooth feel to my face.</li>
            <li> I know that this product was not targeted for other parts of the body, but I love it so much that I also use it on my elbows.</li>
            <li> Honestly, there probably aren&#x27;t any, and I won&#x27;t be the fashion victim who spends thousands on skin care for barely- or im-perceptible results.</li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t take any particular measures to prevent mold</li>
            <li> , well, it came from a sea in which something might have, say, died, but they&#x27;ve covered most of that up with the other organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> If only the packaging and scent weren’t so off-putting, I’d definitely repurchase this and add it to my usual rotation because the formula truly is awesome.</li>
            <li> mud felt fine on my face and it really does dry fast and hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just like many of the other reviewers...</li>
            <li> Hopefully I don&#x27;t break out more like other reviewers did.</li>
            <li> This unique mask and scrub works double time to detox skin.</li>
            <li> I could already see and feel a major difference after the first use!</li>
            <li> Also, the size is pretty big, I think i&#x27;ll last me quite a while! :)</li>
            <li> The history and directions on the packaging were clearly written and large enough for easy reading.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, huge open pores, and many blemishes &amp; black heads.</li>
            <li> Pure and Essential Minerals use 100% pure, natural and certified organic ingredients that are free of sulfates, phosphates and parabens.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is supposed tingle so much that it felt like my face was kind of burning.</li>
            <li> After 15-20 minutes, you rinse and are left with clean, yet moisturized skin.  </li>
            <li> then I rinsed it off and my skin was left feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed to get a great result.</li>
            <li> I think the price is decent for this mask because it really feels as organic as it says.</li>
            <li> It deep clean your face.  </li>
            <li> The dead sea facial mask is amazing!</li>
            <li> Within the first week, my face looked better and all the acne had dried up.</li>
            <li> It was obviously easy to apply, but after an easier than expected removal, it left my skin feeling silky smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom and me feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> It applies really easily and takes about 10 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> After application, it took about 12 minutes to dry and was really easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> For the first couple times I have used this, It worked really well, but I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Although I knew that it could be felt harsh at first time (by the reviews), I couldn&#x27;t stand even 5 more seconds.</li>
            <li> This mask dried in less than 5 minutes so this one is perfect for the busy moms out there.  </li>
            <li> It smelled good at first but then leaves a smell behind like dirt..</li>
            <li> This is a nice little home spa mud mask!</li>
            <li> I have used other mud masks in the past that I liked better.</li>
            <li> Rich Dead Sea minerals clean, heal, soften and revitalize your skin for that all day glow.</li>
            <li> After applying this mask my face started to burn, reminded me of this time I got a chemical burn in high school from applying too much Benzaclin at once (concentrated acne medicine).</li>
            <li> Actually using it right now!</li>
            <li> I shared it on my mom and uncle and they love the stuff it really helps with my black heads.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least a half dozen of these masks and this is the best one for my skin type.</li>
            <li> This mask is soft and leaves your face super soft</li>
            <li> My skin feels super soft and looks clear.  </li>
            <li> It begins drying pretty quickly though, so it isn&#x27;t an issue for long.</li>
            <li> very strong mask and need to be watchful over how long I leave on my skin....can see the healing effects but, it burned my face first 15 minutes of use...felt harsh yet, was weirdly refreshing all at the same time,</li>
            <li> Wetting it really cleaned the mask very clearly and fast.</li>
            <li> Not only is this made from very natural ingredients but it is also cruelty free and certified vegan.</li>
            <li> My skin was left feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The amount of pain this mask causes is not okay, but the result is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This Mud Mask has worked amazingly well for me in the past month.  </li>
            <li> I have never had my face clear up so fast!</li>
            <li> I am planning to try a full body mask later this week and will post an updated review then.</li>
            <li> It tingles for the first couple of minutes, but then completely goes away.</li>
            <li> The next morning the face looks fabulous , skin is soft and very moisturized  .</li>
            <li> I had planned a spa-type night with my two teenage girls, and when the opportunity to review this product came up, I  was so excited, as I had heard such good things about dead sea mud, salt, masks, etc.</li>
            <li> Well there is the Anti-aging properties such as tighten the pores promoting young, healthy natural skin.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling smooth and soft and really gave it an even look.  </li>
            <li> What I really like most about this product is that you don’t have to use it daily (but only once a week).  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was going to make my face shiny because I have naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li> After applying the mask only for 15 minutes, I rinsed with cool water and could feel the difference before my face reached the mirror.</li>
            <li> my skin becomes pretty soft afterward.</li>
            <li> I’m pretty sensitive about scents triggering headaches, but this one didn’t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> so I still have a full jar after using it almost weekly since last February when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad feeling, just different.</li>
            <li> The jar is easy to open and keeps the mask contained for no mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better if I can just go lay down and close my eyes, but I&#x27;d give this 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li> Pure&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask, however, contains no nasty ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I love my PURE Dead Sea Mud Mask and it has become my Friday night ritual after cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li> I was delighted when Pure &amp; Essential Minerals contacted me and asked if I would consider trying out their new Dead Sea Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The container itself may not look much but the product will last for many months as long as you use it twice a week with a reasonable amount of product.</li>
            <li> Unlike most other masks, this dries in a mere 5-10 minutes and does a great job</li>
            <li> And because of this, I am very scared to experience with new products on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very apprehensive about trying new beauty products, but this one is going into my collection.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this Dead Sea Mud Mask from PURE to anyone who wants to love their face!</li>
            <li> The price is more than I would typically pay for a jar of mud.</li>
            <li> That is basically more then half a year if used weekly!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love masks that when you put them on they feel like you have nothing on or a slight cooling feeling - but not burning/hot/</li>
            <li> I let it dry for 15 minutes and wash it off and it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply on but feel like peppermint and icy burn.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the slight tingle of the mask.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and once I was done, my skin felt smooth and soft, definitely made me feel a bit pampered.</li>
            <li> It shrinks my pores which is a main concern of mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a mask kind of girl, but as I&#x27;m heading towards the mid 30&#x27;s, my skin has been changing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using spot treatments for breakouts, but wanted to try something different, in hopes that my face will love me back in return.</li>
            <li> It left my face soft and smooth after using it twice in a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very similar to other Mud masks, but I LOVE mud masks, so it&#x27;s alright by me!</li>
            <li> but I was lucky enough to be given the product at a cheaper price for review.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask felt so good on my face.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s tingled ALOT initially but quickly</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> &gt; When you open the container, It has a light natural smell to it.</li>
            <li> you can see, I really had an interesting experience with the Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> Luckily I got this from taking surveys, so money isn&#x27;t a big deal</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t perform as expected, but it&#x27;s ok so far...</li>
            <li> .BTW shipping was quick almost like next day thats a score  </li>
            <li> after 20 mins i can feel my skin restored back to many years younger.</li>
            <li> I was shopping for a facial mask that could handle my in between skin and bring back my face and neck skin area that has seen better days.</li>
            <li> My most recent purchase of it, however, has been a total letdown.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on it actually felt like it was stinging my face (which made me pretty nervous)</li>
            <li> The order arrived quickly even though I chose standard shipping.</li>
            <li> Left my skin extremely soft,  smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It comes in a decent jar so you can get a ton of uses from it.</li>
            <li> and it left my skin feeling really soft and smooth</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had some problems w/ redness, eczema and psoriasis, even on my face, mainly around my eyes.</li>
            <li> it smells a little strange but it leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have their face feel like new.</li>
            <li> It was a little strong tingling feeling at first</li>
            <li> Loaded with dead sea minerals, the mask sports a refreshing cucumber smell and is very gentle even on my sensitive, aging skin.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and leaves my skin soft soft soft and clear!</li>
            <li> I have ordered other Dead Sea mud face masks, and this is by far the most pure and authentic.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, it has not been tested on animals, and the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li> My skin was VERY soft!  </li>
            <li> Love it and it does work, but it makes a mess when you remove it.  </li>
            <li> It has a different texture and fragrance, but not unpleasant at all</li>
            <li> This time my face felt soft, hydrated, moisturized and just plain amazing.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>

            <li> &amp; would highly  recommend if your looking for a mudd mask.</li>
            <li> Def high quality.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.p</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to wash off as well, takes very little effort and unless you get it on your hair their is no discomfort in washing the product off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a single application, it left my face feeling smooth, soft and really clean.  </li>
            <li> It has a lighter feeling than other muds I have used, and it goes on smooth and fast.</li>
            <li> so i may as well ignore that.&lt;br /&gt;Its not very runny and stays fine on the face.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product and I am excited to try it again in the near future.</li>
            <li> Make sure not to get it too close to your eyes because the fumes can sting your eyes a little.</li>
            <li> The smell could be a little better but that in no reason to take stars away from it.</li>
            <li> I do also like the benefits of this Anti - Aging natural Mask product!!</li>
            <li> Definitely buying again after the first jar gets used up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more minty than I wanted</li>
            <li> So I was a little nervous about it and thought I should probably do a spot test to make sure that I wasn&#x27;t going to have a reaction.</li>
            <li> But too strong and salt in it not for sensitive skin or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I will say that it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean, but my pores do not look any smaller or tightened at all.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my 53 year old skin and it left it feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This facial mask draws out impurities, toxins and excess oils leaving your skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> but I like it because it leaves a nice faint clean scent on my face all day.</li>
            <li> Now that I am (ahem) considerably older, I still  love masks and thisamazing Dead Sea Mud Mask is no exception.</li>
            <li> It seems more even toned, less oily, and just soft!</li>
            <li> It made my skin look and feel great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure &amp; Essential Minerals are proud that their Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask does not contain any chemicals, it’s 100% pure, natural and certified organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I really like being able to order new products from Amazon, as I tend to be very anxious to try them out, plus I can read lots of reviews.  </li>
            <li> face felt very smooth after my face was dry and my acne wasn&#x27;t as red as it was before I</li>
            <li> After drying and rinsing, it leaves the skin moist, supple, clean, and firmed, and neither oily nor dry.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, minimal scent.</li>
            <li> so far i really like it</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t sting too much.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> The texture seemed very spongy and soft.  </li>
            <li> The application was silky not thick and muddy</li>
            <li> this amazing mud face mask.&lt;br /&gt;i even sometimes put it on my back and chest for some extra deep cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> She said it really helped clear up her complexion.</li>
            <li> What is really fantastic is that is is gentle enough to use multiple times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I notice it really helps clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> it smells really minty and different, after the first use my skin was glowing.</li>
            <li> and as it dried I felt that tightening sensation that I love.</li>
            <li> I will apply the mask for a few more weeks and see if it makes any difference.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a week and normally leave it on when it drys.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mask has a beautiful deep grey color from the mineral-rich Dead Sea mud, which is blended with a few botanic and mostly organic ingredients to condition and protect the skin:  shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera juice, calendula oil, and hickory bark extract.  </li>
            <li> I think for oily or normal skin.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I did a facial night and used this for fun.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit like icy hot and feels like tingly during the mask but both are well worth the work the mask does.</li>
            <li> I love this dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NORMAL,  </li>
            <li> Some products are more trouble to remove than the results they garner.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s normally.</li>
            <li> I would do it at maximum once a week for my normal skin.</li>
            <li> Is that normal?  </li>
            <li> I know what to expect and love about Dead Sea Mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea has many benefits</li>
            <li> I’ve tried many products, and yes… even the 3 step one and had NO results like this Dead Sea Mud Mask did for me.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and cannot wait to see the long term benefits of using this mask.</li>
            <li> (that would have been useful knowledge that the instructions left out)</li>
            <li> However, the oils in the mud totally got absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s normal and just means it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Will update after using it a few more times.</li>
            <li> So.. I guess that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> I have many clients that are signed up for monthly mud wraps since we&#x27;ve introduced the Dead Sea Mud.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my different subscription boxes I&#x27;ve been able to try a wide variety of them.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how smooth and soft my skin felt after using this facial mask.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this Dead Sea Mud Mask.  </li>
            <li> I have a normal skin type; i used this mask on my face twice a week.</li>
            <li> After using the mask, my skin felt more oily than hydrated, and after using it for a few weeks, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if the &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; in the cheaper versions are even real, however, I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> Love Dead Sea masks...</li>
            <li> I find the smell irritating fragrance wise and to my eyes.</li>
            <li> ; Like some other people have reported, my skin, especially the skin around my sinuses, started burning strongly almost right away.</li>
            <li> But the second time I tried it, there was a slight nice tingle.</li>
            <li> My skin actually felt tighter-not dry, just better.</li>
            <li> After 25 minutes, I washed it off only to feel my face being super soft with a hint of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Her skin actually looks better after just one week and no new flare-ups have occurred.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li> After trying it once every week I finally learned the right way to use it for me.</li>
            <li> The right amount of muddiness and moisture ratio to properly apply the mask.</li>
            <li> This facial mask was right on time.</li>
            <li> To end this on a positive note, it leaves my skin so soft, and helps remove the oil buidup, and clear it up of acne.</li>
            <li> After my treatment with the  Dead Sea Facial Mask from Pure and Essential minerals was over, my skin did have a very nice natural glow and WAS NOT DRIED OUT as I had been concerned it may do.</li>
            <li> If you feel that it is too strong for your skin or feel dry afterwards, it&#x27;s possible that you&#x27;ve used too much too.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to get really nice and clear looking skin then this product is for you, just hope you can tough it out for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling super soft and helped to clear up stubborn cystic acne that I suffer from!</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes on my face, it dried nicely and was quick to wash off without a mess.</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes of it on my face, it dried nicely and was quick to wash off without a mess.</li>
            <li> The other biggest benefit Ive noticed is how smooth my face feels after it cleansed and drew out the impurities.</li>
            <li> As its a little different than clay masks, its a nice change.</li>
            <li> You will feel cool and a little bit stimulated when you first put it on your face.</li>
            <li> This mask made my face feel refreshed and new.</li>
            <li> It has also helped to speed up the disappearance of the acne and it appears to be stopping new acne from forming.</li>
            <li> This product is a must-have for those who live with OILY skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new face mask as the one I use was changed.</li>
            <li> and so I was thinking that I was doomed to live with the skin I live in.</li>
            <li> You will feel like you have a brand new face after using this.</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel new once you use it.</li>
            <li> and I am often hesitant to try out new products.  </li>
            <li> it is suggested to wet the mask before wiping it clean.</li>
            <li> I always used Noxzema but as i got older my skin became sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aztec Secret bentonite clay with great results and will go back to that.</li>
            <li> so I love using products that contain the dead sea mud and all its natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> , wasn&#x27;t working out regularly, and was also thrown into quick eating (fast food and such).</li>
            <li> I have a super dry skin</li>
            <li> but thats just the natural dead sea minerals doing their magic.</li>
            <li> I feel that in the long run, with such a good-sized container, the product might end up becoming contaminated from this method of use.</li>
            <li> It has a nice minty aroma, and then feels terrific rinsing off after it has dried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using organic and natural products for over 15 years, so I&#x27;m extremely particular about what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> She has been able to calm her acne flare-ups without irritating her very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product it did have a little bit of tingling/burning on the face, but quickly went away.</li>
            <li> Side note: Just be careful when you first open the jar and safety seal, it can spill a bit if you&#x27;re not holding it upright, and get too excited.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, and I have eczema.  </li>
            <li> It makes the skin very soft.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d warn people who have very sensitive skin to be careful.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and even rinsing my hair with shampoo gets my body rashes.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin because I have severe eczema.  </li>
            <li> My pores definitely felt tighter, and my skin was very very moisturized.</li>
            <li> if you have very sensitive skin I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in the product look very natural too.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Probably not for very sensitive skin types though.  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you have a very sensitive skin, this is probably not the mask for you.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so we as hesitant to try this.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin was very soft.</li>
            <li> With this mask, my skin was very soft and it didn&#x27;t leave my face shiny like some others.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My face is very soft.</li>
            <li> I took the mask off after the recommended 10 minutes and my skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li> so it stings a little after wiping it off, but other than that my face feels really good</li>
            <li> I got my Dead sea Mud facial Mask and was super excited to use it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for three weeks now and it has started to clear my face up well!</li>
            <li> so I noticed that my skin stays clear longer!</li>
            <li> It will clear your nose!</li>
            <li> This product feels exactly the same.</li>
            <li> A lot of other mud masks have that chalky, pasty feel and this one definitely doesn&#x27;t - it&#x27;s a lot more supple, and that makes it easier to spread on your face evenly and keep it on your skin and not your clothing.</li>
            <li> what I did notice was that my face still felt really well-moisturized in spite of mud masks generally being so drying to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dark circles under eyes seemed lighter, skin tighter and smooth.  </li>
            <li> second time I mixed the mask properly in the jar itself and did not wash my face before applying and it was a much better experience than the 1st time.</li>
            <li> and my skin was beyond soft!</li>
            <li> I have tried better Dead Sea masks though !</li>
            <li> and u actually can feel the difference on the first use.</li>
            <li> It made my face so soft and took my oily shine away!</li>
            <li> and my skin feels cleaner afterwards and not dried out!</li>
            <li> Only works in first couple times.</li>
            <li> The fine lines around the eyes were smoother and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a mud mask before, so it was funny to open the jar and see that it&#x27;s literally just a jar of mud.</li>
            <li> The container is pretty big</li>
            <li> Only part I don&#x27;t care for is a severe burning sensation that I get when first applying.</li>
            <li> I noticed even after the first use, my skin tighter, and the pores in my sking were much smaller.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I noticed that the texture was pretty gross as well.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it burns and makes your eyes water when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> It always makes my face so soft, smooth and deep cleans all the while putting moisture back into my skin.</li>
            <li> (be sure you&#x27;re not allergic to anything before you use it though so that you don&#x27;t mistake allergic reaction for the usual pain).</li>
            <li> I love this mud mask I usually use a mint julep clay mask</li>
            <li> received early!</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed is that my pores are much smaller.</li>
            <li> My skin not only felt higher, it looked tighter.</li>
            <li> through the first bottle and on my second.</li>
            <li> The texture is pretty consistent to other mud/clay masks I’ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is actually the first face mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s definitely a difference in the skin after one use, my brother in law says I was glowing haha, so I recommend!</li>
            <li> I used it last night for the first time, and immediately after using I felt softer skin.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times now and it does really improve the texture of my skin and helps to clear my complexion which is always appreciated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond thrilled to have finally found a clay based mask that isn&#x27;t too drying or harsh for my sensitive normal/dry</li>
            <li> I usually buy the masks at Walmart and Target which are okay, but this mud mask kicks</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this product, I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> However, I am so glad I tried out this Dead Sea Mud Mask!  </li>
            <li> My face feels soft!</li>
            <li> and it is only soft if i apply some kind of heavy lotion the night before.</li>
            <li> The Eucalyptus is a little strong.</li>
            <li> texture is nice, smooth, with just a few little smaller particles in it.</li>
            <li> While I felt this made applying the mask a little more difficult, the Dead Sea Mud Mask otherwise performed wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> I added this to my normal routine and to my surprise my blackheads on my nose large pores on my upper lip visibly diminished after just one use.  </li>
            <li> After I opened it the smell is very strong more than any mint in my used products and my face is painful after I used it.</li>
            <li> and it comes off very easy and is very non irritating.</li>
            <li> It also has a thick, soft, silky feel to it, which made it very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this mask feels amazing.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea mud facial mask is pretty easy to apply and wash off.</li>
            <li> I have only used it on my face so far, but it left it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> However, the price is really high for such a so-so product, so I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend using this</li>
            <li> This dead sea mud mask was easy to apply and surprisingly did not dry out my skin like past facial masks.</li>
            <li> Ok EVERYONE,  are you ready to hear about my experience with Pure &amp; Essential Mineral&#x27;s Dead Sea Facial Mask?????????????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works great as I have seen from other reviews but for me it just broke my face out bad.</li>
            <li> ..as long as the price is right, I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day, and may even increase it to twice a day, for about 15-20 minutes (or until it is completely dry) and when I remove it, my skin looks so fresh and revitalized.</li>
            <li> I found it easy to apply and not at all messy.</li>
            <li> It took mine about 15-20 mintues to fully dry but man was my outcome worth the wait.</li>
            <li> My skin also felt smoother and tighter but not dry, probably thanks to the shea butter, sunflower oil, and jojoba oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and dried well within 5-10 min.</li>
            <li> we used the pure dead sea mud mask for several nights, it really pulled those pores clean</li>
            <li> I love is that Pure And Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask it’s made with organic ingredients, they don’t test on animals and FDA approved!</li>
            <li> but if you have very dry skin this mask may dry you out more</li>
            <li> It took me whole day to calm skin down.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like the idea behind this product, but it possibly could&#x27;ve been formulated differently in order to be more aesthetically appealing.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to clean and exfoliate without making my skin even more oily or going the extreme opposite and creating those gross dry patches.</li>
            <li> My face felt cool and not gunked up like other products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not sure if this mask is as purifying as others I&#x27;ve loved (but are way more expensive), I do like it for the price.  </li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask spreads easily and evenly over your face, giving you complete control of where it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After several weeks of using the mask, my skin became much less oil and more balanced.</li>
            <li> Right before I get into the shower I wash my face and allow it to air dry.</li>
            <li> It went on very easily and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Proactiv, but it wasn&#x27;t working quick enough to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> The parts of my face that were healing from the rash that were left with dry scaly skin actually looked better and in some areas were gone altogether.  </li>
            <li> Love the idea, but did dry my face out a bit, so could only us it occasionally.</li>
            <li> Because of the constant acne and sensitive skin she has a hard time finding something for her face that doesn&#x27;t irritate it more!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before applying it I press a face cloth soaked in very hot water to my face - similar to how I prepare to shave with a razor - to open up pores.</li>
            <li> but  after i used the Pure and essential minerals</li>
            <li> : Pure is only the brand name, not a title.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Pure &amp; Essential Minerals</li>
            <li> I was asked to review Pure &amp; Essential Minerals-</li>
            <li> Pure &amp; Essential Minerals</li>
            <li> Pure &amp; Essential Minerals</li>
            <li> PURE &amp; Essential Minerals</li>
            <li> When I first put it on my face, it tingled quite a bit at first and that scared me a little.</li>
            <li> I received this PURE Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask via Brand Backer (Discloser: I am a blogger who received this for free to review).</li>
            <li> I am 28 and really struggle with adult acne, especially cystic acne along the chin and jawline.  </li>
            <li> I never seen my face so clear.</li>
            <li> It says to use once a week which I will follow.my face and neck feel so clean, but not dry or rough.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it on my blemishes over-night, but it didn&#x27;t clear them up.</li>
            <li> and it does clear up some acne.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face so soft and is really doing wonders on my giant pores.</li>
            <li> It helps to clear out impurities from pores and to tighten the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far (once a week for two weeks), but my face feels SO much softer after using it and</li>
            <li> It also helped reduce the size of my pours &amp; helped clear up my pimples.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing it and helping to clear it</li>
            <li> fifteen minute application completely removed all of my blackheads and left my skin tone really even.</li>
            <li> that it is already mixed and ready to go.</li>
            <li> also like that it has mostly natural ingredients and isn&#x27;t tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways if your skin is sensitive I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Offers Scrub Moisturizer and Cleanser System - Anti Aging Clay &amp; Mud</li>
            <li> Also keep in mind since its all natural...</li>
            <li> Leaves my faced soft, moist and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t affect performance as far as I&#x27;ve noticed</li>
            <li> Probably my skin is too sensitive</li>
            <li> Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised, considering it is a &amp;#34;Dead Sea&amp;#34; mud mask, but I had to admit that I was a little...taken aback...</li>
            <li> The only downside is it really burns.</li>
            <li> I like it, my face feels soft ----</li>
            <li> my face feels soft and cleaner.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin soft and feeling refreshed</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it cleansing, but I really feel like my skin tightens after this product.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel soft</li>
            <li> I like it so far, it does give a tingling or a bit of burning sensation.</li>
            <li> but my skin has never been so soft</li>
            <li> Its all natural</li>
            <li> Made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;(A natural aroma that let&#x27;s me know it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I like that the mask is all natural and it does leave my skin feeling softer and well circulated.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> i would not recommend people with naturally oily skin to use this product.</li>
            <li> had it on for 30sec before I had to wash it off, I guess my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> Not observe any change in my skin before and after using this item just not waste your money</li>
            <li> You can totally tell this stuff is REAL as it pulls and tingles ( a bit).</li>
            <li> but if someone wants to use it, that is an added extra bonus.</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tighter (30 years old no wrinkles) after I use it.</li>
            <li> but my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried proactive, prescription medicine, thousands of cleansers and washes, natural aloe oil cleansers and vitamin E cream, and nothing.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin so soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I enjoy this using the Dead Sea Mask.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> At this time, my oldest child was near tears saying her face was also burning.</li>
            <li> I have never used eucalyptus near my face,  so maybe?</li>
            <li> All opinions expressed are my own.e never used eucalyptus near my face,  so maybe?</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive skin and acne.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and rejuvenated after use.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is that the smell is very pungent.  </li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I was surprised by the almost burning sensation, seemingly caused by the eucalyptus plant.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> These minerals are also known to treat, detoxify, and cleanse our skin, to keep it us looking young and</li>
            <li> However, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> No, the smell really got to me and I am not a big fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> I realized this as a young adult i couldnt be like this for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> It also makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I got 10oz on eBay for $8 and it is completely identical to this 6oz jar.</li>
            <li> and it still turned my whole face red and broke out</li>
            <li> When using it, I suggest not putting the mask near the eye area because of the eucalyptus/menthol scent.</li>
            <li> I never felt my face to be so soft and look so radiant.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I could really feel the eucalyptus, especially in my eyes…</li>
            <li> do not waste your time and money for this product .</li>
            <li> Plus it has a soft botanical scent that makes you feel like your at a spa.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However with all that being said, I can&#x27;t say if it was product or the fact that my face was still sensitive and healing from the hell of a rash that I had.  </li>
            <li> I noticed automatically on how soft my face felt.</li>
            <li> did read online from some users that since this product is all natural it can spoil and it was advised to place in the fridge for longer shelf life.  </li>
            <li> I think my skin is too sensitive for this mud mask because when I put on the mask it burns for a bit.</li>
            <li> , I left it on for 15 minutes because I used a bit too much</li>
            <li> and I have seen a marked improvement in texture the of my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and refreshed feeling and I always feel my skin is nourished after I wash it off.</li>
            <li> My face felt cooled and comfortable, and the mask slowly dried in about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> but I just recently went through a very stressful time in my life</li>
            <li> These minerals detoxify and cleanse our skin, to keep it looking young and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is beneficial for anti-aging properties to tighten pores promoting young, healthy natural skin.  </li>
            <li> but, though my skin felt soft I still felt like I needed to add some moisture.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised at how well this mask makes my face feel and look.</li>
            <li> When I stick to this, my face clears up almost completely.</li>
            <li> DO NOT GET IT NEAR YOUR EYES.</li>
            <li> After that, use it regularly and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li> Also my face was SOFT.</li>
            <li> My skin is now silky and soft.</li>
            <li> ; and he felt it and said &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34; because even he realized how soft this mask was making my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I haven&#x27;t had that much time to tell if it is making a long-term difference.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Afterwards my skin is really soft - so if I continue to use it 1-2x a week</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic or immediate results thus far.</li>
            <li> Like it so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as oily, my skin feels firmer and my pores appear smaller with much fewer blackheads,  </li>
            <li> When you put it on you immediately feel this tingling sensation that lasts about 2-3 minutes after you smear it on (for some really really sensitive skin people it may differ).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> When you put it on it goes on smoothly and creates a tingling sensation for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This really does work (again, no miraculous results for me) and I definitely plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li> It really works especially on oily or combination skin like mine.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a natural mask that will clear out your pores, then this will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus its all natural, so the recommended weekly treatment is going to be apart of my routine.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is too sensitive?</li>
            <li> If your skin are sensitive, don&#x27;t try it.</li>
            <li> I felt my face again and it was REALLY soft.  </li>
            <li> It arrived the next day thanks to prime.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone with Highly Sensitive Skin -</li>
            <li> I can pronounce all of the ingredients which are natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used twice so far.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I started using it once a week, and am now using it twice a week.</li>
            <li> The beauty of this mask is that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face and it has absolutely improved the overall texture and appearance of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and did not have any reactions to it.</li>
            <li> I received the product a couple weeks ago, and have probably used the mask a minimum of four times so far.</li>
            <li> one of the natural ingredients is eucalyptus oil).</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin then you might want to avoid this product.</li>
            <li> and my skin did feel soft.</li>
            <li> It had completely evacuated every one of my pores and the angriest of my zits</li>
            <li> &amp; I really like that it is only a 5-10 minute mask</li>
            <li> ingredients are natural</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin either).</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel tingly and refreshed - when it has been removed, makes my skin feel soft and ultra-clean.</li>
            <li> Helps to get my dead skin cells off and makes skin smooth</li>
            <li> have adult acne</li>
            <li> I removed it with a soft wash cloth and warm/hot water.  </li>
            <li> I’m thirty eight years old and</li>
            <li> The benefits of this mask are a plethora of things including tightening pores, promoting young natural skin.</li>
            <li> Although I do not consider myself having a wrinkle problem at my age, I do believe you are never too young to moisturize and take care of your skin.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m a natural skeptic of everything</li>
            <li> the acne is almost all gone and my skin tone is even enough now that if I really didn&#x27;t want to I wouldn&#x27;t need to wear foundation...</li>
            <li> This mud mask leaves my skin feeling so supple and soft after washing it off.</li>
            <li> I immediately notice how soft my skin felt</li>
            <li> makes your skin incredibly soft and cleanses the pores</li>
            <li> It cleans all the impurities and leaves my skin so soft .</li>
            <li> But for the price, none have done nearly the job this has in the amount of time it has been used.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 15 minutes, and it really cleaned my pores.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> (I do not have particularly sensitive skin either).</li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive skin, then I recommend something else.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Mask leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask is really creamy and smooth, its not gritty at all.</li>
            <li> and it still feels relatively soft</li>
            <li> No face mask has ever made my skin this soft</li>
            <li> I love all products from Israel and especially those from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> Love my Dead Sea mud facial mask!</li>
            <li> I liked the overall result of this product, but there was a stinging sensation in the beginning, which disappeared a few minutes later.</li>
            <li> My acne is the kind that REALLY sucks because not only do I look like I have pepperoni on my face</li>
            <li> Again I love my Dead Sea facial products.</li>
            <li> This is another one of my favorite products, that I would stand behind and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But your will find your face kind of lose wet after a few times use.</li>
            <li> I just applied a thick coat all over my face and it feels better.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Mask is very easy to apply, not too dry or sandy.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Mask is very easy to apply, not too dry or sandy.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this pure brand dead sea mask for those that have large clogged up pores.</li>
            <li> I’ve used plenty of mud masks over the course of my life, and many had no strong odor, so there must be ways to get around the earthiness present in the mud.</li>
            <li> But, it does last a long time, makes my skin super silk like.</li>
            <li> And luckily, when it does hurt, the pain doesn&#x27;t last that long (although it may feel like it).</li>
            <li> If you do not completely LOVE it you can rest easy knowing that it comes with a complete refund for dissatisfaction.</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S SO CLEAN AND TIGHT WITH MY PORES</li>
            <li> I have used many other brands, and for the money this is something I will definitely be coming back to for my Mud Mask Skincare needs!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for me, as I mainly use it on my forehead, nose and cheeks, not on my jaw, chin, and neck (because I mainly just want to clean out those pores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But maybe other customers wouldn&#x27;t mind the intense smell as much as I did.</li>
            <li> Makes face feel refreshed after first use, and if there is a pimple this mask will reduce the size and dry it out.</li>
            <li> If that turns out to be true, that&#x27;ll be less than one dollar per mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn/irritate my eyes,although slightly feeling cool from the eucalyptus  oil.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less dry and more</li>
            <li> Almost all of the deep cleaning mask that I tried made my skin super dry and even break out.  </li>
            <li> It kind of stings when I apply it but not sure if it is a good thing or a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it knowing that it&#x27;s from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> I will add that during my most recent use (approximately week 3 or 4, cant&#x27; remember exactly)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mask draws out oils from your face so after removing the mask,  you will need to follow it up with a high quality moisturizer to complete your facial process.  </li>
            <li> I loved how it went on smoothly with no grit, common in other mud masks and removed with very little messiness.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this mask more than 5 stars, seriously</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea minerals clean, heal, soften and revitalize your skin for an all-day glow.  </li>
            <li> After I used the dead sea mask and an alcohol pad, my skin was clean.</li>
            <li> this was the second time experience with the mud mask, the first time I did the mistake of not mixing the mask properly before applying it on my face.</li>
            <li> It feels like Icy hot and peppermint extract - nowhere near &amp;#34;natural mud&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These essential minerals are already in our bodies, but we lose them as we get older.  </li>
            <li> This is actually the first store-bought facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> After using this mask my skin wasn&#x27;t as red as it usually is and my skin tone looks more even.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if my skin is actually looking better</li>
            <li> but if you can get past that it is very well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the closest i&#x27;ve seen to actual decent results.</li>
            <li> Way higher quality than more expensive brands with fillers.  </li>
            <li> Pure dead sea mud is dark in color, this is way too light, it is diluted with oils and is not thick like mud at all.</li>
            <li> It starts off very mineral,  progressing to slightly fishy, and finishes off pure lake mud.</li>
            <li> It starts off very mineral,  progressing to slightly fishy, and finishes off pure lake mud.</li>
            <li> It was really really strong and to smell it for 10 minutes was a little hard to deal with but the results make it all worth it!</li>
            <li> It was almost a little too strong as it left my eyes watering as well.  </li>
            <li> The second time I ordered it the mud was light in color and appeared to be watered down.</li>
            <li> It burns a little but it leaves the skin feeling moist and looking full</li>
            <li> The mud is very fine, not gritty, or overly thick.  </li>
            <li> The price is right for me though compared to other face masks I have looked into this was among the cheapest.</li>
            <li> Why is mud from the Dead Sea special?</li>
            <li> It went on smooth, almost like my typical facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Alas, it hasn&#x27;t transformed me overnight into a carbon copy of a 25-year-old Christie Brinkley; but I&#x27;m happy to report a slight improvement in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I did notice that after a few more uses, it did dry out my face a bit, which for me</li>
            <li> but in general she said I should use a mud face mask to help clear my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second was light green and watery and never dried.</li>
            <li> Have tried a few different mud masks and this definitely produced the better results.</li>
            <li> Normally that only happens with synthetic fragrances, so maybe there was something in it that I didn&#x27;t see in the list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> but honestly I would not purchase it as I have tried other masks in the past that have shown me results within this time frame.</li>
            <li> I used this Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask weekly and found my oily skin has lessened dramatically, my patches of dry skin have balanced, skin is more refined, hydrated, and it only took a weekly treatment of 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our faces felt smooth and tight and my pores looked noticeably smaller.</li>
            <li> I did get a bit sunburned while on vacation and the mask helped calm it down.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is super invigorating!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a little different than other masks I&#x27;ve used, but it was nice.</li>
            <li> I really like Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and not too hard to wash off your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other masks and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new that I could make part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling like new.</li>
            <li> Remember that when using a new product you won&#x27;t start seeing big differences until a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> We only live once</li>
            <li> She has problem skin and breakouts and this is really helping to dry those pimples up.</li>
            <li> My husband also uses it on his dry hands and it heals fast.</li>
            <li> After I washed it off, my face felt very refreshed, but it did dry out my skin a bit.  </li>
            <li> Also very moisturizing for dry skin....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions state to put on face avoiding eyes and let dry 10-15 minutes then under warn water rub gently in a circular motion for maximum exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for the 1st time last night and my skin is SO soft and completely clear.</li>
            <li> The second time I had a reaction around my eyes and the skin around them became very swollen and red.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful to not go near my eyes but even just having it on my nose really hurts my eyes.</li>
            <li> The dead sea mud facial mask is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I decided during the 10-15 minutes that I had the mask on, to google the net to see if anyone else had the same kerosene burn like sensation and realized that no, no, it really was just me and my face getting over the rash.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was pleasantly surprised that my face was not all red and irritated when I removed the mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its slightly grainy to exfoliate and after you take it off your face feels so fresh and moisturized even though its a mask.</li>
            <li> I might just have sensitive eyes, but I had to keep them closed (and no, I didn&#x27;t even have it very close to my eyes themselves...</li>
            <li> I received this dead sea mud facial mask that happened to come with a bonus FREE ebook for a consumer review.</li>
            <li> All my pores must be open and the mask readily went into the open pores, and burned my face!</li>
            <li> Organic Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask has a light scent.</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> texture is thick but can be smoothed onto your face easily and starts working immediately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick, but it evens out easily.</li>
            <li> Its thick and goes on easy.</li>
            <li> This mask dried on quickly on my face.</li>
            <li> I love this mask because it&#x27;s actually works on my skin and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First let me share a little more about Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> Your face should feel refreshed, smaller pores and very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have used once and it left my face feeling very soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> My face is combination--it has traditionally been very oily, although as I&#x27;ve aged, it has dry areas; my skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> It only lasts a minute or two and does no damage, but wow!</li>
            <li> Left my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I use this mask once a week and have been using for a month now (so 4 times) and I&#x27;ve seen a major improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft, but no long term effects.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite tingly when you first put it on, I&#x27;m guessing due to the eucalyptus oil.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricy and at the same time, you get what you pay for and It is well worth it!</li>
            <li> I used this when I had major sinus pain going on, as soon as I put the mask on</li>
            <li> I like that my skin felt firmer, softer, and not extremely shiny after use.</li>
            <li> I am a mask lover, and have tried my fair share of moisturizing masks, deep cleaning masks, masks to make your skin less dull, etc.  </li>
            <li> Application was easy, dried fast, and wasn&#x27;t overly messy during removal.</li>
            <li> Really rich texture, not too harsh, actually looks like mud, etc.</li>
            <li> Other than burning and turning my skin into scarlet red, I do not see any difference - normally mud masks cleanse your pores really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minty fresh burns a little</li>
            <li> It feels minty fresh on my face and since it stung a little it made me think it was working.</li>
            <li> the Dead Sea Mud Mask was my first mask!</li>
            <li> Imagine applying whipped cream cheese mixed with a small amount of fine sugar to your face – except everything tingles and smells like Eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li> Btw, I am a Black male, 22, with mild acne</li>
            <li> My skin was soft, felt clean, and glowed a bit; however that be due to my face just having been burned for 10 minutes due to this mud.</li>
            <li> So I contacted Pure &amp; Essential Minerals and they suggested mixing the mud properly before applying, also not to wash the face before applying because that will open the pores which may also give a burning sensation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to break out at least once a month and now my skin is pimple free.</li>
            <li> I can immediately see an improvement in my skin tone and skin&#x27;s general healthiness after using it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also this mask is a big size, you can use it to the whole face and it still can use for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not only is my face crystal clear</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like something scraped off of the bottom of a lake, which it is; but, I expected something more like the usual mud mask, which doesn&#x27;t stink.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now, and definitely enjoy it, but haven&#x27;t noticed any long term effects yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for my daughter who in her late 20&#x27;s has developed some constant acne problems.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product might linger on your skin for a while even after washing it off, so I usually put on a lightly scented moisturizer to remove what is left of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell of the product might linger on your skin for a while even after washing it off, so I usually put on a lightly scented moisturizer to remove what is left of the smell.    </li>
            <li> definitely  started to see clear, even skin, and after two weeks my skin is practically the clearest it&#x27;s ever been..</li>
            <li> My pores also looked smaller, so I feel like this could help to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after using this facial mask!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using the Dead Sea Mud Face Mask, it will definitely continue to be one of my daily regimes going forward.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I could actually notice a difference after just one use.</li>
            <li> The mask leave my face soft and moisturize, my mom actually asked how did my complexion look</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far.</li>
            <li> I barely used it once and within a couple of weeks it had mildew in it.  </li>
            <li> This mask clears up my pores where it is now barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft and by morning, I could see such a difference in my face.  </li>
            <li> I lasted barely the minimum 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is not rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> When I washed it out of my hair, didn’t use any shampoo or conditioner so it can stay in longer even though its out of my hair (something a salon told me to do) and in the morning I took a shower, and my hair was so soft, I couldn’t remember the last time I had that feeling, at the salon years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortable and eventually passes, but I think I will stick to more gentle treatments in the future.</li>
            <li> It left my skin soft and supple for days after I used the mark.  </li>
            <li> so far I only been using it for two weeks (twice a week)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but it left no irritation!</li>
            <li> BARELY VISIBLE.</li>
            <li> I just used this for my second time and my face feels sooo velvety soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this one time so far</li>
            <li> I have a 13 old daughter whose face is starting to break out</li>
            <li> and it doesnt leave them sensitive or red.</li>
            <li> The mask itself is much &amp;#34;soupier&amp;#34; than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only use once so far.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t notice any change in my wrinkles/lines or pores, but I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.  </li>
            <li> mask is designed to remove impurities and leave skin feeling a looking tighter and refreshed with a natural glow and almost instantly you can feel the tightening beginning.</li>
            <li> It left my face really soft.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for those with sensitive skin and acne problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a facial mask before since I have the break out outcome fears with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I only used it once so far</li>
            <li> For anyone looking for natural skin care, look no further.</li>
            <li> I recommend when washing it off, to just get the mask moist enough to exfoliate your face, using circular motions with your fingers before rinsing it completely off.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it out, I thought I had wide enough margins, but didn’t.</li>
            <li> The formula was great as it was thick enough to apply well but not too thick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest the first time I used the mask, I thought about washing it off just after a few minutes as I was afraid the mask was burning my skin, but I decided to leave it on for the whole 10 minutes as suggested</li>
            <li> Also, while I like that they use natural ingredients and that you get quite a bit of product for the price point, the mask did burn my eyes the first few minutes I had it in until it dries.</li>
            <li> nothing better, nothing worse.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; right away which I was a little bummed about.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because this mud has such a high concentration of minerals and organic essential oils that puts it on such a higher level than the other stuff we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This mask makes this hard process EXETREMELY easy where I don&#x27;t even need to use a facial steamer anymore!</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long ways, so it is worth the money!</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way and its definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li> After I removed it my skin was pink for a few minutes but quickly returned to my normal color.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it did not dry as you would assume traditional mud would.</li>
            <li> I liked the thinner texture of the mask as opposed to the traditional thick paste of other masks.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> I’ve used a few different types of masks, and what I really like about this one is that you don’t have to mix it with anything, it applies easily and doesn’t leave a gritty mess in your sink when you rinse it</li>
            <li> I also had severe skin reaction in few seconds right after I put this mask on my face.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not a fan of is that sting sensation I get when I first put it on and it lasts until I remove the product but other than this</li>
            <li> first time I used it, there was definitely a burning/hot sensation, probably due to the eucalyptus ingredient.</li>
            <li> I was so excited that I could hardly contain myself and counted the nights away till it came.  </li>
            <li> This mask feels AMAZING on the skin, granted a little disturbingly tingly at first</li>
            <li> mud worked amazingly well and cleared out a few deep blackheads that have been giving me extra trouble.  </li>
            <li> At first I was afraid that it might dry up my skin, but when I washed it off after the first use, my skin was clean and dewy.</li>
            <li> my teen has clogged up pores resulting in major blackheads!</li>
            <li> It is a all natural pure dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li> I used it that same night and the huge pimple I had on my cheek for the past two days wasn&#x27;t there the next morning.</li>
            <li> And it hard to clean</li>
            <li> It burned a little bit after a few minutes that got better.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little pink, but feel super soft.</li>
            <li> I also used my astringent (just a little witch hazel) and a quick extra rinse AFTER the mask to remove any extra remnants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in an extremely dry climate so</li>
            <li> Dermatologists recommend it once a week, but with my sensitive skin I usually only do a facial once a month.</li>
            <li> A pump or squeeze bottle that dispenses the product directly onto your hand without potentially contaminating the rest of the product still in the package would definitely be preferable.</li>
            <li> A pump or squeeze bottle that dispenses the product directly onto your hand without potentially contaminating the rest of the product still in the package would definitely be preferable.</li>
            <li> I probably will mix some moisturizing oil so that it does not dry my face.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced this soft and smooth feeling of my skin ever before.</li>
            <li> I have seen results of the mask working, has shrunk my pimples and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting a demo of a FAR more expensive mask at the mall, which appeared to erase the lines on the side of my face to which it was applied.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t quite as thick as most masks that I&#x27;ve used - so you have to be somewhat careful when applying it, so it doesn&#x27;t run all over the place.</li>
            <li> She said that the first time it when on her skin tingled a little but didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I broke out a little bit after my first use, but I felt like it pulled all of the oil and junk out of my pores.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll keep using it and​ report back with any major changes that we see.</li>
            <li> but first time I used, my skin hurt a little bit.</li>
            <li> It does burn a little at first when putting it on</li>
            <li> when I first put it on it was a little burning / tingly</li>
            <li> I received this at a highly discounted rate and it worked just as expected.</li>
            <li> It dried up very fast; I guess within 5/6 minutes.</li>
            <li> I felt a bit itchy at first when it dried out but after washing my face it does not dry the skin..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wet&amp; not a thick clay.</li>
            <li> This is the first Dead Sea Mud mask I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> am getting married in a few months</li>
            <li> and it stung for the first few minutes.</li>
            <li> The dead mask scared me at first.</li>
            <li> It really feels like it’s pulling out anything trapped in my pores without parching my skin, and after rinsing it off, I was left with a squeaky-clean feel that was fresh but not at all tight.</li>
            <li> I’m definitely going to be using this at least twice a month to ensure I clean out my pores.</li>
            <li> It provides a deep clean and is not too thick</li>
            <li> All in all, a real let down.</li>
            <li> was concerned if I was burning my face, it was very redden and chilled it down with (HD skincooler ice roller) ...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always use it, only because I can get lazy at night and don&#x27;t want to get up (9.5 months pregnant), but when I do, I notice a change in my skin the next morning.  </li>
            <li> The process is simple, just leave it on to dry for 10 minutes to allow full absorption of Dead Sea Minerals and extraction of any impurities.</li>
            <li> This is a good price compared with other similar products or an expensive trip to the spa.</li>
            <li> but it didnt leave it so dry and tight that I was scared to smile.</li>
            <li> Not &amp;#34; oh, it burns a little.&amp;#34; It shot right past that into your brain screaming &amp;#34;Get</li>
            <li> One really feels the tingling, it actually made her eyes water a little bit while my other daughter didn&#x27;t really experience a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend over any other Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of an unpleasant smell to it, but I’ve started using this weekly and don’t notice it much any more.  </li>
            <li> My skin was so soft after use, without feeling oily or dry.</li>
            <li> I can tolerate it with a body butter, as the skin on your body is usually less reactive to germ exposure than the skin on your face, but I get really squicked by face products that come in tubs.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really cleared my skin that I have noticed, because I still have the black heads on my skin.</li>
            <li> When you wash it off, it does leave your face amazingly soft without being overly dry like some masks.</li>
            <li> My face is less oily and so much softer and my blemishes have gone away.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply in a thin, even layer.</li>
            <li> When i placed it on there was a big burning sensation that happened for the first few minutes</li>
            <li> and I urge anyone interested in a mask to consider the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask.</li>
            <li> therefore it&#x27;s a must that I use a moisturizer of some sort exactly after I wash my face; however, this dead sea mud mask is the very opposite.  </li>
            <li> The Mask is a mixture between light brown and dark green in color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I much prefer to use Glamglow products on my face because I think they work better although they are very expensive</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned at first but, after a minute there was this big relief, a big cooling relief.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend even if you have a dry skin!!!  </li>
            <li> This pure dead sea mask has a very earthy smell to it, but the smell is very tame and did not bother me, even though I have a very sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> anyone looking for a natural high quality product that actually works, I can recommend the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask without reservation.</li>
            <li> It came of easy with no residue left behind in my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some really beneficial changes: my pores appear smaller and my skin is less oily in the days following the use of this mask.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells very mud like and vaguely surfuric, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I try to do full face about once a week, with every night or every other night, putting it on just the acne trouble zones.</li>
            <li> However, it does dry fairly quickly and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this mask to anybody, especially to people who have sensitive skin and are limited on products they can use.</li>

            <li> So far, very promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knock one star off only because the burning sensation was so strong, it was almost painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little concerned now about the comments that say it doesn&#x27;t have much of a shelf life and may mold.  </li>
            <li> Product is very watery and spilled a little in shipment.  </li>
            <li> I am reviewing my third purchase of PURE Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> PURE &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask...</li>
            <li> Mom Gives Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask</li>
            <li> Mom Gives Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask</li>
            <li> , I thought I was getting pure dead sea mud, guess I should have actually read the ingredients list.  </li>
            <li> After the third time I used it, it didn&#x27;t burn as much, just a little tingly sensation...</li>
            <li> recently had the pleasure of trying out the Dead Sea Mud Mask by Pure &amp; Essential minerals.</li>
            <li> Well I recently received my Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask on May 17th, 2014.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask is a bit different from the one I&#x27;m currently using and the ones I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> The Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask made it possible for me to pamper myself a bit and turn back the hands of time.</li>
            <li> this may smell bad but it works good.</li>
            <li> I guess with this mask you have to take the good with the bad.</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud Face Mask is different than other facial masks I&#x27;ve tried--my face didn&#x27;t feel as unpleasantly tight afterward as it does with most face masks.</li>
            <li> Moiturises my dry skin like not other</li>
            <li> This Pure Dead Sea mask stands far and above ANY other</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s made with Pure dead sea mud and other natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Redness I normally get was toned down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I just started using it so it is hard to tell how it works right now.</li>
            <li> When I say oily skin, I mean that skin where no makeup stays on for more than a few hours, every time you blot, the tissue becomes almost transparent, blackheads are a daily project, and you leave a smug on every phone you use.</li>
            <li> My skin felt much smoother and certainly less oily after even one use!</li>
            <li> My skin looks smoother with a healthy glow after only 3 weeks, little dark spots are little diminished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used original dead sea mud on my fave for many years but this product burned so badly</li>
            <li> and I always look forward to using it, plus I&#x27;m a sucker for anything minty so that drew me right in.</li>
            <li> Its a fantastic mask that I like using when taking a bubble bath after a long weak.</li>
            <li> After applying it takes only about 10 mins to dry completely, once dry</li>
            <li> There was a slight tingling and pulling as the mask dried, which I find typical of most masks.  </li>
            <li> This one is definitely a double duty beauty product that you need to try out when you are ready to splurge on a little something for yourself!</li>
            <li> I have to keep reminding myself to use it once a week due to my busy schedule.</li>
            <li> One time usage of this stuff, and seriously I looked younger, my tone was evened out, my skin was super soft, and my forehead wrinkles were less noticeable....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask!</li>
            <li> I worked in an initial layer and, once I had covered my face, went back to the slightly dry parts to apply a second layer.</li>
            <li> It has been at least 2 months since I have had it, there is no issues with the storing of it and the product has remained the same as when I first received it.  </li>
            <li> It washed off easily and with no real residue left behind.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical of putting mud on my face, but since trying this product my whole outlook has changed.</li>
            <li> any active, mature break</li>
            <li> When I washed off the mud and patted my skin dry, my pores felt tighter, but my face was not dry.</li>
            <li> Since you only use this product one time per week it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Hence we come to the subject of Dead Sea Mud or more correctly a Dead Sea Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little pricey - but worth it for the convenience and mess factor alone.</li>
            <li> After using water to wash it off, my skin looks not big diffence, maybe a little bit soft but feels like using daily moisturizing lotion not cleaning my pore or brighting my skin.</li>
            <li> My face wasn&#x27;t as red and my bigger pimples started to dry up and shrink.</li>
            <li> I have had the pure pleasure of trying a few of the dead sea products over the past few months and have really enjoyed them.</li>
            <li> OKKAY let me make that more dramatic by repeating it: I woke up to NOTICEABLY less RED SPOTS and the acne had SHRANK!  </li>
            <li> During the time that I started using this, my face has not broken out like it usually would and thus I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My one kid was unaffected,  my kid that also had a burning face had no lasting effects after about 20 mins.</li>
            <li> My one kid was unaffected,  my kid that also had a burning face had no lasting effects after about 20 mins.</li>
            <li> If you leave it on your skin for too long it will definitely hurt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately, the product itself doesn’t fall flat.</li>
            <li> This 6oz jar last long with the results you be getting.</li>
            <li> I have had acne issues for a long time and now in my mid twenties I still struggle with it from time to time.</li>
            <li> But it did not last long.</li>
            <li> The only MINOR con is the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly old, however 21 didn&#x27;t last forever either.</li>
            <li> This tub will last a long while as well.</li>
            <li> This jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It has this thick muddy feeling to it and also a real mud color!</li>
            <li> (but I did put it on pretty thick).  </li>
            <li> and you are left with soft, tight skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong but nothing serious.</li>
            <li> Probably in a year... it will last that long!</li>
            <li> I use this once a week along with an organic facial wash daily throughout the week (it says on this to not use with any other facial washes</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Face Mask over the weekend and have made facials my new thing.</li>
            <li> I realized this product is going to last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I left the mask on for about 20 minutes, letting it dry sitting out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Since it only takes 5-10 minutes to dry, I could get it done during nap time...</li>
            <li> Not my favorite product left my face feeling crusty and dirty</li>
            <li> It helps heal dry and oily skin, works on skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema and leaves you with a youthful looking complexion.</li>
            <li> /wouldn&#x27;t know how to use this properly, my sister told me that you&#x27;re supposed to remove it while it&#x27;s dry by just rubbing it in circles</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a moisturizer afterward and daily if your skin is dry.  </li>
            <li> I am a greasy italian so this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
            <li> It only takes about 10 minutes for the mask to dry.  </li>
            <li> They say that the natural silica found in the black mud hardens on the skin once you apply the mask.  </li>
            <li> My face has just about every type of skin possible – oily, dry, flaky, acne, blackheads, and blemishes.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Face Mask - Ancient Natural Facial Mask and Skin Care Treatment for Women, Men and Teens - Organic Mud Mask</li>
            <li> Be careful when you open the packaging as it is sealed from the outside and doesn&#x27;t have an additional removable seal on the side (I was expecting one, so I almost sloshed this out all over my bathroom).</li>
            <li> It is now the next day, and my face has a rough texture  red bumps all over my cheeks and burns if I  place coconut oil or Shea Butter on it.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Facial Masks contains organic and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My face feel soft and my pores get smaller after few uses.</li>
            <li> This mask literally sinks into my pores and pushes out all the blackheads - gross but essential.</li>
            <li> It washed off real nicely and left my skin feeling insanely refreshed.</li>
            <li> my pores are no so big and no new breakouts since I started using</li>
            <li> After the Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask dried up, I rinsed it off my face.</li>
            <li> some people had their entire face turned the red because they tried to bare with the burning feeling hoping that it would go away after few minutes</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and it did hurt a little bit, but not nearly as much as some of the masks I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Before, i was very worried because i have been suffering from a lot of blemishes including dark spots on my skin from my previous acne attack</li>
            <li> My pores feel really tight and clear.</li>
            <li> Putting this on has kept my skin tight and clear out my pores to prevent from breaking out.</li>
            <li> Parts of it has tiny blackheads, other parts tend to get blemishes, and the rest seems to only act up once in a while.</li>
            <li> My skin looked brighter, my pores looked smaller and the 2 big acne on my chin looked less inflamed and smaller.</li>
            <li> but It is to be expected due to all the natural ingredients in the formula.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using extra care to prevent discovery from my 4 other male roommates that I utilize a face mask I have been using this for about a month now.</li>
            <li> Most other masks that I have used in the past were hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised at how little of the product I had to use in order to do one face mask.  </li>
            <li> It felt a little weird when I first put it on but was fine after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the mud is neither too thin nor too thick and it is very easy to apply on my face.</li>
            <li> When I applied it for the first time it stung a little bit, but this dissipated as it dried.</li>
            <li> I have been addicted to GlamGlow, but was looking for something a little less expensive, and, so far so good!</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t really is that the mask comes in a tub, and it made it a little messy for me.</li>
            <li> BUT smells kind of bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally after a mud mask my skin sucks up as much moisturizer as I can give it.</li>
            <li> I am an 18 year old with oily/combination skin who is suffering from acne and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> So I switched to using dead sea mud mask because all the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> that takes a long time to fade being too close to my nose.</li>
            <li> I will review again in a couple of months to see if there are long term benefits.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen my skin look so refreshed in a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to remember to use once a week to determine the long time advantages.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve noticed any long-term results in terms of my complexion or anything, and I still break out normally.</li>
            <li> I guess my skin is to sensitive to it because a few seconds after i put it on it started to burn.</li>
            <li> Just be careful if it start to burn or makes your face red then stop using it.</li>
            <li> (I literally just sit back and relax, and let it set), and then you get it wet and wash it all off.</li>
            <li> It had been a long week and the thought of relaxing with a mud mask was wonderful!My niece Ashley</li>
            <li> Did you know that, the dead sea mud has been renowned for centuries as a natural beauty remedy?  </li>
            <li> skin felt so soft after I rinsed and dried my face.</li>
            <li> I think as long as one does not try it you cannot tell.</li>
            <li> My skin was stretched and softer.</li>
            <li> I am 73 years old and few products</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn or isn&#x27;t too heavy for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For centuries mud from the Dead Sea has been known as a natural beauty remedy.</li>
            <li> I tried the dead sea mud mask for the first time a few days ago.</li>
            <li> and although I don&#x27;t notice major results, I do notice that my skin feels softer and less oily on my forehead and nose.</li>
            <li> next morning however I woke up and the redness was noticeably less and the acne spots were smaller</li>
            <li> I take it off in the shower, because it makes a huge mess in the sink / counter and leaves lots of silt behind.  </li>
            <li> It also does not sting like some other brands when left on too long.  </li>
            <li> It did not take long to dry at all.</li>
            <li> was extremely clumpy, slimey and possibly moldy.</li>
            <li> Gave me FIVE cystic pimples + some other pimples after finally having my face clearer.</li>
            <li> Sometime my face feels greesy the next day with other products not with this one.  </li>
            <li> then any other mask has left him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I grew up I stopped playing with the little boys and started playing with the big boys known as &amp;#34;Spas&amp;#34; and never looked back.  </li>
            <li> The only problems I have with it is the results don&#x27;t last long, maybe a few hours tops.</li>
            <li> It left my face a little bit red and irritated, but it has eucalyptus in it and sometimes my skin doesn&#x27;t do well with that.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t say on the bottle how to store it, but all the other similar products I have used recommended to store in the fridge.</li>
            <li> She has used this twice in the last week after a extreme hormonal acne flare-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various peel-off masques and some other inexpensive masques that come in tubes but</li>
            <li> in all, this product is definitely a plus other than the packaging.</li>
            <li> All in all, this product is definitely a plus other than the packaging.</li>
            <li> After keeping the mask on my face for a minute, I already wanted to get it off as quickly as possible due to the burning and stinging sensation.</li>
            <li> but I know, based on other reviews, I wasn&#x27;t the only one who felt the burning and stinging sensation.</li>
            <li> Other face masks leave my face feeling painfully dry and sometimes red and burning.</li>
            <li> I have tried other mud masks before and they have ALWAYS left my face feeling Sahara dry to the point that it felt like it was going to crack.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin due to the combination of essential oils.</li>
            <li> I know other masks that I&#x27;ve used were difficult to remove, but this mask was easy to wash off, no muss, no fuss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After removing the mud, a very strange smell lingers.</li>
            <li> After removing the mud, a very strange smell lingers.</li>

            <li> But thought it would dry tighter on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product did not leave my skin to dry or oily.</li>
            <li> Just read the directions so you don&#x27;t over do it and dry or skin out.</li>
            <li> After 3 or so minutes the mask will dry.</li>
            <li> and it helps with my redness and dry spots.</li>
            <li> After applying I let it set for about 5 to 10 minutes which is all it took for it to dry thoroughly.</li>

            <li> However, I did use it and let it dry as I was arranging my closet.</li>
            <li> It did not over dry either.</li>
            <li> I allow it to dry for 10 minutes</li>
            <li> They are always so dry and cracking.</li>
            <li> Just apply and keep for 15 minutes for it dry up and then wash it.</li>
            <li> It took the mask about 15 minutes to fully dry.</li>
            <li> Your face gonna be too dry.</li>
            <li> The thing is, it didn&#x27;t dry me out, moisturized well.</li>
            <li> Helped with dry skinin winter months.</li>
            <li> Let it dry for about 20 minutes before washing it off, and then  apply your nighttime moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m waiting for it to dry out).</li>
            <li> I have typically dry skin.</li>
            <li> Even at my age I get oily skin at times and dry skin the rest of the time.  </li>
            <li> After fifteen minutes when it was dry</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t  dry skin out at all</li>
            <li> I just apply it, let it dry</li>
            <li> After waiting around 10 minutes for it to dry I washed it with lukewarm water.</li>
            <li> Dry out blemishes, not for people with combination skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin naturally dry, so I used a moisturizer after using the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Anyone with dry skin should use a moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> In only a few uses, I have seen an improvement in my overall skin tone/complexion.  </li>
            <li> but my husband works out side all year round and has always had problematic skin and uses facial masks and cleansers on a regular bases.</li>
            <li> You see, I have incredibly sensitive skin and using the wrong product can be an absolute disaster.</li>
            <li> I also expected it to be very gritty and rough, but it has a smoother texture to it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if consistency is an issue with this product but the first time I ordered it the mud was dark in color and thick in texture.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely felt softer, my pores were smaller and less noticeable, and my skin glowed!  </li>
            <li> I was also shock to see how very little mask spread out far on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick as well, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and using this mask roughly once a week to give my face just the extra boost of healing after a hard week.</li>
            <li> Actually, when I sat down and waited for the mask to dry up, the eucalyptus/menthol scent became soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> and when I wash it off it made my face red and in the following morning I had HUGE painful zits.</li>
            <li> This product has a small that does not seem natural.</li>
            <li> This is what I expect from a mud mask: thick, dense consistency that sits heavy on the face and dries really solid to the point that it’ll crack if you move your face too much.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a couple of times, but skin is clearing and dark marks seem to be lighter.  </li>
            <li> , I really do not like to wait long</li>
            <li> The mask was loose as water and didn&#x27;t want to stay on my face.</li>
            <li> the poeple in my life left, everyone who brought me down, ig ot rid of them.</li>
            <li> I brought it down on vacation with me earlier this month and my mother</li>
            <li> It gives deep down cleansing for blackheads and breakouts.</li>
            <li> This facial mask passes my test, hands down.</li>
            <li> The only other way I could describe it is, my face literally felt &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Next is a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> my face was very tingly and when I went to wash off the mask for a final rinse with cold water my face was kind of numb.</li>
            <li> This mask doesn&#x27;t dry out my face!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too!</li>
            <li> I will probably only use about once a week or less.</li>
            <li> I actually apply a small amount on before bed then wake up and wash with regular face wash.</li>
            <li> You will want to plan accordingly when using as it leaves a slight &amp;#34;after smell&amp;#34; that will go away with a proper shower.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I just couldn&#x27;t get past the scent enough to put this mask on my face, so I can&#x27;t actually comment on its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> After following the directions and putting it on, it gave the slight tingle and tightening that I look forward to with these types of masks.</li>
            <li> and I get acnes less likely than I used to before.</li>
            <li> However, it does not shrink the size of my pimple , but will slightly reduce the redness and help remove left over</li>
            <li> I could instantly feel the tingle and slight heat.</li>
            <li> Shortly after that it hardens slightly.</li>
            <li> While I’ve only done a couple applications, I can see a small difference in the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> There are both pros and cons for this Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask product, but I think in the long run, the pros outweigh the cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually appreciate the menthol and eucalyptus fragrance as that usually helps prevent my allergies from acting up.</li>
            <li> have no opinion of other benefits (anti-aging, less wrinkles, smoother skin) of yet as I have not use the product long enough.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry skin and have been looking for a mud mask for years.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid this would go the other way on me, in other words asking me if she needed  to do more with her skin treatments now.</li>
            <li> It was just pretty busy and hard month, so it is not perfect, but I am going to continue to use and will see if it actually helping to my skin or not.</li>
            <li> We applied a thin layer,  leaving large spaces for our eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I rinse it off, I could see that my pores were noticeably smaller, and if I look closely in the mirror, I actually saw that my black heads were much less visible!</li>
            <li> My skin was feeling cleaner and smoother; I also noticed that the size of the acne on my forehead was a little smaller.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a little bit below the eyebrows and wiped it off, but I guess it was enough to still cause that reaction.  </li>
            <li> I was the little guy in the back of the room, who shied away from the world.</li>
            <li> I left it on a little longer.</li>
            <li> Some customers have stated the smell is a little over-bearing, but actually I thought it had somewhat of a mint flavor.</li>
            <li> That turned me off a little, so in the future I might use a mini spatula to help me out with application.</li>
            <li> You only need a little not.</li>
            <li> It can be tough weeding through them, however, because there is literally so much stuff on the market today.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m left a little curious as to why there is no consistency.</li>
            <li> It does not make my skin dry at all like other mud mask.</li>
            <li> I have other mud masks that just dry up and do nothing.</li>
            <li> I didn’t know what to expect with the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask but the application itself actually feels a little luxurious and the results are awesome!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find I use much less of this mud than others I have purchased, so a container of this will last you a lot longer than other types.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it’s a huge disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> I was really excepting it to look like dirty old mud.  </li>
            <li> but this one is most expensive and not effective</li>
            <li> I would be careful because it also burns your eyes a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> After the recommended 10 minutes I took it off with a wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li> It was easier than I expected to remove.</li>
            <li> I have just recently gotten into beauty products and a beauty routine and have heard a lot about mud from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> This product dried out my skin like I didn&#x27;t know possible.  </li>
            <li> but it did not do what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I even ordered the dead sea mud soap so I can lather my entire body in this stuff!</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> The packaging is a wide mouth container which is my preference over tubes.  </li>
            <li> My face has not become dried out to the point of having to put on a facial lotion.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still not ready to rave about it quite yet.  </li>
            <li> only a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is like actually bathing int the dead sea.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Dead Sea Mud products.</li>
            <li> so I need to be careful of what I put on my face.</li>
            <li> With the Dead Sea Mud Mask, there’s only 1 application once a week and</li>
            <li> Be careful with your hairline.</li>
            <li> It is harder to wash it from hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it dried out my skin and made it red afterwards.</li>
            <li> it turned my face red and dried up.  </li>
            <li> The Dead Sea mud facial mask.</li>
            <li> my few friend has the same problem</li>
            <li> As a teen girl she has her battle with acne, but ever since she added doing dead sea mineral masks to her skin regimen</li>
            <li> (I have not kept up with any of my facial routines in a few months).</li>
            <li> Partially genetics, partially life choices/diet.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s icy</li>
            <li> If the next jar I buy is the same poor quality as this current jar, I will not buy it anymore.    </li>
            <li> Until then I had never really used them.</li>
            <li> This step allows the mask to extract toxins and impurities located deep in the skin layers, and also to attach to dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> Just dab some on the brush head and work into wet skin for a minute or two.</li>
            <li> I immediately saw improvements in my skin after only using it once a week for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I expected</li>
            <li> B00C8YCFU4 Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask]]!  </li>
            <li> When I put it on it immanently started to burn the skin on my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> my scars/blackheads are clearing up faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued enough, in any case, to go home and research Dead Sea products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at that age when I&#x27;m going to start being curious about magic-potion wrinkle fixes.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the mask for a few days and it seems to do what I expected it to.</li>
            <li> I only tired it on my hand so far</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers with psoriasis, I have heard about the benefits of Dead Sea salt for many years and have wanted to try it on my skin to see if it would truly help lessen the appearance and inflammation of my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> and I applied it thick enough to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> smells super bad but thats normal for dead sea mud smell .</li>
            <li> My skin used to be oily but suddenly since the past 6 months it has become extremely dry and pale.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a daily cleanser I usually use for my face that leaves it dry whenever I rinse my face</li>
            <li> Which can only mean I will eventually have less ingrown blemishes that cause my african american skin, less discolorations after that.</li>
            <li> It is not strong on the face only some might find it because it has a minty feel to the skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin clean and seems to get all the bad oils and such out of my pores.</li>
            <li> Once it dries, it will flake, so be careful if you are doing other things around the house as you wait for this to set.</li>
            <li> afterwards my face felt hot; wasn&#x27;t overly unpleasant just not expected.</li>
            <li> Some cleansers and masks clean dirt on the surface and once you use an alcohol pad your skin is still dirty.</li>
            <li> and my face feels smoother and less dry.</li>
            <li> Anyways, it burns a little when it&#x27;s on, and leaves my face red for about a half hour afterwards.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It burns a lot when you apply it, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have found a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless when Pure &amp; Essential Minerals contacted everything Beauty and Beyond to review their Dead Sea Mud Mask, I was game!</li>
            <li> little bit pink, but no lasting harsh damage.</li>
            <li> Very little is needed when applying to your face and the product COULD last for months, instead,</li>
            <li> Since I recently had a baby and get very little sleep, I can see the effect it has on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have the most annoying skin type  - oily T zone with dry spots eveywhere else.</li>
            <li> There is a distinct tingly, slightly stinging sensation once I applied it, but it wasn&#x27;t too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and it did not leave it feeling dry or tight.</li>
            <li> There was no itching or burning like some other face masks I have tried.</li>
            <li> It actually took some of the sting out of a small sunburn I&#x27;ve been nursing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Giving this a four since I haven&#x27;t tried any other mud masks.  </li>
            <li> been using different products but never satisfied with the result</li>
            <li> Unlike other mud masks I&#x27;ve tried, this one made my eyes water when applying.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product, but not with any other &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> My blackheads and other acne was gone and my skin looked even.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is one thing that I was not aware of it when i purchased it.  </li>
            <li> Once you put it on, it  does sting a little bit and the face gets a little bit red.</li>
            <li> Ok, I  am so, so disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I am going to experiment with their other products as well.</li>
            <li> The mud is sorced from Israel and Jordan but the product is assembled here in the USA with the other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask 4 times, the last two times it had small  pieces of grit in it.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> /&gt;Getting past the packaging, the next thing I was confronted with was the smell.</li>
            <li> I was glad to try it, just disappointed that I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I did what other told me i couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> This stuff works extremely well</li>
            <li> but this is extremely overpriced.  </li>
            <li> I am not willing to get chemicals</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Dead Sea Mud products, I have tried all sorts of things from all sorts of companies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the mask several times over the past month</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this product at first.  </li>
            <li> Forget about the 3 step program from those other competitors.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s pretty weird for someoneyo find a mask in the fridge</li>
            <li> but I believe it was just the eucalyptus and other minerals drawing out the impurities out of my skin.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, it kinda tingled and had this burn sensation after you applied it on your face</li>
            <li> The other day I said to my boyfriend &amp;#34;feel</li>
            <li> I have used it in conjunction with other serums and scrubs</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a completely different color and consistency than what I&#x27;ve gotten in the past.</li>
            <li> This mask exceeds all other masks out there.</li>
            <li> It does smell a bit sulfuric, as some of the other reviews said, but it made my pores and skin</li>
            <li> then, I decided to go on youtube and look at what other people are saying about it.</li>
            <li> I have not had a breakout since I was in my teens  and have even used other mud masks with no issues</li>
            <li> I am really not sure what to think of this just yet as I have only used it once.</li>
            <li> I did as instructed, and after a long day at work (followed by a round at the gym)</li>
            <li> Other masks I have used involve measuring, mixing..</li>
            <li> I need my time that also allows me to do other stuff as well.  </li>
            <li> I just did the daily usual of applying a toner and hydrating lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, both odors aren&#x27;t too extreme</li>
            <li> After rinsing off the mask, you dont feel any of the left over residue you usually get with products with lots of additives.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this stuff wouldn&#x27;t last long, boy was I wrong, this is enough product for me to use twice a week for the next few months.</li>
            <li> --I think it&#x27;s due to coming from an organic ocean source.</li>
            <li> but I read other reviews  </li>
            <li> one cheek seems little irrated and dry..</li>
            <li> The mask is only a little uneven going on.</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful about what I use on it</li>
            <li> My skin was so dry and dead looking.</li>
            <li> After washing it and using my Clarisonic, I pat my face dry and applied the Dead Sea Mud Mask.  </li>
            <li> I put a bit of the Dead Sea Mud Mask on my chin, let it dry and wash it off and the pimple never materializes.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft&amp;smooth and exfoliates my dry skin without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> and then I wet my face slightly and massage in circular momentum over my face.</li>
            <li> The effects of the Dead Sea mud mask on your skin truly is beneficial to dry skin!So</li>
            <li> I would say probably less than half is actual dead sea mud.</li>
            <li> it was super cold and after about a minute my skin started to have a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> The mask will firm up and dry after about 10 mins.  </li>
            <li> The mask dried to a dark green color and wasn&#x27;t concrete hard.  </li>
            <li> Weirdly enough, I checked out my skin beforehand and did not see the little black hairs around my jaw line and neck ( that started few years before I turned 40)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I ran out of the other facial mask and it&#x27;s hard to get.</li>
            <li> The effects of the Dead Sea mud mask on your skin truly is beneficial to dry skin!</li>
            <li> minus the little burn ofcourse..</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned it burns your skin, but I waited 5 minutes since some products are supposed to be slightly burning.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first</li>
            <li> As for price it is a little up there but considering a small amount goes along way and that I only use it twice a week</li>
            <li> As for price it is a little up there but considering a small amount goes along way and that I only use it twice a week</li>
            <li> The only thing that was a bit hard was the smell.</li>
            <li> it not really that big of a mess!!!</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it is a tad too watery in texture.</li>
            <li> It is truly a much recommended Moisturizer and Cleanser System for the skeptical at heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like a dark gel.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> go&amp;#34; because of the dark color of the mask.</li>
            <li> I was definitely shocked initially at the burning/hot  sensation when I first used it.  </li>
            <li> so i made feed back late</li>
            <li> It helped brighten my skin and fade some dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Dead Sea Mud Masks in the past.  </li>
            <li> do not like applying dark color stuff on my face</li>
            <li> Sadly, it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> The only negative about this mask is its smell.</li>
            <li> After using the Dead Sea Mud Mask, I no longer have rough skin and clogged pores any longer.  </li>
            <li> I cannot wait to see the effect it has on my eczema down the road.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but then it calms down.</li>
            <li> and this mask seems to keep my monthly, cystic breakouts down.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this mask and recommend it to other users!</li>
            <li> [minus for the greasy feeling and the Vicks scent!!]</li>
            <li> About eight minutes later it was all dried, and I washed it off using my konjac sponge in small circles for a little exfoliation on my face and throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My pores are closed and tight, My husband says I have a glow!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask to my worse enemy!  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it burns/stings really bad the first few minutes</li>
            <li> I do not normally have any known allergies, so I&#x27;m not sure what in this was the cause.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use and washes off very easily, not like some other mud masks I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> My skin was noticeably softer and less oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might would break me out the next day since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so you may want to leave it on for less time.</li>
            <li> To me it had a slight eucalyptus smell.but my sister(who uses it too)Says</li>
            <li> I can only imagine this product for someone who has some seriously oily skin...</li>
            <li> I put it on after I showered and it burned slightly.</li>
            <li> it does have a slight burning effect if you do.</li>
            <li> slight alkaline burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps cleans my pores and make it less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is probably a one time situation, but it is weird enough that I will try another mask next time.</li>
            <li> I could even feel it working by the slight tingling</li>
            <li> The pores looked cleaner and the skin just slightly tighter.</li>
            <li> You feel a slight burning sensation temporarily though</li>
            <li> The Eucalyptus Oil gave me a slight tingling sensation, however, it did not irritate my skin or cause redness.</li>
            <li> Wearing the mask you do feel a slight tingle</li>
            <li> Does have a slight smell like sulfur.</li>
            <li> I had a couple of black heads pop up after using it, but I don&#x27;t know if it was from this or from something else.</li>
            <li> I am used to it now and like the slight burn and tingle.</li>
            <li> Even though the ingredients are so natural and no harsh chemicals in it, which I like, I just feel so painful to use it every time.  </li>
            <li> and I notice slight improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I typically use the mask twice a week, unless there&#x27;s a breakout, then up to  four times a week.</li>
            <li> had shrunk in half.</li>
            <li> It feels slightly mentholated while it&#x27;s on your face -</li>
            <li> A little cold irritating, but used up very comfortable</li>
            <li> The only negative, can get a little messy when removing.</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong and bad that heavy headache is guaranteed!</li>
            <li> Although we all don&#x27;t have the same skin type, that&#x27;s not fair to write that people are lieing on the 5stars.</li>
            <li> and this one just goes on pretty cold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using once a week but twice just because my skin is to oily and when I&#x27;m cicling my face is a mess</li>
            <li> When you first put it on, it makes your face feel cold and tingly.</li>
            <li> The color was a dark green.  </li>
            <li> It was a mess when you wash your face.</li>
            <li> I just started noticing that my skin isn&#x27;t as tight on my face as it was a cpl years ago.</li>
            <li> It feel tight and I can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> and I did feel a slight burning sensation for a few seconds and</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical about the product because there were some negative reviews on the storing and keep of this product.  </li>
            <li> At first I was taken by surprise as the Dead Sea Mud Mask felt really cold</li>
            <li> The ones I found were either too expensive or full of unhealthy ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Since I have been using the Dead Sea Mud Mask,  my flare-ups have been under control and a lot less.</li>
            <li> I received a code from Snagshout to purchase the product for a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;Little info about the product: it is a mud green color, it is slightly runny, and goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We live in an area that is always so cold which leaves our skin very dry but this mask helps a lot because it cleanses our face while moisturizing it</li>
            <li> mask felt a little less harsh than some others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer said, it is a little soupy, but</li>
            <li> When its on my face stings a little on my T zone</li>
            <li> It does have a little sea smell to it</li>
            <li> To me, it felt a little milder while it was drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> /&gt;However i dot still have redness on my face and a little but of pimples</li>
            <li> It did sting a little bit</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s used other masks in the past and this is a lot thinner and easier to apply than some of those others.</li>
            <li> Just a little itchy</li>
            <li> I want to talk a little bit about haters...</li>
            <li> I had little voice in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scrub is a little abrasive</li>
            <li> It feels a little tingly which makes me think that it is working.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; but its not unbearable.</li>
            <li> It does have a little smell to it</li>
            <li> As a little girl I use to play with the boys and make mud pies.  </li>
            <li> I see a little difference with the dryness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I keep my jar in the refrigerator because I have talked to other people that have tried this product in the past and they have said it can develop mold.</li>
            <li> I started using it for a little while.  </li>
            <li> You can literally feel the mask working, and I can attest that my skin was smoother and had a little glow after just one use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It hurts a little bit when I start to apply on my face, but soon it will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I feel a little tingle..</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> It does sting a little tho.</li>
            <li> I  have used it for a little over a week now and could not be happier with the results.  </li>
            <li> smells little muddy though for couple hours.</li>
            <li> It burns a little</li>
            <li> (I also didn&#x27;t experience excessive dryness or pulling of skin that I&#x27;ve found with other mask formulas).</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical about this Dead Sea mud mask, but I realllllly needed a new face mask.</li>
            <li> This product is not cheap and was a waste since I had to throw the remaining half of the jar</li>
            <li> one thing I really dislike about it is that it is very difficult to rinse off compared to my other masks, and it has a tendency to leave spots, chunks in my bathtub or sink after I&#x27;ve rinsed it off and drained any water.</li>
            <li> the mask dried and I washed it off, my skin felt a little tighter.</li>
            <li> but  I used it twice ,  and it dried my face a little in the chin area.</li>
            <li> A hands down 5star mud mask !</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my cousin who suffers from acne for a whole year.</li>
            <li> and I break out worse now than I did as a teen</li>
            <li> also I had a few spots were my acne hurt and as soon as I felt the mask start drying</li>
            <li> I ordered this Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the mystique of being from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; after a Dead Sea mud mask.</li>
            <li> I went to the Dead Sea,  Jordan side, in June.  </li>
            <li> Dead Sea mask I bought</li>
            <li> I applied a medium layer as instructed and waited until it dried off and washed my face.</li>
            <li> Dead sea mud mask</li>
            <li> You feel the tightening affects within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> The Dead Sea mask came and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> This stuff got rid of all dead skin.</li>
            <li> i think the dead sea mask is so great!when</li>
            <li> My skin smells as if I was just in the mud of the Dead Sea after I use this mask</li>
            <li> The only downside was a faint lingering smell of mud (to be expected) which went away within a few minutes of washing off the mask.</li>
            <li> a few days I noticed my brown spots were brighter.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Dead Sea mud</li>
            <li> It is dust that is heavily alkaline.</li>
            <li> I tried this mask because I am a lover of face masks and anything dead sea.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are : dead sea mud, organic Shea Butter,  organic sunflower oil.</li>
            <li> Oh, and, of course, dead sea mud.</li>
            <li> Oh, and, of course, dead sea mud.</li>
            <li> With a thin layer, I can actually rub it off like it said in the instruction.</li>
            <li> It did burn my face when I used it, but just for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I got this mask a few weeks ago and have been continuously using it every week since.</li>
            <li> Had a for a few weeks</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea is 1400 feet below sea level and the lowest pint on the earth´s surface.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There Dead Sea Mud contains over 21 skin-reviving minerals including magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.</li>
            <li> are the benefits of using the Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> I wish I could use it everyday.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes it goes away.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s messy when you wash it off.</li>
            <li> This dead sea mask that is already all made for you, all you need to do is apply.</li>
            <li> so you get tons of uses for your face or few with your hair.</li>
            <li> For now, I will be ordering dead sea mud to my home.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask is infused with twenty-one minerals like magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.</li>
            <li> I am firm believer that everyone passed the age of 25</li>
            <li> Like I said, I am no newbie to Dead Sea Mud products, so</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask was soothing to my face.</li>
            <li> Dead sea minerals are known to treat, detoxify, and cleanse our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask contains:</li>
            <li> To get to the point, the Dead Sea Mud Mask “DELIVERS”.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using a mask bush for application as using fingers can get quite messy.</li>
            <li> Then I applied a thin layer on my face and left it there for 30 mins.</li>
            <li> It felt nice on, and didn&#x27;t smell awful like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff almost everyday.</li>
            <li> bear in mind that any Dead Sea product must be groundtruthed as these are minerals exploited from occupied Palestine.</li>
            <li> hope the Dead Sea Mud Mask can reduce my acens..</li>
            <li> but if you have extremely sensitive skin this may be uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> So I washed it off and placed my green tea oil and moisturizer to combat the burning feeling.</li>
            <li> I dont have acne prone skin, just a few pimples here</li>
            <li> Since the mud is a bit messy to rinse off, I recommend applying and cleansing the mask from your face in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have used dead mud mask for about 2 months now</li>
            <li> We use this Dead Sea Mud Mask in our upscale SPA for mud wrap treatments.</li>
            <li> so when I was given the opportunity to test this dead sea mud mask for quality, I was elated.  </li>
            <li> I have oily face and this dead sea mud mask</li>
            <li> I am infatuated with any product that has dead sea minerals.</li>
            <li> It just works so well at removing dried, dead skin that I cant control myself.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud is an experience to use.</li>
            <li> This time, because my face was so broken out, I left it on</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it every few days and works well.</li>
            <li> I got addicted to facial masks about a year ago.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how this was going to work for me and my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have overly oily skin that breaks out randomly and frequently.  </li>
            <li> After that I began to notice a green layer of what seems like mold building up on the surface of the mud in the container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the mask a few times now</li>
            <li> It is really messy.</li>
            <li> and I broke out within a few hours of putting it on my face.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud, Organic Shea Butter, Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Aloe Vera Juice, Organic Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Jojoua  Oil, Hickory Bark Extract, Organic Calendula Oil, Filtered Water, Xanthan Gum, Eucalyptus Oil</li>
            <li> but you do get a underlying ocean-mineral smell that made me know this product is from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> After a few months of useage I do not notice any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I received my dead sea mud mask.</li>
            <li> But the smell of the product smells like a dead corpse (maybe because its from the dead sea).</li>
            <li> You only need to put a thin layer on your face.</li>
            <li> Boy have I been missing out.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud can heal, soften and revitalize your skin for an all day glow.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for some way to even out my skin, if even for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for dead sea face masks</li>
            <li> This mud mask is about as close as you can get  to scooping the mud from the dead sea yourself.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wish I could use it everyday...</li>
            <li> I tried out this product a few days ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few days</li>
            <li> , my face felt slightly softer after the 1st use!</li>
            <li> How are you going to advertise something are &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; Dead Sea mud when it&#x27;s got at least 8 other ingredients in it?</li>
            <li> I like that its not runny or chunky or clay thick like some other mud masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I needed for my breakouts and dry, dull skin!</li>
            <li> I am getting married in two weeks and unfortunately my skin has broken out.</li>
            <li> It has a very odd smell, but is not strong.</li>
            <li> I had to hop in the shower to take it off though because I started to make a mess around the sink!</li>
            <li> But after I got a pretty bad episode of acne I seized upon my sister&#x27;s advice and purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first time I used it, it was kinda painful</li>
            <li> It tingles at first, nothing painful.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my skin was clearly glowing, and my dull, pasty skin, was no more!!!</li>
            <li> noticed that it exfoliates my skin without making it seem raw.</li>
            <li> just recently had a bad hormonal breakout and my face is plagued with red dots and clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a thick, heavy product, and messy, so I&#x27;d suggest having something spread out ahead of time to catch any flakes as it dries.</li>
            <li> Just a little note, this mask dries hard, so if you are going to be laughing a lot when wearing this mask, please be cautious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still get a little negative reaction here and there on small spots</li>
            <li> Not in a bad way just a VERY tingly way.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the heat froms hipping or what</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid for organic creams in small jars and tubes.</li>
            <li> When put it on my face, I feel pain, not sure why.</li>
            <li> As it dried the sting slowly went away.</li>
            <li> I noticed on here that people say it has a weird or gross smell, but I didn&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> have looked over the ingredients,  and I  am  still not sure what caused this reaction.</li>
            <li> , I am not sure.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure how to explain it</li>
            <li> But, the sensation did slowly subsided as it dried and by the time I rinsed it off, I could see that there was no skin irritation at all...</li>
            <li> The combination of the 3 caused my skin to break out in areas it doesn&#x27;t usually.</li>
            <li> I received a jar of the Dead Sea Mud Mask to review!  </li>
            <li> I’m not sure if you’re supposed to do that</li>
            <li> No oil slick or grease face as some products tend to do to my type of skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for the past three weeks</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely feel a tingle while the mud is in place and drying, but it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable - just noticeable.</li>
            <li> Usually, I leave it on for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Mud mask are usually my preference.</li>
            <li> and I thought this thing was expired :/  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just not able to leave it on my face for the recommended time.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not sure if this was just an allergy for me or what</li>
            <li> As it dries you notice that it starts to tingle a small amount.</li>
            <li> It did have a small earthy scent but nothing stinky.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned my face as usual and then applied the mask.</li>
            <li> not sure if it is from animal fat or not.</li>
            <li> Well let me tell you about the dead sea mud mask!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what was going on</li>
            <li> I have tried others that were stiff and hard to put on.  </li>
            <li> thin layer is all you need and after using it once a week my for a few weeks, I noticed that my skin is smoother with less blemishes.</li>
            <li> but it is very messy.</li>
            <li> The other day, I got home from work and applied a thin coat to my severely affected areas.</li>
            <li> I suggest real dead sea mud without added ingredients, it is much better for your skin than this crap!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind bad smell, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin with psoriasis around my nose which got worse with a pinkish  scar that was noticeable and embarrassing .</li>
            <li> I still am broken out but the swelling and redness went down.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the jar,the mask looks like thick black jelly!!</li>
            <li> and I was literally shocked at how soft it was!</li>
            <li> AND my jar looks like I hardly touched it.  </li>
            <li> When it was time to wash it all off, I didn&#x27;t have a hard time.</li>
            <li> Hard to get off</li>
            <li> Gets hard on the face so you can tell when it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This means I am somewhat disappointed when I look in the mirror and my skin is dull, lifeless, and looking older than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Then I use a moisturizer that is scented to dull that odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to explain.</li>
            <li> and it is actually hard to say if it help a lot or not.</li>
            <li> Hard to say...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mud masks before and this one seems a little thin.  </li>
            <li> the smell wasn&#x27;t bad, but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> complaint?  </li>
            <li> As a stay at home mom, I like to pamper myself at least once a week.</li>
            <li> would definitely purchase the mask again, it delivered results without any drying or artificial additives.</li>
            <li> I bought this last year because once I decided 2 try products without chemicals on face, my face decided to break out like crazy.</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a week</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> Definitely avoid the thin skin around your eyes and be careful if you have any painful blemishes.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of money on products that gave me either no effects or bad reactions in the end, which only made me feel like my money was wasted once again.</li>
            <li> However to late now, eh!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> For some reason the steam help to work the mud into your pores, or at least that was how I felt.</li>
            <li> I try to at least do the mask twice a month.</li>
            <li> and I worried that I would react negatively using this</li>
            <li> A must have or at least a must try.</li>
            <li> I logged on to amazon to read the negative reviews to see what they were complaining about - and no surprise</li>
            <li> and then all of the dirty pores are turned blue</li>
            <li> Lately I have been feeling like my skin is blah.</li>
            <li> My sink drains much slower after each use too, which is annoying to fix after trying to unwind after a spa-like relaxing experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a THICK creamy texture, no girty or oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> I also noticed a change in poor size and acne after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and stays in place.  </li>
            <li> If you like your masks thick, you may to use a couple dabs per area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mud has a thick jelly like consistency.</li>
            <li> This mask is thick and yes it does look like mud.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> put the mask on thickly, and avoid talking or moving my mouth, so that the mask won&#x27;t settle in any lines.</li>
            <li> I should warn you that there is a slight unpleasant smell; it isn’t too bad and it is well worth using anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well but smells pretty bad!</li>
            <li> I mean it is part mud</li>
            <li> and i guess that could mean that it is working.</li>
            <li> I mean there was an over abundance of mint, or eucalyptus or something.</li>
            <li> (if you know what I mean)</li>
            <li> I just received another jar of this product, and just like the last time, the consistency is terrible and the quality is very poor compared to when I first started buying it.</li>
            <li> I mean seriously.</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud Mask really helped to get those nasty suckers out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well as at sucking the dirty stuff from my skin without leaving it too dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of products from the less expensive to pricy</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me almost two weeks before I could use this because I ended up breaking out in a serious rash on my face from allergies to the point that my skin was cracked and bleeding.  </li>
            <li> But usually the first time is the worst.</li>
            <li> After a 15 minute mask, I had 3 blackheads come up to the surface that had been previously stubborn and unable to extract.</li>
            <li> It stings and smells a little weird.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t that bad and you only apply it to your face/neck for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> the package arrived I was quite shocked on how big the jar was.  </li>
            <li> I was actually quite shocked out my head.</li>
            <li> It becomes flaky red and painful on my forehead and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My skin was red, painful, and irritated.</li>
            <li> Applying the mud mask to my face left it with an incredibly painful stingy feeling to it.</li>
            <li> It was naive of me not to read the ingredient list and not to spot check first, but I figured &amp;#34;it&#x27;s mud, what&#x27;s the worst it could do.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> but it left me with nasty dry patchy skin as it healed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the mask hardened, I didn&#x27;t experience any uncomfortable itchiness or excessive tightening.</li>
            <li> Also, it leaves your face smelling pretty awful afterwards.</li>
            <li> its alright, because i do have a reputation of being a dumb *</li>
            <li> /&gt;First things first, the mask smells horrific.</li>
            <li> But then again my nose is very delicate with scents.</li>
            <li> After that, I apply a thin layer on before I start my day (almost as if I&#x27;m applying make-up).</li>
            <li> It leaves a minty sensation that others may find to be cooling, but I find to be irritating.</li>
            <li> Water made it WORSE.  </li>
            <li> I  found that water,  no matter the temp, made it worse,  as did Aloe Vera gel.</li>
            <li> It has also decreased the size of my pores.  </li>
            <li> So you know you are not adding anything unhealthy to your body.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the tinkling feeling when I apply it to my face, and the moisture it leaves behind...</li>
            <li> I thought something was wrong, but the feeling slowly subsided and when I rinsed it off, there was no skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> But then again who would actually put that crap on their face if it looked like the type of mud that kids played in after it rained and cars drive through after a snowstorm?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> and hey don’t use any harsh chemicals or artificial additives</li>
            <li> This mask is thick and a bit scary looking once it gets on your face</li>
            <li> non irritating for us....</li>
            <li> BUT once I opened it and applied a thin layer to my face</li>
            <li> When I got it, I apply it on my face then immediately felt burn on my face and getting worse.</li>
            <li> Spreads out thinly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also so thin</li>
            <li> This broke my skin out worse</li>
            <li> It burns your skin, and makes your break-outs worse than they are.  </li>
            <li> so I took a shower and put on a thin to medium layer of mask.</li>
            <li> I was ready to leave an awful review on the item...</li>
            <li> I have terrible skin, its blotchy, I&#x27;ve had a problem with acne my whole life</li>
            <li> It stings worse than anything I have put on my face before.  </li>
            <li> It didnt make it worse either.</li>
            <li> Well the game has changed with this mask!&lt;br /&gt;Pure</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, I like seeing the nasty crap pulled out of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I personally can&#x27;t get past the smell, which I think is disgusting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a slight smell, but it’s not that bad.</li>
            <li> I know, a bit dramatic</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s making a dramatic difference or not</li>
            <li> It smells a little bit bad, but it soon goes away once you apply it.</li>
            <li> I have read about the benefits of dead sea minerals and wanted to try it so bad.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I dont like about it is that my skin smells very bad after use of this mask.</li>
            <li> I really hate the hassle and mess of mixing the powder clay masks.</li>
            <li> have posted some pictures which BTW sorry not so flattering</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews but no one failed to mention that this product has a shelf life.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit weird</li>
            <li> but I was wrong because there is not mint in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> but it definitely does not smell awful.</li>
            <li> It’s the combination with the mud smell that takes things into questionable</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always a bit skeptical about the claims.</li>
            <li> It tingles and has a weird</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry.  </li>
            <li> but it was too expensive and wanted something that was organic and mosturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda weird.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s weird to say that,</li>
            <li> This batch is watery, sandy, is uncomfortable on my skin and never dries.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useless for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> It smells weird and made my skin breakout</li>
            <li> works well but leaves a weird feeling on my skin after.</li>
            <li> However my skins still not perfect</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have really bad forehead wrinkles caused by sun exposure...and really bad acne...and really oily skin...and an awful skin tone.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t all that bad, but not great.</li>
            <li> Due to this, I haven&#x27;t worn make-up in almost 3 weeks because you can see the nasty dryness through the foundation.  </li>
            <li> but this was like dirty water.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t tingly cold feeling</li>
            <li> When I receieved this mask it looks really dirty although it has some plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> makes my skin break out like crazy.</li>
            <li> the mask is drying it tingles a bit and makes my face feel cold.</li>
            <li> My eyes started to water like crazy.</li>
            <li> It cleans toxins, impurities and embedded dirty.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t awful looking, I&#x27;m just pale</li>
            <li> It cleanses my skin of all of it&#x27;s impurities without irritating my skin!!</li>
            <li> I was so mad</li>
            <li> From pictures I’d seen, I assumed this would be an entirely unpleasant experience.</li>
            <li> Besides all of that, I think that it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> it does go bad</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t that bad either.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s this bad fishy smell that lingers.</li>
            <li> had I known it would go bad.</li>
            <li> sometimes it also HURTS...... badly.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have bad acne</li>
            <li> if it feels itchy you might have had a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> used this mask after a particularly bad breakout</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so bad</li>
            <li> Some people also said this product went bad after they used it couple times.</li>
            <li> My face also tingled a bit but it isn’t a bad tingle or anything.</li>
            <li> She has really bad skin issues, so I wanted to see if this would work on both our skins.</li>
            <li> I tend to take that for granted until I notice it looks bad.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> these guys are all shocked.</li>
            <li> The mud is ugly, but the scent and tingly sensation on my face were wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate leaving bad reviews but his mud mask made my skin burn.</li>
            <li> Dangerous!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this mask.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this mask.</li>
            <li> It has a invigorating Eucalyptus scent and even cleared up my stuffy nose from this stupid summer cold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Others say it smells horrible, in my opinion it&#x27;s not that bad</li>
            <li> Very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> You know, we always use Vicks when we are sick or for the runny nose!</li>
            <li> yes, but its not too terrible</li>
            <li> My face is awful!</li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t the worst part.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s horrible</li>
            <li> /&gt;About a week ago, I had the worst breakout that I can remember.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Awful!</li>
            <li> it was the worst pain I have felt on my face.</li>
            <li> I know this is shocking</li>
            <li> I know, I said it was shocking!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So exciting to get this product.</li>
            <li> Nice and pleasant mask that feels good after washing off. I felt a hint of glow in the complexion after the first use. My face also feels clean. It&#x27;s not too drying too and vey easy to remove. The only complaint is that it is a tad too watery in texture.</li>
            <li> This mask is awesome. After just one use, my skin looked clearer and my blackheads shrunk drastically. It has a minty scent to it, which I loved. The only downside is that it burns/stings really bad the first few minutes but as it dries it stops stinging.</li>
            <li> I love this!!!  I love the tingling feel when you put it on.  It was very easy to wash off and my skin looked amazing afterwards!  My skin was VERY soft!  Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I love it!! First time trying it and I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with my purchase. I was reading some 1star reviews and I must say that this did NOT burn my face at all. It made my face feel clean &amp; fresh. Although we all don&#x27;t have the same skin type, that&#x27;s not fair to write that people are lieing on the 5stars. Because what could work wonders for me may not do anything for you. look at how many 5stars compared to the 1star, that should say a lot. I highly recommend this. Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> The burn is intense, but it stopped after about a minute. It left my skin feeling very clean and soft. I will probably only use about once a week or less.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after using this facial mask! I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to all my friends and family</li>
            <li> The mask itself is quite good, but the part about it being a MUD mask is quite apparent. I personally can&#x27;t get past the smell, which I think is disgusting. The texture is squishy, slimy, and rather gritty at the same time. I have to breathe through my mouth the entire time it&#x27;s on my face, and I simply can&#x27;t use it. I still gave it three stars however, because even after one use I could see improvements. If you don&#x27;t mind bad smell, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used to use Mary Kay for my acne prone complexion. It worked okay, but not for my daughter&#x27;s difficult skin. After reading the reviews about this facial mask, I ordered it for her. It works perfectly. Her face is more even tone, and clear of acne. Me too! My skin looks so much more brighter and even toned. I used to be so embarrassed to look people in the face, not any more. Bye, Mary Kay! Oh, it sooths my eczema, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a warning, when you first put in on, it tingles or burns, depending on what you did to your face beforehand. I only use it once a week. But, if you&#x27;re going to use it, do not scrub you face before, it will burn. It only lasts a minute or two and does no damage, but wow! So before I use it, I  just mildly wash my face. I scrub the rest of the week.</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling smooth and clean ! No harsh texture and no skin discolor left behide love it!</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong and bad that heavy headache is guaranteed! I also had severe skin reaction in few seconds right after I put this mask on my face. When I rinse it off my skin was burned and I can&#x27;t touch it at all! It took me whole day to calm skin down. It&#x27;s not a mud mask, it smells and feels like some chemical mask. Very upset with result of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this face mask. It provides a deep clean and is not too thick so it has an easy application and removal. I look forward to applying this once a week before my shower and then enjoying the  warm tingle for 15-20min before washing off. The scent is nice too, it has a light mint smell. This is a great maintenance product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if consistency is an issue with this product but the first time I ordered it the mud was dark in color and thick in texture. The second time I ordered it the mud was light in color and appeared to be watered down. I still like the product and will continue ordering it but I&#x27;m left a little curious as to why there is no consistency.</li>
            <li> I am so very pleased with this mask.  I am 28 and really struggle with adult acne, especially cystic acne along the chin and jawline.  After about a month of regular use (once a week) I can honestly say that while my skin isn&#x27;t perfect, it has improved significantly!  AND my jar looks like I hardly touched it.  The product is great and the price is amazing.  I will definitely be ordering this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.divaandthedivine.com</li>
            <li> I love the fact that all of the ingredients in this product are natural! The mask makes my skin feel smooth, and it also has a slight exfoliating property which I enjoyed. Another great thing about the mud mask is the fact that there is NO overpowering smell. If you are sensitive to strong smells like I am, then this product will work for you. The smell is light and natural without any added fragrances.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it does have a strong smell but it is bearable it smells really minty and different, after the first use my skin was glowing. I shared it on my mom and uncle and they love the stuff it really helps with my black heads. this is a must have for your face!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mask I have ever used . I will be buying again !!!</li>
            <li> Great mask left my skin very soft easy to apply. I used it for a week straight before leaving a review. I did receive this product for review.</li>
            <li> I love all products from Israel and especially those from the Dead Sea. I just received the mud mask and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it, and I was not disappointed. I followed the directions and once I was done, my skin felt smooth and soft, definitely made me feel a bit pampered. The product is all natural which makes me feel good buying it and using it. I will definitely be adding a Mud Mask treatment to my weekend routine. I highly recommend this product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using the Dead Sea Mud Face Mask, it will definitely continue to be one of my daily regimes going forward. I am very much skeptical about what I put on my face and most times it is only water and maybe ( a big maybe) a moisturizer of some sort...But this product really surprised me, in that it immediately made my face feel clean and very much rejuvenated. It is truly a much recommended Moisturizer and Cleanser System for the skeptical at heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that I have only used it for almost a week now it and it has made tremendous difference in my fight with oil skin. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does with my acne&#x27;s. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The mask goes on smooth as silk...and then it grabs onto your skin within the 10 minutes and you know it&#x27;s working!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is silky smooth, mega clean, and happy!&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint?  It truly SMELLS like the sea....like after the tide has gone out!  BUT hey for the value and the result?  its worth holding your nose ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is amazingly quick on sending out the product, very responsive, and wonderful to deal with! Would absolutely buy another product from the company and strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> As a stay at home mom, I like to pamper myself at least once a week. This mud mask will now be part of my ritual. I received it today and wanted to try it out immediately. As another reviewer said, it is a little soupy, but I actually like that about it, I just wish I&#x27;d known ahead of time since I almost spilled it everywhere. The jar is the perfect size for me to fit my fingers into and the lid is nice and secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mud itself is a good texture. I could feel it working as I applied it and as it dried I felt that tightening sensation that I love. It came off easily when I rubbed it for the extra exfoliation. Then, I washed the remaining mud off with warm water and my skin felt really good. My skin is very smooth right now and I&#x27;m excited to keep using this product and add it to my weekly home spa ritual. I would recommend this to all my friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has variable areas. Parts of it has tiny blackheads, other parts tend to get blemishes, and the rest seems to only act up once in a while. I think this stuff will help me get it under control, since it actually got rid of some of my tiny blackheads in just one use.</li>
            <li> I like this mask. I was surprised that I could actually notice a difference after just one use. My skin was noticeably softer and less oily throughout the day. I like that its not runny or chunky or clay thick like some other mud masks I&#x27;ve tried. The consistency feels creamy like a lotion. I think I put it too close to my eyes the first time because the eucalyptus vapors made my eyes water a bit. No burning, just watery eyes. I received the product complimentary to test and/or review.</li>
            <li> I have the most annoying skin type  - oily T zone with dry spots eveywhere else. Most masks either leave me with breakouts or even drier skin. This mask was the perfect solution. My skin was so soft after use, without feeling oily or dry. I loved that it was all natural,&lt;br /&gt;I feel safe using it. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea mud face mask is great. My skin was so dry and dead looking. I tried this and followed the directions and my face feels smoother and less dry. It actually feels a lot like it does when I get a facial! Love this!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this mask more than 5 stars, seriously, I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;First, fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Before putting on the mask, I read the ingredients, most ingredients were organic, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;After I rinse it off, I could see that my pores were noticeably smaller, and if I look closely in the mirror, I actually saw that my black heads were much less visible! The mask leave my face soft and moisturize, my mom actually asked how did my complexion look so bright!&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely in love with this mask, it&#x27;s amaaaaazing, such great result! Saves me time and money from going to spa(:</li>
            <li> This facial mask is awesome. It works super well. It leaves my skin feeling super clean and it pulls out all of the impurities and unclogs my pores. Its an amazing product. My face has never been clearer.</li>
            <li> I actually just got this today. But I wanted to try it asap because I love facial masks.&lt;br /&gt;First off I like that it is already mixed and ready to go. I really hate the hassle and mess of mixing the powder clay masks. I like the exfoliating beads too.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it has mostly natural ingredients and isn&#x27;t tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;I have posted some pictures which BTW sorry not so flattering but so u know I&#x27;m real Lol.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways if your skin is sensitive I wouldn&#x27;t use it. It has eucalyptus oil in which I actually liked because it gives you that clean tingle feeling ( I suppose could also be from the aloe) but at the same time even if u don&#x27;t put it near your eyes it still burns. That&#x27;s why I gave four stars. Also when you go to rinse it off I would be careful because it also burns your eyes a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I like it, it seemed like it did a good job cleaning my face and getting rid of dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> Have tried a few different mud masks and this definitely produced the better results. Application was easy, dried fast, and wasn&#x27;t overly messy during removal. This left my skin smooth and refreshed. Perhaps the only reason I would not give a 5 star is that for ~1hr afterwards my face felt hot; wasn&#x27;t overly unpleasant just not expected.</li>
            <li> I liked this mask. It is much easier to use than the powder clay masks that you have to mix up and it removed easier, too. I have only used it on my face so far, but it left it smooth and soft. I am planning to try a full body mask later this week and will post an updated review then.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the heat froms hipping or what but this was like dirty water.  Nothing smooth or creamy at all.  Yuck</li>
            <li> Excellent shipping, timely manner and well packaged. When applied it feels WONDERFUL, your skin feels refreshed and you can feel it working...will definitely buy again! my skin is smooth and clean! My local Spa charges over $100 for a mud mask, now I can do 30 or more treatments at home for under $30... This is a BARGAIN!</li>
            <li> I am an 18 year old with oily/combination skin who is suffering from acne and uneven skin tone. I have read about the benefits of dead sea minerals and wanted to try it so bad. The item shipped within a week and it looked different from the what was pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I opened the container and realized the mask was kind of runny instead of the more creamier consistency I was expecting. It also smelled kind of murky. It is not a bad smell if you get used to it. There is a fair amount so it will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I applied the mud mask on my face  for the third time ever since I bought it. One concern I have is that it reduces the oil on my forehead and t-zone areas but dries out the rest of my face like my cheeks. So I use it only once every two weeks or so. It kind of stings when I apply it but not sure if it is a good thing or a bad thing. I will apply the mask for a few more weeks and see if it makes any difference.</li>
            <li> After many a girls night with my mother and sister, I have experienced many different kinds of face masks. This pure dead sea mask has a very earthy smell to it, but the smell is very tame and did not bother me, even though I have a very sensitive nose. Once I washed my face and put the mask on, it felt nice on my skin. It felt like it was supposed to be there. There was no itching or burning like some other face masks I have tried. After the recommended 10 minutes I took it off with a wet wash cloth. I was amazed at how easily it came off and how fresh my face felt after using it. Other face masks leave my face feeling painfully dry and sometimes red and burning. This mask made my face feel refreshed and new. I also noticed after looking in the mirror that my pores were noticeably smaller. All in all I think this is a great product! Not only is it a relaxing, pleasant, and refreshing experience, but it will leave your face feeling fresh and new.

            <li> Amazing product!  I was a little skeptical at first but once you get it on and it dries you feel it working! My skin has never felt more amazing! It really helped to even out my skin as well!</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing! My skin is very sensitive, and I have eczema.  After using it for the first time, I could feel and see a difference in my skin.  I love the texture, it is slightly thin, which makes it very easy to apply.  You can feel it working as it&#x27;s drying.  My pores look smaller after only one application.  I cannot wait to see the effect it has on my eczema down the road.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels moisturized, tighter, and it looks brighter already.  I highly recommend this face mask, it honestly makes my skin feel better than any face mask I have paid for at a spa. Just thinking of all the money I will save, and how I get to pamper myself with a facial every week makes me love this product even more.&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review in a month or so after I see how much it helps my eczema.</li>
            <li> Until now, I had never used a mud mask. I&#x27;ve tried many store brand masks and wanted to try something more natural. I liked the thinner texture of the mask as opposed to the traditional thick paste of other masks. It let me control how much I wanted to apply and went on very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the mask hardened, I didn&#x27;t experience any uncomfortable itchiness or excessive tightening. Upon removal my skin felt soft, smooth, and clean. It actually took some of the sting out of a small sunburn I&#x27;ve been nursing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase the mask again, it delivered results without any drying or artificial additives.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I actually see my skin getting tighter and clearer after using it. Would get it again</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 I got one already works very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new masks to try, and I really love this one. I was excited to try it knowing that it&#x27;s from the Dead Sea. I always loved every product I owned that came from the dead sea. This mask definitely lived up to my expectations. My skin was super smooth, bright, and extra soft after using this just the first time! It smells really nice, like mint, and goes on real smooth. I love how it feels on my skin. Make sure not to get it too close to your eyes because the fumes can sting your eyes a little. When it was time to wash it all off, I didn&#x27;t have a hard time. It washed off real nicely and left my skin feeling insanely refreshed. I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> A little cold irritating, but used up very comfortable</li>
            <li> My face does feel very smooth and soft after using it. Felt very nice and the feeling lasted all night.</li>
            <li> it seems to be working good,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 and I break out worse now than I did as a teen I&#x27;ve heard amazing things about mud masks so I finally decided to give one a try.  I used it as soon as I got it and I already see and feel a difference.  My pores are so large I can see them with out the magnifying mirror and after removing the mask I saw a visible difference also I had a few spots were my acne hurt and as soon as I felt the mask start drying I could feel the pain starting to subside.  I still am broken out but the swelling and redness went down.  I can&#x27;t wait to make this part of my weekly regiment and see how much more my skin will improve.  It was so relaxing next time I am going to leave it on longer and pamper myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great to know that this is a responsible company that uses all natural ingredients and doesn&#x27;t test on animals :-)</li>
            <li> Ok, I admit it, I am addicted to face masks; I have tried many of them over the years. This Pure Dead Sea mask stands far and above ANY other I&#x27;ve tried. It goes on lightly and you can feel it going to work within minutes. My skin looked and felt cleaner, tighter pores and oh so smooth.  It really is remarkable. This product is officially part of my beauty regimen from herein in. This really is a must try...I have never used anything like this. So glad I did!!!</li>
            <li> I like it, but I&#x27;m definitely not the biggest fan of the smell. It lingers even after you wash it off of your face. I do like that you can feel the tingling sensation from the mask though. Another thing was that I wish I was able to tell what kind of improvements there were after using it. I couldn&#x27;t tell if any of my pores were coming out at all. Besides all of that, I think that it&#x27;s not too bad. I think I prefer Lavo&#x27;s volcanic mud mask more though. The smell is much better and you&#x27;re able to see the immediate effects of the mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was too strong for my sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> this products is great. i like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 3 times until now .. I didn&#x27;t notice any changes yet .. But it feels fresh after removing it .. I will try to edit my review after one month .,</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after wards. Doesn&#x27;t dry it out either.</li>
            <li> A very good mudd type mask.  Leaves my face feeling clean and fresh</li>
            <li> How are you going to advertise something are &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; Dead Sea mud when it&#x27;s got at least 8 other ingredients in it? It was naive of me not to read the ingredient list and not to spot check first, but I figured &amp;#34;it&#x27;s mud, what&#x27;s the worst it could do.&amp;#34; Like some other people have reported, my skin, especially the skin around my sinuses, started burning strongly almost right away. After two minutes I rinsed off the mask in a panic. I don&#x27;t know which of the ingredients was responsible for that reaction, all I know is my skin can&#x27;t handle this product and it is not &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; mud. Grrr.</li>
            <li> This is the first Dead Sea Mud mask I&#x27;ve used but it seems to work well. Has a tingling feeling when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> My face looks And feels amazing after this mask. When its on my face stings a little on my T zone but i can see my blackheads and pores are cleared after using it. I will definitely purchase it again. Also keep in mind since its all natural...it does go bad I believe it is. 12mo after  opening.</li>
            <li> The mud is not the same color as appear in the image and don&#x27;t feel any change in my skin or if it can help to treats the acne</li>
            <li> I never actually had skin problems. I always used Noxzema but as i got older my skin became sensitive to it. So I switched to using dead sea mud mask because all the ingredients are natural. I use this product twice a week and normally leave it on when it drys. This product does flake (that&#x27;s when I know when its time to wash it off). It has a cooling tingling sensation. Others say it smells horrible, in my opinion it&#x27;s not that bad it&#x27;s not going to leave your face smelly or anything. But after I wash it off I apply a Euricern moisturizer to my face and my face is smoother. I often apply the mask and sit my face in the steamer as well to open up my pores. I will be buying this product again.!</li>
            <li> This mud mask feels cool, creamy, and refreshing when first applied to the skin and then tingles a bit.  After drying and rinsing, it leaves the skin moist, supple, clean, and firmed, and neither oily nor dry.  I use it before bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask has a beautiful deep grey color from the mineral-rich Dead Sea mud, which is blended with a few botanic and mostly organic ingredients to condition and protect the skin:  shea butter, jojoba oil, aloe vera juice, calendula oil, and hickory bark extract.  It has an earthy scent with an invigorating hint of eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar holds six ounces and should provide at six to eight facial treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: pure Dead Sea mud, organic shea butter, organic sunflower oil, organic aloe vera juice, organic vegetable glycerin, organic jojoba oil, hickory bark extract, organic calendula oil, filtered water, xanthan gum, eucalyptus oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handcrafted Goods provided a jar for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Very sticky. Hard to get off but it feels good on the skin!</li>
            <li> I love this mask! Easy to apply. Makes my skin look and feel fresh. I&#x27;ve used it once a week for three weeks now and can see a difference in my skin already. It&#x27;s smoother and softer. I&#x27;ve gotten nice comments on my complexion without anyone knowing I&#x27;m using the mask! I would definately buy this product again.</li>
            <li> After used this product, my brother&#x27;s face started getting lots of acne, and he had to go see the dermatologist</li>
            <li> It works leave my face soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask weekly for a month now. I love how it makes my skin feel tighter after I rinse it off and how it almost has a cooling effect as I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I really dislike about it is that it is very difficult to rinse off compared to my other masks, and it has a tendency to leave spots, chunks in my bathtub or sink after I&#x27;ve rinsed it off and drained any water. My sink drains much slower after each use too, which is annoying to fix after trying to unwind after a spa-like relaxing experience. When I rinse the mask off in my bathtub, I have to spend time cleaning the tub after with a sponge because it does leave tiny mud clumps all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great feeling mask, but I much prefer my old mint-julep or grape seed masks or even salt or sugar scrubs to this one. After I finish this tub of mud I won&#x27;t be getting another.</li>
            <li> Awesome! My face felt amazing after and felt like I was 5 years younger! Amazing purchase.</li>
            <li> Leaves my faced soft, moist and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I don&#x27;t like using it on my face because I get a sulphuric odor from it as I rinse it off that takes a long time to fade being too close to my nose. It does make the skin look nice though, reducing pores and redness. It makes the skin very soft. I much prefer to use Glamglow products on my face because I think they work better although they are very expensive so I have to use them sparingly. I have found a wonderful use for this product, however. I use it for bodywraps: I use this mud mask and cover it with layers of plastic wrap before it dries then I get dressed and go about my business for an hour or so. It&#x27;s great in summer because it has such a cooling effect. I don&#x27;t know if I get much of a reduction, but my skin looks so much nicer after I do that I am willing to wear a bikini. This masks generous size and great price makes it worth it too! I will repurchase this product for this reason. And in a pinch, if I&#x27;m out of Glamglow, I will use this on my face.</li>
            <li> Giving this a four since I haven&#x27;t tried any other mud masks.  Your face definitely feels softer and smoother after using this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Dead Sea Mud Mask. It came in a nice size container.  It does have a little sea smell to it so I decided to use it at night time.  I have only used it once so far. It is easy to smooth onto my face and neck.  Then I leave it on for about 10 minutes.  Then wipe off.  It really makes my skin feel smooth and clean.  It does not irritate my skin.  I am going to use it whenever a pimple pops up too.  Very nice product I got complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid for facials. I&#x27;ve paid for organic creams in small jars and tubes. I&#x27;ve even purchased special clay I had to mix up and put on my face. This product is different. It isn&#x27;t the mystique of being from the Dead Sea. It&#x27;s that the product really does what it says. It takes the impurities, excess oils, and grime right out of my skin. I &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; after a Dead Sea mud mask. Now, granted, the stuff smells like, well, it came from a sea in which something might have, say, died, but they&#x27;ve covered most of that up with the other organic ingredients. And, that&#x27;s another thing. The list of additional ingredients is amazing! They&#x27;re organic/natural, and I&#x27;m beyond impressed. I can get (the manufacturer claims) thirty uses from this one jar. If that turns out to be true, that&#x27;ll be less than one dollar per mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quality-tested this product at the manufacturer&#x27;s request. I do not hold a stake in the success of this product or the company which created it. I hope my review helps you with your purchasing decision.</li>
            <li> I went to the Dead Sea,  Jordan side, in June.  Just in time to get out!&lt;br /&gt;The Dead Sea mask I bought there was great so I wanted more.  This product feels exactly the same. Happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> I just started noticing that my skin isn&#x27;t as tight on my face as it was a cpl years ago. I wanted to try something new that I could make part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I used to break out at least once a month and now my skin is pimple free. I even started receiving compliments on how my skin is now glowing. I will definitely purchase again when it gets low. I actually apply a small amount on before bed then wake up and wash with regular face wash. After that, I apply a thin layer on before I start my day (almost as if I&#x27;m applying make-up). My skin looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> Super watery and it burned!!! It wasn&#x27;t a tingle, it BURNED!! My skin is so irritated now. Throwing this away!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a blemish-free day since I was a teenager. I&#x27;m cursed with blackheads on my nose and whiteheads on my chin, and massive pores all around my face. I&#x27;ve tried countless stuff and nothing seems to work. So I was really excited when I got the chance to review this product - I&#x27;m willing to try just about anything to get rid of my zits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I first noticed about this mask is that it doesn&#x27;t look or feel like mud in the jar. It looks like a dark gel. A lot of other mud masks have that chalky, pasty feel and this one definitely doesn&#x27;t - it&#x27;s a lot more supple, and that makes it easier to spread on your face evenly and keep it on your skin and not your clothing. That&#x27;s a big plus - I love using mud masks but they tend to clump up and not spread uniformly. This one does a great job of offering even coverage when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels pretty cold on your face - if you use a mud mask you have to add water to you can elect to add warm water and this one just goes on pretty cold. It might be a good idea to either microwave whatever you&#x27;re going to use for a couple of seconds or to run warm water over the jar for a while to keep your pores open and your blood flowing to your face. It doesn&#x27;t affect performance as far as I&#x27;ve noticed but I just don&#x27;t like to feel cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask felt a little less harsh than some others I&#x27;ve tried. Sometimes I try masks and feel my face flushing underneath the mask, and I didn&#x27;t really have that problem with this one. If you&#x27;ve experienced that, this mask is probably worth a try. To me, it felt a little milder while it was drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the mask dried and I washed it off, my skin felt a little tighter. I only noticed a small difference in the size of my pores upon first application, but what I did notice was that my face still felt really well-moisturized in spite of mud masks generally being so drying to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask was easy to apply, kind to my skin, and left my face feeling fresh and moisturized. This is an awesome bargain for a dead sea mud mask, and if you&#x27;re curious about trying it I think this is a great option. I hope you get the chance to try it and enjoy it as much as I did!feeling fresh and moisturized.

            <li> I got my Dead sea Mud facial Mask and was super excited to use it. I applied a medium layer as instructed and waited until it dried off and washed my face. It has a minty kind of feel when applied on my face which made my face feel fresh after washing it off. I don&#x27;t know about the instant glow they mentioned but I can definitely see some difference. I will keep using this twice a week and will try to keep this post updated.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product is it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li> When put it on my face, I feel pain, not sure why. Probably my skin is too sensitive</li>
            <li> Very smooth mask. Applies easily. It tingles for the first couple of minutes, but then completely goes away. Really tighten the skin. I applied argan oil afterwards. My skin feels great!</li>
            <li> I used it on my nose area. It works great and was easier to remove than I thought it would be. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad either.</li>
            <li> I love this. It makes my skin feel so smooth... My pores havminimized... Definitely will be rebuying.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face really smooth for a couple of days after using this. Will buy more as gifts for my friends and family.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Used it once so far and loved how my skin felt after I did the mask.</li>
            <li> This product works as promised. My skin felt clean and fresh after using it. There were no issues with irritation. The smell could be a little better but that in no reason to take stars away from it. I use the product every 5 days. My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Work well on  oil skin . good buy I would buy ;this again.</li>
            <li> went on smooth...felt really good on my face and rinsed away nicely!!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this mask for all the women in my family and we love it!! Everyone always comes to me asking my secret for my great skin and this is one thing I recommend.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I have tried at least a half dozen of these masks and this is the best one for my skin type.</li>
            <li> SMELLS FUNKY. but worked really good.</li>
            <li> Good product. Spa quality.&lt;br /&gt;The eucalyptus has a two- fold purpose in this product: for it&#x27;s antibacterial properties and to help cover the sulphur smell of the mud. It is not an overpowering smell, but it is noticeable. I primarily noticed it when I began to remove it. You will want to plan accordingly when using as it leaves a slight &amp;#34;after smell&amp;#34; that will go away with a proper shower.&lt;br /&gt; It applies thinner than most masks I&#x27;ve used. I worked in an initial layer and, once I had covered my face, went back to the slightly dry parts to apply a second layer. There was a slight tingling and pulling as the mask dried, which I find typical of most masks.  The mask left my face feeling softer and smoother after one use. I will review again in a couple of months to see if there are long term benefits.</li>
            <li> Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised, considering it is a &amp;#34;Dead Sea&amp;#34; mud mask, but I had to admit that I was a little...taken aback...by the scent of the product when it first arrived. It smelled very, very strongly like mud and salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I just couldn&#x27;t get past the scent enough to put this mask on my face, so I can&#x27;t actually comment on its effectiveness. But maybe other customers wouldn&#x27;t mind the intense smell as much as I did. Overall, I really like the idea behind this product, but it possibly could&#x27;ve been formulated differently in order to be more aesthetically appealing.</li>
            <li> I Highly recomend this product, you can feel the freshness as soon as you apply the product on your face and top part of neck. This product removes all impurity and leaves your skin so smooth and clean. thank you for giving me the chance to review this product</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well, and made my skin SUPER soft. The only downside is it really burns. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that at first, so I immediately washed it off, but it turns out that is normal!</li>
            <li> From my experience after using this product for a couple weeks now I have found it to work efficiently and it is quite easy to use. Like it says it gently dries on my face after about five minutes, when I take the mask off it leaves my skin so smooth, clean, fresh and blemish free. The only thing I am not a fan of is that sting sensation I get when I first put it on and it lasts until I remove the product but other than this I think it is a great product because it works. Not to mention if you buy it off amazon you will receive a free ebook and who doesn&#x27;t like free stuff I know I do! &amp;#60;3 *Powered by BrandBacker</li>
            <li> Clean so deep, thats good! But too strong and salt in it not for sensitive skin or dry skin. I think for oily or normal skin.</li>
            <li> I like it, my face feels soft ---- when applied it has a really big heating affect .. Sat I front of a fan lol.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says, improves!!! Will definitely be a staple in my beauty cabinet.</li>
            <li> This mask is beautiful. I like it.</li>
            <li> i will give this a 5 stars! It smells a little bit bad, but it soon goes away once you apply it. i have an oily face and some blackheads that i wanna get rid off. been using different products but never satisfied with the result but  after i used the Pure and essential minerals Dead sea mud mask my face feels soft and cleaner. i love it! :-).... and the fact that it has all natural ingredients and not tested on animals  cant wait to used it again :-) i will surely recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Only used it once and I&#x27;m already in love.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fresh and glowing !! I just love it!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I recieved this on time and as described. I used this mask and am so happy! I have very sensitive skin and was very reluctant to use it because of how most facial scrubs and masks I have tryed caused a reaction. This scrub not only got along with my skin, but loved how it left my face feel. I would recommend this mask and seller A++++++</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is good for sensitive skin (and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin). It works well as at sucking the dirty stuff from my skin without leaving it too dry. However, one or both of the essential oils in this product irritates my skin. It leaves a minty sensation that others may find to be cooling, but I find to be irritating. I think I will move on to a mud mask that does not these types of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Ok...just used it first time and I haven&#x27;t seen my skin look so refreshed in a long time. My dark circles under eyes seemed lighter, skin tighter and smooth.  Weirdly enough, I checked out my skin beforehand and did not see the little black hairs around my jaw line and neck ( that started few years before I turned 40) and after I was able to pluck six hairs that magically showed up!! I think the mask drew them out of my pores!!! Which can only mean I will eventually have less ingrown blemishes that cause my african american skin, less discolorations after that. I&#x27;m really excited to see what my skin will look like after some more weekly uses!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with this product. It is refreshing and smells great, even if it is dead sea mud. It works wonders leaving my skin feeling revitalized, refreshed, smooth and clean. It shrinks my pores which is a main concern of mine. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin soft and feeling refreshed</li>
            <li> This mud mask performs exactly as intended. It smells of eucalyptus oil, a really pleasant scent.  It&#x27;s easy to spread on, a real pleasure to wear as it dries. It&#x27;s a good exfoliator and pore cleanser. This is a luxurious and beneficial item for anybody.  Unlike other mud masks I&#x27;ve tried, this one made my eyes water when applying. It&#x27;s from the extracts I think but then once applied my eyes were fine. Take a look at the ingredients - seems impressive.  Item received for sincere review.</li>
            <li> GREAT product!!!  It smells good and feels cool when you put it on.  I have sensitive skin, but it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING. I used it for the 1st time last night and my skin is SO soft and completely clear. I love the way that the mask feels when you put it on. It is tingly and it feels so luxurious. When I rinsed off the mask, it felt cool and refreshing. My skin was VERY soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, my skin looks even better than it did last night. Its clear and I look more refreshed. I am in love with this product and cannot wait to see what happens when I use it again next week.</li>
            <li> I like the product. But thought it would dry tighter on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is magic in a container. Once the product is on, you can feel your skin tingling and stinging in a matter of second. Not only is it cleansing, but I really feel like my skin tightens after this product.</li>
            <li> OOh. I love this stuff. I think it is important for problem skin folks such as myself use a mud mask to periodically to draw out impurities and this mask seems to work in spades. It does make my skin feel soft and I like the warm tingle it delivers. A response like that makes me believe it&#x27;s working the magic it says it will. It is a good value for the money too. Try it y&#x27;all.</li>
            <li> I love this!! Makes my skin feel super soft and it not really that big of a mess!!! Will definitely use it again!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is supposed tingle so much that it felt like my face was kind of burning. I have never done this before. My boyfriend and I did a facial night and used this for fun. But after it washes off it felt very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I received this at a highly discounted rate and it worked just as expected. It gives a tingly feeling at first and once you take it off, your pores feel clean. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Left my face feeling like new.</li>
            <li> BURNS!!! Stay out! Very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Glowing skin after use.</li>
            <li> Smooth, minimal scent.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feels great, I love it, the first them though it stung a bit and made my skin a little red. But the second time I tried it, there was a slight nice tingle.</li>
            <li> Best Dead Sea Mud product that I bought so far. The smell is indeed very strong but if you have ever been to the Dead Sea and experienced the smell of sulfur, you know you got the real stuff. The minute I put the mask on my face I felt the ingredients working. I left the mask on for about 20 minutes, letting it dry sitting out in the sun. It cleaned my skin perfectly, red spots and impurity are gone. It feels very clean and leaves a smooth and soft skin. This is it for me! I found what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I like it so far, it does give a tingling or a bit of burning sensation. It was easy to apply on and easy to wash off. After washing it off, my face felt fresh. I&#x27;ll be using this often to see the end results.</li>
            <li> Burns a bit but my skin has never been so soft</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I wish I can give it 5 stars but I can&#x27;t, for the simple that I used this weekly product with an organic moisturizer and organic face wash. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad and you only apply it to your face/neck for 5-10 minutes. You can totally brush your teeth, surf the internet during that time. The first time I applied this product to my face it tingled (which is a good thing) after I removed the mask, my skin looked radiant. I recommend this product, but not with any other &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I loved the Dead Sea Mud Mask.  You feel the tightening affects within a few minutes.  Our skin felt so smooth after the treatment and we plan on using it weekly!</li>
            <li> Definitely feels very good both after applying, and after you rinse it off. Skin is noticeably tighter and smoother looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments on use:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Make sure you stir the mud well before using it!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; I recommend keeping the product refrigerated when not in use</li>
            <li> I added this to my normal routine and to my surprise my blackheads on my nose large pores on my upper lip visibly diminished after just one use.  Everyone has commented how my skin looks more supple and I have a glow.  I am very pleased with this product and definitely will be purchasing again.  I would definitely recommend this as an excellent addition to any skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> This mask doesn&#x27;t dry out my face! It makes my skin super soft. It cleanses my skin of all of it&#x27;s impurities without irritating my skin!! I love it!</li>
            <li> Absorbs amazingly fast, which means, my skin needs it. Best to apply this mask after a warm bath or shower, then have a good night sleep, you will wake up beautifully.</li>
            <li> Its all natural and it is a good product. its also kind of liquid and does dry fast. Only apply and leave for 5 minutes. Can be used in the entire body. Smells nice and does not stain the body. It also works as a scrub when you remove it.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea mask came and was well packaged. I love that this product is natural products. We used the product at a girls night party and everyone loved the product. I tend to have break outs in my chin area and feel like the mask helped with the blemishes. It smells a bit like icy hot and feels like tingly during the mask but both are well worth the work the mask does. It almost gives the idea that it is doing its job.  I have been trying to remember to use once a week to determine the long time advantages. I will definitely be purchasing this mask again.</li>
            <li> I hate leaving bad reviews but his mud mask made my skin burn. I had to wash it off as soon as I put it on. Maybe it is the eucalyptus in it, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve used mud masks before and never had this reaction. I will not use this again.</li>
            <li> Love the product my face feels so clean and smooth. I never seen my face so clear. I use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> Outstanding face mask! I used this right before I took a shower and it worked wonderful. It has a jello like consistency that is easy to apply. The jar is easy to open and keeps the mask contained for no mess. It takes about 15-20 minutes to fully harden. Once I washed it off the results were amazing. My blackheads and other acne was gone and my skin looked even. I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> It tingles but its a very good mask noticed the effects immediately and it lasts throughout the week. I definitely recommend the mask to just about anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for several months now, and I have not had a problem with irritation or any of that, and I have very sensitive skin. Anyways, it burns a little when it&#x27;s on, and leaves my face red for about a half hour afterwards. My skin is smoother and clearer the day I use it, but that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve noticed any long-term results in terms of my complexion or anything, and I still break out normally. Also, it leaves your face smelling pretty awful afterwards. I notice when I take it off there&#x27;s this bad fishy smell that lingers.</li>
            <li> Love my Dead Sea mud facial mask!</li>
            <li> This stuff got rid of all dead skin.</li>
            <li> i think the dead sea mask is so great!when the mask put on my face, i felt so comfort and cool.now,my skin become more abd more good.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing. You can actually feel it working when it is on. Your skin feels clean and fresh with a glow afterwards. Really cleans out the toxins and impurities in your skin. Highly recommend over any other Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> my teen has clogged up pores resulting in major blackheads! we used the pure dead sea mud mask for several nights, it really pulled those pores clean let me tell ya! i highly recommend this pure brand dead sea mask for those that have large clogged up pores. i am happy to report this complementary in exchange.</li>
            <li> I love this dead sea mud mask. It goes on easy and great. It smells nice which is a plus for dead sea mask. It tingles a bit and feels refreshing while its on. It was easier than I expected to remove. My face felt so good after and super soft. I was afraid it might would break me out the next day since I have sensitive skin but it didn&#x27;t Overall this is a nice mask and I would recommend to anyone. I received a sample to review and all opinions are my own and unbiased.</li>
            <li> I tried this mask on myself and my husband. Both of us experienced burning while the mask was on and minor breakouts afterwords.</li>
            <li> Just received my Dead Sea mud facial mask and it&#x27;s awesome ! I just did my first facial and my face feels great. Super soft and it smells amazing. It truly gives you a spa like experience while you are wearing it. It tingled a bit while I had the facial on but but didn&#x27;t burn at all. I love how easy it was to apply ! I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for that perfect facial to make your skin feel like a 10 !!!</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing.. You apply a generous layer to your entire face, avoiding the eyes and you get a nice cool tingly sensation. The results were just great, it left my skin glowing and very soft to the touch, I will be using this every week and ordering more. Highly recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> As I opened the jar it smelled really nice and while applying, the mask glided on smoothly over my face. The consistency is just perfect, not too grainy or liquidy. After applying it takes only about 10 mins to dry completely, once dry it is suggested to wet the mask before wiping it clean. Wetting it really cleaned the mask very clearly and fast. My skin was feeling cleaner and smoother; I also noticed that the size of the acne on my forehead was a little smaller. The minty smell also felt so relaxing when I was waiting for the mask to dry.&lt;br /&gt;But this was the second time experience with the mud mask, the first time I did the mistake of not mixing the mask properly before applying it on my face. The Eucalyptus oil was floating on the top and when I applied it felt like my face was burning. So I contacted Pure &amp; Essential Minerals and they suggested mixing the mud properly before applying, also not to wash the face before applying because that will open the pores which may also give a burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;The second time I mixed the mask properly in the jar itself and did not wash my face before applying and it was a much better experience than the 1st time. It is advised to use the mask weekly for a blemish free bright and glowing complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I will be applying it every week as I really like how my skin feels after using the mask and it is so easy to use, no mixing and pouring, apply directly from the jar.&lt;br /&gt;**I received the mask to use in-exchange of my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. A little goes a long way and I actually like the way it smells and the tingle like sensation. I wish I could have gotten a bigger container because of the price, but I&#x27;ll take it as it is. A little goes a long way! I&#x27;ve used it about 3 times and it still doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve used any at all!</li>
            <li> Feels great - you get a nice tingle as it&#x27;s drying. Exfoliates. Only giving this 4 stars because it has a slightly...odd(?) odor. I can&#x27;t really describe it. Just a little...odd.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the best product out there. I have tried a number of products from the less expensive to pricy and I found this one to be the best overall.</li>
            <li> For the name I was expecting a product that actually showed results this one does nothing but shrink poors does not aid on acne like they claim</li>
            <li> Gently and natural exfoliates during application, and hydrates skin while taking out toxins, leaving skin glowing, smooth, clean, and not even red (I have fair skin). Highly recommend this product. I have ordered other Dead Sea mud face masks, and this is by far the most pure and authentic. My skin smells as if I was just in the mud of the Dead Sea after I use this mask&lt;br /&gt;(A natural aroma that let&#x27;s me know it&#x27;s natural)&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to giving this as gifts!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It burns my face!!!! Dangerous! I applied the mask for one minute and I am glad that I didn&#x27;t hold it longer  because my face was on fire and for the whole week was very red. When I went to dermatologist she told me my face looks like It was a second degree burn !!!! I don&#x27;t know what all the good reviews are coming from.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews but no one failed to mention that this product has a shelf life. Very little is needed when applying to your face and the product COULD last for months, instead, it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;After taking a week off of not using this product, I went to resume usage only to find that it has a fowl smell, discoloration and it was extremely clumpy, slimey and possibly moldy. This product is not cheap and was a waste since I had to throw the remaining half of the jar away.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the labeled indicated this because I would&#x27;ve used more of it had I known it would go bad. If there was a next time, which there won&#x27;t be, it&#x27;s possible this product might need refrigeration.</li>
            <li> Smells good and smooth on the face.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!  Only used it once, but my skin felt soo refreshed afterwards!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this the first time I tried it.  It seemed to help decrease my pore size.  The second time I had a reaction around my eyes and the skin around them became very swollen and red.  I had gotten a little bit below the eyebrows and wiped it off, but I guess it was enough to still cause that reaction.  I probably won&#x27;t use it for a while.  It would be great for people without sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mas as a sample for review and evaluation and have found it to be relaxing to use. Because it contains eucalyptus oil it starts to tingle on your face right away. I would highly recommend giving the mud a good stir before you apply it. I leave mine on for 5 minutes and find this to be sufficient for my combination skin. If you are not used to using products with eucalyptus oil this will be a bit intense at first so you may want to leave it on for less time. While using it I sometimes notice my nasal passage opening up! I like that the mask is all natural and it does leave my skin feeling softer and well circulated. I like this for &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; night at my house!</li>
            <li> If you can get past the smell, the feeling afterwards is great. My pores feel really tight and clear. Skin feels soft. I like this product more than the aztec clay. It is a bit more expensive though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my skin type made me break out</li>
            <li> i would not recommend people with naturally oily skin to use this product. My skin is very dry so this product was wonderful for me.</li>
            <li> Skin feels fantastic after using this product. Will definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> It seem very good, good price for this good face mask!</li>
            <li> Great item. Leaves skin feeling clean and clear. Great smell and quick drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a mask kind of girl, but as I&#x27;m heading towards the mid 30&#x27;s, my skin has been changing. I get more breakouts and my skin is dryer than normal. I&#x27;ve been using spot treatments for breakouts, but wanted to try something different, in hopes that my face will love me back in return. I was offered this Dead Sea Mud Mask for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it. the day it arrived, I decided to try it. Since it only takes 5-10 minutes to dry, I could get it done during nap time...that way I won&#x27;t scare the baby...lol! It was very easy to apply and has a nice scent to it. Almost a tea tree smell but lighter. I waited till it was dry, then started to wipe it off with warm water and a damp hand towel. As soon as I started removing the mask, my face had this warming sensation. It was so refreshing and my skin was beyond soft! I wanted to wait till the next day to write this because I wanted to see if my face would break out...Nope! Woke up this morning and my face is flawless! I definitely recommend this Dead Sea Mud Mask from PURE to anyone who wants to love their face!</li>
            <li> I received this PURE Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask via Brand Backer (Discloser: I am a blogger who received this for free to review). I have just recently gotten into beauty products and a beauty routine and have heard a lot about mud from the Dead Sea. Be careful when you open the packaging as it is sealed from the outside and doesn&#x27;t have an additional removable seal on the side (I was expecting one, so I almost sloshed this out all over my bathroom). I loved the smell and feel of this mask as I put it on - it has a tingling sensation and dries quickly. Once it dries, it will flake, so be careful if you are doing other things around the house as you wait for this to set. It washed off easily and I felt that my face was cleaner and smoother. The only downside was a faint lingering smell of mud (to be expected) which went away within a few minutes of washing off the mask. I really liked this product and I expect the bottle to last me quite a while!</li>
            <li> Love this product.. Makes my face feels so clean and smooth. It tingles but feels great.. Would buy again</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product. I am always searching for something to leave my skin feeling clean. I love the fact that this product is cruelty free and comes right from the dead sea. It leaves my skin clean and seems to get all the bad oils and such out of my pores. I highly recommend you give this product a try. FYI I have combination skin. This product did not leave my skin to dry or oily. It was perfect. I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> This product will mildew in a short period of time.  This is one thing that I was not aware of it when i purchased it.  I barely used it once and within a couple of weeks it had mildew in it.  I had to throw it away.  I will just buy local products for facial masks</li>
            <li> I have a very dry skin and have been looking for a mud mask for years.  Almost all of the deep cleaning mask that I tried made my skin super dry and even break out.  I was worry about ordering this but having such a good review, I decide to give it a try.  It is truly awesome and I feel so clean after using it.  Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t cause any break out, but also help me skin to absorb better with my skin care product.  Highly recommend even if you have a dry skin!!!  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Too minty on my skin.</li>
            <li> After just one use I would say I like it. It burned a little bit after a few minutes that got better. After washing it off my face felt toned and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had alot of mud masks and this one is by far the best one.it isnt thick like most of them.it goes on smooth .I&#x27;ve noticed that it exfoliates my skin without making it seem raw.You can feelbit working from the tingling sensation whike you have it on.To me it had a slight eucalyptus smell.but my sister(who uses it too)Says it has a mint smell.It comes off easy even out of your hair..Your skin feels really clean and light after you wash it off.You can tell after a few days that your skin feels really smooth.it reduce the oiliness of my skin but it didnt leave it so dry and tight that I was scared to smile.My sisters skin is drumier than mine and it helped her&#x27;s feel smooth(I felt it).After a few days I noticed my brown spots were brighter.I&#x27;m looking forward to them beingvgone.I&#x27;m glad I received this in a promtion to review because I would never have bought it.When this runs out I will gladly buy it again.Just read the directions so you don&#x27;t over do it and dry or skin out.I also like that it comes with an ebook.It&#x27;s always better to know you are doing it right.</li>
            <li> Amazing ! My wife loves it!&lt;br /&gt;You just found a repeat customer !</li>
            <li> Its a great mask which made my acne diminished and now my skin is really smooth and clear. I felt a bit itchy at first when it dried out but after washing my face it does not dry the skin..My skin looks really fresh and clean. Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> Gave me FIVE cystic pimples + some other pimples after finally having my face clearer. It didn&#x27;t help with my blackheads (left for ten minutes). I would return it but I don&#x27;t like returning things..I think I might only use it on my nose for longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I have tried better Dead Sea masks though !</li>
            <li> Absolutely love everything about this product. Makes my skin feel like a million dollars!</li>
            <li> Pretty damn good. I had a facial mask from a foreign country and that was pretty damn good. I bought this because I ran out of the other facial mask and it&#x27;s hard to get. This is nearly just as good. I can feel the burn, but it&#x27;s worth it if you want some good skin. I use this product weekly btw which is probably why I feel the burn everytime. But good product and will probably last me a couple of months.</li>
            <li> My mother uses this mud mask and she loves it.  Great item for great results</li>
            <li> I searched for a Mud mask that would be suitable for sensitive skin and this is what I got, I read only positive reviews and decided to buy it. As other reviewers mentioned it burns your skin, but I waited 5 minutes since some products are supposed to be slightly burning. I wish I hadn&#x27;t. Other than burning and turning my skin into scarlet red, I do not see any difference - normally mud masks cleanse your pores really well. So, I really do not get it - why so many positive reviews? Perhaps it&#x27;s for people with very oily skin!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will try to return it!</li>
            <li> This product dried out my skin like I didn&#x27;t know possible.  It&#x27;s taken about two weeks to rehydrate my skin and stop it from peeling.  I can only imagine this product for someone who has some seriously oily skin...even then, I&#x27;d be cautious.  My skin is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; and non-sensitive.  I have never had a product have anywhere near the outcome I&#x27;ve experienced here.</li>
            <li> Very deceptive: Pure is only the brand name, not a title.&lt;br /&gt;Only had it on for 30sec before I had to wash it off, I guess my skin is too sensitive. It feels like Icy hot and peppermint extract - nowhere near &amp;#34;natural mud&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with the purchase . Once you put it on, it  does sting a little bit and the face gets a little bit red. THIS IS NORMAL,  so  the  best time to use the mask  is in the evening.  The next morning the face looks fabulous , skin is soft and very moisturized  . Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I freakin LOVE this stuff! It smells a bit weird yes, but its not too terrible and my skin feels amazing after!</li>
            <li> Not observe any change in my skin before and after using this item just not waste your money</li>
            <li> this mask is great and cleaning the pores and has a cooling effect.</li>
            <li> this left my face feeling refreshed &amp; smooth!! I will use it often!!</li>
            <li> My skin felt much smoother and certainly less oily after even one use! My only complaint is the smell. The eucalyptus oil in it smells nice, but it isn&#x27;t the primary smell. After it the product is on my face the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask and i thought it was a bit pricy but it came with an ebook about keeping a healthy skin and i have been using it for about 4 weeks maybe.&lt;br /&gt;It does tingle and make my eyes watery for about a minute but then its gone. Skin feels super soft and pleasan to touch after washing off.&lt;br /&gt;However i dot still have redness on my face and a little but of pimples but im hoping it takes time for it to start working!&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This mud mask has to be one of the best things I received from Amazon. I know I have purchased electronics and beauty tools but this mud mask feels like heaven. It smells minty. The mud didn&#x27;t run as I took it out of the jar and placed it on my face. I was pleasantly surprised that it did not dry as you would assume traditional mud would. This made the removal of it (I kept it on my face well over 20 minutes) very easy. I just face products off of how easy they are to remove. Some products are more trouble to remove than the results they garner. My skin actually felt tighter-not dry, just better. The mask cleared off makeup I thought I had removed the night prior. This has removed my need for an acne treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product sent to me for purposes of review</li>
            <li> It stings and smells a little weird. Immediately after my skin is more even but I haven&#x27;t seen any lasting effects.</li>
            <li> You can totally tell this stuff is REAL as it pulls and tingles ( a bit). and has a medicine smell to it. It&#x27;s not overbearing you can just tell it smells like that :-)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this! all natural and top of the line ingredients! My skin feels lovely!</li>
            <li> This is my First time use this Product ,  I hope it&#x27;s good on for my skin and works well</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and leaves my skin soft soft soft and clear! I will never be without this product again!!</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical about this Dead Sea mud mask, but I realllllly needed a new face mask. This says it has plenty of applications in the jar, and judging by the amount I just used I would have to agree. It says to use once a week which I will follow.my face and neck feel so clean, but not dry or rough. Would I recommend...yessssss!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using once a week but twice just because my skin is to oily and when I&#x27;m cicling my face is a mess and it actually works no pimples no blackheads my skin feels so fresh :D and u actually can feel the difference on the first use.</li>
            <li> It was okay. I bought this last year because once I decided 2 try products without chemicals on face, my face decided to break out like crazy. This mask was okay but it did not do what I expected it to do. I just ran out of it finally but I will not be purchasing it again. I am going to look for something else to try.</li>
            <li> OMG the most wonder mud mask ever. It smells, but the tingle is amazing!</li>
            <li> It did sting a little bit but I think that was the eucalyptus in the product.  Thankfully did not bring my face up so I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I really liked how my face felt after using this mask, I don&#x27;t think I will use the free e-book but if someone wants to use it, that is an added extra bonus. I will definitely use again!</li>
            <li> I suffer from Graves&#x27; Disease and the hormonal imbalances often times cause my skin to break out no matter what products I use or how healthy my diet is. I am getting married in two weeks and unfortunately my skin has broken out. I am a big fan of Proactiv, but it wasn&#x27;t working quick enough to clear up my skin. So I decided to give this a try. I can honestly say that it has made a very big difference in the overall appearance of my skin. I use it once a day, and may even increase it to twice a day, for about 15-20 minutes (or until it is completely dry) and when I remove it, my skin looks so fresh and revitalized. It has also helped to speed up the disappearance of the acne and it appears to be stopping new acne from forming. I am very happy I found this!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this mud mask! When I first opened it, it smelled like peppermint, very pleasant! I put it on after I showered and it burned slightly. It was a nice tingle, nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle. I let it harden and after about 7 minutes I started to rub if off my skin and exfoliated my skin with my hands; all I did was rub it around with my fingers and got as most off as I could and I rinsed off with lukewarm water after and I applied a bit of jojoba oil after and my skin felt amazing!! I completely recommend this product. Simply amazing!</li>
            <li> I like the mask. It&#x27;s kind of hard to get the right amount on, but once you figure it out, it&#x27;s nice. It doesn&#x27;t really exfoliate, but I use a washcloth to remove the mask, so that helps. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Although the smell is not the best, I am really loving the results! My skin looks and feels younger, softer, clean, bright, popes are smaller, acne is going away... I just love it! I only wish I&#x27;d bought enough for a weekly body treatment!!</li>
            <li> I have comination skin &amp; i have large pores after washing this mask there is some spot from mask in my face dosent go and i make some effort by sponge to release it . I will not buy it again</li>
            <li> This is really working for my brother.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! After every use my skin feels so fresh and clean and soft. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I did buy this on a promotion and didn&#x27;t pay full price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product for my wife and she really enjoyed it (this review on her behalf)! She said it had a great scent and made her face feel really clean, soft, and smooth after using it. She&#x27;s used other masks in the past and this is a lot thinner and easier to apply than some of those others. The ingredients appear to be all natural with no chemicals, which is great.</li>
            <li> This Mud Facial Mask made my skin feel so good. I received it today and used it right away, and found after that my skin felt smooth, clean, and soft. It was an easy product to use, as well as to wipe off from my skin. I would recommend purchasing this product. I was lucky and bought it at a deeply discounted price, but would pay full price for this product!</li>
            <li> This smells a bit but it&#x27;s just a sulfur smell. It works for cleansing, eczema, acne, and pore tightening.  You have to wash your face and hairline very well afterwards to get rid of the smell. Don&#x27;t do it right before a date... Great product.</li>
            <li> I liked the fresh smell. Tingly but not too much for my skin though my daughter said it was a bit strong for her face. My skin felt clean after using the mask.</li>
            <li> I really like it. I saw all the reviews so I wanted to try it. I feel like it get&#x27;s toxins out and really cleans skin of impurities. My skin feels tighter (30 years old no wrinkles) after I use it.</li>
            <li> I found this mask at a steal of a deal! I have been wanting to try a mud mask forever. I don&#x27;t know much about them, but I thought the texture was nice and the smell was interesting mix of mud and eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put it on my skin burned, that is eucalyptus oil causing it. I left it on for only 5 minutes unsure of how my skin would react. The last type of mask left my skin red. My skin is a little pink, but feel super soft. As it dried the sting slowly went away. I have used this product twice now and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Dead Sea mud masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was extremely quick. Now to download my free ebook</li>
            <li> i like this stuff i like how it works but my skin is sensitive so it broke me out by peeling my skin off and turning it to scabs  im sure if i did not have sensitive skin i would be ok but i will not be buying this product again although i like it....</li>
            <li> Love this product. Fast and easy to use</li>
            <li> Made my face feel really nice and smooth. I have used it once so far and am really happy with it! Looking forward to using it again.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised , the only problem is you need to stir contents before applying to face . It left my face soft and smooth after using it twice in a week. Don&#x27;t leave it on more than 10 minutes it does have a slight burning effect if you do.</li>
            <li> Try this experiment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put Apple Cider Vinegar on your face for 2 weeks. See if it clears up your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the mud mask serves to do is hold the Apple Cider Vinegar, and give your skin a slight alkaline burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sand comes from the Nevada Desert. If you&#x27;ve ever been to burning man and have gotten that fine dust in everything, this the same stuff. It is dust that is heavily alkaline.</li>
            <li> So, I need to say that my skin is...annoying. It isn&#x27;t awful looking, I&#x27;m just pale so it&#x27;s blotchy and I break out more than a normal 21 year old would. It&#x27;s not terrible, but I haven&#x27;t felt okay with my skin since middle school. I&#x27;ve tried everything. Seriously. I&#x27;ve tried proactive, prescription medicine, thousands of cleansers and washes, natural aloe oil cleansers and vitamin E cream, and nothing. Ever. Works. I should also add I have moderate eczema.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I learned of this mud, and how it has all these really great oils and stuff in it. And I thought...well, what do  have to lose?&lt;br /&gt;You guys, I left a decent layer on my skin for 10 minutes, and did what the instructions said, and my skin wasn&#x27;t perfect, but it was brighter, more even toned, and healthier looking after just the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally suggest it. I also never write reviews, so that&#x27;s sayin something!(:</li>
            <li> I love this mud mask! It made my face so soft and took my oily shine away!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I love this mask. It was a little strong tingling feeling at first but it wasn&#x27;t painful. It smells very mintyish is the best word. It washes off like a dream for a mask. It was easy and clean. Came right off. My skin felt smooth and actual clean kind of a feeling. It wasn&#x27;t tingly cold feeling it was like my skin felt full and soft. It was a nice and relaxing 10 min.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels amazing! It definitely burns but if you hold out through the pain it will all be worth it!</li>
            <li> This Mud Mask is great. I have been looking for something to clean and exfoliate without making my skin even more oily or going the extreme opposite and creating those gross dry patches. The Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask works perfectly. My skin feels clean, soft, and smooth. The Eucalyptus is a little strong. the smell wasn&#x27;t bad, but I have sensitive skin and I did feel a slight burning sensation for a few seconds and that was it. It washes off easily and you don&#x27;t get the issue of it wanting to cling to whatever hair you accidentally get it in. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I’ve used a few different types of masks, and what I really like about this one is that you don’t have to mix it with anything, it applies easily and doesn’t leave a gritty mess in your sink when you rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A thin layer is all you need and after using it once a week my for a few weeks, I noticed that my skin is smoother with less blemishes.</li>
            <li> Love this mud face mask! So easy to put on and take off and it leaves my skin so soft and glowing. Great value for the the money</li>
            <li> Ok, so basically I never write reviews, and I am writing one for this product because it is amazing!!!! I noticed on here that people say it has a weird or gross smell, but I didn&#x27;t think so. It smells like the essential oils that are in it, which to me, smells great. Essential oils are beneficial even when they are just inhaled so you get more than just the benefits in your skin. &#x3D;) Anyway, I have really bad forehead wrinkles caused by sun exposure...and really bad acne...and really oily skin...and an awful skin tone. My face is awful! One time usage of this stuff, and seriously I looked younger, my tone was evened out, my skin was super soft, and my forehead wrinkles were less noticeable....HELLO! Amazing product here, I am so excited about it I even ordered the dead sea mud soap so I can lather my entire body in this stuff! By it....you won&#x27;t regret it. And a little goes a long ways, so it is worth the money! Get it...get it!!! Just do it, you will be sooooo happy I promise. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This mask is abusolutely amzing. After use that you can easily to see how it works. Although it is kind of smell but it is really useful. Also this mask is a big size, you can use it to the whole face and it still can use for a long time. If you look for a clean mask, buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft. And it doesn&#x27;t try my face out!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> This works very well. It has a strong minty feel and you can feel it works. So I would not leave on longer than the recommended time.</li>
            <li> I cannot say this has changed my complexion/skin in any way, BUT it is a good exfoliating mask - I use it at least twice a week and my skin feels cleaner afterwards and not dried out! Will definitely use this again!</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing!  I am a mask lover, and have tried my fair share of moisturizing masks, deep cleaning masks, masks to make your skin less dull, etc.  This mask seems to be good for everything.  It smells really good and feels amazing when you put it on, very refreshing.  After 15-20 minutes, you rinse and are left with clean, yet moisturized skin.  This is definitely one of my new favorite skin care items.</li>
            <li> Odor is a bit strong, but the product works well on pores. I would recommend this for this price also.</li>
            <li> I guess my skin is to sensitive to it because a few seconds after i put it on it started to burn. Just be careful if it start to burn or makes your face red then stop using it.</li>
            <li> Made my face feel soft and fresh the first use and is clearing out my flaws in my face.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive of paying this much for this face mask, but I am glad I purchased it ! It has a really nice feeling to it, like it is authentic. I liked the tingly feeling and look forward to using it again. Money well spent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very similar to other Mud masks, but I LOVE mud masks, so it&#x27;s alright by me!</li>
            <li> Great product as it helps with my pores. This mask clears up my pores where it is now barely noticeable. You only need to use this mask weekly but my pores are still very clean from initial cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;When you put this makes on it has this tingling sensation. After 3 or so minutes the mask will dry. You are suppose to leave it on 5-10 minutes.  My face does feel very clean after I wash off the mask.&lt;br /&gt;I have no opinion of other benefits (anti-aging, less wrinkles, smoother skin) of yet as I have not use the product long enough. I will update this review as time passes&lt;br /&gt;Overall I enjoy this using the Dead Sea Mask. It helps cleans my pores and make it less noticeable. It is also does an excellent job of cleaning my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have receive this product at a reduce price in return for a honest .review</li>
            <li> Been looking for a good mud mask and was going to buy something else for $60. This works perfect for fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly.  I have used Dead Sea Mud from other companies for years and like the products, but this one is the best.  There is Eucalyptus oil in it, which smells heavenly.  It also does not sting like some other brands when left on too long.  It seems to have the same effect of infusing minerals into my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this mask because I am a lover of face masks and anything dead sea. I raised my eyebrows at the price tag but I was lucky enough to be given the product at a cheaper price for review. After following the directions and putting it on, it gave the slight tingle and tightening that I look forward to with these types of masks. I do have sensitive skin so I was a bit worried, but I had no irritation. My skin felt remarkably smoother and tighter with shrinking of pores. This is comparable to the Ahava masks and some Korean beauty masks I have tried and I would defintely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of it and it felt my skin feeling smooth</li>
            <li> Ok, I  am so, so disappointed in this product.  I had planned a spa-type night with my two teenage girls, and when the opportunity to review this product came up, I  was so excited, as I had heard such good things about dead sea mud, salt, masks, etc. I was so excited. It didn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is nice, smooth, with just a few little smaller particles in it. But, hey,  it&#x27;s mud, so, all&#x27;s cool. The scent in the jar is pleasant.  It spreads on smooth, and it does go on thin. That&#x27;s a little different than other masks I&#x27;ve used, but it was nice. We applied a thin layer,  leaving large spaces for our eyes. All went well for about a minute.  What began as a pleasant tingle became more and more intense, until my face was on fire. Not &amp;#34; oh, it burns a little.&amp;#34; It shot right past that into your brain screaming &amp;#34;Get it off! GET IT OFF!!&amp;#34; The RED ALERT was sounding in my head! At this time, my oldest child was near tears saying her face was also burning. We grabbed washcloths and washed it off. Water made it WORSE.  My face was red, shiny, swollen. My eyes were also red, watering, burning, and hurting. The swelling took ten minutes to start to subside. The burning continued for almost a half-hour. I  found that water,  no matter the temp, made it worse,  as did Aloe Vera gel. It is now the next day, and my face has a rough texture  red bumps all over my cheeks and burns if I  place coconut oil or Shea Butter on it. I&#x27;m at a loss. I  feel like our pet bearded dragon, and that&#x27;s just not how you should feel after a beauty treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have looked over the ingredients,  and I  am  still not sure what caused this reaction. The ingredients are : dead sea mud, organic Shea Butter,  organic sunflower oil. Organic Aloe Vera juice, organic vegetable glycerin, organic jojoba oil, hickory bark extract, organic calendula oil, filtered water, xanthan gum, eucalyptus oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used almost all of these ingredients except for hickory bark extract and calendula oil. I have never used eucalyptus near my face,  so maybe? Oh, and, of course, dead sea mud. Something lit my face on fire and caused a reaction. I wish I  knew what, as I would avoid it forever. My one kid was unaffected,  my kid that also had a burning face had no lasting effects after about 20 mins. After removing the mud, a very strange smell lingers. It starts off very mineral,  progressing to slightly fishy, and finishes off pure lake mud. A nice citrus hand soap will take the smell off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions expressed are my own.e never used eucalyptus near my face,  so maybe? Oh, and, of course, dead sea mud. Something lit my face on fire and caused a reaction.

            <li> Love this stuff! My face feels so much smoother after using it and the it smells great!</li>
            <li> Was provided this for review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved this mask and I have tried a lot.  The formula was great as it was thick enough to apply well but not too thick.  I was able to perfectly smooth this onto my skin.  The smell wasn&#x27;t the most beautiful thing ever but it&#x27;s not going to be when you use this type of product.  Was able to leave my skin feeling fantastic and very deeply cleaned.  You get so many uses out of this jar because it&#x27;s so big!</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive skin and acne. It sucks. I tried everything. This mask actually improved my skin without any side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells very mud like and vaguely surfuric, but not unpleasant. You can feel it working and it is wonderful. Skin feels soft and rejuvenated after use.</li>
            <li> The packaging is a wide mouth container which is my preference over tubes.  The mud is very fine, not gritty, or overly thick.  It is easy to apply in a thin, even layer. The smell is fantastic, smells like peppermint, although no mint is listed in the ingredients. The mask is easy to clean off and does not leave your face dry or your skin tight like most masks. I look forward to using it weekly. The price is more than I would typically pay for a jar of mud. My skin feels clean and ready to receive dirt again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works I can feel the tightness on my face. Will order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 2 months ago. At first I tried to follow the instruction but it was hurting my skin. After trying it once every week I finally learned the right way to use it for me. I have sensitive skin. So even though it said &amp;#34;medium layer&amp;#34; I really should put a think layer on my face instead. If you feel that it is too strong for your skin or feel dry afterwards, it&#x27;s possible that you&#x27;ve used too much too. The best way to figure it out is to have just enough so that it dries within 10-15 minutes. If you leave it on your skin for too long it will definitely hurt. With a thin layer, I can actually rub it off like it said in the instruction. It works great and makes my skin really soft. I still get a little negative reaction here and there on small spots but I think it&#x27;s normally. Just a little itchy and I can totally deal with it. Definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> I love the cool mint feel during application. My skin feels very supple right after application. I would definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> Love it and it does work, but it makes a mess when you remove it.  I take it off in the shower, because it makes a huge mess in the sink / counter and leaves lots of silt behind.  But, its MUD, so that&#x27;s fine.  Just beware.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing my third purchase of PURE Dead Sea Mud Mask. This product is a must-have for those who live with OILY skin. When I say oily skin, I mean that skin where no makeup stays on for more than a few hours, every time you blot, the tissue becomes almost transparent, blackheads are a daily project, and you leave a smug on every phone you use. If you have this kind of oiliness, you know exactly what I am talking about. After 2 weeks of using 3 times per week (I pushed the frequency up, twice is recommended), the blackheads take longer to come back. The corners of my nose feel more like normal skin. Makeup stays longer without any additional primers! I have shift from doing my entire face to my most troublesome areas (nose, cheeks and chine). I can say this is a game-changer for anyone looking to control oily skin. I am going to experiment with their other products as well.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the smell it does a great job......................Even so I am sure I would order it again........</li>
            <li> I love this mask because it&#x27;s actually works on my skin and a little goes a long way.  I bought this a couple months ago and I use it about 1-2 times a week. Still only a 1/4 of the jar has been used. Definitely will buy again (if I ever actually run out)!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other masks and this one is by far my favorite. My skin has never felt so soft and by morning, I could see such a difference in my face.  I looked very refreshed! No breakouts or redness afterwards.  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is that the smell is very pungent.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just potent.  I will continue to use this mask and recommend it to other users!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. Here is what she has to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Nice texture. The right amount of muddiness and moisture ratio to properly apply the mask. Even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I was surprised by the almost burning sensation, seemingly caused by the eucalyptus plant. Powerful stuff. Rinsed it off and unlike with many masks, which once rinsed off leave the skin feeling stripped and squeaky clean, this one left my skin feeling like I had already applied moisturizer and allowed it to absorb. I also had a nice glow. So far, very promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knock one star off only because the burning sensation was so strong, it was almost painful. I&#x27;d warn people who have very sensitive skin to be careful.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was given this item to review. The texture of the mask is smooth and creamy. The smell wasn&#x27;t all that bad, but not great. That wasn&#x27;t the worst part. I placed it on my skin in about two minutes, my face felt like it was on fire! I tried to breathe through the pain but it was so overwhelming I had to run to the bathroom and wipe it off my face. I lasted barely the minimum 5 minutes. I would not recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this mask weekly and have had nothing but the best results.  It leaves the skin smooth and young looking that lasts and it feels great.  Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask felt so good on my face. My face felt cool and not gunked up like other products that I have tried. After 10 minutes when I washed the mask off of my face and neck all I felt was a revived clean face. My face has not become dried out to the point of having to put on a facial lotion. It is a wonderful Feeling!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> really good. and the deliver speed is really great.you will feel comfortable, your face will cool! and a good smell</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast. I couldn&#x27;t wait to open the package and try it out. And OMG it is fantastic. Would totally buy again</li>
            <li> It is definitely a jar of mud. I recommend stirring it before use.  It did burn my face when I used it, but just for a few minutes.  Did leave my skin sort and clean.</li>
            <li> I have been doing skin care for 39 years and have used a a lot of products. I love this Mud Mask. If you want to see an amazing change in your skin try this mask. For the price it delivers everything it claims and my clients just love it.&lt;br /&gt;Gail E.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far (in a 1 week period) and so far I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very smooth in the skin and it feels really refreshing while it&#x27;s working!&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels clean and light after using!</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast and it comes in a cute little box. This mask is soft and leaves your face super soft and I feel like it will help with pore minimizing. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask. My face feels so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough wonderful things about this product. It definitely exceeded my expectations. Yes it&#x27;s tingled ALOT initially but quickly went away &amp; my skin was at its best I&#x27;ve ever seen.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but I don&#x27;t know if it made me break out</li>
            <li> My wife can&#x27;t stop using this stuff. Every morning and evening she has the mud on her face. She loves the way it makes her face feel and I don&#x27;t mind it either. Recommended to purchase. Arrived fast and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because my skin really feels amazing while the mask is on and once it is washed off.  At first, I was skeptical about the product because there were some negative reviews on the storing and keep of this product.  It has been at least 2 months since I have had it, there is no issues with the storing of it and the product has remained the same as when I first received it.  It is stored in my bathroom cabinet away from any heat or sun light.  Good product and would recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Leave on for 20 mins feel the cool sensation and wash off with warm water ,skin feels soft and looks bright. Love this!! Definitely recommend this....</li>
            <li> I still remember the first time to use it after I got it from Amazon. My face feel burning and I didn&#x27;t like it at all! I wanted to wash my face and I told myself to tolerate it for another 3 minutes. The burning went away and after I washed my face, I found my skin smoother and I love the clean feeling. I have been using it for a month now. I love this product and my skin is becoming more radiant.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mask that would tighten as it dries and leave a clean that I can feel.  I found it.</li>
            <li> I tried the dead sea mud mask for the first time a few days ago. It has a great smell. It felt tingly the whole time it was on my face. The mask left my face feeling refreshed and really smooth.</li>
            <li> So for the first 6 weeks or so I was fairly happy with this product. The ingredients include shea butter and eucalyptus oil, so don&#x27;t get too excited about the mud, but overall I thought it was pleasant and at least somewhat effective. Then when I opened it up for my weekly mask on about the 6th week there was bright blue mold growing in it! I didn&#x27;t even think that was possible. I certainly didn&#x27;t take any particular measures to prevent mold but I always had clean hands when handling it and my home is mold free so I don&#x27;t know where this came from/how it managed to survive. This is probably a one time situation, but it is weird enough that I will try another mask next time.</li>
            <li> Love it. Ive been useing this every night now for almost two weeks. I have very oily skin and this helps tighten my pores and reduce the oiliness and breakouts on my face with out over drying. I highly recommend for anyone suffering with Acne to try this out.</li>
            <li> Wow, I really love this and so does my teenage daughter. She has problem skin and breakouts and this is really helping to dry those pimples up. I love the way it makes my skin feel and I would recommend this for anyone looking for nice, clean, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I am currently still testing this one but so far i really like it I like the size, the texture it is easy to apply. I will comeback in a few more days to give a more detailed review.</li>
            <li> My official report from my wife is that this mud mask smells terrible--but works great! She loves the way her skin feels after she uses it, and everything on the ingredients list meets her beauty standards. She said that the first time it when on her skin tingled a little but didn&#x27;t hurt. She took that as a good sign that it was working. She is a definite fan and has done a couple of treatments know, so all thumbs up on this mud mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Super good leaves my skin radiant and Fresca. I loved wholeheartedly recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> I got this  mask two weeks ago. I use it 3 to 4 times per week. My pores are getting visibly smaller. Great product!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new face mask as the one I use was changed. This one sounded good but when I tried it, it burned my skin. After about 10 seconds my face started to tingle which didn&#x27;t seem like a problem. But after another 30 seconds it started to burn so I took it off. My face was red and sore for the next day. I&#x27;ve never had this happen before. I ended up throwing out the face mask since I missed the window to return it.</li>
            <li> It is a really good mask since I have a sensitive and oily skin. Every time after i used, i felt so refresh and clean. It helps my skin glow and breathable. I recommend to every body to give a try</li>
            <li> Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is super invigorating! If you are looking for a mask that will WAKE your skin up then try this! I thought that it smelled strongly of peppermint oil but I was wrong because there is not mint in the ingredients. Maybe it is the Eucalyptus oil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients include Pure Dead Sea Mud, Organic Shea Butter, Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Aloe Vera Juice, Organic Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Jojoba Oil, Hickory Bark Extract, Organic Calendula Oil, Eucalyptus Oil, Filtered Water, Xanthan Gum. The mud is sorced from Israel and Jordan but the product is assembled here in the USA with the other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not wash your face or do any other kind of strong treatments before doing this mask. You don&#x27;t want you skin &amp;#34;overexposed&amp;#34; because the oils in this are strong and will really really tingle. I kept mine on for almost 10 minutes before I had to wash it off.. my face was very tingly and when I went to wash off the mask for a final rinse with cold water my face was kind of numb. Not in a bad way just a VERY tingly way. So maybe patch test this before you try it. I would do it at maximum once a week for my normal skin. Maybe every 2 weeks would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells good. Like I said before.. like peppermints and like a spa.I mean it is part mud so you can&#x27;t expect it to smell like fresh flowers but it definitely does not smell awful. The oils really help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt nice and bright and clean after. It was super invigorating so I would do this in the AM if you want to feel AWAKE! Definitely avoid the thin skin around your eyes and be careful if you have any painful blemishes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I have so-so skin (some acne, combination skin, and hyperpigmentation), I am always trying different products that might be able to help out. I have tried dead sea products before and actually liked the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product the day I got it in the mail. First time using the product, I put the mask on about 20 minutes before I got in the shower. Seems easier to me to remove. It seemed cool on my face. I could feel it drying. My face and neck feels more hydrated, smooth and tight. After one use I noticed my pores were not as prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked well and was a completely safe and natural product.  The mud mask seems to pull toxins out of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it and see how it works out over time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift and my friend LOVES this product! She raved at how well it works and how amazing her skin feels afterwards. I may need to buy this product for myself!</li>
            <li> Only works in first couple times.</li>
            <li> Works AMAZING. BUT smells kind of bad. but for how great my skin feels and looks after using it makes it totally worth it. My pores look smaller and my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li> I liked the overall result of this product, but there was a stinging sensation in the beginning, which disappeared a few minutes later. Maybe it is supposed to do that, I am not sure. The end result was good, smoother skin and less wrinkle lines. I am glad I was given a code to get this product at a dr&lt;br /&gt;Is counted rate.</li>
            <li> I am not usually one to write reviews but this product is great.  In only a few uses, I have seen an improvement in my overall skin tone/complexion.  It has also decreased the size of my pores.  I look forward to continuing use of the product for additional results.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good size container for $25. Masks are normally more expensive...It does have a burning sensation when you apply it but it goes away in a couple minutes and does not irritate the skin. I like it :)</li>
            <li> Based on my experience, 2-3x applications a week for the past a few weeks, my skin feels tight &amp; clean afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked a touch of mint, which soothes my skin, while I have it on.  The grains of the mud are very fine, so that makes it a nice exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good &amp; removes easily (unless you leave it on for too long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I got this mask a few weeks ago and have been continuously using it every week since. I love the tingle sensation and how refreshed my skin feels afterwards. I was also shock to see how very little mask spread out far on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask 4 times, the last two times it had small  pieces of grit in it. Is that normal?  Other than that I like the way it makes my skin feel after using it. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t sting too much. Now that I&#x27;ve used 4 times I can really see a difference in the way my face looks-more toned, smoother and brighter. I tried to use it on my blemishes over-night, but it didn&#x27;t clear them up. If you&#x27;re looking for a good value mud mask, this one is good, a big 6 oz jar! It&#x27;s much easier to remove in the shower.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the face mask. I like the way the ingredients in the mask tingles, feels likes it working. I have only used it a couple times, but it doesnt make me break out so thats a plus! my skin is softer too!!</li>
            <li> After one mask I can see a difference!!!</li>
            <li> Had a for a few weeks and I already see results, lol no I&#x27;m not being paid to put this it really does work (&#x27;:</li>
            <li> Left my skin so soft! I really liked and recommend it.</li>
            <li> it smells a little strange but it leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh and clean. great product. definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! A definitely must have! My skin has changed since I star using it. It&#x27;s cleaner and brighter. It&#x27;s a spa treatment at home!</li>
            <li> Love it my face is smoother my pores are no so big and no new breakouts since I started using</li>
            <li> I received a free product to sample on my blog. I was very pleased with the use of this mud. It has a lighter feeling than other muds I have used, and it goes on smooth and fast. I find I use much less of this mud than others I have purchased, so a container of this will last you a lot longer than other types.&lt;br /&gt;There is a nice eucalyptus scent to it that reminds me of the spa at the Luxor in Vegas.. loved that place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pores appear smaller, and my face feels great after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product has a small that does not seem natural. The vendor told me it was eucalyptus, but I&#x27;ve never smelled a eucalyptus like that before. It also seemed to make my skin breakout more. All in all, a real let down. I&#x27;ve used Aztec Secret bentonite clay with great results and will go back to that.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It feels so good when you put it on, and it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re at a little day spa. It makes my skin so bright and glowing, I can&#x27;t stop raving about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a week and it helps with my redness and dry spots. Gotta love this amazing mask!</li>
            <li> This Mask is beautiful! It has this thick muddy feeling to it and also a real mud color! Right after applying I get this tingling sensation on my skin which probably comes from the Eucalyptus Oil. If you have sensitive skin this might not be the right choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I have oily skin and my skin feels super balanced after applying this mask! I feel like my skin gets cleansed from deep within and enjoyed this mask a lot! Why is mud from the Dead Sea special? The Dead Sea is 1400 feet below sea level and the lowest pint on the earth´s surface. The healing properties of its mineral- rich mud are known for centuries. I find it very unique to know that I am applying real mud from ground of the Dead Sea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This facial mask is for sure for everybody who has oily skin and if you have any impurities and for those I recommend this for sure!</li>
            <li> I am constantly hunting for better beauty products. It can be tough weeding through them, however, because there is literally so much stuff on the market today. I was stoked when I got approved to review this mud mask because it couldn&#x27;t have come up at a better time. I suffer from acne and oily skin. My acne is the kind that REALLY sucks because not only do I look like I have pepperoni on my face sometimes it also HURTS...... badly. As soon as I got this stuff in the mail I tried it out. My son said &amp;#34;where did mommy go&amp;#34; because of the dark color of the mask. It felt like a spa experience. The smell was very pleasant and it didn&#x27;t stink like some masks do. My favorite thing about it though is that as soon as you wash it off you can feel how soft and nourished  your skin feels. It also helps to reduce the size of my breakouts and takes some of the pain away. This one is definitely a double duty beauty product that you need to try out when you are ready to splurge on a little something for yourself!</li>
            <li> As a kid I loved playing in the mud I would create huge mud baths in our driveway. Now as an adult it turns out that mud is good for your skin who knew I was ahead of the beauty market at 5. Ok so maybe my mud wasn&#x27;t the same as those sold in stores but it was good fun. Hence we come to the subject of Dead Sea Mud or more correctly a Dead Sea Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Dead Sea Mud Mask by Pure &amp; Essential minerals. There Dead Sea Mud contains over 21 skin-reviving minerals including magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium. These essential minerals are present in our bodies, but are lost as we age. These minerals are also known to treat, detoxify, and cleanse our skin, to keep it us looking young and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the benefits of using the Dead Sea Mud Mask. Well there is the Anti-aging properties such as tighten the pores promoting young, healthy natural skin. Rich Dead Sea minerals clean, heal, soften and revitalize your skin for that all day glow. Plus the organic essential oils moisturize and hydrate your skin, helping to reduce wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of all that amazing work this product contain 100% pure, natural and certified organic ingredients that are free of sulfates, phosphates and parabens. It&#x27;s also cruelty free and  vegan certified. So you know you are not adding anything unhealthy to your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me I loved the cool feel of the mud on my skin. I found it easy to apply and not at all messy. I could even feel it working by the slight tingling feel to my skin. After applying I let it set for about 5 to 10 minutes which is all it took for it to dry thoroughly. then I rinsed it off and my skin was left feeling refreshed and clean. I have since started doing this mask twice a week and my skin is so much softer. As for the wrinkles my son says he can still see them(we know who is grounded for life right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I enjoyed using this product and it was a real treat to my skin. As for price it is a little up there but considering a small amount goes along way and that I only use it twice a week I&#x27;m good with it.  I would say if your looking for an all natural way to achieve healthy looking skin this is a good choice.and it was a real treat to my skin.

            <li> First off, I wasn’t too impressed with the packaging. I don’t like tubs to begin with, and especially with something like a mask (which you would definitely want to remain hygienic), it’s a huge disappointment for me. I can tolerate it with a body butter, as the skin on your body is usually less reactive to germ exposure than the skin on your face, but I get really squicked by face products that come in tubs. I imagine I’ll be able to use this mask maybe a handful of times before I start to worry the product has been too contaminated to continue using on my face without prompting a breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting past the packaging, the next thing I was confronted with was the smell. This mask has an incredibly strong scent – one of the major ingredients is eucalyptus oil, and you can’t miss the menthol odor at all, but it also has a strong earthy smell from the mud. I’ve used plenty of mud masks over the course of my life, and many had no strong odor, so there must be ways to get around the earthiness present in the mud. When combined with the intense eucalyptus, it’s not all that pleasant… I do enjoy the smell of menthol, so if that was the only detectable scent, I’m sure it wouldn’t bother me in the slightest. It’s the combination with the mud smell that takes things into questionable territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, the product itself doesn’t fall flat. This is what I expect from a mud mask: thick, dense consistency that sits heavy on the face and dries really solid to the point that it’ll crack if you move your face too much. It really feels like it’s pulling out anything trapped in my pores without parching my skin, and after rinsing it off, I was left with a squeaky-clean feel that was fresh but not at all tight. In this regard, I think the eucalyptus oil is a brilliant addition to the formula – it really works well with the mud to purify the skin. I also love how it seems to calm some of the redness in my skin, leaving it veryeven-toned and almost glowy. Pure &amp; Essential Minerals has done an excellent job of including ingredients that condition the skin without being too moisturizing, with the end result being what I consider to be the perfect mud mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I’m of a mixed opinion on this mask. If only the packaging and scent weren’t so off-putting, I’d definitely repurchase this and add it to my usual rotation because the formula truly is awesome.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product, as I thought it would help my skin. However, I have sensitive skin. When I put it on my face it immediately began to burn.Normally that only happens with synthetic fragrances, so maybe there was something in it that I didn&#x27;t see in the list of ingredients. I was glad to try it, just disappointed that I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I love this facial mask and I like using it. It feels very refreshing to the skin and the scent is really something. My acne scars are not that visible anymore and I get acnes less likely than I used to before. I&#x27;m never replacing this one no matter what.</li>
            <li> I had to wash it off as soon as it touched my face. It turned my face red and burned also. I would not recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I always had very sensitive skin and tried many different masks over the years. I spend a lot of money on products that gave me either no effects or bad reactions in the end, which only made me feel like my money was wasted once again. This Pure dead sea mud mask is absolutely amazing. It made my skin look and feel refreshed, clean and feel more elastic. After using this mask I didn&#x27;t even feel like needing a moisturizer afterward. I would definitely recommend this mask to anybody, especially to people who have sensitive skin and are limited on products they can use.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a mask to make your skin feel rejuvenated, this is the one!!! I wish I could use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I love it. I like the tinkling feeling when I apply it to my face, and the moisture it leaves behind...</li>
            <li> This burned my skin immediately after applying it. I will not be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 or 4 weeks now.  I like it, but I&#x27;m still not ready to rave about it quite yet.  I do recognize that it takes a lot for met give a stellar critique.  This product isn&#x27;t all the way there for me yet.  I was definitely shocked initially at the burning/hot  sensation when I first used it.  I thought something was wrong, but the feeling slowly subsided and when I rinsed it off, there was no skin irritation.  I will add that during my most recent use (approximately week 3 or 4, cant&#x27; remember exactly) it didn&#x27;t burn and sting like it did when I first started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that my face felt soft, smooth, and skin looked brighter.  I liked that feeling.  I also used my astringent (just a little witch hazel) and a quick extra rinse AFTER the mask to remove any extra remnants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little concerned now about the comments that say it doesn&#x27;t have much of a shelf life and may mold.  I haven&#x27;t experienced that yet, but I&#x27;m debating now about whether I should put it in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> Like it,  does sting when first put on but face feels smooth after</li>
            <li> It feels cool and fresh, easy to make and wash. After using it, the skin was soft and very nice. I did not use it right now so i made feed back late but it was really a good deal.</li>
            <li> I just love this mask, it leaves my skin soft and clean. I use it about twice a week. Great product!</li>
            <li> I had so much redness and big bumps with acne, but in 3 applications I have seen remarkable improvment. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great mask, noticed a difference after one application. Great value for the money and I would absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the smell then this product is great for you. I wasn&#x27;t really fond of the smell and it made me want to throw up. I had to plug my nose when it was on my face.  When i placed it on there was a big burning sensation that happened for the first few minutes and i guess that could mean that it is working. After a few minutes it goes away. Easy to apply and not too hard to wash off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results i got were pretty decent. My skin felt really smooth and my pores weren&#x27;t as visible. Would I use it again? Yeah probably will use it up and do it maybe once a week.  Would I repurchase it? No, the smell really got to me and I am not a big fan of the scent. But then again my nose is very delicate with scents.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something this wonderful for a long time. It truly is as amazing as everyone is claiming. My skin is super soft and like velvet. I have now found my favorite facial mask!</li>
            <li> This mud mask is great.  Sometime my face feels greesy the next day with other products not with this one.  You don&#x27;t need much so the bottle will last awhile</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! After the first week of using it, it left my skin really smooth but I did notice a lot more acne. I have used this product for three weeks now and it has started to clear my face up well! Remember that when using a new product you won&#x27;t start seeing big differences until a couple of weeks so I would say even if it doesnt do anything in the first week or two keep on using it!</li>
            <li> I love this product except for one thing: the last ingredient, eucalyptus. I&#x27;m careful to not go near my eyes but even just having it on my nose really hurts my eyes. It&#x27;s better if I can just go lay down and close my eyes, but I&#x27;d give this 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t hurt my eyes. Otherwise I love the ingredients, the texture, and the way it feels during and after.</li>
            <li> When I receieved this mask it looks really dirty although it has some plastic wrap. After I opened it the smell is very strong more than any mint in my used products and my face is painful after I used it. I did try my best to be patient of waiting it dry about 10 mins. After using water to wash it off, my skin looks not big diffence, maybe a little bit soft but feels like using daily moisturizing lotion not cleaning my pore or brighting my skin. Will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this. Makes face feel refreshed after first use, and if there is a pimple this mask will reduce the size and dry it out.</li>
            <li> this is my first time using this product and as soon as it touched my skin i felt the burn (a good burn if there is any), it felt like it was doing something so we will see the results after a month. I did feel like my skin was smoother after i washed it off though. Good product so far.</li>
            <li> It does not smell good, but boy does it work. After just one treatment, my skin looked better. The pores looked cleaner and the skin just slightly tighter. I did use under my eyes for which it burned somewhat (the directions say not to do this, but I did it anyway). The fine lines around the eyes were smoother and less noticeable. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and this mask works amazingly. I broke out a little bit after my first use, but I felt like it pulled all of the oil and junk out of my pores. I use it every week and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I want to talk a little bit about haters... firstly, it still mind***s me to this day, how so amny people come up to me, see me in person and talk to me. And you know what? these guys are all shocked. They turn to their mates and i hear the whispers,  &amp;#34;wow, this guy is actually alright, he&#x27;s actually got a personailty&amp;#34;&amp;#34;he&#x27;s not just an idiot&amp;#34; and you know what? its heartbreaking hearing that stuff&lt;br /&gt;but its alright, because i do have a reputation of being a dumb ****, .&lt;br /&gt;How was my life before I bought this mask. I was the little guy in the back of the room, who shied away from the world. I had little voice in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Something changed... I realized this as a young adult i couldnt be like this for the rest of my life. And i started seeing this ... people wouldnt pay atentiont ome, people wouldnt talk to me. And thats not even the bigger issue. Respect. No one respected me and when you dont have respect, you become depressed and you alienate yourself.&lt;br /&gt;So what did I do? I changed. I did what other told me i couldn&#x27;t do. I bought this mask,a nd applied it 2 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;Slowly my life started to change. We only live once so we might as well do it right. This mask has changed my life for the better. Just remember everything i do is with good itentions...... AL the poeple in my life left, everyone who brought me down, ig ot rid of them. People change and we have to learn from our mistakes...&lt;br /&gt;This mask changed my life. 5/5</li>
            <li> Has a slight tingle and the eucalyptus scent makes it very nice.  My skin feels very smooth. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling clean and fresh and has a nice tingling sensation that feels like it is cleaning or whatever happens to pores and skin.  I liked it and will buy more.</li>
            <li> I went out on a limb and purchased this product as a stocking stuffer for my wife who just loves her skin the way she is. I was afraid this would go the other way on me, in other words asking me if she needed  to do more with her skin treatments now. She was so excited to get this and she began using it last week and she says she can not believe the differnce it makes, thanks for such a great product!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Husband</li>
            <li> I love this mask, plus it smells really good. The scrub is a little abrasive so it stings a little after wiping it off, but other than that my face feels really good and it does clear up some acne. Only use once a week though, any more and it could really dry your face out</li>
            <li> I actually feel like this product kinda works. I like how it feel on my face. It feels a little tingly which makes me think that it is working. Once I wash the product  off my face it seems like my face is brighter. So I like it.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for sensitive skin!! After using this product I wasnt itchy and I didnt have any dry skin or redness. It also makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff works extremely well but this is extremely overpriced.  I got 10oz on eBay for $8 and it is completely identical to this 6oz jar.</li>
            <li> While this product doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant of smells it works beautifully.  My face has never felt so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My skin feels so clean. Not messy to clean up and smells good. Does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I really like this product looking forward to using it every week.</li>
            <li> I love it. Leaves your face so soft and is really doing wonders on my giant pores. Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> I put this mask on every Sunday night. It&#x27;s become my weekly ritual now. I LOVE how it makes my face feel afterwards. I feel like it&#x27;s made a huge difference in the way skin looks and feels. I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this once weekly as recommended for two weeks. It&#x27;s still early to tell but my skin does seem to feel smoother and look more even toned.</li>
            <li> In love with this mask. Will definitely buy more in the future. Great product and I highly reccommend</li>
            <li> Great product, tingles on your face when you use it and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your face so it is a great deal as well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice face mask. Both of my daughters used it. One really feels the tingling, it actually made her eyes water a little bit while my other daughter didn&#x27;t really experience a tingling sensation. They both, however, say they like it. That in itself is an accomplishment. But as for the mask, it really has a very refreshing, bright smell. I thought for some reason that it was going to be powder, but it is already mixed and was very easy for them to apply. Their skin felt refreshed and smooth and they said they will use the mask again weekly as directed.</li>
            <li> Loooooved this product. The feeling was great and my skin felt amazing. Downside was the actual mud scent. Not a fan of that scent. Otherwise it did what it was made for and did it well.</li>
            <li> I got this mud mask on a very good discounted price. I am happy that i purchased this product because it really worked like a charm for my skin. My skin has really improved since i started using this product. It does not make my skin dry at all like other mud mask. My skin is soft and bright also it zaps away all my acne and blemishes. I love this product and will definitely repurchase it. Highly recommended  product.</li>
            <li> I like this mask. It makes my skin feel very clean when I combine it with a steam facial. It has a minty smell to it and instantly makes my face tingle when I apply. However, it does not shrink the size of my pimple , but will slightly reduce the redness and help remove left over dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a 4/5 for softness and face texture after use. But I have yet to see the effects once applied to acne. I will keep using and update if I see changes.</li>
            <li> my face change a lot since I&#x27;m used this product- more clean, fresh, and natural. i just love it -</li>
            <li> This is a strong product so I do not recommend it to anyone with highly sensitive skin or easily rashes with new skin products. However that aside it is amazing and my face feels as soft as my baby&#x27;s skin!</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I had read reviews and my acne stopped after first use! No&lt;br /&gt;Lie it&#x27;s refreshing and smells&lt;br /&gt;Really good! Love using it once a week&lt;br /&gt;But sometimes&lt;br /&gt;Twice!&lt;br /&gt;Great product and reviews didn&#x27;t lie for sure and I&#x27;m taking the time to post hoo rah</li>
            <li> Great product! I will continue to use it on a weekly basis for the results of smoother skin. I like that!</li>
            <li> Great product. Super smooth skin after two uses! Highly recommended! Worth the cost.  You feel a slight burning sensation temporarily though</li>
            <li> It smells like, well, mud but don&#x27;t let that deter you! I feel like this gets my pores really clean!</li>
            <li> I loved this product it made my skin feel great. I will continue to use this in the future. Anytime I want to feel i went to the spa I just use this mask and it really relaxes me.</li>
            <li> Prior to applying this product, be sure to alert your family.  Not doing so could frighten a loved one. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s something about applying mud to your face that brings back a flood of fond childhood memories of mud pies and playing outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure’s Dead Sea Mud Mask spreads easily and evenly over your face, giving you complete control of where it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a single application, it left my face feeling smooth, soft and really clean.  I use it every day immediately following a shower.  This product is gluten free.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and even rinsing my hair with shampoo gets my body rashes. And because of this, I am very scared to experience with new products on my face and I don&#x27;t use facial cleanser. However, with this, it is different. Not only was my skin able to handle it, it also leaves my face glowing! I have never felt so refreshed before!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Great for the skin!</li>
            <li> makes my skin break out like crazy. i gave it a second chance and it still turned my whole face red and broke out so i trashed it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  Worth every penny and pretty inex</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud Mask by InstaNatural is great! I had a lot of fun with it too, I made it into a &amp;#34;spa night&amp;#34; at my house. Nice and relaxing.</li>
            <li> A must have in mine and my daughter&#x27;s weekly skin regime. This is truly an amazing mask. Getting ready to re-order it.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask is a bit different from the one I&#x27;m currently using and the ones I&#x27;ve tried before. It&#x27;s a bit pasty and has this eucalyptus/menthol scent. When using it, I suggest not putting the mask near the eye area because of the eucalyptus/menthol scent. It did sting my eye a bit at first (I&#x27;m not sure how to explain it but the scent itself stung my eye) but got better after about a minute. Actually, when I sat down and waited for the mask to dry up, the eucalyptus/menthol scent became soothing and relaxing. :) After the Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask dried up, I rinsed it off my face. I was glad that it rinsed off easily. I was very satisfied with the results. My skin looked brighter, my pores looked smaller and the 2 big acne on my chin looked less inflamed and smaller. I like that my skin looked rejuvenated and better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a mud mask before, so it was funny to open the jar and see that it&#x27;s literally just a jar of mud. It feels great on your face though. It&#x27;s fun to apply - what kid didn&#x27;t roll around in the mud for fun?? - and it feels great. When you first put it on, it makes your face feel cold and tingly. You leave it on for 5-10 minutes (I literally just sit back and relax, and let it set), and then you get it wet and wash it all off. It leaves your face feeling sooo smooth and clean. It&#x27;s a wonderful feeling. Love this product!</li>
            <li> PURE &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask...&lt;br /&gt;1st time use: cooling and minty feeling. Gets hard on the face so you can tell when it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best facial mask I have ever used, I don&#x27;t use many if any facial products since I have sensitive skin, but I love this mask. I will continue to use it. It has a great minty scent, it feeling very cooling and nice on the skin, after it dries (about 10 minutes) you wash it off with warm water and it leaves your face feeling tight and rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;I also want to state that the shipping was quick, only a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I 100% recommend this product to anyone. I Love This Mask... You can feel it working. It&#x27;s a THICK creamy texture, no girty or oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;5 Star review for overall greatness. Smell, feel, look and ease of use (though a bit messy, lol).</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t possibly be more pleased than I am with this mask. Having not purchased a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; for quite some time, I hesitated before placing my order for a &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; mask - but I&#x27;m delighted I did. The results have proven that much more promising than I could have possibly have hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great success for me and I urge anyone interested in a mask to consider the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask.</li>
            <li> I have used other mud masks in the past that I liked better. However I still enjoyed this one. My face felt nice and smooth afterward.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ..Love it !</li>
            <li> This dead sea mud mask was easy to apply and surprisingly did not dry out my skin like past facial masks. The scent is light and tolerable. I do plan on incorporating this product in my skin care regime.</li>
            <li> Again I love my Dead Sea facial products. It just feels right to keep using a product that keeps producing wonderful results! This mask was wonderful against my skin. It was smooth and relaxed me. I felt like I was getting a spa treatment without living my home.</li>
            <li> I use this mask twice a week and it heals any acne spots that I have and leaves my skin glowing. The smell is a little &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; but its not unbearable. Gentle on my sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to buy this but I am extremely glad I did. After applying it and washing it off, my face feels amazing. I never felt my face to be so soft and look so radiant. I highly recommend this to others. It does have a little smell to it but It is to be expected due to all the natural ingredients in the formula. Disclaimer: I received a discount for my unbiased honest opinion.</li>
            <li> The dead sea mud facial mask is fantastic.  It is easy to use and really helps clean out the impurities in the skin.  When applying the mask you need to make sure you get an nice even layer and then let it dry about 15-20 minutes.  Follow the instructions for washing it off and you will be happy with the results.  Your face should feel refreshed, smaller pores and very soft.  The consistency is kind of like pudding and it spreads nicely.  Make sure not to get any on your clothes as it can stain.  The company will send you an email with tips on how to use the mask and wash it off for the best results.  I found the tips very helpful and appreciated the email, great company!</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It&#x27;s minty fresh burns a little but it just means it&#x27;s working. I would recommend to everyone. Bought athe a discount to speak my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was asked to review Pure &amp; Essential Minerals- Dead Sea Mud Mask. It had been a long week and the thought of relaxing with a mud mask was wonderful!My niece Ashley and I applied the mask together. We both noticed the initial tingle-which I associate with the Eucalyptus Oil-and it was great! The mask was east to apply and spread easily. You did not need a large amount, it covered well. We put our feet up and pampered ourselves for a while and let the Mud Mask do it&#x27;s magic! We then rinsed it off easily with a warm washcloth and loved the results! Our faces felt smooth and tight and my pores looked noticeably smaller.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing! I love it! I&#x27;ve used this mask on my sister who has lupus and sometimes her face gets really red. I used the mask on her and it&#x27;s helped with her redness. so I will definitely be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> I got it to try. I love that from the second I put this mask on my face I could feel it cooling.  This mask dried in less than 5 minutes so this one is perfect for the busy moms out there.  You can use this mask every week.  To me it had kind of a minty smell.  It washed off easily and I could really tell a difference in my skin right after using it. It left my skin feeling smooth and soft and really gave it an even look.  I really liked this facemask it was very easy to use and left my skin feeling and looking great.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to apply. Directions are very simple to follow and results were as promised. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a 5 Star Rating was becuase it&#x27;s messy when you wash it off.</li>
            <li> I love how this mask gently exfoliates and leaves my skin feeling soft. It&#x27;s simple to use and washes off very easily, not like some other mud masks I have used in the past. I also like that it is not rough on my skin. I&#x27;ve used it for over a two week period and although I don&#x27;t notice major results, I do notice that my skin feels softer and less oily on my forehead and nose. It is great to see these results after two weeks. I also have sensitive skin so tha fact that this works great on my skin is a real plus. I do recommend this one and even my husband tried it and likes it.</li>
            <li> This dead sea mask that is already all made for you, all you need to do is apply. You can use this on your face, all over, and I tried it in my hair as well. It says for your face, but it did wonders for my hair as well. This smells just like mud with a hint of a bit of perfume like. You apply to face and let it sit until its drying and starts to flake. I prefer a thinner face mask more so of a thicker one, as it takes longer to dry. After its all off it makes your skin feel amazingly soft and fresh feeling. Didn’t dry my skin out at all. When I washed it out of my hair, didn’t use any shampoo or conditioner so it can stay in longer even though its out of my hair (something a salon told me to do) and in the morning I took a shower, and my hair was so soft, I couldn’t remember the last time I had that feeling, at the salon years ago. The container is pretty big so you get tons of uses for your face or few with your hair. I love dead sea mask, it just makes your face and body feel so good inside. Be sure to try them out!</li>
            <li> At first I was taken by surprise as the Dead Sea Mud Mask felt really cold and I could really feel the eucalyptus, especially in my eyes… According to the instructions, you need to leave the mask on for about 10 minutes and then wash it off using a circular motion.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest the first time I used the mask, I thought about washing it off just after a few minutes as I was afraid the mask was burning my skin, but I decided to leave it on for the whole 10 minutes as suggested and I was happy to realize that the mask did not give me any kind of reactions and it actually worked very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin that can be easily irritated, and I was very happy when I came to the realization that the mask had not caused any kind of reaction and that I was actually very happy with the way my skin looks and feels after using the  Mask.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly! It feels very clean after and skins feels really soft. Will try to update in 3 months.</li>
            <li> My skin looks smoother with a healthy glow after only 3 weeks, little dark spots are little diminished. I highly recommend Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this dead sea mud mask. I know the dead sea is supposed to be great for your skin but I don&#x27;t have the luxury of going out there, lol maybe one day. For now, I will be ordering dead sea mud to my home. And I love that this is made of all natural ingredients and oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When you open the container, It has a light natural smell to it. Nothing overwhelming. It applied to my face very smoothly. After laying there and relaxing for about 10 minutes, it dried and was very easy to remove and wash off with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As a background, my face is oily and has some light discoloration and acne. I&#x27;ve used this about once a week. After the use of this mask, my skin feels very smooth, soft and clean. It seems more even toned, less oily, and just soft! It&#x27;s like having a nice spa day at home. I love it and look forward to continue using it.</li>
            <li> This product is better than most of the 100-500$ mud mask facials out there! It is like actually bathing int the dead sea.</li>
            <li> the Dead Sea Mud Face Mask is very effective for clean the skin and remove the impurities, i recommend it</li>
            <li> Just like another cheap mask but this one is most expensive and not effective do not waste your time and money for this product .</li>
            <li> I am blessed with fairly good skin so I rarely use masks but my husband works out side all year round and has always had problematic skin and uses facial masks and cleansers on a regular bases. That being said I used the product and enjoyed it and my skin felt very nice smooth and clean after use, My husband who has tried just about every mask out there mud peel warming... etc... loved this mask. He said the warming tingle and the eucalyptus smell was very nice and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;The feel of the mask is a bit goopy when you place your fingers in it to scoop out but not anything more then what you would expect when sticking your hand into &amp;#34;MUD&amp;#34; but it goes on nicely on the face. there is no sliding or moving and the tingling and warmth starts immediately. as the mask dries you can feel the tightening and the pull of the mud on your face.&lt;br /&gt;After wiping my husbands face clean of the mud mask I noticed that his face looked cleaner and clearer then any other mask has left him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed!</li>
            <li> just got it 30 min ago , i tried it , loveeeee it so much, make my skin so bright , clean and smooth</li>
            <li> We women have different grades of beauty products we own in our vanities. We either like them or we love them. Right? I mean seriously. How many products do we own right now that are just siting in our vanities. You know those we purchased and used once or twice and now they sit there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well I recently received my Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask on May 17th, 2014. I must confess it is the only item I literally tried within 10 minutes of it arriving at my door. I just felt like after research and reviews my expectation where really high and I had to see for myself right away. So here are my findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me share a little more about Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask. It is a all natural pure dead sea mud mask. Made to naturally exfoliate, moisturize, cleanse and balance for healthy radiant skin. Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask is infused with twenty-one minerals like magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium. All working together to build and restore skin troubles like acne, balance oily skin, dry skin, and eczema. With 30 treatments per jar; this is truly a affordable effective home treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My findings truly co-inside with the design of this product. I used this Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask weekly and found my oily skin has lessened dramatically, my patches of dry skin have balanced, skin is more refined, hydrated, and it only took a weekly treatment of 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So do I like this product? Will I repurchase? Yes, oh yes. I love this product. Yes, I said it. I love this product. It has dramatically changed the tone of my skin. Plus it has a soft botanical scent that makes you feel like your at a spa. Is that not what we all need? A affordable spa treatment at home?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I love this product, I use this product, recommend this product.. oh and did I say I love this product :)</li>
            <li> I love mud anything!  Really I do!  As a little girl I use to play with the boys and make mud pies.  When I grew up I stopped playing with the little boys and started playing with the big boys known as &amp;#34;Spas&amp;#34; and never looked back.  I have had mud facials before in my past and loved them.  I always wanted to have a mud bath, however said matter has not happened yet!  Nonetheless when Pure &amp; Essential Minerals contacted everything Beauty and Beyond to review their Dead Sea Mud Mask, I was game! I was so excited that I could hardly contain myself and counted the nights away till it came.  I know, a bit dramatic but did I tell you I love mud?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the package arrived I was quite shocked on how big the jar was.  It came in a nice plastic jar with a plastic wrap around it for protection.  It was really easy to open and close.  It smelled like eucalyptus and fresh mint.  I was really taken by the smell.  The texture seemed very spongy and soft.  The color was a dark green.  I was really excepting it to look like dirty old mud.  But then again who would actually put that crap on their face if it looked like the type of mud that kids played in after it rained and cars drive through after a snowstorm?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me almost two weeks before I could use this because I ended up breaking out in a serious rash on my face from allergies to the point that my skin was cracked and bleeding.  After two weeks of torture, the rash has subsided a lot but it left me with nasty dry patchy skin as it healed.  Once I felt that my face was safe to &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; on with, I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first washed my faced with my Paula&#x27;s Choice cleanser.  After washing it and using my Clarisonic, I pat my face dry and applied the Dead Sea Mud Mask.  10 seconds later my face felt like it was on fire!  I swear to God I thought I was going to scream and wash it off immediately.  However I decided to wait it out for a good two minutes.  During this time of intensehell fire burning, I imagined what the flames of hell felt like and decided it was as good as time as ever to say my prayers for the evening and repent of my sins...you know...just in case...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However with all that being said, I can&#x27;t say if it was product or the fact that my face was still sensitive and healing from the hell of a rash that I had.  Nonetheless as all brave soldiers I push on and after 2-3 minutes the hell burning flames stop.  I decided during the 10-15 minutes that I had the mask on, to google the net to see if anyone else had the same kerosene burn like sensation and realized that no, no, it really was just me and my face getting over the rash.  I probably should of waited another week or two before applying it.  However to late now, eh!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the burning sensation stopped (after 2-3 mins) and the 10-15 minutes had passed I washed it off.  The mask dried to a dark green color and wasn&#x27;t concrete hard.  It washed off easily and with no real residue left behind.  I noticed automatically on how soft my face felt. I was actually quite shocked out my head. I have tried other mud masks before and they have ALWAYS left my face feeling Sahara dry to the point that it felt like it was going to crack.  However not this time.  This time my face felt soft, hydrated, moisturized and just plain amazing.  I applied my Paula&#x27;s Choice toner and Poppy Austin Argan oil and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up the next morning, it was like angels were singing in my bathroom.  The parts of my face that were healing from the rash that were left with dry scaly skin actually looked better and in some areas were gone altogether.  I was amazed..let me say that again..I WAS AMAZED on how well my skin looked.  The parts of my face that had the dry scaly patches, I was applying creams and oils mornings, afternoons and nights in order to hydrate the skin and nothing was working.  Due to this, I haven&#x27;t worn make-up in almost 3 weeks because you can see the nasty dryness through the foundation.  However this just totally amazed me on how the dryness was gone in many parts of my face.  I&#x27;ll be honest I still haven&#x27;t worn make up (and I won&#x27;t till next week) nonetheless my skin looks freaking awesome and almost back to its original condition before the biblical plaque came over and took a hold of my face.  This literally has shrunk my pores and I have only used it twice now.  I can&#x27;t believe how poreless and flawless my face looks because of this.  It even feels different.  This also made the blackheads on my nose look better and came out easier when I used my extraction tool and Paula&#x27;s Choice BHA 9.  This Dead Sea Mud Mask really helped to get those nasty suckers out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read online from some users that since this product is all natural it can spoil and it was advised to place in the fridge for longer shelf life.  Also, it would feel cool on your face when applied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar clearly says to only use once a week which is a bummer as I would love to use this 2-3 times a week.  However I plan to use this weekly till it runs out and according to their website you have about 30 plus facials you can get can out of this jar!  That is basically more then half a year if used weekly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and would for sure recommend it!</li>
            <li> Received the mud mask within three days of order.  Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but just opened the jar and it has a wonderful smell.  Looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always take the time to care for my skin like I should. I&#x27;m a busy mom of 3 and spend most of my &amp;#34;spare time&amp;#34; (if you can call it that), taking care of everyone else. This means I am somewhat disappointed when I look in the mirror and my skin is dull, lifeless, and looking older than I&#x27;d like. The Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask made it possible for me to pamper myself a bit and turn back the hands of time. My skin looks more vibrant and youthful and everything from the scent of the treatment to the texture helped me feel pampered and relaxed. The 5-10 minutes each week is definitely worth it and the mask is a great value (the 6oz container goes a long way)!</li>
            <li> I think my skin is too sensitive for this mud mask because when I put on the mask it burns for a bit. It&#x27;s uncomfortable and eventually passes, but I think I will stick to more gentle treatments in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used a lot of different products.  I highly recommend this to help with skin your completion and smooth appearance. Excellent product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this mud mask. I brought it down on vacation with me earlier this month and my mother and I had a spa night. (Mind you . . . it was less than attractive to have a mud colored mask on in front of my dad and husband LOL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it! It smells awesome. Pepperminty. It also makes your face feel very tingly while it is on and kind of hot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries pretty quickly. I had to hop in the shower to take it off though because I started to make a mess around the sink! My skin felt amazing afterwards. So smooth and fresh feeling. My mom also liked it and asked me to send her the link when I got time so she could order some as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will last quite some time also. I can see getting many uses out of this container.</li>
            <li> I really love this mask, it leaves my skin feeling so soft and supple. I use this twice a week and I always look forward to using it, plus I&#x27;m a sucker for anything minty so that drew me right in. I like the texture of the mask, it is thick, smooth and the scent isn&#x27;t too overwhelming. I adore how this makes my skin feel and as soon as I&#x27;m done with this one I will definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite product left my face feeling crusty and dirty</li>
            <li> I knew that it&#x27;d work great on my face (per all the positive feedback and reviews). But surprisingly, it does more than that! I have a skin condtion that requires me to swallow pills if I want to look better &#x27;cosmetically&#x27;. I am not willing to get chemicals and so I was thinking that I was doomed to live with the skin I live in. But no :) I am using the mud on my problematic skin now, used it for 4 times and I am so happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;No allergic reactions whatsoever. Absolutely happy with this product!</li>
            <li> stinky but works great.  Ladies this may smell bad but it works good.</li>
            <li> awesome result thanks for early delivery</li>
            <li> Well since I got.it a month ago and its recommended to be used weekly. I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times. I like the mask. I see a little difference with the dryness of my skin. Only part I don&#x27;t care for is a severe burning sensation that I get when first applying.</li>
            <li> I received this mask as a gift and I wasn&#x27;t sure at first. I used it once and it felt tingly, I left it on for 15 minutes because I used a bit too much and it took longer to harden. I went back 2 days later to use it again and found that it burned so I would recommend only doing it once a week. But, it does last a long time, makes my skin super silk like. I know some people don&#x27;t like the smell but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s horrible, I&#x27;ve tried a lot. I also noticed a change in poor size and acne after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love! After one mask my face feels so different! I left it on a little longer. It tangles but only because of the mint I&#x27;m sure. I&#x27;m going to order this again!&lt;br /&gt;Update 5x use later. My pores are significantly smaller! I&#x27;m very convinced this product is worth it!</li>
            <li> Really love this mask - it is everything is says it is. Will repurchase for sure (although it doesn&#x27;t take much, so it will be a while).</li>
            <li> Surprising product! When i first opened the jar it looked like someone had Just placed mud in there it was so fresh!  The smell is relaxing and the directions are simple! The application was silky not thick and muddy like i assumed. I could instantly feel the tingle and slight heat. It was quite a treat and i look forward to seeing the effects!</li>
            <li> Finally the mask I always wanted! I could see the difference even when I used it the first time!&lt;br /&gt;When you apply it, you can sense that it is working on your skin. After washing it off, I could feel that my skin was softer.&lt;br /&gt;I am getting married in a few months and I think this is my savior!</li>
            <li> What an awesome Mask! The first time I used the product it did have a little bit of tingling/burning on the face, but quickly went away. Some customers have stated the smell is a little over-bearing, but actually I thought it had somewhat of a mint flavor. Also, great coorespondence from the company, on how to use. I noticed even after the first use, my skin tighter, and the pores in my sking were much smaller. After rinsing off, the skin felt so refreshed and clean. Looking for a great mask, look no further! You will love it! The only negative, can get a little messy when removing. However, it&#x27;s a five star product!!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 3 weeks now and I must say, not bad... I will definitely keep using it. I think this is the sort of product you need to use for a bit longer to see the full effects. When I first opened it, the first thing I noticed was a strong &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; odor, it is strong, but I liked it. It also has a thick, soft, silky feel to it, which made it very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, there was definitely a burning/hot sensation, probably due to the eucalyptus ingredient. It even made my eyes kind of burn with it just being on my face. I kept it away from my eyes like the directions said to. But, the sensation did slowly subsided as it dried and by the time I rinsed it off, I could see that there was no skin irritation at all... After the third time I used it, it didn&#x27;t burn as much, just a little tingly sensation... Maybe my skin just had to get use to this product. But, I will say that even after the first use I noticed right away that my face felt smoother and softer. The only other way I could describe it is, my face literally felt &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;! Like all mud-masks, it is a bit messy but it came off pretty easily with warm water. I found it easier to put the mask on, then take a shower. I did notice that after a few more uses, it did dry out my face a bit, which for me I didn&#x27;t mind to much because I have really oily skin, so that helped. If you have dry skin, just make sure to moisturize well. Other than that, I&#x27;m pretty pleased and happy with this product and definitely will recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This is a mud-mask... emphasis on mud. I keep my jar in the refrigerator because I have talked to other people that have tried this product in the past and they have said it can develop mold. If you prefer not to keep it in the refrigerator, just keep an eye on it, there is a shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.

            <li> Dead Sea Mud Facial Masks contains organic and natural ingredients. The Eucalyptus Oil gave me a slight tingling sensation, however, it did not irritate my skin or cause redness. I loved how it went on smoothly with no grit, common in other mud masks and removed with very little messiness. I found it easier to apply the mask and then hop in the shower. For some reason the steam help to work the mud into your pores, or at least that was how I felt. At first I was a bit skeptical of putting mud on my face, but since trying this product my whole outlook has changed. Now I have no idea on the shelf life for a mud mask, but I figure if you use it often that pretty soon you will be buying another one. I am a fan of this Dead-Sea-Facial-Mask the benefits to keeping the skin healthy and acne free, and not to mention the glow your skin has from using good ingredients on your face and delicate area! I do also like the benefits of this Anti - Aging natural Mask product!! I am firm believer that everyone passed the age of 25 could benefit from using Anti - Aging products. My face felt smoother even the next morning, this will definitely be part of my weekly &amp;#34;pamper me&amp;#34; regiment! I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Dead Sea Mud products, I have tried all sorts of things from all sorts of companies. I know what to expect and love about Dead Sea Mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, the mask smells horrific. From the second I opened the container, all I could smell was this foul, pungent, yucky scent. The last thing I wanted to do was put it on my face, but I did. That&#x27;s when I noticed that the texture was pretty gross as well. Very slimy, mucky, and the product in the jar shook like a gelatin. Again, just not quite something you wanna put on your face. But I went for it. And with the end results I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on, and let it sit for about 15-20 minutes. At that time it was fully dried on my skin, and I was ready to wash it off. When I did, my skin felt very clean and refreshed. I immediately applied a moisturizer after washing to lock in all that moisture. My skin felt very hydrated, soft and smooth. Redness I normally get was toned down quite a bit. So dealing with the smell and texture was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that this would be reformulated to have a better scent and texture. Like I said, I am no newbie to Dead Sea Mud products, so I know that you get a very earthy scent. But this one was just way too pungent! I guess with this mask you have to take the good with the bad. The end results will be worth it!</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a good mud mask for years.  The ones I found were either too expensive or full of unhealthy ingredients.  I&#x27;ve seen all sorts for food dyes and parabens in facial masks.  There&#x27;s no way I wanted to put that on my skin!  Pure&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask, however, contains no nasty ingredients.  All of the ingredients are beneficial to a healthy complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the mask 3 times and my skin&#x27;s appearance is improving with each application.  The mask itself has a strong smell of eucalyptus which starts to subside as it dries.  As the mask tightens you can feel the skin being cleansed of impurities.  The consistency is not too gloppy and the mask is easy to apply and remove.  I have sensitive skin and was pleasantly surprised that my face was not all red and irritated when I removed the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone looking for a natural high quality product that actually works, I can recommend the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask without reservation.</li>
            <li> I have never had my face clear up so fast! Ive always had problems with acne .. i even tried those special washes advertised on tv. I love this stuff and i will be purchasing again</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin because I have severe eczema.  While this product did make my most eczema prone parts of my face flare up - I still continue to use it in places that didn&#x27;t flare up and I love this mask.  It helps to make my skin feel soft and very clean.  The cost is affordable and it works really well.</li>
            <li> My skin really does feel softer after using it. My pores look much smaller. If I feel a pimple coming on I use this as a spot treatment. The only thing is that it burns and makes your eyes water when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask is wonderful. I&#x27;m a redhead and like most redheads, I have sensitive skin. Especially on my face. I have to be very careful about what I use on it otherwise my faces gets all red and blotchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dead Sea Mud Mask was soothing to my face. It doesn&#x27;t burn at all like some masks do when you first apply it. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t take very long to dry. It has a invigorating Eucalyptus scent and even cleared up my stuffy nose from this stupid summer cold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the mask several times over the past month and I have seen a marked improvement in texture the of my skin. It&#x27;s less dry and more radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get nervous or stressed out I tend to touch my chin a lot and the oils from my fingers get on my chin and pimples start to develop. When I feel that twinge I put a bit of the Dead Sea Mud Mask on my chin, let it dry and wash it off and the pimple never materializes. Amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> I tried out the Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask and loved it!  It tingles at first when you put it on and it is nice and cool.  This would feel amazing on a hot day if you put this in the fridge!  It takes longer than some masks to dry – a good 15-20 minutes for me (but I did put it on pretty thick).  It rinses off very easily once it dries, and the effects are wonderful.  It left my skin soft and supple for days after I used the mark.  My pores definitely felt tighter, and my skin was very very moisturized. My skin definitely glowed!</li>
            <li> This mask smells and feels minty as it draws toxins out of the skin. It leaves my skin soft and refreshed feeling and I always feel my skin is nourished after I wash it off. It is thick and creamy and goes on easily. I love this mask and use it every week without fail. High quality and effective.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and I tend to leave it on for much longer than it states.  I don&#x27;t always use it, only because I can get lazy at night and don&#x27;t want to get up (9.5 months pregnant), but when I do, I notice a change in my skin the next morning.  It looks refreshed and healthy.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is so invigorating and feels so purifying.  It tiingles at first, has a minty kind of fragrance, and you can really feel it working.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea has many benefits so I love using products that contain the dead sea mud and all its natural ingredients. PURE &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask is a great and highly recommended mask for all skin types. I have sensitive skin and using this mask roughly once a week to give my face just the extra boost of healing after a hard week. This mask is organic and of course cruelty free (I love animals) so that is an added benefit to the amazing healing formula within.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is thick but can be smoothed onto your face easily and starts working immediately. It may not look great with its dark greyish color but I expect that from sulfuric mud and it doesn&#x27;t have a scent.&lt;br /&gt;There are no parabens or sulphates, which makes sense that this is a better deal when it comes to facial mask and your skin. This 6oz jar last long with the results you be getting.</li>
            <li> It shipped super fast, was packaged well so that it didn&#x27;t leak and has professional labeling that makes it great for gift giving as well! It left my skin feeling super soft and helped to clear up stubborn cystic acne that I suffer from!</li>
            <li> I really did have quite the experience with this mask! Let me start out with describing the texture – it is gloopy and slippery, and felt like what I always imagined Flubber would. That turned me off a little, so in the future I might use a mini spatula to help me out with application. Nonetheless, as I applied the mask, my skin began to react instantaneously. It was tingling, cooling, and burning all at the same time. I got a bit worried for a minute – was I having a reaction?! But I waited it out and after about 1-2 minutes the mask felt amazing. Yes, amazing. My face felt cooled and comfortable, and the mask slowly dried in about 10-15 minutes. I carefully rinsed my face, and couldn’t believe how great I felt afterwards! My skin was glowing and looked really clean and healthy! What the heck had I just been though?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, I really had an interesting experience with the Dead Sea Mud Mask. It is very intense at first, so if you have very sensitive skin I would not recommend it. That being said, I absolutely loved the result, and felt hooked on the product after just one use. I’m definitely going to be using this at least twice a month to ensure I clean out my pores. This mask is truly invigorating!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have had the pure pleasure of trying a few of the dead sea products over the past few months and have really enjoyed them. I have suffered from Psoriasis since my teens. While it is primarily on my scalp it does travel to my face at times. It becomes flaky red and painful on my forehead and eyebrows. Since I have been using the Dead Sea Mud Mask,  my flare-ups have been under control and a lot less.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t break out much and I don&#x27;t have bad acne but I just recently went through a very stressful time in my life and I stopped drinking as much water, wasn&#x27;t working out regularly, and was also thrown into quick eating (fast food and such). The combination of the 3 caused my skin to break out in areas it doesn&#x27;t usually. I knew I needed to rejuvenate my skin so I put this on and it helped tremendously. It always makes my face so soft, smooth and deep cleans all the while putting moisture back into my skin. I try to at least do the mask twice a month.</li>
            <li> Great product. My skin looked better since the first application.</li>
            <li> Like others just read the good reviews and this burns so much when on the face and as soon as I removed it (well before drying) my face was completely red like burns.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this mask, you can actually feel it working the moment you apply it. I like the way it makes my skin feel clean and rejuvenated. It helps to rid out the toxins and impurities in your skin. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I must say that I received this very very discounted to give my opinions. You can read my review history &amp; see that I am ALWAYS honest. Good or Bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good! I like the way it feels as it works, although I could do without the odor. I was not expecting anything else though considering the main ingredient! I just know to be sure &amp; use it at night, not before I start my day. Then I use a moisturizer that is scented to dull that odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see it has reduced the size of my pores on the 1st use. I will update as I use more product with more details!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely cleans out my pores very well, very happy with the results!  Definitely will keep utilizing the product!  (:</li>
            <li> I found this product have a soothing and calming feel on the skin.(Almost like a mint soothing feel to it.) I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels super soft after using the product but I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in the appearance of my skin but that could be because I dont have much im looking to improve with my skin...I&#x27;m 25 and dont have oily skin so because i&#x27;m already happy with my skin I cant see if this product has changed my appearance at all...but I really like it anyways!&amp; would highly  recommend if your looking for a mudd mask.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face mask. It left my skin feeling super fresh and smooth. I got so many compliments. Although it doesn&#x27;t smell great, don&#x27;t let that fool you!!! It is amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I think this product will work well with all skin types. I have dry skin and it did not leave it feeling dry or tight. It was soft and smooth. They ship super fast and the customer service is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. It feels good on the skin... I am excited to see results over a longer period of time!</li>
            <li> It helps heal dry and oily skin, works on skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema and leaves you with a youthful looking complexion. Dead sea minerals are known to treat, detoxify, and cleanse our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dead Sea Mud Mask contains: Pure Dead Sea Mud, Organic Shea Butter, Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Aloe Vera Juice, Organic Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Jojoba Oil, Hickory Bark Extract, Organic Calendula Oil, Eucalyptus Oil, Filtered Water, Xanthan Gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mud draws out the impurities in your skin, while the Organic Shea Butter and Organic Calendula nourish and moisturize your skin. And it smells great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the mask is drying it tingles a bit and makes my face feel cold. I think the sensation is the mask drawing out any impurities in my skin. The mask washes off cleanly and leaves my face feeling soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love is that Pure And Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask it’s made with organic ingredients, they don’t test on animals and FDA approved! One thing I really love is that they don’t test on animals. I love that it is a 100% natural skin care treatment and hey don’t use any harsh chemicals or artificial additives and it’s vegan!</li>
            <li> I love this mask! I have used it several times, including two nights ago and I always have a glow on the second day, which is today. I feel that I will use this mask for years to come, I even ordered one for my mom.. Yep, it&#x27;s that good and the price is nice too.</li>
            <li> It can be challenging to find beauty products that are organic.  I received a jar of the Dead Sea Mud Mask to review!  Did you know that, the dead sea mud has been renowned for centuries as a natural beauty remedy?  I heard that the mud was really good for your skin, but I wasn’t sure exactly what it did.  It has more than 21 skin-reviving minerals including, magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium.  These essential minerals are already in our bodies, but we lose them as we get older.  These minerals detoxify and cleanse our skin, to keep it looking young and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is beneficial for anti-aging properties to tighten pores promoting young, healthy natural skin.  The Dead Sea minerals clean, heal, soften and revitalize your skin for an all-day glow.  I love the fact, that the organic essential oils moisturize and hydrate your skin, helping to reduce wrinkles.  The mask is easy to apply and it smells like eucalyptus oil.  It made my skin look and feel great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure &amp; Essential Minerals are proud that their Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask does not contain any chemicals, it’s 100% pure, natural and certified organic ingredients.  It’s free of sulfates, phosphates and parabens.  It’s also cruelty free and vegan certified!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is awesome!  This is another one of my favorite products, that I would stand behind and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Dead Sea Mud products.This mask is thick and a bit scary looking once it gets on your face but it works wonders! I absolutely love it! My skin looks healthier and has a much more even skin tone. I love that my scarring looks lighter too! This is a great mask to use every few days and is not drying at all!</li>
            <li> Here’s some things I noticed about the mask:&lt;br /&gt;There’s a minty scent that I’m guessing is from the Eucalyptus oil and it also had a tingly feeling to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mud felt fine on my face and it really does dry fast and hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt so soft after I rinsed and dried my face. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still added a moisturizer. I’m not sure if you’re supposed to do that but, though my skin felt soft I still felt like I needed to add some moisture. Maybe it’s just habitual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it?&lt;br /&gt;This is the first mud mask I have ever tried so I have nothing to compare it to but, I think it’s worth it just for how great my skin feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m going to add it to my weekly beauty regime as they suggest and hopefully my face will glow like they say it will.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised at how well this mask makes my face feel and look. My skin is softer and under my chin, the skin looks more tightened. Wearing the mask you do feel a slight tingle but it didnt bother me at all. It makes me feel like it is working.</li>
            <li> got it right away... big pot... easy to use...my skin feels very nice afterwards and I have been sharing with the hubby... non irritating for us.... non drying...</li>
            <li> I honestly have tried bunch of facemasks from all over. I have a super dry skin so I need to be careful of what I put on my face. This mask I purchased was after reading all the reviews and my friend telling me how she could tell the difference in only one use. It seems like it works.  It says to use it only once a week but  I used it twice ,  and it dried my face a little in the chin area. I probably will mix some moisturizing oil so that it does not dry my face. The ingredients in the product look very natural too. I think as long as one does not try it you cannot tell. These products works differently on different skin so I would suggest all the ladies who are apprehensive about it, to try it and figure out themselves rather than buying it just in a whim. Plus when people tell you something or feel your face is glowing thats when you feel the difference too.</li>
            <li> My skin is very smooth thanks to this product. Every time I apply it, I feel it working. This is truly a good deal, because even after using it for about 3 weeks, I barely made a dent in the jar.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I saw a drastic change the first time.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Facial is ideal as a once a week mask. It helps to clear out impurities from pores and to tighten the skin. It is ideal for folks that want to do a little extra for their skin. It can burn a bit when you first put it on because of the peppermint oil but it dissipates and feels really nice as it dries on the skin. I am glad I go to try this product for free but I would definitely purchase it on my own.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Does have a slight smell like sulfur. I could feel it tingling on my skin after I removed product my face felt very clean. I do like the product just not the smell.</li>
            <li> this product is my go too!!! pamper me sundays... is all about this amazing mud face mask.&lt;br /&gt;i even sometimes put it on my back and chest for some extra deep cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;youll feel a tingling when you put the mask on. but thats just the natural dead sea minerals doing their magic.</li>
            <li> Its been a month since i purchased this mask, its working very well even though i havent seen the differences that much. it helps me relax and makes my skin clear and fresh.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Packing was awesome! Came in a box and was double sealed :D&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is perfect not watery or anything. Def high quality. It went on smooth and never once did it burn or itch my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I had so much fun! I would recommend this to anyone and we will be back for more when this is gone easy. The only thing that was a bit hard was the smell. It was really really strong and to smell it for 10 minutes was a little hard to deal with but the results make it all worth it! Super smooth skin! I will be sharing this with others for sure. I cant wait for them to get hooked like I am :)</li>
            <li> Just received this today and had to use it right away.  I love using masks. It came very quickly. I loved the cooling sensation on my face. Came off pretty easy too.  My face felt very soft and smooth.  I would definitely purchase again,</li>
            <li> This mask is totally worth the money!  I take antibiotics and lotions for my Acne Prone skin.  I am able to add this to my skin regimen without drying out my skin.  In fact, it does the opposite.  It actually leaves my skin feeling nourished but not oily (I have very oily skin).  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The product was good. I brought this during last week and tried it and it was exactly like the mud. Continuing this every week for a period to see the results.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it has a funky minty smell. Leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes pre-mixed because I need every time saver available!</li>
            <li> I would like 2 state that this is a b- day gift&lt;br /&gt;2 my wife. There hasn&#x27;t Been tested yet,&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m sure the product is fine.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this product at first.  So I took a chance plus I based it on the high reviews.  When I first applied it, it felt great and even has a tingling sensation (to let you know that it’s working).  To get to the point, the Dead Sea Mud Mask “DELIVERS”.  The description about this product does exactly what it says.  I immediately saw a difference in my skin and it even made me look much younger (it literally cleans your pores, brightens and clears your complexion).  What I really like most about this product is that you don’t have to use it daily (but only once a week).  Like most competitive products out there where you have to use “THREE” bottles in order to have clear skin.. (please…).  With the Dead Sea Mud Mask, there’s only 1 application once a week and your done‼  Plus the mud mask should last you for more than a month.. talk about getting your money’s worth.   All I know is what I’ve seen..  After using the Dead Sea Mud Mask, I no longer have rough skin and clogged pores any longer.  Not only is my face crystal clear but I look so much youthful.. almost like tasting the fountain of youth.  I’m telling you boys and girls.. this product is your “ANSWER”.  Forget about the 3 step program from those other competitors.  I’m telling you.. invest in this mud mask and you’ll see a huge difference.  I’ve tried many products, and yes… even the 3 step one and had NO results like this Dead Sea Mud Mask did for me.  This is truly a one of kind, a gem to your skin.  They have a committed customer for life.</li>
            <li> Lovely product. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it once but it felt great! Especially once I washed it off; it left should a clean and smooth feel to my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two weeks..my face getting cleaner and cleaner...thanks!</li>
            <li> When it first arrived I felt jipped by the size of the jar BUT once I opened it and applied a thin layer to my face I realized this product is going to last me a very long time. A little goes a long way and this mask feels amazing. I&#x27;m the type to try everything and anything so I&#x27;m always a bit skeptical about the claims. However this mask truly delivers, after one use my face felt super soft and clean. The smell is a bit minty but you can also catch a whiff of the actual mud. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and cannot wait to see the long term benefits of using this mask.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the mask for a few days and it seems to do what I expected it to. My face feels detoxified. On a personal note, the eucalyptus is quite strong. The mask has a burning feel when first applied but then it calms down. I think that I will continue to use it and see how it works out over time.</li>
            <li> I have used once and it left my face feeling very soft and hydrated You also get a *lot* for your money. The communication with/from seller of this product is excellent.</li>
            <li> The product is really good. I can feel a glow in my skin after using it.</li>
            <li> It is awesome! It burns a little but it leaves the skin feeling moist and looking full</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice and skin glowing</li>
            <li> I really love this mask, I got it because it was well rated but it was even better than I expected. Its slightly grainy to exfoliate and after you take it off your face feels so fresh and moisturized even though its a mask. Also feels very natural and not like its full of chemicals!</li>
            <li> The amount of pain this mask causes is not okay, but the result is AMAZING. If you use it regularly, the pain goes away (depends on your skin tone how often you use it). I try to do full face about once a week, with every night or every other night, putting it on just the acne trouble zones. When I stick to this, my face clears up almost completely. I&#x27;m 17 and this has helped my face get clearer than its been in about 5 years.    But again, let me emphasize on the amount of pain. The first time you use it, most likely it will feel like there is acid on your face. DO NOT GET IT NEAR YOUR EYES. But this is how you can tell it&#x27;s working. (be sure you&#x27;re not allergic to anything before you use it though so that you don&#x27;t mistake allergic reaction for the usual pain). But usually the first time is the worst. After that, use it regularly and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much. As I said the pain is how you know it is working. The longer you go without doing it, the more oils and toxins, the more pain. And luckily, when it does hurt, the pain doesn&#x27;t last that long (although it may feel like it). Once it starts drying, it stops hurting.     To end this on a positive note, it leaves my skin so soft, and helps remove the oil buidup, and clear it up of acne. I have tried a lot of products for my acne, but this has helped the most. I will definitely continue buying this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask!  It has a cooling affect that leaves my skin feeling great afterwards!  I recommend using a mask bush for application as using fingers can get quite messy. The mud itself is very smooth and applies easily.  My face has a nice pink glow after using it and is soft and refreshed.  I recommend using quality organic/natural cleansers, toners, and moisturizers in addition to this product for the very best results.  Your face is worth it!  I will be purchasing this mask for my daughters for Christmas as I know they will also love it!  Delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. Only a small amount is needed to get a great result. Bang for the buck is definitely there.</li>
            <li> I just started using it so it is hard to tell how it works right now. But it looks good after first use will see.</li>
            <li> I have had acne issues for a long time and now in my mid twenties I still struggle with it from time to time. I came across this product by recommendation from my sister of course it was not this exact brand but in general she said I should use a mud face mask to help clear my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course being a guy, I was against the idea of doing something what I and most men would consider so feminine in regards to personal hygiene. But after I got a pretty bad episode of acne I seized upon my sister&#x27;s advice and purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using extra care to prevent discovery from my 4 other male roommates that I utilize a face mask I have been using this for about a month now. During the time that I started using this, my face has not broken out like it usually would and thus I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I used warm water to remove the mask after it dried, because let&#x27;s face it being a man means that I don&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t know how to use this properly, my sister told me that you&#x27;re supposed to remove it while it&#x27;s dry by just rubbing it in circles (that would have been useful knowledge that the instructions left out) then you wash off whatever is left with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that after use my skin feel very oily so I always wash my face with my daily face wash. So far, happy results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Keeps skin clean and clear&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Makes me feel like a girl when I use it.</li>
            <li> Luckily I got this from taking surveys, so money isn&#x27;t a big deal this is kinda what I think without the price.&lt;br /&gt;SO I really like this so far I only been using it for two weeks (twice a week) and I already see a different. (I&#x27;m 14 btw) the first time I used it, it was kinda painful but I&#x27;m a good way. It feels minty fresh on my face and since it stung a little it made me think it was working. I love the scent to. It smells very earthy, minty and a hint of chocolate. The color is kind of a greenish gray. Anyway when I first took it off I first thought, Woo I look like a baby, no wrinkles what so ever! I was also glowing and redness around acne was diminish. My blackhead looked better too. Also my face was SOFT. I also have dry skin and it didn&#x27;t cause any problems whatsoever. The only problems I have with it is the results don&#x27;t last long, maybe a few hours tops. But I think over time the results will last longer. I usually use this after I wash off all my makeup, exfoliated, and than open my pores with warm water to get the best out of the mask. Also lush makes these great toner tabs that can really help with a face mask. If I don&#x27;t use that I use a toner after my face mask. I wouldn&#x27;t put this in the fridge since the mint feeling is pretty overpowering and it won&#x27;t help it keep it&#x27;s freshness. Plus it&#x27;s pretty weird for someoneyo find a mask in the fridge and I don&#x27;t think you want someone throwing out your $29.95 face mask. Just keep it in a cool place like under the sink.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t perform as expected, but it&#x27;s ok so far...</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good dead sea mud mask recently, and after seeing all these good comments about it, I decided to give it a try! #Feelingexcited</li>
            <li> I love this mud mask I usually use a mint julep clay mask but I think this mud mask might have took my clay mask&#x27;s place. When I first used this mask my skin felt super tingly an it burned a bit but I believe it was just the eucalyptus and other minerals drawing out the impurities out of my skin. You can read my full review below by clicking on the link below which will take you to my blog    [...]</li>
            <li> Great for a at home spa day!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! It helped brighten my skin and fade some dark spots on my face. The only thing Is that it kind if burns when you first apply it but than after a while it goes away. It&#x27;s easy to wash off and leaves your face feeling clear, clean, and brighter.</li>
            <li> I debated between 3 and 4 stars. Really good product has a little sting to it going on the face , I&#x27;m guessing from the eucalyptus oil in it. Skin feels nice and smooth after and very clean I&#x27;ve used it all week and it gives a good clean. Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. I do feel the difference.  My skin is softer.</li>
            <li> Just tried this for the first time. Face is smooth and brighter. Feels really clean.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good! I like it. It&#x27;s really help my face skin</li>
            <li> I stirred to mix the content in the jar thoroughly prior to using it. Then I applied a thin layer on my face and left it there for 30 mins. It glided on smoothly but tingled at lot. My skin did feel cleaner and fresher afterwards. I also love the fact that all of the ingredients in the jar are organic. This is actually the first store-bought facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I use this once a week, it makes my face feel smooth and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I dont like about it is that my skin smells very bad after use of this mask.</li>
            <li> Love the idea, but did dry my face out a bit, so could only us it occasionally.</li>
            <li> Love this mask! Easy to use, and makes skin super soft and clear. Great to use the night before a special occasion if you don&#x27;t have time to get a facial! I plan on ordering it again!</li>
            <li> I feel like it worked on the first use. My skin is very sensitive. When I first apply it stings. But it did not last long. My skin was stretched and softer. Be careful with your hairline. It is harder to wash it from hair.</li>
            <li> Great stuff keeps me clean and acne free</li>
            <li> I recieved a discount on this item in return for a review. It felt nice on, and didn&#x27;t smell awful like others I&#x27;ve tried. I had a couple of black heads pop up after using it, but I don&#x27;t know if it was from this or from something else.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have been using it once a week as instructed and I have noticed a huge difference in my blemishes and the texture of my skin. The only MINOR con is the scent. Overall, Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Just minutes ago i tried this product for the very first time. Definitely the best mask i have ever bought, worth every penny. As other reviewers have said, it kinda tingled and had this burn sensation after you applied it on your face but once you wash your face, the results are clean face and more brighter hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> I started using it for a little while.  Not bad.  Although, it started getting moldy (?!) so I had to throw it out.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing that again.  When does mud get moldy?</li>
            <li> I just got it today, so it&#x27;s not like I can write in great detail anything significant. However, I did use it and let it dry as I was arranging my closet. After 25 minutes, I washed it off only to feel my face being super soft with a hint of moisturizing. At first I thought it was going to make my face shiny because I have naturally oily skin. However, the oils in the mud totally got absorbed by my skin. No oil slick or grease face as some products tend to do to my type of skin. Pretty good results for a mask that I&#x27;ve only used once.</li>
            <li> I have been a big user of masks for many years.  This one is very nice.  It most definitely is a cooling and mildly tingling mask.  Not too drying and mildly exfoliating when you remove it.  Leaves your skin feeling pretty refreshed.  Probably not for very sensitive skin types though.  As its a little different than clay masks, its a nice change.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I found this mask! I just tried it and it made my skin feel tingly but not itchy, if it feels itchy you might have had a bad reaction to it. After I removed it my skin was pink for a few minutes but quickly returned to my normal color. My skin is now silky and soft. It did not over dry either. I definitely recommend this to everyone and I will be buying this again in the future.</li>
            <li> Very effective on the first use. Dries quickly and makes face look clear and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Works well but smells pretty bad!</li>
            <li> This product is great for the skin, and it DOES relax and de-stress you. After you wipe all of the blue off, you&#x27;ll feel your skin tighter and more polished. It&#x27;s just a nice refreshment to the face, use after a long day!</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and I was worried that this product will cause more irritation on my skin.  However, the first time I used this product I felt that it was working.  I felt the tingling warm sensation knowing that the product is actually working.  I waited 10 minutes and I followed exactly what the instruction stated.  My skin felt smoother and glowing.  I continuously felt the cool sensation after washing my face.  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve really used a mask, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it does make my skin very smooth and reduces oil in my T-zone.  I won&#x27;t use it more than once a week because I don&#x27;t want to dry out my skin.  I would recommend using a moisturizer afterward and daily if your skin is dry.  The mask stung the first time I tried it and when I questioned it they told me to stir it up because the oils can rise to the surface and stirring did help.  They also provided a free skin care E-book with lots of ways to take care of the skin. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Im in Love with this mask 😍makes my skin so radiant and heathy looking just i wanna be putting this mask every day 😳 just gr8 mask that i will be keep buying .BTW shipping was quick almost like next day thats a score  right  ,-) Happy with Dead Sea Mud Musk all&lt;br /&gt;The way.</li>
            <li> Love this mud mask, my skin has never been so smooth and clean before.. I used it twice a week leave my skin feeling wonderful every time i use it</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way and its definitely worth it!  I just love the scent of the oils in this mask and love the moisturizing and conditioning properties of the mud.  I also love that the ingredients are all natural and organic.  Im definitely hooked on this stuff!  Read my full review at TheBeeHiveBuzz dot com!</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel. It tingles and has a weird feeling-- but I like it! when I wash it off it just makes me feel so refreshed! The other day I said to my boyfriend &amp;#34;feel my face, its so soft!&amp;#34; and he felt it and said &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34; because even he realized how soft this mask was making my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face and chest (lots of sun damage) once a week and it couldn&#x27;t be more perfect for how things are going so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I haven&#x27;t had that much time to tell if it is making a long-term difference. I will update once I know! :)</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my face super smooth and silky... I really feel a difference after using it. I use the mask once a week and it seems to also have helped my acne too. I&#x27;ll be buying more once I run out.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Best mask I have bought :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice but so far I really like it. I have really sensitive skin and I worried that I would react negatively using this but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. It feels really tingly when it goes on but I think that&#x27;s normal and just means it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s not a bad feeling, just different. I leave the mask on about 20 minutes and when I remove it, my skin does feel really nice. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s making a dramatic difference or not but I like the way my skin feels and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Having used the mud face mask, my skin felt beautiful and smooth, just like a babies bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended it to my friends and family already.</li>
            <li> I like it very much,because it is very suited for me.I think,next time.I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is okay. I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it dried out my skin and made it red afterwards. If it weren&#x27;t for this, I would have rated better. I use another brand now from Amazon (true you organics dead sea mud mask) which is much better on my skin...</li>
            <li> This product takes time to adjust to I think. I tried it for the first time today and it has a strong minty odor which I don&#x27;t care for all that much. I put it on and immediately felt it getting hot on my face - so I left it on about 1 minute total and then rinsed it off. I don&#x27;t like &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; masks and this one is sure hot and tingly. Afterwards my skin is really soft - so if I continue to use it 1-2x a week I will just leave it on for about 1 minute again. I love masks that when you put them on they feel like you have nothing on or a slight cooling feeling - but not burning/hot/tingly. Just an okay product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered this mask, seems like it s a great product. When I got it, I apply it on my face then immediately felt burn on my face and getting worse. I couldn&#x27;t stan the burn feeling, I left it on my skin not even a minute, I had to wash it off. My cheeks were red from the burn. Can&#x27;t imagine if I used it longer than I did how my face would turn into!!!!</li>
            <li> AA+++ Great Mud Mask :) Love it! Highly Recommended &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this mask, it makes my skin feel so soft and has helped my overall complexion, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks I loved it so much. It did really good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I think i&#x27;m gonna buy it again</li>
            <li> Trying to reduce my nose pores/blackheads that I have had for years. I use this stuff almost everyday. I am a greasy italian so this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry me out. The first time I used it I thought my face was going to catch fire. I am used to it now and like the slight burn and tingle. The minty smell is nice, I tried another mask that said mix with vinegar and it smelled horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product, when I wash it off my pores do look smaller, I think. My blackheads always seem to become visible again the next morning though, I probably should have started this stuff sooner before my nose got overrun. Well s***, I should go wash this mask off now. Toodles.</li>
            <li> Pros: Feels smooth on the skin, works FAST, started clearing up my acne after only a day.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It smells very strong which I expected so I didn&#x27;t mind, I also want to mention that this burns surprisingly a lot. I do not have sensitive skin and I am used to using products like this but it does hurt when you put it on.</li>
            <li> good product. received early!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and this is what she had to say &amp;#34;My skin is noticeably clearer. It&#x27;s been a couple of days since I used the stuff and it stung for the first few minutes. Then it just felt smoother after. Today I noticed that my skin is truly looking clearer. I&#x27;m only supposed to use it once a week so I&#x27;ll have to see if it lessens my breakouts by using it for several weeks. But pretty cool product&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Folks- bear in mind that any Dead Sea product must be groundtruthed as these are minerals exploited from occupied Palestine. That means that by buying it, you may be supporting incitement to genocide and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. Please stand with the people of Palestine who have lost over 80% of their country through invasion.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing! It really shrinks pores and helps with my super oily skin. If I use this product on a weekly basis is does a lot more for me. I gave it a four star because when I first recieved this product, it burned my face, by that I mean there was an over abundance of mint, or eucalyptus or something. As time has went on though, it&#x27;s way more pleasant now. It gives such a clean and fresh feeling when your done. It is a mud mask so like with any mud mask there is a \\&quot;muddy\\&quot; smell to it afterwards. But it fades pretty fast. Overall i would definitely recommend this product! #deadseamudmask</li>
            <li> Not only does my skin feels smoother and tighter after using the mask but to my surprise, it also feels healthier.  I find myself touching my face several times a day just to see if it still feels so smooth. I&#x27;m enjoying the results; they are Much better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for the past three weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic or immediate results thus far. I will say that it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean, but my pores do not look any smaller or tightened at all. Also, while I like that they use natural ingredients and that you get quite a bit of product for the price point, the mask did burn my eyes the first few minutes I had it in until it dries. I might just have sensitive eyes, but I had to keep them closed (and no, I didn&#x27;t even have it very close to my eyes themselves...it&#x27;s just very strong). I was sent this mask for my unbiased consideration and review so I am glad that I got to try it out, but honestly I would not purchase it as I have tried other masks in the past that have shown me results within this time frame.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good mud mask for awhile now and this one works great!!! Doesn&#x27;t have one of those funky smells like some do and it left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is one my favorite facial masks. The dead sea are great ingredients and this product really embraces those ingredients. My skin is smooth and wow does have a nice glow! I tell everyone you got try it, it make you face look and feel so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> I find the smell irritating fragrance wise and to my eyes. There&#x27;s something in it that causes tingling of the skin and makes my eyes water and  so on that i don&#x27;t really like having it on my face. I am going to assume its the Eucalyptus oil I have that essential oil and it does the same. I only tired it on my hand so far and my eyes were burning from that lol.</li>
            <li> It burned my face at the first time, but I felt better the next time..&lt;br /&gt;I hope the Dead Sea Mud Mask can reduce my acens..</li>
            <li> I have tried many face masks hoping to find one that benefits my skin, but also doesn&#x27;t irritate. You see, I have incredibly sensitive skin and using the wrong product can be an absolute disaster. Fortunately, this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask goes on smoothly and you only need a small amount to get good coverage. It dries fairly quickly and washes off easily, and leaves my skin smoother that before the treatment. I also use it as a quick spot treatment for blemishes and irritations and it helps to reduce swelling and redness. The only thing I didn&#x27;t really is that the mask comes in a tub, and it made it a little messy for me. Overall, it&#x27;s a great mask.</li>
            <li> It has a tingle to it and your face feels wonderful after you use it. It leaves your face soft and fresh and clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft&amp;smooth and exfoliates my dry skin without being too harsh. My breakouts have minimized and im looking forward to using it every week!</li>

Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> You can literally feel the mask working, and I can attest that my skin was smoother and had a little glow after just one use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I actually use it as a nightly scruff after I wash my makeup off. Ive been using it for about 2 months now and it has cleared my skin immensely. Recommended</li>
            <li> End result was fantastic - my skin feels refreshed! It felt a little weird when I first put it on but was fine after a few seconds. I have sensitive skin, but it left no irritation!</li>
            <li> You can feel it cleaning and soothing your skin right away. I&#x27;ve only used it once. Will update after using it a few more times. Like it so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I have to say this is the best product ever!! I have dark skin with psoriasis around my nose which got worse with a pinkish  scar that was noticeable and embarrassing . After I got this product and use it it restored my skin in about 1-2 weeks with no marks at all, I used it about once a week sometime 2 times a week. After seeing what this product does I will definitely buy again after once I run out.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. The smell is a great mint aroma, followed the direction on Amazon(container doesn&#x27;t have much on good detailed instructions.) Great price and received it quickly</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask from Pure &amp; Essential Minerals works great. Actually my wife is using it and she loves it :)</li>
            <li> As my face and neck get very dry at most times, I like to find products that would help my skin. I must say that I like this product because putting on the mask has help my eczema from breaking out. I use this once a week or whenever I have time to use it. (Recommendation is to use it 10-15 minutes once a week only). Putting this on has kept my skin tight and clear out my pores to prevent from breaking out. Love this mask and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was simply amazing the feeling of my skin being de-toxed and knowing the results would be incredible.  Try it!  You will not be sorry.  Love everything about this product</li>
            <li> It STINGS like hell!!!!!!  Don&#x27;t know why there are so many good reviews here(I was so wrong to believe those reviews and bought the item).  Even though the ingredients are so natural and no harsh chemicals in it, which I like, I just feel so painful to use it every time.  I will have to try my very best to finish it........don&#x27;t know if it helps to clean my skin or not.....only feeling STINGING!!!!!</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF YOU CAN FEEL WORKING AND IT&#x27;S THE BEST MASK I&#x27;VE EVER TRIED AND I&#x27;VE TRIED LOTS! IT TINGLES AND MAKES MY FACE FEEL ALL THESE SENSATIONS AND IT&#x27;S SO CLEAN AND TIGHT WITH MY PORES SO MINIMIZED THEY&#x27;RE BARELY VISIBLE. WHEN I USE THIS I JUST KNOW THAT  IT&#x27;S DOING SOMETHING, &#x27;GOOD&#x27; TO MY FACE AND NECK. DEFINITELY, WORTH A TRY, WORTH THE BUY. I&#x27;LL BE RE-PURCHASING IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> The mask was easy to apply, dries in about 15 min, and was easy to remove. I felt my skin was cleaner afterwards. Use it on an oily skin, as you need some protection from this product. It is pretty strong. The eucalyptus in it made my eyes tear. If you have a very sensitive skin, this is probably not the mask for you. Overall, my skin (mixed, oily), can handle it, but I would not recommend this product to all. On the positive side, it has not been tested on animals, and the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li> The stamps of this product is tumbledown, it does not look like from good company.&lt;br /&gt;It is very terrible.&lt;br /&gt;When i use it, it liked burn my face. i can&#x27;t bear  in 1 min. then, my face is swell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller, please checking your product.</li>
            <li> Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work on me..</li>
            <li> Amazing face mask. The best I have ever tried. My skin is sensitive so most clay masks irritate my face but this mask did not irritate my face at all. And my skin felt great afterwards. My daughter, whose skin is oily, loved this mask as much as I did. She said it really helped clear up her complexion. I have tried much more expensive face masks and they weren&#x27;t near as good as this one. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The ingredients list is appealing, but the listing title and tons of positive reviews made me nervous. Nothing on Amazon is rated THAT amazingly without some drawbacks. But honestly, after trying it for a pretty reasonable price, it&#x27;s 100% spot on! This mask feels AMAZING on the skin, granted a little disturbingly tingly at first but it goes away quickly, and your skin looks amazing after using it. Some may not like the earthy smell but I personally love it. It recommends you use this once a week to prevent drying out your skin, and at that rate this one container will last you many many months. I think this is a must have for everyone, my new favorite mask!</li>
            <li> Just received this yesterday and already notice results after my first mask! I have been addicted to GlamGlow, but was looking for something a little less expensive, and, so far so good! It does have a pretty strong tingle factor that might be a little too intense for someone with sensitive skin, but that is something I enjoy in a good facial.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have never experienced this soft and smooth feeling of my skin ever before. Easy instructions and after 20 mins i can feel my skin restored back to many years younger. Excellent experience. I have to keep reminding myself to use it once a week due to my busy schedule.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and works great.  I have oily skin and it makes my skin so smooth and soft.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I just used this for my second time and my face feels sooo velvety soft. When you first put it on, it sort of burns and then tingles, but I think that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working. Initially, it smells pretty good but when you take it off, it leaves a strong odor that you smell for a couple of hours. Overall, it has good results, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the burning sensation or the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good. It makes my skin shinning and smooth. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice and it made my skin feel so clean and soft!</li>
            <li> This is a great mask....I love it. My skin looks brighter, refreshed</li>
            <li> I would really suggest this mask for many reasons. First of all you can see how your skin tone evens out after the couple first uses. I keep it in the fridge, so when i put it it feels really refreshing and you can feel it working while its on and after you wash it off, your skin is feeling very clean and fresh. Thank You</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie i used it twice however my skin broke out so much after that i will never use it again. Maybee it really works well for others however that was not my experience.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like something scraped off of the bottom of a lake, which it is; but, I expected something more like the usual mud mask, which doesn&#x27;t stink.  It made my face break out after one use.  Returned it.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this worked really well, after washing the face mask off, my face feels immediately refreshed.</li>
            <li> Inconsistent quality. My first jar was thick and dark and rich and great for exfoliation. The second was light green and watery and never dried. Two completely different products.</li>
            <li> I like the texture, the scent and the softness of my skin when I take it off.  Soft and clean...</li>
            <li> When I first used it I felt my skin was burning or smth. However my skin felt so much better after washing it off. From the second use, it didnt feel burning at all. This product makes my skin softer and cleaner.</li>
            <li> Loving this!  I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far (once a week for two weeks), but my face feels SO much softer after using it and the color of my skin is much more uniform - no blotches.  I&#x27;ve also found that I don&#x27;t need as much moisturizer through out the week after using this.</li>
            <li> I use this mask once a week and have been using for a month now (so 4 times) and I&#x27;ve seen a major improvement in my skin. It&#x27;s not as oily, my skin feels firmer and my pores appear smaller with much fewer blackheads,  for me this mask did everything it promised and I will definitely repurchase. It does tingle some, I found the sensation pleasant,  it was a cooling tingle that felt like this mask was opening up and clearing my pores but if you have extremely sensitive skin this may be uncomfortable.  Also, I have a oily t-zone and this mask keeps my oil at bay until I use it again but if you have very dry skin this mask may dry you out more so I would recommend using it only on problem areas every couple of weeks instead of weekly and follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different from what I used before.</li>
            <li> Helped get rid of most of my rocacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used original dead sea mud on my fave for many years but this product burned so badly it turned my face red and dried up.  After removing it,  my skin was still sizzling.  Feels like putting ben-gay on.  Probably a good product for people with really greasy skin.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! works great so skin will definately be purchasing in the future!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! My skin has never ever looked better.  My pores are closed and tight, My husband says I have a glow!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really noticed any effects from using this. But when I used this I tended to have breakouts.</li>
            <li> I tried other Mud Mask and by far this is the best one I have tried. Than you for the great product</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea mud facial mask. Works great you see improvements the 1st time you use it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so we as hesitant to try this. I&#x27;m so glad I did! It has worked wonders on my blemishes. I would definitely suggest trying this mask if you have hormone breakouts!!</li>
            <li> Very excited about this product. Could feel freshness in face after using it.</li>
            <li> Noticed an immediate change in my skin.  Skin looked refreshed and polished.  I had some reservations but after using, I was quite impressed.</li>
            <li> had to use this mud mask for a couple of weeks to give a review.. Verdict? hit the add to cart button.. this stuff leaves your face fresh,clean,smooth,tight and most important shiny... I love this mud mask better than the Lab Series for men. comes with a e-book for added value and knowledge.. after 3 weeks of using this mask.. people noticed how smooth my skin looks and I&#x27;m 40.. thanks Pure for having a excellent mud mask!</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT!!!!! I LOVE IT.  I USE IT ONCE A WEEK AND MY SKIN FEELS AND LOOKS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This mask is interesting. It&#x27;s like a pudding consistency. It&#x27;s wet&amp; not a thick clay. You only need a little not. Spreads out thinly. It tingles from the eucalyptus. Then it dries and tightens. I Used it&amp; so did my daughter. It smelled good at first but then leaves a smell behind like dirt.. Which it is mud.. So.. I guess that&#x27;s normal. But it lingered a while. I wish the eucalyptus lingered instead LOL</li>
            <li> This mud mask is pretty good.  I used to buy the powdered mud and mix it myself but it is very messy. This mud is way more convenient. A little pricey - but worth it for the convenience and mess factor alone. Seems to work pretty good on lessening acne issues.</li>
            <li> Just like many of the other reviewers...I thought that this product would help with clearing acne...it immediately  burned when I applied (and not in a good way). As I went to reviews to see if this was what others were experiencing,  I saw so many reviews of the same. So I washed it off and placed my green tea oil and moisturizer to combat the burning feeling. It helped but my face is still supper red. Hopefully I don&#x27;t break out more like other reviewers did. :/</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time tonight. Going on tonight&#x27;s experience I am very pleased. My skin is softer and seems firmer. I am 73 years old and few products if any in prove my skin. It feel tight and I can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> Just tried today,feels clean and smooth after clease,will see if it&#x27;s getting better every time use</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews and I can honestly say its well worth it. I have been using it for about 2-3 weeks now and I love it. I think the price is decent for this mask because it really feels as organic as it says. Its like a muddy sea sand feeling just like how it says and it smells like sea mud too. I dont really mind the smell since it doesnt bother me. When you put it on you immediately feel this tingling sensation that lasts about 2-3 minutes after you smear it on (for some really really sensitive skin people it may differ). I let it dry for 15 minutes and wash it off and it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and smooth. I dont have acne prone skin, just a few pimples here and there and this mask really helps clean my face so I noticed that my skin stays clear longer! The container itself may not look much but the product will last for many months as long as you use it twice a week with a reasonable amount of product. Hope my review helped, will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The mask was loose as water and didn&#x27;t want to stay on my face. It was a nightmare.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely Dead Sea Mud mask that will leave your skin feeling clean and refreshed. You&#x27;ll definitely feel a tingle while the mud is in place and drying, but it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable - just noticeable. Since the mud is a bit messy to rinse off, I recommend applying and cleansing the mask from your face in the shower. And most importantly, enjoy your freshly de-toxed, cleansed, firmed skin! :)</li>
            <li> I really love how my skin feels while using this product! It has lasted me for almost 6 months - I use it 2,3 times a week. I have used it in conjunction with other serums and scrubs and I notice slight improvement in my skin. I plan on buying more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> This product does a amazing job. It make you feel like you just had a facial. Love it!</li>
            <li> The dead mask scared me at first. I didn&#x27;t think it would work just by looking at it. However I gave it a try and absolutely loved the results. I have sensitive skin so I was leery about how my skin would react to the product. However , it did nothing but provide me with a radiant glow. As a woman of color, it works</li>
            <li> Love it and works fast</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft, but no long term effects. Also my face gets red after using so I suggest using it before bed</li>
            <li> I have used dead mud mask for about 2 months now and I love it very much. My face feel soft and my pores get smaller after few uses. Even my mother and brother tried and they like it a lot.</li>
            <li> it hurts my skin. my few friend has the same problem</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this one time so far and I could tell a difference within that.&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be some tea tree oil in it so stay away from the eyes...&lt;br /&gt;My skin is more evenly toned and I feel like my pores are smaller too!</li>
            <li> We use this Dead Sea Mud Mask in our upscale SPA for mud wrap treatments. We are located in a very upscale area and our spa services are definitely not cheap. Compared to any of the clays or muds we&#x27;ve used before, this Dead Sea Mud Mask has shown the most impressive results as far as detoxifying skin and leaving it with a younger appearance. I have many clients that are signed up for monthly mud wraps since we&#x27;ve introduced the Dead Sea Mud. I think it&#x27;s because this mud has such a high concentration of minerals and organic essential oils that puts it on such a higher level than the other stuff we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, especially around my T-zone. I also have enlarged pores. I have been using this product weekly as recommended and after a couple of weeks I&#x27;ve noticed some really beneficial changes: my pores appear smaller and my skin is less oily in the days following the use of this mask. I like the smooth texture and natural ingredients. It&#x27;s really easy to apply to my face, unlike a lot of the thicker, sandier mud masks available. My face feels refreshed and clean after using it. I am very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> I use this once a week. It gives my skin a good complexion! Check prices before you buy, i did notice sometimes its 40 and sometimes its 30 dollars!</li>
            <li> It says I believe to only to use it once a week, and I&#x27;m still kind of experimenting with it. It hasn&#x27;t really cleared my skin that I have noticed, because I still have the black heads on my skin. We will see though. Quite honestly, I like seeing the nasty crap pulled out of my skin.  I had recently boughten the white jar of glam glow which I loved but it was too expensive and wanted something that was organic and mosturized. We will see though. And I also notice that when I rinse my skin after, my skin feels really oily like the water sits on top. It&#x27;s kinda weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now, and definitely enjoy it, but haven&#x27;t noticed any long term effects yet. It&#x27;s quite tingly when you first put it on, I&#x27;m guessing due to the eucalyptus oil. When you wash it off, it does leave your face amazingly soft without being overly dry like some masks.</li>
            <li> I am in love with mud masks.  I have a 13 old daughter whose face is starting to break out and I am prone to breakouts monthly (if you know what I mean) so when I was given the opportunity to test this dead sea mud mask for quality, I was elated.  There are a couple of reasons why I was impressed with this Pure brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several brands and what I like about this one is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like mud.  It has a minty smell.  The mud is also smooth and creamy.  I have tried others that were stiff and hard to put on.  This one can be applied with your fingers or a brush.  I used a brush as it is easier for me to avoid my eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on enough of the product so you could not see skin underneath.  It only takes about 10 minutes for the mask to dry.  As it&#x27;s drying, you can feel it tightening your skin.  It tingles at first, nothing painful.  It reminds me of how your mouth feels when you eat a peppermint patty; that same sensation.  You simply rinse it off when your time is up and you are left with soft, tight skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask draws out oils from your face so after removing the mask,  you will need to follow it up with a high quality moisturizer to complete your facial process.  You will not be disappointed with this mask.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Dead Sea Mud Masks in the past.  Everything from mix your own powder with water or Apple Cider Vinegar to already mixed in the jar like this one.  I have found that this mask is easier to apply than most. It goes on thick and stays in place.  I used it this morning and I noticed a difference in the size of my pores in my T-Zone area.  It shrunk my pores with the first application.  This was discounted so I decided to try it and I am glad that I did.  I have been looking for something to help my skin look more alive.  Enjoying the results.</li>
            <li> This feels like HEAVEN! I have oily face and this dead sea mud mask just pulls out all that yucky oil as well as impurities, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth as well as shrinking the appearance of my pores.I got this for a great deal in return for my unbiased feedback. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it! I love the smell; to me, it smells like peppermint so I don&#x27;t mind having this on my face until it dries. It has a tingly feeling while the mask does its magic on pulling out all that dirt from my face. I rinse it with warm water, pat my face with a clean towel and apply my night serum. In the morning, my face looks very refreshing and for someone who doesn&#x27;t really get that much sleep, this is great to prevent my face from looking tired. I strongly recommend this mud mask.  Oh by the way, make sure to also put it on your neck :D</li>
            <li> I received this dead sea mud facial mask that happened to come with a bonus FREE ebook for a consumer review. I love love love it. It is one of my favorite things. I am infatuated with any product that has dead sea minerals. They work amazingly on my skin. This jar is rather large in comparison to other products that I have bought with my favorite ingredient, a full 6 ounces. Since you only use this product one time per week it will last you a long time. I use this in the shower on Saturday nights. Right before I get into the shower I wash my face and allow it to air dry. Then I put the mask on and get into the shower. While I am letting the days stress leave my back and shoulders standing under the shower spray the mask dries. I allow it to dry for 10 minutes and then I wet my face slightly and massage in circular momentum over my face. I love it. I love how I can feel it exfoliate my skin and I love even more the amazing way my skin feels when the mask has been completely rinsed away. I know that this product was not targeted for other parts of the body, but I love it so much that I also use it on my elbows. They are always so dry and cracking. It works so good and it doesnt leave them sensitive or red. It just works so well at removing dried, dead skin that I cant control myself. I love it. This works great for acne, scars and skin conditions of many types.  Men and women can use it as well as teens. My youngest daughter will try to do a mud mask every night. As a teen girl she has her battle with acne, but ever since she added doing dead sea mineral masks to her skin regimen her face has really cleared up. This product really speaks for itself. You have to try it to believe it. If you do not completely LOVE it you can rest easy knowing that it comes with a complete refund for dissatisfaction. Buy and try today. And get some for a friend, too!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I saw all the good reviews of how it&#x27;s a miracle! DON&#x27;T LISTEN TO THEM. When I first put it on my face I burned but I thought that just meant it was working so I let it be and when I wash it off it made my face red and in the following morning I had HUGE painful zits. I regret buying this product...</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud is an experience to use. When you put it on it goes on smoothly and creates a tingling sensation for a few minutes. The mud hardens and after a good rinse, my skin feel great and the smell of eucaliptous is sensational. A must have or at least a must try.</li>
            <li> I always wanted a good mud mask for my skin. My skin used to be oily but suddenly since the past 6 months it has become extremely dry and pale.&lt;br /&gt;It has lost its color and lustre. Since i started using this mud mask i can feel my skin getting back its shine.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like applying dark color stuff on my face but well you need to sacrifice some things to look beautiful. I do not like the smell too much but it does its job good so i may as well ignore that.&lt;br /&gt;Its not very runny and stays fine on the face. Just apply and keep for 15 minutes for it dry up and then wash it. You will instantly feel your skin soft and nice. I love how my skin looks and feels since i have started using this. Its easy to use and the quantity is good too.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is a product I was able to purchase at a reduced cost for product testing purposes. When you first apply this mask,  it feels like a tingling sensation. Shortly after that it hardens slightly. It is best to remove the mask with warm water &amp; a wash cloth.The directions suggest using a circular motion when washing it off so thats what I did. It is a good size jar that should last awhile! It really works well, my face felt slightly softer after the 1st use! It also helped reduce the size of my pours &amp; helped clear up my pimples. The only reason I am giving it a 4 star review is because the smell of this mud mask is a bit strong &amp; stinky to me, but I can over look that because of how well I feel this mask works.</li>
            <li> My sisters always come over and ask to use this mask! I love the way it makes my face feel and letting the mask dry. It feels like an at-home spa! Definitely loved and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just tried this product. The mud is a bit softer than the last product I used so I was skeptical at first. However, it spread really easily across my face. After about my a minute, the mud started to heat up and as I walked the bathroom, there was a nice cooling sensation. It took the mask about 15 minutes to fully dry. After I had washed the mask from my face, I felt my face feel tighter. On a close inspection of my face, I noticed that there were white marks that I did not notice before. I realized this was the dirt coming to the surface (I have not kept up with any of my facial routines in a few months). I am confident that the more I use this product, the better the results will be. I can&#x27;t wait to continue using this !</li>
            <li> Love this mask it makes my face feel and look alive!</li>
            <li> I like this mask very much. It has a nice mix of shea butter, aloe and jojoba with herbs. The eucalyptus makes it feel very refreshing.</li>
            <li> At 25, I have pretty acne prone skin. Partially genetics, partially life choices/diet. I truly feel tat masks really have helped my skin. I had used the mask about three times with positive results. It seemed to &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34; my skin. Moisturizing it and helping to clear it any active, mature break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week ago, I had the worst breakout that I can remember. I could attribute it to a couple of things. My skin was red, painful, and irritated. I picked at it to the point of making myself bleed. The other day, I got home from work and applied a thin coat to my severely affected areas. Usually, I leave it on for an hour or so. This time, because my face was so broken out, I left it on while I slept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up, the results weren&#x27;t miraculous, but exponentially better. My face wasn&#x27;t as red and my bigger pimples started to dry up and shrink. I just applied a thick coat all over my face and it feels better. This really does work (again, no miraculous results for me) and I definitely plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! My skin is so soft and looks great too. I pit it on my sons eczema and it looks better than it has in a long time. The mud smells kind of minty, which is nice, and it tingles when it is drying so its awesome! Highly recommend! I got this for $1.00 on Snagshout.com , but when I run out I will definitely pay full price!</li>
            <li> Great face mask product! It really works especially on oily or combination skin like mine. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months and it really cleans out impurities from the pores. It gives deep down cleansing for blackheads and breakouts.</li>
            <li> This mask is awesome. It actually kind of reminds me of Glamglow. It has eucalyptus oil in it so there is kind of a month smell that leaves your face all tingly (with an added bonus of clearing out your sinuses by the time the mask is ready to be washed off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this mask after a particularly bad breakout and I noticed a huge difference the next day. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural mask that will clear out your pores, then this will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*i was given a coupon code to review this product*</li>
            <li> Hi there, I enjoyed using this product and feel it is of high quality! I use a lot of Dead Sea Mud Masks and this is by far the best one I have tried. I have used many other brands, and for the money this is something I will definitely be coming back to for my Mud Mask Skincare needs! Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda</li>
            <li> The mask dries quickly and allows your skin to feel refreshed. Il keep using it to see what others benefits there are.</li>
            <li> I received the Dead Sea Mud Face Mask in good condition.  The packaging is appealing - light and uncluttered.  The mask itself is much &amp;#34;soupier&amp;#34; than I expected.  Most other mud masks I&#x27;ve used are more clay-like.  This mask is more like pudding that hasn&#x27;t set yet.  While I felt this made applying the mask a little more difficult, the Dead Sea Mud Mask otherwise performed wonderfully.  It dried within 10 minutes and was easy to remove with a bit of warm water.  My skin definitely felt softer, my pores were smaller and less noticeable, and my skin glowed!  I was very happy with the results and will definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> amazing product! saw results right away.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service was amazing too!</li>
            <li> This facial mask was right on time. I was shopping for a facial mask that could handle my in between skin and bring back my face and neck skin area that has seen better days. I&#x27;m not exactly old, however 21 didn&#x27;t last forever either. I just used Dead Sea Mud Face Mask over the weekend and have made facials my new thing. After applying the mask only for 15 minutes, I rinsed with cool water and could feel the difference before my face reached the mirror. The first thing that I noticed is that my pores are much smaller. I&#x27;m very apprehensive about trying new beauty products, but this one is going into my collection. My skin was much smoother and even felt lighter. Plus its all natural, so the recommended weekly treatment is going to be apart of my routine.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before and I am buying it again. It is an amazing feeling on your face body and hair. It&#x27;s a day at the spa without leaving your home. My husband also uses it on his dry hands and it heals fast. I&#x27;m so in love with this.</li>
            <li> It left my face a little bit red and irritated, but it has eucalyptus in it and sometimes my skin doesn&#x27;t do well with that. I can&#x27;t really blame them for that.</li>
            <li> awesome product that works great as a mask. leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth! product is a very good size and will last through many masks! :)</li>
            <li> The mud peel is easy to apply. I love this product!</li>
            <li> The promotion for this was $1.00 and my thoughts are that this a great product. Fast shipping and does as stated. Would order again.</li>
            <li> So far so good. We&#x27;ve been using it every few days and works well. There is a smell but nothing overbearing. We&#x27;ll keep using it and​ report back with any major changes that we see.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply on but feel like peppermint and icy burn. I know it&#x27;s weird to say that, but it&#x27;s icy burn.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels like burned but cool! Hard to explain. Maybe my skin is too sensitive? If your skin are sensitive, don&#x27;t try it.</li>
            <li> Smooth texture, OK smell (not so strong), do feel a difference after a first try. Once its drying on your face, you can feel it the tickling, but at the same time you feel its doing the job. Once face is washed, it does look cleaner and fresher. I have no complaints. I will continue using it and would recommend it. Mud mask are usually my preference.</li>
            <li> My wonderful mask is the best:)), thanks, my clients is very happy for result :)))</li>
            <li> Well, I am a man and I would just like to share with you my experience with this amazing product. Before, i was very worried because i have been suffering from a lot of blemishes including dark spots on my skin from my previous acne attack and I was so depressed until i saw this product online. I tried it and I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE RESULT! i love it!</li>
            <li> great for deep cleaning</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before, and it&#x27;s usually great... Really rich texture, not too harsh, actually looks like mud, etc. My most recent purchase of it, however, has been a total letdown. This batch is watery, sandy, is uncomfortable on my skin and never dries. It&#x27;s also so thin it&#x27;s useless for exfoliation. It&#x27;s a completely different color and consistency than what I&#x27;ve gotten in the past. If the first batch I bought had been like my most recent one, I would have never re purchased it. The price has drastically changed, too... Makes me wonder if that price drop is being reflected in the product quality. If the next jar I buy is the same poor quality as this current jar, I will not buy it anymore.    ***Update 1/21/15***    I just received another jar of this product, and just like the last time, the consistency is terrible and the quality is very poor compared to when I first started buying it. I will be returning this jar and will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only use once so far. However, it shows a difference on my skin right after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;It hurts a little bit when I start to apply on my face, but soon it will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;And my skin becomes pretty soft afterward. Nice product with decent price!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. You can feel the tingling when you put it on. I waited the 10mins, but didn&#x27;t notice anything right away. However, I could see the difference the next morning. My skin not only felt higher, it looked tighter. My pores were smaller which made my skin look softer.&lt;br /&gt;Went through the first bottle and on my second. I did notice however that it went up in price by $4.00 so if it keeps increasing like that I&#x27;ll be rethinking future purchases. I wanted something without the &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; price tag and this fit the bill…..as long as the price is right, I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are organic and cruelty free. I have made many DIY face masks in the past but this is the first mud mask I have tried, and it was wonderful! It gave a tightening feel and left my face feeling refreshed. I think my favorite part about the mask is that it was actually so easy to clean off, I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
            <li> I got the product this morning and immediately tried it on. It works really good on my sensitive skin and leaving my skin smooth and hydrated</li>
            <li> I got addicted to facial masks about a year ago. Until then I had never really used them. Thanks to my different subscription boxes I&#x27;ve been able to try a wide variety of them. For a long time my favorite was a clay mask, but I think this product just edged it out. I love how soft my skin feels after. While I’ve only done a couple applications, I can see a small difference in the overall appearance of my skin. I know it going to take more time for the full results to materialize though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask does have a tingling/cooling sensation. I know others have said it feels more like burning, so mileage may vary. I honestly didn’t mind it and even enjoyed it. However, I will say to keep it a good distance away from your eyes. The first time I tried it out, I thought I had wide enough margins, but didn’t. My eyes started to water like crazy. Once I wiped it back some I was fine though and haven’t had the problem again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slight smell, but it’s not that bad. I’m pretty sensitive about scents triggering headaches, but this one didn’t bother me at all. The texture is pretty consistent to other mud/clay masks I’ve tried. A tad watery, but not horribly so. If you like your masks thick, you may to use a couple dabs per area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an A+ experience. I can’t wait to see what kind of results long term usage will bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: I did receive this product for free for an honest opinion from BrandBacker</li>
            <li> Had the cleaning of my life! Love this so much! It has unclogged my pores and nothing ever had before. It did brighten my skin and it looks younger. My husband noticed my skin after a 2 weeks, i use it 2-3 times a week . It is not strong on the face only some might find it because it has a minty feel to the skin. I have oily skin and it does not dry or leave face more oily. Just use a good moisturizer after for better results. Love love love</li>
            <li> Application: This product comes in a jar, so make sure your fingers and nails are very clean before dipping in. The mask has kind of a liquidy muddy texture, not too think. It smelled like eucalyptus oil and made my face tingly. It was almost a little too strong as it left my eyes watering as well.  I left it on for about 5-10 minutes and then removed with a wash cloth.  When rinsing it off in the shower, I did detect more of the sulfury smell you expect in a mud mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: This mask leaves your skin feeling refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li> I had never used any sort of mud mask before so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  Since it is a MUD mask, I think I was expecting a sort of musty gross smell, but I was very pleasantly surprised when it had more of a eucalyptus scent to it.  I also expected it to be very gritty and rough, but it has a smoother texture to it.  It was nice and thick and went on very easily.  Because it has eucalyptus oil in it, it has a tingling feeling at times.  When I first put it on it actually felt like it was stinging my face (which made me pretty nervous) but then after a minute or two it lessened to just a cool tingle.  After I washed it off, my face felt very refreshed, but it did dry out my skin a bit.  After about 10 minutes I felt my face again and it was REALLY soft.  I didn&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; right away which I was a little bummed about.  I also didn&#x27;t notice any change in my wrinkles/lines or pores, but I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.  Maybe after a couple more times I will notice more of a difference.</li>
            <li> I got  my skin irritated ...</li>
            <li> I love this product so far. It arrived the next day thanks to prime. I used it that same night and the huge pimple I had on my cheek for the past two days wasn&#x27;t there the next morning. Whats even better is that after using I could see a difference in my skin. My only problem is the smell. It literally smells like the sea. I don&#x27;t like the sea, still extremely satisfied</li>
            <li> First of all, I really like being able to order new products from Amazon, as I tend to be very anxious to try them out, plus I can read lots of reviews.  Second, for $25, you get a huge tub of the mask – bigger than what most night creams come in.  Third, this stuff works.  They say that the natural silica found in the black mud hardens on the skin once you apply the mask.  This step allows the mask to extract toxins and impurities located deep in the skin layers, and also to attach to dead skin cells.  I can actually feel it working as it dries.  After I wash it off, my face feels so smooth and hydrated – and it stays that way for days.  It does have a bit of an unpleasant smell to it, but I’ve started using this weekly and don’t notice it much any more.  And it doesn’t leave my skin smelling funky after I wash my face, so it’s not a big problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mud masks before and this one ranks top 3.. Good scent and left my face super soft afterwards. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This mask exceeds all other masks out there. I absolutely love this, how it makes my face feel right after I take it off is like nightlife and day from before using. Love that this company uses all natural ingredients... I especially appreciate the effects it has had on my face/skin after only 2 uses.</li>
            <li> It smells but it is amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how this was going to work for me and my sensitive skin but it reduced the size of my pores! It left my skin feeling smooth and clean after the very first wash. I definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Over all this is great, and I like it , the scent, and texture, and it does clean my face!!!</li>
            <li> Great mud facial, left skin smooth, soft, and nourished. I&#x27;ve had it about a month now and have used it weekly since, I love it so far. The ebook that came with it is a nice addition too, informative on keeping your skin and self healthy, a nice little read. Overall, satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This Mud Mask has worked amazingly well for me in the past month.  I have overly oily skin that breaks out randomly and frequently.  This mask seems to penetrate deeply enough to unclog the pores and keep them free from building up;no longer have oily skin and it feels much cleaner. I typically use the mask twice a week, unless there&#x27;s a breakout, then up to  four times a week. The mask has a very pleasant,natural fragrance.  Highly recommend for those fighting oily skin issues.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Very happy with the results&#x27; - says the girlfriend. Cleaner, refreshed, healthy glow. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I have used this mask for a couple of weeks now and can already notice a difference.  My regimen has been once a week and before I apply the mask I use a facial steamer to open my pores.  I have large pores and oily skin, so keeping my pores clean is challenging.  Although I know the mask isn&#x27;t physically reducing my pore size, they do look smaller and I can only guess that is because they are a lot cleaner.  I will continue to use this product as I am happy with the results thus far.</li>
            <li> Eucalyptus oil is one of the last ingredients listed, but it&#x27;s the 1st thing I noticed on opening a jar of this mud mask. Not only is the odor strong, it provides a burning or tingling feeling as the mud goes on. I&#x27;ve used the mask 4 or 5 times, hoping I&#x27;d either get over my dislike of the eucalyptus or that the results would be so wonderful that I could put up with it. Even though my skin has felt &amp; looked fine after using this mud mask, I can&#x27;t put up with the overwhelming eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> The mud was excellent the first few times I used it. After that I began to notice a green layer of what seems like mold building up on the surface of the mud in the container.</li>
            <li> It truly cleans and reduces your pores, leaving your skin nice and soft.  I will look into more products from this company.</li>
            <li> This felt like it burned my face.  I left it on for about a minute thinking it would level out.  It did not.  Made my eyes water horribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely an allergy and not a bad batch, because I tested it on my boyfriend and he had no problems.  Be very cautious.  I do not normally have any known allergies, so I&#x27;m not sure what in this was the cause.</li>
            <li> I had no idea it had oils in it. It&#x27;s good for a breakout and not what I was looking for..</li>
            <li> Do not use for Acne!  This broke my skin out worse then I have ever seen in 5 years. It burns your skin, and makes your break-outs worse than they are.  If you have problem skin, try the &amp;#34;Glam Glo Supermud&amp;#34; its awesome.  Clears your skin up almost over night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask to my worse enemy!  It&#x27;s Awful!</li>
            <li> This works great on oily acne prone skin. I use this as a fasewash with a Clarisonic Mia 2 every morning in the shower. Just dab some on the brush head and work into wet skin for a minute or two. Super easy and won&#x27;t over dry skin. Your skin will love you.</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve used this face mask, I&#x27;ve had great results. My face is less oily and so much softer and my blemishes have gone away. My face looks clearer and cleaner after every wash. I recommend this product to anyone with Highly Sensitive Skin - I have very sensitive skin and this stuff doesn&#x27;t hurt my face. I love the fact that the mud has a creamy consistency and is really easy to apply. The organic Shea Butter, Aloe and Jojoba oils really add a lovely moisturizing element.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. My facial skin feels and is improving.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. I can pronounce all of the ingredients which are natural. It has a nice eucalyptus scent. The mask feels very cooling on the face as it is drying. And it is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! Definitely something I&#x27;ll be using from now on. I immediately saw improvements in my skin after only using it once a week for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Good!! but first time I used, my skin hurt a little bit. Other than that, it&#x27;s good and I feel difference. i like the oily feeling after cleansing.</li>
            <li> This will be my forever mask!!!!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how smooth and soft my skin felt after using this facial mask. I have sensitive skin and found this a really gentle experience - the all natural and organic ingredients are a huge plus for me. After using this mask my skin wasn&#x27;t as red as it usually is and my skin tone looks more even.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask! I am very happy with it,my face feels clean and soft after using it and it washes off easily.I&#x27;m so happy I got it,definitely a go to product!!!</li>
            <li> Good product. I have sensitive skin but it does not irritate my skin. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too!</li>
            <li> I received a code from Snagshout to purchase the product for a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;Little info about the product: it is a mud green color, it is slightly runny, and goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed this product, I loved the slight tingly/warming sensation I felt and I loved the way my skin felt after. What is really fantastic is that is is gentle enough to use multiple times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin; therefore, I am very careful using products on my face. This Dead Sea Mud Face Mask has worked wonderfully on my face; it does not irritate my skin or create redness or a rash. My face feels wonderful, nice, soft and clean. Very easy to use, apply a little bit over your face and leave it on for 5 to 10 minutes, wash it off with warm water then you have a nice silky smooth, soft and healthy looking face. Seller is very responsive and caring. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the face mask. I like the way the ingredients in the mask tingles, feels likes it working. I have seen results of the mask working, has shrunk my pimples and does not dry out my skin. I would order this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It is actually the first face mask I have ever used. I noticed results right after the very first use- my skin immediately seemed more even and soft. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week.  I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Not really sure if my skin is actually looking better but it does feel better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very obsessed with my face in keeping it clean, so I&#x27;m often trying new products and let me say this is absolutely great! It leaves my face so smooth and it feels so fresh.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!!! Very good and keep your skin clean. I love the fact that while putting on the mud to your face, your face feel like it&#x27;s burning but after you rinse it off it feel like a cool breeze to your face!</li>
            <li> I have used twice so far. I felt a litter burning/sting when I first apply on, then it went away while drying. I didn&#x27;t notice any blemish disappear yet, but my skin get a lot softer.</li>
            <li> good stuff .As I expected</li>
            <li> Musty Smell. I am not using this.</li>
            <li> Like the way my skin feels but the but the SMELL is god-awful!</li>
            <li> Actually using it right now! It does smell a bit sulfuric, as some of the other reviews said, but it made my pores and skin overall look healthier with just one use. Will definitely keep using this weekly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice now and I can tell an obvious difference in the size of my pores. The smell could be more pleasant, but that&#x27;s all I have to complain about. My skin feels smoother and looks better!</li>
            <li> very strong mask and need to be watchful over how long I leave on my skin....can see the healing effects but, it burned my face first 15 minutes of use...felt harsh yet, was weirdly refreshing all at the same time, was concerned if I was burning my face, it was very redden and chilled it down with (HD skincooler ice roller) ...one cheek seems little irrated and dry..it tapered off as time wore on and results were noticeable, going to use on my chest to clarify and try tightening effects....! This is strongest mask  have ever used but, saw good results from one use...have to go back and see the bonus eBook as I haven&#x27;t downloaded but, plan to do so...not quite sure if would purchase again, need more time will let you know as I continue using this one! Enjoy doing spa days at home so will play with this one, have to play with it!</li>
            <li> You will feel cool and a little bit stimulated when you first put it on your face. But your will find your face kind of lose wet after a few times use. And it hard to clean</li>
            <li> Expected texture and scent to be more cosmetically pleasing. Soupy texture rather than creamy or clay like. Pungent scent is a no go. Absolutely cannot put this on my face where my nose holes are. I will move on to another product.</li>
            <li> It smells weird and made my skin breakout</li>
            <li> Your skin feels clean and pure.</li>
            <li> I used this once and I was hooked! You will feel like you have a brand new face after using this. It does burn a little at first when putting it on but if you can get past that it is very well worth it.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my Face! I love it so far</li>
            <li> Love that minty feeling it has when you apply first to the face, it certainly works and pores look smaller in a week of using it perfect product</li>
            <li> Great product,  made my face nice a soft.  Love this product</li>
            <li> Fabulous product, my skin felt great after every use.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this item through a promotion deal in return I had to leave an honest unbiased opinion. So far I really like this product. I enjoy the smell and texture. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results! I&#x27;m trying it on as I write this review!</li>
            <li> My favorite face mask! Your skin will feel new once you use it. I have sensitive skin, so I started using it once a week, and am now using it twice a week. My skin loves it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have their face feel like new. It goes in easy, gets warm and tingly and when you take it off your face is so smooth and feels so clean.</li>
            <li> What a great product. It has all good ingredients  and it made my skin feel amazing. I put mask on 2 days ago and skin still feels great. Company also gave a free ebook that was filled with a lot of useful information that truly is beneficial and in no way trying to sell product. Extremely  impressed  with product and company. I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> i got this product and i tried to use it for the best result i didnt give right away the previews but now heres the thing i just used it and theres a good happen my face i felt it smooth and i like it.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely moisturizes. Haven&#x27;t seen a change in my face otherwise. It burns a lot when you apply it, but a little goes a long way. The smell is okay, not very offensive. My eyes and nose water a lot when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mask. It come on time, in good package. I got my free e-book imidiatelly.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as it said on it and I do not have problems. But it looks like people with very sensitive skin may have problems, because it is kind of intence when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it once a week for a month already... and it is actually hard to say if it help a lot or not. It was just pretty busy and hard month, so it is not perfect, but I am going to continue to use and will see if it actually helping to my skin or not.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin fresh and soft.  Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so bad I couldn&#x27;t even keep it on my face I used once for like 2 min and that was the end of this</li>
            <li> I love this product so far.</li>
            <li> Skin does feel much smoother after using this product. The key is not to cake it on so that it dries within 10-15 minutes. It doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant scent, but it really does its job good.</li>
            <li> I have a daily cleanser I usually use for my face that leaves it dry whenever I rinse my face therefore it&#x27;s a must that I use a moisturizer of some sort exactly after I wash my face; however, this dead sea mud mask is the very opposite.  Whenever I wash this mask off my face it does not leave it dry at all, rather moisturized, which is perfect (and I made sure when writing this I applied the mask to my face again and washed it off for verification).  From the very first time I tried it I felt the difference on my skin and had my roommate try it and she also loves it!  We live in an area that is always so cold which leaves our skin very dry but this mask helps a lot because it cleanses our face while moisturizing it so there&#x27;s no need to apply lotion after washing your face with this mask.  This mask leaves my face feeling soft, smooth, and most importantly clean!  I recently bought this product and still using it.  The beauty of this mask is that it is all natural.  It&#x27;s great and I love it!</li>
            <li> Good.  It deep clean your face.  Feels wonderful.  Suggest use that once a week. Otherwise. Your face gonna be too dry.</li>
            <li> Tried it as soon as i got it! it had a nice smooth easy way to apply and left my face feeling super clean after i removed it. Cant wait to use it again!</li>
            <li> Must have! There&#x27;s definitely a difference in the skin after one use, my brother in law says I was glowing haha, so I recommend!</li>
            <li> really nice product... love it....use it on face and neck....see the result next day.....and recommend to everybody....will get it again</li>
            <li> This &#x27;Pure&#x27; Dead Sea Mud Mask works great! By following the instructions my face appears to be tightening and my skin is softer. Loving this product.</li>
            <li> Finally found a product that works as it&#x27;s advertised, with a great aroma and a super clean feeling after use.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not sure if this mask is as purifying as others I&#x27;ve loved (but are way more expensive), I do like it for the price.  It will really make your eyes water!!  It has the same feeling as if you put Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub on your face lol.  However, it does dry fairly quickly and a little goes a long way so I still have a full jar after using it almost weekly since last February when I purchased it.  My skin does feel pretty amazing after washing it off.  I think in order to get more pore clearing results I would need to use it a few more days per week instead of only once.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Mask is very easy to apply, not too dry or sandy. It went on very smoothly and has a light scent. After 10 minutes on my face, it dried nicely and was quick to wash off without a mess. My skin was very soft. I recommend this product for good results.</li>
            <li> I really love this mud mask! I recommend it to anyone looking to use a mask for their facial treatments. I use it on my face and it has absolutely improved the overall texture and appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It shows immediate results. My face always feels nice, soft and clean and my pores look smaller. Seller sends really helpful emails after purchase with detailed directions on how to use for best results.</li>
            <li> A really nice, gentle mud mask...it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin due to the combination of essential oils. It feels great on my face... very smooth! Also very moisturizing for dry skin....doesn&#x27;t give you the feeling of dryness that comes with many masks. Thumbs up on shipping! The order arrived quickly even though I chose standard shipping.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my skin. Washes off easily. I feel a little tingle..which I was hoping for more..but my face still feels very clean and fresh after my rinse. I use it once per week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the mask a few times now and I can say that my skin looks much smoother when I rinse the mask off. I think I made a good decision to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Mud Mask is very easy to apply, not too dry or sandy. It went on very smoothly and has a light scent. After 10 minutes of it on my face, it dried nicely and was quick to wash off without a mess. Most other masks that I have used in the past were hard to wash off. They would take quite a bit of rubbing to remove. With this mask, my skin was very soft and it didn&#x27;t leave my face shiny like some others. It was a nice matte. I have sensitive skin and did not have any reactions to it. Throughout the day, my face felt smooth and pampered. I recommend this product as a no fuss mask with great results!</li>
            <li> Ok EVERYONE,  are you ready to hear about my experience with Pure &amp; Essential Mineral&#x27;s Dead Sea Facial Mask?????????????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, this company absolutely rocked when it came to fast shipping. I ordered and 2 days later it is at my door. Thats was a great start!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second good thing I remember- I was very happy to see that the Dead Sea Facial Mask had a plesent smell even though its color scared me a little. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions state to put on face avoiding eyes and let dry 10-15 minutes then under warn water rub gently in a circular motion for maximum exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is designed to remove impurities and leave skin feeling a looking tighter and refreshed with a natural glow and almost instantly you can feel the tightening beginning. Its not over the top either. It feels nice, it feels like impurities are being lifted out and as the mask dries it definitely makes your facial skin tighten and continues to feel that way for a good while after the facial. It took mine about 15-20 mintues to fully dry but man was my outcome worth the wait. After my treatment with the  Dead Sea Facial Mask from Pure and Essential minerals was over, my skin did have a very nice natural glow and WAS NOT DRIED OUT as I had been concerned it may do. Also the tightening qualities of this stuff are awesome. It made my face feel very smooth and firm for a good 12 hours after even with my makeup over it!!. My husband and kids all marveled at how soft and smooth my face was and that made mama a happy camper for sure!...I would 100% recommend this to anyone out there, man/women old/young as the benefits are for everyone out there.They really nailed it on this one as far as Great Face Masks that actually work go.....THANK YOU&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure &amp; Essential Minerals.....FAN FOR LIFE HERE!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO if you like fast shipping, a product that stands true to what it claims to do and want your face/neck to get a great pick me up..look no farther I FOUND IT RIGHT HERE!!!!!I FOUND IT RIGHT HERE!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been telling everyone I know to buy this mask because my husband and I LOVE the way it cleans our faces. My husband has Rosacea and we have already seen an big change in his complexion. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> This is a great facial mask! leaves your skin feeling smooth, refreshed, and clean! Great product and fast shipping! Thanks!I I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMb8d87fb0d89d8b76310d809628e21c12&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I absoutely LOVE this mask. It is excellent and leaves my skin feeling super clean, tight and refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t burn or isn&#x27;t too heavy for my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s pretty thick as well, and a little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s easy to apply, and makes my skin feel amazing and like no other face mask I&#x27;ve ever used in my life. I would buy this a million times.</li>
            <li> The mud has a thick jelly like consistency. I found the mask comfortable to wear. It was fun to put it on, forget about it, and freak out the family when I walked out with mud all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may wonder what it smells like. I am big on smelling things before I put them on. I am not allergic to perfumes/dyes, but I know many others are. This fragrance has a strong eucalyptus scent. I was not expecting the mask to make my skin tingle, but it did in a good way. The mud is ugly, but the scent and tingly sensation on my face were wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results? When I washed off the mud and patted my skin dry, my pores felt tighter, but my face was not dry. My skin felt smooth and refreshed. I look forward to using this mask again next week.</li>
            <li> Well, It was a huge jar of the mud mask (6 oz.!!) I was really excited to see how good it is as it&#x27;s claimed to have natural ingredients. When I opened the jar,the mask looks like thick black jelly!! As it&#x27;s mention it&#x27;s a healing mask,it has Eucalyptus oil which is quite Smell like  Vicks!! Haha!! You know, we always use Vicks when we are sick or for the runny nose! I thought how could I put this on my entire face??!! But after applying it on my face, I kinda like it.It didn&#x27;t burn/irritate my eyes,although slightly feeling cool from the eucalyptus  oil. It dried up very fast; I guess within 5/6 minutes. I used a damp cotton towel to remove it.It was a mess when you wash your face.So make sure to do it during shower.The thing is, it didn&#x27;t dry me out, moisturized well.But I kinda felt greasy,so I used a face cleaner to remove that oiliness. And just because I used it once,I didn&#x27;t see any brightness after washing up. I guess It will take time to do that.I think it&#x27;s best to use it when you feel sick/tired/have headache. It has healing formula that is very refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love it and I would love to give this mask 3.5/5 ♥ [minus for the greasy feeling and the Vicks scent!!]</li>
            <li> I have used this face mask 4 times now and my skin is softer and brighter. I even took it to a friends house and we had a girls spa night!</li>
            <li> What I can say other than I love this product!!! I&#x27;ve applied this product three times and already can see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Only positives on this face mask! It came quickly after I ordered it, came packaged great, it wasn&#x27;t a disaster to open. It was great to wear, made our skin look and feel great. Just great, great, great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this mask. I do this mask weekly. The first time I put this mask on it got warm, like a deep down in your pores, is it burning, will my face be red or will my skin fall of type warm. I was a little concerned at first but, after a minute there was this big relief, a big cooling relief. After washing it off, there wasn&#x27;t red irritated skin like I had expected, my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry and crave lotion, and I felt like it looked great!</li>
            <li> Helped with dry skinin winter months. Moiturises my dry skin like not other I have tried. Great vue for he money</li>
            <li> I received the product a couple weeks ago, and have probably used the mask a minimum of four times so far. It tightens the skin, and I believe it brings any impurities to the surface, which is a good thing. Just remember to wash your face first, then stir the mask before applying it to your clean face. Let it dry for about 20 minutes before washing it off, and then  apply your nighttime moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be happy to review the product again after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Pros: The dead sea facial mask is amazing! It really does a great job at deep cleaning. It cleans toxins, impurities and embedded dirty. Some cleansers and masks clean dirt on the surface and once you use an alcohol pad your skin is still dirty. After I used the dead sea mask and an alcohol pad, my skin was clean. It left my face really soft. I cannot tell if it even the skin tone, but I will update my review after I finish the product. Cons: It is really messy.</li>
            <li> Great left my face feeling great</li>
            <li> works well but leaves a weird feeling on my skin after.</li>
            <li> This mud mask definitely made my skin feel amazing! A little pricey but it came from the sea so I think it was worth it.</li>
            <li> It feels nice it doesnt dry the skin it leaves it looking fresh .its a great mask.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited when I got this mask and I wanted to try it on right away. I thought it would be better to apply it on a clean skin so I took a shower and put on a thin to medium layer of mask. OMG!!! the burning feeling from the hell!!! I could not rush to the sink to wash it away! I thought someone just poured acid on my face! it was the worst pain I have felt on my face. Then, I looked at the bottle for expiration date - there was none! I was so mad and I thought this thing was expired :/  I logged on to amazon to read the negative reviews to see what they were complaining about - and no surprise -- people were complaining about the burning feeling. some people had their entire face turned the red because they tried to bare with the burning feeling hoping that it would go away after few minutes (I was lucky not to do that because I know that if your skin is legit hurting, that cannot be good). I was ready to leave an awful review on the item... then, I decided to go on youtube and look at what other people are saying about it. I watched couple of reviews and they mentioned light tingling sensation. I was like --- light tingling sensation??? my face was legit on fire! Anyways, then I thought maybe I try one more time before I trash this product. I put on the mask near the sink so if my face burned again, I could wash it of quickly. After I applied, I was in shock that my face did NOT burn! I was actually experiencing tingling sensation. I was in shock! Then, I realized, because I put the mask on right after taking shower! All my pores must be open and the mask readily went into the open pores, and burned my face! Right now I&#x27;m leaving this comment here with the mask on my face (I&#x27;m waiting for it to dry out). First I experienced tingling sensation, and now I have cool feeling on my face. It feels like my face just chewed peppermint gum :)&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase this item:&lt;br /&gt;- Do not apply right after shower, nor after washing your face with hot water&lt;br /&gt;-  If you experience burning/pain feeling on your face, wash it off right away! because that means something is wrong.&lt;br /&gt;- Be mindful of that this product has a distinct smell to it and it may not be the most pleasant smell (in other words, it smells bad :D )&lt;br /&gt;- Some people also said this product went bad after they used it couple times. make sure you store this product in the fridge after you open it. I always keep my mud masks in the fridge. it doesn&#x27;t say on the bottle how to store it, but all the other similar products I have used recommended to store in the fridge.</li>
            <li> This is phenomenal!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I used it last night for the first time, and immediately after using I felt softer skin. After washing it off, there was no redness, and no signs of agitation! It is perfect for sensitive skin. I went to bed feeling great, but when I woke up in the morning I felt even better! I noticed my skin was clearly glowing, and my dull, pasty skin, was no more!!! I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a weekly facial at home!</li>
            <li> Good product!!!! It&#x27;s a must!! I would recommend to buy it. Love it!! It works and smells good. But it,</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product so much! It made my face feel amazing after I used it! My face feels cleaner and purer than ever! I don&#x27;t even want to put my makeup on!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item at a reduced price for an accurate review. The item arrived quickly and was in excellent condition. I bought this primarily for my daughter who in her late 20&#x27;s has developed some constant acne problems. Because of the constant acne and sensitive skin she has a hard time finding something for her face that doesn&#x27;t irritate it more! She has used this twice in the last week after a extreme hormonal acne flare-up. I am happy to say that the promise of this product is true. She has been able to calm her acne flare-ups without irritating her very sensitive skin. She is only using this and water as a cleanser. After she is using some organic scar cream from Sprouts that I had purchased for myself after surgery. Her skin actually looks better after just one week and no new flare-ups have occurred. I have used it on my 53 year old skin and it left it feeling clean and refreshed. I don&#x27;t have any big skin issues (besides aging - yuck). I would definitely recommend this product for those with sensitive skin and acne problems. I am delighted to find something for my daughter that actually works.</li>
            <li> smells super bad but thats normal for dead sea mud smell . i am using it for a month now . am not amazed by the results</li>
            <li> Great product so far. However, I&#x27;d like to know why The directions say to use the mask only once a week. I have very oily skin, huge open pores, and many blemishes &amp; black heads. As you can gues, I&#x27;d love results as soon as possible!!!</li>
            <li> I have typically dry skin. After applying this mask my face started to burn, reminded me of this time I got a chemical burn in high school from applying too much Benzaclin at once (concentrated acne medicine). Whole face was bright red after. Probably need to toss this.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and oily skin and have used masks for most of my adult life (I&#x27;m now in my sixties). Before trying this mask, my favorite was the original Queen Helene Mint Julip Masque. I&#x27;ve tried various peel-off masques and some other inexpensive masques that come in tubes but this Dead Sea Mud Mask is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels cooling and stimulating, and a bit tingly as it dries, and it has a pleasant minty eucalyptus smell (one of the natural ingredients is eucalyptus oil). If I lay it on thick, it can take up to 20 minutes for it to dry, which is fine with me, because I&#x27;m happy to leave a mask on for up to 45 minutes or so. It washes off pretty easily compared to the aforementioned Queen Helene mask, which can be a real chore to get wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before applying it I press a face cloth soaked in very hot water to my face - similar to how I prepare to shave with a razor - to open up pores. The skin on my face feels good after using this mask and the mask does not dry my skin out (though as I said, my skin tends to be oily). A little goes a long way for me, as I mainly use it on my forehead, nose and cheeks, not on my jaw, chin, and neck (because I mainly just want to clean out those pores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is certified vegan and is not tested on animals and most of the natural ingredients are organic.</li>
            <li> Likes how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I tried this and I broke out within a few hours of putting it on my face. I have not had a breakout since I was in my teens  and have even used other mud masks with no issues so this was surprising. I&#x27;m sure it works great as I have seen from other reviews but for me it just broke my face out bad. Took 4 days for the redness to go away. I threw it out. So if you have sensitive skin then you might want to avoid this product.</li>
            <li> I love this [[ASIN:B00C8YCFU4 Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask]]!  Loaded with dead sea minerals, the mask sports a refreshing cucumber smell and is very gentle even on my sensitive, aging skin.  Unlike most other masks, this dries in a mere 5-10 minutes and does a great job exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶︎  INGREDIENTS:  Dead Sea Mud, Organic Shea Butter, Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Aloe Vera Juice, Organic Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Jojoua  Oil, Hickory Bark Extract, Organic Calendula Oil, Filtered Water, Xanthan Gum, Eucalyptus Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - Refreshing mask that does a great job of exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Test Sample Provided</li>
            <li> I am really not sure what to think of this just yet as I have only used it once. I put it on and left it overnight while I slept and it washed of easily the next morning and my skin did feel soft. The price is right for me though compared to other face masks I have looked into this was among the cheapest. So far so good, I give 4 stars.</li>
            <li> What I love about this mask is that it is chemical free and it makes the skin feel so clean and soft. It makes me feel Like I just left the spa!. It was worth buying it!</li>
            <li> Nice smooth feeling after.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this Dead Sea Mud Mask.  I have oily skin that is prone to blackheads and cystic acne (oh the joy), so I am always shopping around for detoxing mud masks and was given a discount to sample and submit honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did as instructed, and after a long day at work (followed by a round at the gym) I stirred up this mask and applied it to my unwashed face.  The mask was easy to apply with my figures and it has a thinner, lighter, slightly grainy consistency than I have experienced with other mud masks.  Imagine applying whipped cream cheese mixed with a small amount of fine sugar to your face – except everything tingles and smells like Eucalyptus.  I swear I could feel the junk in my pores being drawn out.  About eight minutes later it was all dried, and I washed it off using my konjac sponge in small circles for a little exfoliation on my face and throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mud worked amazingly well and cleared out a few deep blackheads that have been giving me extra trouble.  It had completely evacuated every one of my pores and the angriest of my zits had shrunk in half. My skin also felt smoother and tighter but not dry, probably thanks to the shea butter, sunflower oil, and jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;- MIX IT&lt;br /&gt;- Apply to unwashed face and use once a week&lt;br /&gt;- Expect a cooling and tingling sensation&lt;br /&gt;- the Eucalyptus does a great job of hiding the natural smell of the Dead Sea but you do get a underlying ocean-mineral smell that made me know this product is from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly, tingles enough to feel like it is working and left my skin looking and feeling very clean!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  I love the smell and the slight tingle of the mask.  My face felt really soft and smooth after application. I also used it on the tops of my hands and they look amazing!  Can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
            <li> This product does abosutely nothing what-so-ever. After a few months of useage I do not notice any difference in my skin. Avoid.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good value. Have only used it a couple of times, but skin is clearing and dark marks seem to be lighter.  Doesn&#x27;t smell that great. I did receive a discount on this product to review it, but would have tried it without the discount.</li>
            <li> I have a normal skin type; i used this mask on my face twice a week. I didn&#x27;t like my face afterwards, it became very oily, saggy, and gave me acne few days later. Stopped using it! Maybe for therapeutic procedures its good because it has a nice minty smell.</li>
            <li> While I do like this product the eucalyptus was too much for my skin. Rather than a tingling sensation, it felt like I poured rubbing alcohol on my face. I do have eczema and I was hoping this mask was going to help with it, but I&#x27;m just not able to leave it on my face for the recommended time. If you can tolerate the eucalyptus oil then it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> Very nice. I love the tingling pepperminty sensation. My face feels soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Feels nice and clean  and it makes your skin feel great. Love this stuff and plan on buying more</li>
            <li> great product feels super great on my skin leaves skin feeling clean and fresh</li>
            <li> Great mask. Invigorating for the skin. Cooling mask. Wonderful product. Very glad that I purchased Dead Sea mud face mask</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL~ my first time trying any mud mask, and my daughter and I loved it so much that we will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. You can feel your skin thanking you when you use it! Will continue using it regularly!</li>
            <li> I have been using natural masks since I was a teenager, and have always loved them. Now that I am (ahem) considerably older, I still  love masks and thisamazing Dead Sea Mud Mask is no exception. I love that I can pronounce all of the natural ingredients, and especially love how immediately I can feel the mud working and drying on my skin. The Eucalyptus scent is strong and powerful and and Iove that fresh feeling. My skin glows when the dry mask is washed off and It feels great.</li>
            <li> As a therapist who also does facials, I can say this is a very high quality mud mask. I have found a little goes a long way. The after glow is fabulous. It is a little pricy and at the same time, you get what you pay for and It is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Another great experience with a Pure &amp; Essential Minerals product. I&#x27;ve never used a facial mask before since I have the break out outcome fears with my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m happy to confidently say that I can and will continue to use this product for my skin revitalizing needs. I&#x27;m still rubbing my face because of it&#x27;s smoothness haha. I do believe it&#x27;s reduced some bumpage that was going on on my forehead as well. see a full detailed review here: http://ajstarfish.blogspot.com/2014/06/review-pure-essential-minerals-dead-sea.html</li>
            <li> first time urer..easy on, easy off..feels great..</li>
            <li> Organic Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask has a light scent. It is very easy to apply, not too dry or sandy. Left my skin extremely soft,  smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This stuff has the most amazing feel to it I just adore it. It makes my skin glow. It has a fresh minty smells &amp; I really like that it is only a 5-10 minute mask, I really do not like to wait long and this one really gets the job done and drys wonderfully on the face very quickly. Wash off with warm water and a wash cloth and I&#x27;m good to go. It feels amazing and my skin looks great after, no redness or irritation and no breakouts. I really enjoy this mask.</li>
            <li> I have been tried too many mask products.  This is the best one. Even I read too many reviews but don&#x27;t believe until I used it. I used after recieved it. I can feel my skin soft &amp;amp; smooth. Highly recommend to everyone who picky like me</li>
            <li> My face felt like it was on fire when I applied the mask. I couldn&#x27;t leave it on for more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> This mask is thick and yes it does look like mud.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it is made with all natural, organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using the mask as I type this. I will then shower afterward and show a picture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to apply on your skin. It has a strong Eucalyptus scent. Make sure to avoid your eyes and mouth. It can irritate if you it in your eyes!&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent, but like I said, it is strong.&lt;br /&gt;It feels very tingly and cool on my face. I love this feeling!&lt;br /&gt;I put the mask on thickly, and avoid talking or moving my mouth, so that the mask won&#x27;t settle in any lines. I leave it on for 10-15 minutes and it dries and there is a tightening feeling on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it easiest to shower after using this mask to remove it. My skin feels so nice afterwards. I love this mask so much. My face feels refreshed, clean, and invigorated. It works so well to reduce any inflammation/redness on my skin, helps to clear up the acne, and just leaves it looking better. It also feels even smoother and softer than before.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it once a week as instructed and the results are excellent. I actually look forward to using it every week because it does feel really, really good. So much cheaper than going to a spa/salon to get a Dead Sea Mud Facial! Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Please do make sure to wash it completely off your hands though so that you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes!</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers with psoriasis, I have heard about the benefits of Dead Sea salt for many years and have wanted to try it on my skin to see if it would truly help lessen the appearance and inflammation of my psoriasis. I have to say that this is truly a great mud mask! I should warn you that there is a slight unpleasant smell; it isn’t too bad and it is well worth using anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are natural so I have come to the conclusion that the smell must be coming from the sulfur mineral as it is one of the ingredients in this mud mask. Don’t let that deter you though… This mask is amazing! After just one use, I could see my skin looked brighter and my pores were a lot smaller. The mask goes on smooth and hydrates the skin while taking out toxins.  My face also tingled a bit but it isn’t a bad tingle or anything. After 10 minutes, you wipe it off with a warm damp cloth and you are left with a silky smooth face that looks refreshed and glows. I LOVE this mud mask and highly recommend to anyone that cares about looking their absolute best!</li>
            <li> When I used this product I felt like I was getting a spa treatment! It softened my skin and left my skin glowing. I loved how moisturized and hydrated my skin felt after using this! I live in an extremely dry climate so a mask that leaves my skin hydrated is very important! I also have very sensitive skin and this was so gentle on my skin.This mask is a must have!</li>
            <li> I love this mud mask! It smells amazing! It has Eucalyptus in it, which is a huge bonus from me. I&#x27;m a big fan of anything that smells fresh and clean, and this mask is totally worth it in my opinion. Just a little note, this mask dries hard, so if you are going to be laughing a lot when wearing this mask, please be cautious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this mask comes in a pretty good sized tub! I would recommend this mask to anyone who wants a relaxing day to just pamper themselves with something nice.</li>
            <li> 2.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, not only did I use this mask, but I also got my friend to help me review it. She has really bad skin issues, so I wanted to see if this would work on both our skins. Sadly, it didn&#x27;t do much. After using the mask, my skin felt more oily than hydrated, and after using it for a few weeks, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin. My friend had to quit using it because she actually broke out more while using it. All in all, this was a so-so product. However, the price is really high for such a so-so product, so I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend using this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> Need a hydrating, cost effective mud mask? Try this one out! Not only is this made from very natural ingredients but it is also cruelty free and certified vegan. It leaves my face smelling good and soft afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I love using this weekly and sometimes I do use it twice a week when I feel my face wanting to get acne! I recommend to anyone who needs a mud mask with tons of benefits!</li>
            <li> I received my dead sea mud mask. Works really good. I have other mud masks that just dry up and do nothing. This one you can actually feel the tingling feeling plus you can smell whatever is in the cream working. I am very pleased with the product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I put it on it immanently started to burn the skin on my cheekbones. I thought this was suppose to happen so I waited 5 min before rinsing the mask off and the skin that was burning was very red with bumps. I looked for some warning information on the box and bottle but couldn&#x27;t find any (keep in mind I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin either). I put some Aveeno on my whole face and the burning stop and over time the irritation went away. The skin itself felt very smooth so i&#x27;m not sure if this was just an allergy for me or what but I will only be using this once a month avoiding my cheekbones and under eyes.</li>
            <li> Love the mask removes my blackheads and my skin feels nice and smooth like a babies arm. But the smell of the product smells like a dead corpse (maybe because its from the dead sea).</li>
            <li> I have used this 5 times over 3 weeks. Along with using mask I have been using Peter Thomas Roth Cucumber Gel Masque after washing my face. The difference - my pores have visibly reduced, skin appears radiant, smooth and my blemishes have improved.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Essential minerals!</li>
            <li> Great product just make sure u use as directed to get best friend results</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> love this product absolutly love this it helps my psorasis so much. just love how much it clears them up after using this</li>
            <li> I used this when I had major sinus pain going on, as soon as I put the mask on I swear the pain went away ! I love the texture of this mask. I also like the way it tightens as it dries. Its a fantastic mask that I like using when taking a bubble bath after a long weak. This tub will last a long while as well. It really made a difference with my skin as well, it looked refreshed and so healthy. A hands down 5star mud mask !</li>
            <li> I Havent Seen Much Of A Difference yet. Ive been using it for about 2-3 weeks . It did stop a pimple from growing but thats about it and leaves my skin feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that with more time and uses it will help my skin alot more.&lt;br /&gt;And once u apply it, it does feel like theres a tingily sensation.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel tingly and refreshed - when it has been removed, makes my skin feel soft and ultra-clean. Would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have combination/oily skin and this mask seems to keep my monthly, cystic breakouts down.  It kind of stings when you first put it on but I attribute it to working.  It comes in a decent jar so you can get a ton of uses from it.</li>
            <li> Good product. Helps to get my dead skin cells off and makes skin smooth</li>
            <li> I have used this mask twice.  I think it&#x27;s great.  I like how it goes on and how it feels as it dries.  It washes off easily and my skin feels really refreshed.  I sent it to my daughter and she is also very happy with it.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so smooth after the first use. I really love this stuff! It does sting a little tho. Also don&#x27;t forget to stir it up first.</li>
            <li> First of all I love that all the ingredients are organic.  I switched over to the &amp;#34;oil cleansing method&amp;#34; about 6 months ago and have not looked back. However my skins still not perfect and I need a mask occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just recently had a bad hormonal breakout and my face is plagued with red dots and clogged pores.  I applied the mask on my T-Zone and my breakout spots.  After 20 mins I removed it and my skin felt so soft and smooth.  I didn&#x27;t notice any immediate difference with my acne but I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning however I woke up and the redness was noticeably less and the acne spots were smaller than they did they day before.  OKKAY let me make that more dramatic by repeating it: I woke up to NOTICEABLY less RED SPOTS and the acne had SHRANK!  For me that was a big deal, I had tried so many products claiming to be a miracle acne healer but they never seemed to work.  This is the closest i&#x27;ve seen to actual decent results. So yes overall very happy with the product</li>
            <li> This ptoduct was great.  Within the first week, my face looked better and all the acne had dried up. I used it with honey and a natural organic moisturizer and my face began to look so great.</li>
            <li> It was pretty good. It works better than the clay avocado one that I was using so i&#x27;m happy with it. I would be happier if there was something that i could use to apply this with and not just my hands.</li>
            <li> wonderful product! I have been use it every week and it really works for me , my face is much more clean than it was!  love it!</li>
            <li> This mask is great. I always wanted a mask that has no nasty chemicals, and this is it. At first I was afraid that it might dry up my skin, but when I washed it off after the first use, my skin was clean and dewy. After several weeks of using the mask, my skin became much less oil and more balanced. This mask has a refreshing, herbal scent. It&#x27;s a bit thick, but it evens out easily. Definitely buying again after the first jar gets used up!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing facial mask I have ever tried. It leaves my skin feeling so clean and super soft. Its also made with top notch ingredients even the health show &amp;#34;The Doctors&amp;#34; are raving about this mask I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love this mask.  I love the way this mask feels..I have oily skin. After using the mask, my face feels so clean and refreshed. I&#x27;ve been using for about 10 days now. My skin looks amazing (I also suffer from Rosacea). I use it every day. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it once a week and it keeps my face hydrated and toned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mud masks before and this one seems a little thin.  I do like the tingling feeling it gives off.</li>
            <li> Comes as pictured in a 6 ox bottle. The Mask is a mixture between light brown and dark green in color.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made with Pure dead sea mud and other natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have adult acne and I have been looking for a good Mask that is natural as I am very sensitive to products. When I opened the cap I noticed that I could smell the Eucalyptus Oil the most!&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a lot to cover your whole face! As it dries you notice that it starts to tingle a small amount. It hardens pretty quick and is easy to get off.&lt;br /&gt;My face felt very smooth after my face was dry and my acne wasn&#x27;t as red as it was before I started!&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased and cant wait to use it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a discount on this product for my testing and review.</li>
            <li> This is a spa treatment right in my own cabinet! I love mud masks. They make my skin feel clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this mask is that it is a ready to use product right from the jar. Other masks I have used involve measuring, mixing.. I can never reach my desired consistency. This mask goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and washes off easily with warm water. There is a rather strong smell with this mask, but it is natural minerals and there is no fragrance added to mask the smell. I was given the opportunity to test and try this product and I am really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Love the silky feeling this mask left me with. My face feels so clean. It was easy to apply and I loved having a reason to sit in my room an extra few minutes this morning. It washed off easy. Nice light peppermint smell. I can&#x27;t wait to do it again next week. A sample was provided to me for an honest evaluation and I&#x27;m leaving my review.</li>
            <li> This product has smell when applied.</li>
            <li> I have this mud on my face right now. The first thing that you&#x27;ll notice when you open the jar is it&#x27;s amazing aroma. It will clear your nose! Next is a little goes a long way. This jar will last a long time. You only need to put a thin layer on your face. It makes your face breathe as it dries and it does so quickly. You only need 10 minutes. It&#x27;s already time to take it off..LOL. Be right back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I took a warm wash cloth and put it on my face. It melted the mask for the most part. Then I gently removed the rest. I can feel my pores breathing and it feels like all the elements have been removed. I&#x27;ll finish up with a serum and follow with moisturizer. This is a highly economical product once you realize how many facials your going to get out of it. Although I won this product during their Amazon launch for testing purposes, I&#x27;ll buy it once I run out. Probably in a year... it will last that long! Its amazing.</li>
            <li> I got this product at a terrific price.  I want to start taking better care of my skin.  This product reflect my unbiased opinion and experience. I am getting to the age that I need to start focusing more on my skin.  Even at my age I get oily skin at times and dry skin the rest of the time.  I applied this on a freshly washed face.  I allowed it to set for ten minutes.  I removed it with a soft wash cloth and warm/hot water.  It did have a small earthy scent but nothing stinky.  It went on smooth, almost like my typical facial moisturizer.  It washed off just as easy and your nightly facial cleaner.  I did enjoy the fact that it was a product dedicated to me.  I need my time that also allows me to do other stuff as well.  While it was setting I could do chores.  My skin felt like it could breath, very fresh.  Terrific product.</li>
            <li> I love my PURE Dead Sea Mud Mask and it has become my Friday night ritual after cleansing my face.  There is no grittiness or burning sensation and it leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  Because there is no irritation, I would recommend to others as well, both men and women.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! My skin has had a nice glow, and has been very clear and soft. I like to use this mask once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I know this is shocking but…I have NEVER used a facial mask before! I know, I said it was shocking! I’m thirty eight years old and the Dead Sea Mud Mask was my first mask! Boy have I been missing out. I had no idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely need to take better care of my skin. I tend to take that for granted until I notice it looks bad. Since I recently had a baby and get very little sleep, I can see the effect it has on my skin. That’s when I start paying attention and taking better care of myself. I cleaned my face as usual and then applied the mask. From pictures I’d seen, I assumed this would be an entirely unpleasant experience. But I actually enjoyed the application itself. It felt cool and refreshing on my face and smelled almost minty. It gave me a tingly feeling that made my face feel so fresh and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed it to my kids and they said I looked like a gorilla! It does have a greenish tint and I applied it thick enough to cover my entire face. After fifteen minutes when it was dry I washed it off with warm water. I touched my face to see if it felt any different and I was literally shocked at how soft it was! I didn’t know what to expect with the Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask but the application itself actually feels a little luxurious and the results are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I went to a spa and it just took twenty minutes total in my own bathroom. It says to use once a week and I will definitely be adding this to my routine!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this mud mask. My skin felt tighter, smoother, and had a nice glow afterward. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things to do with my skin is to give it a facial. Dermatologists recommend it once a week, but with my sensitive skin I usually only do a facial once a month. I have been looking for a really good mud mask for a while. I prefer mud or clay, as I do not like the peel off kind they always get stuck on my face. I was delighted when Pure &amp; Essential Minerals contacted me and asked if I would consider trying out their new Dead Sea Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Pure and Essential Minerals use 100% pure, natural and certified organic ingredients that are free of sulfates, phosphates and parabens. Pure and Essential Minerals are also cruelty free and vegan certified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  For centuries mud from the Dead Sea has been known as a natural beauty remedy. The mud contains more than twenty-one skin-reviving materials that include minerals such as magnesium, calcium, sulfur, bromide, iodine, sodium, zinc and potassium. Although we get these minerals regularly in our bodies we are constantly losing them and as we age we lose minerals at an even faster pace. These minerals are important for skin care because they are known to treat, detoxify and cleanse the skin keeping it looking young and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The benefits of this mask are a plethora of things including tightening pores, promoting young natural skin. The Dead Sea Mud can heal, soften and revitalize your skin for an all day glow. The organic essential oils in the mask work to moisturize and hydrate the skin reducing wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Although I do not consider myself having a wrinkle problem at my age, I do believe you are never too young to moisturize and take care of your skin. It is the largest organ of your body. This mask felt fabulous on my face. It went on very easily and a little goes a long way. It did not take long to dry at all. I have used it several times now and it does really improve the texture of my skin and helps to clear my complexion which is always appreciated. I love the feel and smell of the mud and it comes off very easy and is very non irritating. I highly recommend this product. It should be a must have in your beauty regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Next Generation Stay At Home Mom Gives Pure &amp; Essential Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 5 Stars!the feel and smell of the mud and it comes off very easy and is very non irritating.

            <li> What a terrific surprise! I have used myriad mud facial mask products, in home and at a spa, that have delivered very good results. This product yields excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a thick, heavy product, and messy, so I&#x27;d suggest having something spread out ahead of time to catch any flakes as it dries. Washing it off requires a lot of splashing so I skip all that and just apply it 20mins before my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing off in the shower, my entire face and neck were smooth as a bit &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34;. It felt firmer and, in fact, looked firmer around the jawline, throat, and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally after a mud mask my skin sucks up as much moisturizer as I can give it. None of that is needed with this product. I just did the daily usual of applying a toner and hydrating lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope others get the benefits that I have gotten.It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond thrilled to have finally found a clay based mask that isn&#x27;t too drying or harsh for my sensitive normal/dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;This mask is natural, soothing, great for all skin types and most importantly, effective! After a 15 minute mask, I had 3 blackheads come up to the surface that had been previously stubborn and unable to extract. Great (fast and careful) shipping, super responsive customer service and great product! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Feels cool and soothing. It feels rich and authentic leaving my face feel smooth and clean afterwards. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a mud mask that makes my face feel so sleek, fresh and cleansed like the this mask.The process is simple, just leave it on to dry for 10 minutes to allow full absorption of Dead Sea Minerals and extraction of any impurities. I love the tingling sensation of the mask doing its job! It was obviously easy to apply, but after an easier than expected removal, it left my skin feeling silky smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom and me feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I use this once a week.  It tightens pores, leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and looking wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling rejuvenated and wonderful. It does leave a bit of an odor afterward; however after a bath, it disappears.</li>
            <li> Eucalyptus oil irritated my skin</li>
            <li> Nice face mask for the discounted price</li>
            <li> There are both pros and cons for this Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask product, but I think in the long run, the pros outweigh the cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I agree with some of the people who have expressed their concern over the product packaging. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable that the product is in tub-like container in which you pretty much have to dip your fingers in to access. I feel that in the long run, with such a good-sized container, the product might end up becoming contaminated from this method of use. Rather, I honestly think that they should sell this product in a more hygienic packaging that won&#x27;t have the possibility of being exposed to contaminants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the product effects itself are a definite pro. The consistency of the mud is neither too thin nor too thick and it is very easy to apply on my face. It also dries pretty quickly and it definitely feels as if my face is being cleansed and nourished. It&#x27;s interesting to feel the mud mask harden and restrict any major movements on your face. There is a distinct tingly, slightly stinging sensation once I applied it, but it wasn&#x27;t too uncomfortable. I have really sensitive skin, but after washing the mud mask off, my skin has had no problematic reactions which is a great sign. It was also not difficult to wash all the residue off, and my skin felt refreshed and very squeaky clean afterwards. I can immediately see an improvement in my skin tone and skin&#x27;s general healthiness after using it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now going on to the smell of the mud mask. I have sinus allergies and so I am sensitive to extremely strong odors or fragrances. Although the earthy mud smell is unavoidable, there is also a smell of eucalyptus oil or menthol in the product that attempts to drown out the otherwise dirt smell. However, both odors aren&#x27;t too extreme and I have no problems with my allergies from these fragrances. I actually appreciate the menthol and eucalyptus fragrance as that usually helps prevent my allergies from acting up. So I feel that the odor of the product is neither a pro nor a con, but rather a neutral observation. The smell of the product might linger on your skin for a while even after washing it off, so I usually put on a lightly scented moisturizer to remove what is left of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is definitely a plus other than the packaging. A pump or squeeze bottle that dispenses the product directly onto your hand without potentially contaminating the rest of the product still in the package would definitely be preferable. The effects of the Dead Sea mud mask on your skin truly is beneficial to dry skin!So I feel that the odor of the product is neither a pro nor a con, but rather a neutral observation.

            <li> I am in love with this product. It feels so good on your skin while applying and afterwards your skin feels clean and so soft.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week along with an organic facial wash daily throughout the week (it says on this to not use with any other facial washes so I use this instead of the facial wash at night every Sunday). It feels great, opens and cleanses your pores inside and out. Btw, I am a Black male, 22, with mild acne and now I seldom have any breakouts and my scars/blackheads are clearing up faster than I expected. I&#x27;m only two weeks in.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my skin feel. I can&#x27;t believe how soft and smooth my face feels after I wash it off. It applies really easily and takes about 10 minutes to dry. Then I just wash it off in the shower (it&#x27;s easier for me) but you can wash your face in a sink. It feels like I am exfoliating and moisturizing at the same time. I love the scent and the cool sensation as it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super smooth and slowing skin. I have no issues after use. Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Im allergic to it, gave it to my mom.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m a natural skeptic of everything but how do you know if it going to work if you don&#x27;t try it. I have terrible skin, its blotchy, I&#x27;ve had a problem with acne my whole life and I&#x27;m soon to be 24. So I bought this and week one definitely  started to see clear, even skin, and after two weeks my skin is practically the clearest it&#x27;s ever been..the acne is almost all gone and my skin tone is even enough now that if I really didn&#x27;t want to I wouldn&#x27;t need to wear foundation...I feel beautiful for once in my life.. I will be buying more for sure..I definitely  recommend  this product..best part too after you use you don&#x27;t even have to use lotion, it doesn&#x27;t  dry skin out at all...live this product</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting a demo of a FAR more expensive mask at the mall, which appeared to erase the lines on the side of my face to which it was applied. I suspect there was a lighting/distraction trick used by the sales guy, since he wouldn&#x27;t let me walk to the other side of the kiosk to examine my image in more light. Or, entirely plausibly, I just didn&#x27;t realize that I only have wrinkles on one side to begin with. I was intrigued enough, in any case, to go home and research Dead Sea products on Amazon. Thank goodness for Amazon.com!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using this product. Alas, it hasn&#x27;t transformed me overnight into a carbon copy of a 25-year-old Christie Brinkley; but I&#x27;m happy to report a slight improvement in the appearance of my skin. The mask is only a little uneven going on. It has a nice minty aroma, and then feels terrific rinsing off after it has dried. Then my face looks brighter and smoother. I&#x27;m at that age when I&#x27;m going to start being curious about magic-potion wrinkle fixes. Honestly, there probably aren&#x27;t any, and I won&#x27;t be the fashion victim who spends thousands on skin care for barely- or im-perceptible results. I&#x27;m very happy I found this and when I&#x27;m motivated to do something about my skin, this is what I grab off the vanity. It&#x27;s a feel-good, go-to mask that I suspect works as well as any out there.</li>
            <li> This mud mask leaves my skin feeling so supple and soft after washing it off. The amount of mud that comes in the jar is great. It should last a while. I only use it once a week, but I always look forward to it! I love this stuff! This is a good price compared with other similar products or an expensive trip to the spa. A very easy at home spa treatment! It really does purge and cleanse your face and leaves it feeling super smooth. I also use it as an Exfoliator as I&#x27;m rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> Really good product, I like it. Maybe use it with a good moisturizer, or maybe its just  my face lol.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product because of all the organic ingredients in it!  The scent of the scrub was kind of strong but otherwise the mask worked pretty well. :)</li>
            <li> Delivered on time! Great product! love it</li>
            <li> It stings worse than anything I have put on my face before.  Sometimes I have to wash it off immediately.</li>
            <li> As a member of Brand Backers I have offered to test this mud musk and post my honest review for a free full size jar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell right from the get go, I like it! As I was applying the mud to my face I was surprised by the nice tingling I was feeling (it felt like eucalyptus). It had a nice earthy fresh scent and the consistency felt like is very light whipped mud. It was very easy to apply to my face and neck using my fingers. Since it does have a tingling sensation I would recommend not getting it into the eyes as the directions indicate. I left my mask on for about 15 minutes. It said 5-10 minutes but I got distracted :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I rinsed all the mud off using just warm tap water and a clean wash cloth I immediately notice how soft my skin felt and I did notice a definite glow. As you can see from the picture above I wasn&#x27;t converted into a runway model but I do feel like the mask made good on it&#x27;s promise. My skin feels wonderful! I will be doing this mud mask weekly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is also posted on my blog at www.MyVikingPrincess.com</li>
            <li> Pure dead sea mud is dark in color, this is way too light, it is diluted with oils and is not thick like mud at all. I would say probably less than half is actual dead sea mud. What a shame! I just didn&#x27;t ike this at all, I thought I was getting pure dead sea mud, guess I should have actually read the ingredients list.  To top it off, it has glycerin in it, not sure if it is from animal fat or not. I suggest real dead sea mud without added ingredients, it is much better for your skin than this crap!</li>
            <li> This unique mask and scrub works double time to detox skin.I have been doing facial cleaning on my face since I was 13 (25 now) by squeezing out all the whiteheads, blackheads and dirt off my pores. This mask makes this hard process EXETREMELY easy where I don&#x27;t even need to use a facial steamer anymore! I just apply it, let it dry and then all of the dirty pores are turned blue, I squeeze and the dirt comes off right away. This mask literally sinks into my pores and pushes out all the blackheads - gross but essential. Next day the skin looks a million bucks.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and the mask is great. The minerals in this mask are all organic so that makes this mask even better.&lt;br /&gt;I did apply it to my face, and at first noticed a tingling sensation. After waiting around 10 minutes for it to dry I washed it with lukewarm water. After that it was a cool feeling like I have mint on my face. My skin glowed. I applied toner and my favorite night cream. The price is very reasonable for the results you can get.I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! The mask has a great relaxing smell and feels great when applying to your face and neck! If you are looking for a great face mask you must try this one! Love it!</li>
            <li> After using this product, my face was noticeably softer and my pores minimized. I usually buy the masks at Walmart and Target which are okay, but this mud mask kicks they&#x27;re butt to the curb! Im not sure if the &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; in the cheaper versions are even real, however, I&#x27;m sure this stuff id the real deal. I will be using this product from now on!</li>
            <li> Makes worked great. I only used it once so far and it left my skin feeling really soft and smooth it also gave it a healthy glow with just one use can&#x27;t wait to see how it does after more!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my cousin who suffers from acne for a whole year. He loves it and told me it actually reduces acne.</li>
            <li> I really like Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask. My face feels very clean and smooth after use. The smell is a little strong but nothing serious. Thanks for the great deal in return for my review :)</li>
            <li> makes your skin incredibly soft and cleanses the pores</li>
            <li> I feel that my skin has gotten firmer and smoother after using this product but the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent....it smells like hair relaxer with mint. I am happy with this product and would definitely by it again.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt this good in years.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I did facials and enjoyed the product very much.  I love the way it tightens on my skin to pull impurities out.  I felt like I looked younger and had a glow after using the product.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing. I have been a loyal Amazon customer for many years, prime the last 5 years and this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written because I feel everyone should know how amazing it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 26, asian female. Non drinker/non smoker with healthy pescatarian eating habits. With all that said, I kind of thought if I kept things up I would eventually look like J. Lo, but I&#x27;ve come to learn in order to look like J. Lo, you have to take care of your skin internally and externally. Externally, I started washing and mouisterizing in the am and pm and things were just fine...nothing better, nothing worse.  I decided to step it up a notch with this mask since the reviews were so great but I was still skeptic - come to find out, using this once a week has made my skin smoother than butter and softer than silk. Now my boyfriend even wants to try it!  It has a tingling cooling sensation when you first put it on, but once you wash it off...that&#x27;s where the magic is. I plan to use this for the rest of my life!  (And maybe, just maybe, my skin will look like J. Lo&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> I love this face mask . It cleans all the impurities and leaves my skin so soft . I can feel a tingling feeling so I don&#x27;t put it close to my eyes . I use it twice a week and we skin feels so good.</li>
            <li> Love Dead Sea masks... I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for a while now, more now that I&#x27;m pregnant. This is my savior. I love it so much. I let my friend use it, and his acne has cleared too! Amazing product! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love it! Makes my skin nice a soft feeling</li>
            <li> My face has just about every type of skin possible – oily, dry, flaky, acne, blackheads, and blemishes. I am always looking for some way to even out my skin, if even for a few minutes. The Dead Sea mud facial mask is pretty easy to apply and wash off. It goes on pretty easily after washing and rinsing but not drying my face. After application, it took about 12 minutes to dry and was really easy to wash off. I like that my skin felt firmer, softer, and not extremely shiny after use. My skin is pretty sensitive and it did hurt a little bit, but not nearly as much as some of the masks I have used in the past. Face tingled for a while after taking the mask off, but it was not a bad feeling. I got compliments on my skin the day after using it (I used it at night), which was a great feeling! I was asked to test this product and give my honest opinion during a promotion.</li>
            <li> A great treat for my 65th birthday!  Loved the little tingle sensation when I first put it on.  And the aroma reminded me of a soothing spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too soon to speak of lasting benefit, but I liked the first use. The history and directions on the packaging were clearly written and large enough for easy reading.  The ingredients list was also readable and included several things I was hoping to find there, and nothing that gave me concern - thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The free bonus ebook was on a website and required, as does most everything these days, my email address so I didn&#x27;t retrieve it.</li>
            <li> I got this mud mask for my wife. She absolutely loved it. The item shipped very fast and was more than worth the price. I could already see and feel a major difference after the first use! This is very excellent and I very much recommend it! She has tried different skin solutions. But for the price, none have done nearly the job this has in the amount of time it has been used. I give it a 10/10</li>
            <li> This is a great mud mask, i have acne prone, very sensitive skin so i am always very careful with what i use, but believe me this was great! the consistency is light and it is overall very refreshing, it has some exfoliating particles that help with deep cleansing while the mud just refreshes and moisturizes your skin. It is best to use it at night, you&#x27;ll see great results by the next morning, even, soft skin, although i am 23 my skin doesn&#x27;t show wrinkles but i do have a ton of extra oil and it is only soft if i apply some kind of heavy lotion the night before. I really loved this product, I would give it a 5 star, specially shipping, it was fast and it arrived in a great condition, i will purchase again when i&#x27;m done with this jar. Also, the size is pretty big, I think i&#x27;ll last me quite a while! :)</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this product, I was pleasantly surprised! This mud mask is very moisturizing and not drying at all.  I really like how the products are organic, and as soon as I washed the mask off my face, my skin was much smoother and cleaner than before.  My pores also looked smaller, so I feel like this could help to keep my skin clear.  I was also surprised at how little of the product I had to use in order to do one face mask.  There will easily be enough product for another 30 to 40 masks.  This product is a must have for dead sea face masks and I will be doing this every week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing again--thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> For anyone looking for natural skin care, look no further. This mud mask is about as close as you can get  to scooping the mud from the dead sea yourself. The mask leaves your skin feeling incredibly clean, soft and smooth.  After rinsing off the mask, you dont feel any of the left over residue you usually get with products with lots of additives.</li>
            <li> This is excellent for taking care of acne and drawing out the dirt thats trapped in your pores. Its thick and goes on easy. I felt it working and felt my face getting tighter as it was drying. I was worried that it would take forever to remove but it didnt. It came of easy with no residue left behind in my pores. My face has a much healthier glow since Ive started using this. The other biggest benefit Ive noticed is how smooth my face feels after it cleansed and drew out the impurities.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin and I am often hesitant to try out new products.  However, I am so glad I tried out this Dead Sea Mud Mask!  My skin feels wonderfully refreshed and looks amazing.  I  have used it for a little over a week now and could not be happier with the results.  I chose this product because of the many natural organic ingredients it has and I was definitely not disappointed with my choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask has a very soothing effect on your skin.  Even after the first use, my skin felt refreshed and clean.  It made my skin have a wonderful natural glow.  Additionally I feel like it has helped to tighten my skin and has even begun to reduce some fine lines around my mouth that I was beginning to develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seller was Super Fast - they shipped my order the same day I ordered the product.  I will definitely be ordering more of this wonderful Deep Sea Mud Mask for myself and other family members to use!</li>
            <li> this product claims to draw out impurities. once on the skin it feels really cooling and dries quick. will keep using to see results</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product because I love the way dead sea minerals make my skin feel. When I applied it for the first time it stung a little bit, but this dissipated as it dried. I left it on for about 15 minutes, and it really cleaned my pores. My skin is smooth and shiny. I&#x27;m glowing.</li>
            <li> Made my face feel so much better.  I struggle to feel clean after my work out and this is my solution.  Love it and will buy again!</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend, but I ended up using it too.  It feels good on my skin - I can feel it pulling and tightening my pores and my face just looks cleaner afterwards, as if there was a layer of grime removed.  I recommend it to all.:)</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels amazing. Thank you I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more minty than I wanted but it works great!</li>
            <li> Looking for the perfect face mask? Well let me tell you about the dead sea mud mask! This mask is a miracle mask. I was given the opportunity to try out this mask through Brandbacker. So I decided since my cousins were over my home for a sleepover it would be the perfect opportunity to test out this mask. First off I wash my face with water and then I applied the mask to my face. When the mask first touch my face it was super cold and after about a minute my skin started to have a burning sensation. I felt like my skin was burning up. For example when you eat pepper for the first time and it starts to burn your mouth well that’s how it felt when I first had the mask on my face. It was about 10 minutes later then when my skin stop burning. This mask dried on quickly on my face. This is a picture of the mask on my mother face. This facial mask draws out impurities, toxins and excess oils leaving your skin feeling soft and clean. Dead Sea minerals nourishes and restores your skin vitality, stimulates blood circulation hence the burning sensation to your skin which results in a wonderful glow. I notice my skin some of the blackheads on my nose was cleared up a bit but it was still there. Overall I really like this product. It does make my skin feel great after using the Dead Sea Mud mask.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free through snagshout to try out. I was so excited when it came in the mail today! I am a nerd and I seen an episode of the Duggars when they went to the dead sea and had talked about the great benefits of the mud and I am glad that I dont have to take a trip to try it out! It comes in a good size 6oz jar. I did notice that after I applied it tingled. It was super easy to apply and smells wonderful! I love  the smell of eucalyptus. I admit I left it on longer than it said because I was washing dishes but it washed off easily!! My face feels soft! I have eczema on my face and I was worried it would dry my face out even more than it already is but it actually left my skin feeling moisturized. I look forward to using this product and will be buying again once I use this all up! Thank You for the opportunity! Shipping was also fast!</li>
            <li> Not as good as reviews but decent... Dry out blemishes, not for people with combination skin.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave this to me as a gift and I absolutely LOVE this!! It leaves my skin and my husbands skin flawless :) i love it! i love it! i love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it keeps my skin really soft. My face looks refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> Got what I ordered. I was worried that this stuff wouldn&#x27;t last long, boy was I wrong, this is enough product for me to use twice a week for the next few months. It stings a bit when it hardens but it really did leave my face feeling great, and really helped my pores out a lot! It&#x27;s very easy to wash off as well, takes very little effort and unless you get it on your hair their is no discomfort in washing the product off. It dose have a very strong smell but I like it because it leaves a nice faint clean scent on my face all day.</li>
            <li> Hard to say... at first it feels really nice, cool and smooth, but it starts to burn my skin a little. Though after the wash my skin dose feel smoother. little bit pink, but no lasting harsh damage. smells little muddy though for couple hours. cant tell if this makes my face better or not even after a month. probably want buy another one after this, but it dose feel real nice on the skin when first applying. minus the little burn ofcourse..</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE this s***!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the quality of the ingredients!  Just about everything is certified organic.  Terrific for acne and pulling out impurities.  My skin feels super soft and looks clear.  My teenagers will love it!  Way higher quality than more expensive brands with fillers.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Cleanser and moisturizer all in this product, I bought this because I used to have very oily skin, now my face skin looks so much better, I use this twice a week. Its very simple to use, I totally recommend you to buy this. Im buying this from South America ::Ecuador:: :)</li>
            <li> this product is amazing!! my skin has never been smoother or blemish free in my life!!!!</li>
            <li> Great consistency and leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. Would make a great gift for anyone.</li>
            <li> Pros: Feels smooth on the skin, works FAST, started clearing up my acne after only a day.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It smells very strong which I expected so I didn&#x27;t mind, I also want to mention that this burns surprisingly a lot. I do not have sensitive skin and I am used to using products like this but it does hurt when you put it on.</li>
            <li> love this mud mask, it feels amazing! and my skin feels soo smooth afterwards! definitely would recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> My first day of using, most of my blackheads disappeared.  My skin feels so smooth now.  I highly recommend this.p</li>
            <li> It smells good.  smooth texture  pretty happy with it</li>
            <li> Love it! It burns a little but so do a lot of great face masks!</li>
            <li> I would love  to review this product and I am sure that I would love it.  However system would not let me make purchase.</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud Face Mask is different than other facial masks I&#x27;ve tried--my face didn&#x27;t feel as unpleasantly tight afterward as it does with most face masks. It was easy to apply and dried well within 5-10 min. It has a different texture and fragrance, but not unpleasant at all--I think it&#x27;s due to coming from an organic ocean source. My face is combination--it has traditionally been very oily, although as I&#x27;ve aged, it has dry areas; my skin is pretty sensitive and I&#x27;ve had some problems w/ redness, eczema and psoriasis, even on my face, mainly around my eyes. So I was a little nervous about it and thought I should probably do a spot test to make sure that I wasn&#x27;t going to have a reaction. My test and later applying it to my face went well and I don&#x27;t have any sort of redness or rash. My face just feels really clean, soft and toned. I would definitely recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using organic and natural products for over 15 years, so I&#x27;m extremely particular about what I put on my skin. This facial mask passes my test, hands down. It dries quick, dissolves quickly, consistency is smooth, is liquid (not sticky), and smells very clean (hardly any odor, period). It delivers a very nice glow, left no allergic reaction, my skin felt supple to touch, and I didn&#x27;t need an additional moisturizer after washing it off. (I also didn&#x27;t experience excessive dryness or pulling of skin that I&#x27;ve found with other mask formulas). Side note: Just be careful when you first open the jar and safety seal, it can spill a bit if you&#x27;re not holding it upright, and get too excited. Also, make sure to stir mud with a clean utensil to get the full benefit. Overall, I will definitely buy again. Very simple, safe, and beautiful product.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy this refreshing my face with this mask. I tend to get red flakiness in my t-zone unless I&#x27;m using very specific prescription products. Since I started using this mask I have had no issues what so ever with the redness and my skin is glowing. I did get a bit sunburned while on vacation and the mask helped calm it down. This is now going to be part of my weekly regiment!</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this mask. Really watery consistency and burns my skin when I put it on (I do not have particularly sensitive skin either). Does not leave the skin looking any brighter or tighter. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great product..fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. It isn&#x27;t quite as thick as most masks that I&#x27;ve used - so you have to be somewhat careful when applying it, so it doesn&#x27;t run all over the place. It begins drying pretty quickly though, so it isn&#x27;t an issue for long. It feels slightly mentholated while it&#x27;s on your face - I didn&#x27;t find it uncomfortable at all. I also rinsed it off in the shower, which I find to be the easiest way to deal with masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 fifteen minute application completely removed all of my blackheads and left my skin tone really even. I didn&#x27;t have any dryness or irritation - my skin actually felt quite a bit more moisturized afterward. Instructions say to use weekly (I&#x27;ll be cheating and using it multiple times a week!)</li>
            <li> For the first couple times I have used this, It worked really well, but I have sensitive skin. As a result, it started breaking out my chin. I stopped using it since then. If your skin can handle it then it is wonderful. But if you have sensitive skin, then I recommend something else.</li>
            <li> Im very happy that I gave this a try. My face is very soft. I been using for three weeks now it didnt cure my acne. It didnt make it worse either.</li>
            <li> The effects are not obvious. I will not buy it again</li>
            <li> this mask works great on my face!  I wish I could use it everyday... when I first put it on it was a little burning / tingly but I read other reviews  &amp; they said this was ok and it was...left it on for like 10 minutes and my face felt great afterwardsgreat product!</li>
            <li> Something good very good I really like a wonderful shopping!</li>
            <li> smells &amp; feels like you&#x27;re putty icy-hot (the sports rub which simultaneously cools &amp; burns) on your face, still looking for menthol in the ingredients</li>
            <li> Awesome mask. Sometimes if I have a couple zits, i will put this on them at night and sleep with it. I notice it really helps clear up my skin. Otherwise if I don&#x27;t use it as a spot reducer, I use the full mask once a week, my skin always feels so nice afterwards. I recommend when washing it off, to just get the mask moist enough to exfoliate your face, using circular motions with your fingers before rinsing it completely off.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of experiences with face masks, and never have been able to find a mask that I would buy again.. until I found this. The Dead Sea Mud Mask leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. It also did a good job clearing some of my acne. The color of the mask isn&#x27;t very appealing, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me particularly. The only negative about this mask is its smell. It has a very odd smell, but is not strong. Overall great product that I will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Best face mask, it leaves my face smooth like silk. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a smooth and clean glowing face. Best face mask I have ever had. I will forever be using this mask.</li>
            <li> This project makes your skin feel great but for a price that lasts 10 minutes if you can survive for that long. Applying the mud mask to my face left it with an incredibly painful stingy feeling to it. This would have to be the equivalent to having pepper spray in your eyes. After keeping the mask on my face for a minute, I already wanted to get it off as quickly as possible due to the burning and stinging sensation. I toughed out the 10 minutes, which feel incredibly longer when your face feels like it was put inside the a jar filled with fire ants, and after taking off the mask, my skin felt amazing afterward. My skin was soft, felt clean, and glowed a bit; however that be due to my face just having been burned for 10 minutes due to this mud. This project isn&#x27;t for everyone. It could just have been my skin&#x27;s own reaction to the mud but I know, based on other reviews, I wasn&#x27;t the only one who felt the burning and stinging sensation. If you&#x27;re willing to get really nice and clear looking skin then this product is for you, just hope you can tough it out for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This burns my skin. Although I knew that it could be felt harsh at first time (by the reviews), I couldn&#x27;t stand even 5 more seconds. I had to return it but the customer service was great. They gave me refund right aways. I think that all cosmetics are up to person. Seems like this didn&#x27;t work out for me so try this and return it if doesn&#x27;t work for you..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped my skin and acne- went off medication and it cleared my skin up in it&#x27;s place</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> Great for deep cleaning your pores if you have oily/combination skin. But Do Not buy if you have very sensitive/dry skin, this will burn.</li>
            <li> Wonderful,leave your face clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the face and feels great after washing it off. Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. Use it only once per week so too soon to tell if it does all it says.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been feeling like my skin is blah. I&#x27;m in my early 30s and it just doesn&#x27;t have the radiance it once did. Well the game has changed with this mask!&lt;br /&gt;Pure Dead Sea Mud Mask is really creamy and smooth, its not gritty at all. It was easy to apply. I left it on for around 10 minutes while it tingled and worked its magic, then I started to wash it off. I know other masks that I&#x27;ve used were difficult to remove, but this mask was easy to wash off, no muss, no fuss.&lt;br /&gt;This mask left my skin glowing. My skin was left feeling very soft and smooth. It didn&#x27;t leave me feeling overdry. I am happy to recieve this mask to review. Really nice product!</li>
            <li> awesome! love this for my skin.</li>
            <li> I super loved this product and good dili very date on time.</li>
            <li> amazing!!!! It&#x27;s just what I needed for my breakouts and dry, dull skin! I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried out this product a few days ago. I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect because I had never tried a mud mask before. When I first put it on my face, it tingled quite a bit at first and that scared me a little. The scent of the product is strong but not unbearable. I took the mask off after the recommended 10 minutes and my skin felt very soft. It&#x27;s been a few days and it still feels relatively soft so that&#x27;s definitely a plus. I would recommend this product and I am excited to try it again in the near future.</li>
            <li> Nice product. My skin feels soft and refreshing after using it. Easy to apply and wash off.</li>
            <li> I have used many masks and this is by far my favorite. I was excited that I got chosen to buy for a reduced price during a promotion and was so pleasantly suprised.  It doesn&#x27;t have an odor and is very easy to wash off. I think the most important part of skin care is to keep dead skin off of the face. Dead sea mask made my skin feel so fresh , exactly like after a good scrub or photo rejuvenation but without the tenderness. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little home spa mud mask! I feel so refreshed and my skin is so smooth after using it!</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling smooth and refreshed.  My face feels fresh and smooth and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. My skin has improved by using this product.  Product is very watery and spilled a little in shipment.  Overall good product.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The mask was easy to apply, goes on smoothly, and has a good consistency. The only strange thing was the smell, but it is easy to get over and the natural components are better for the skin than &amp;#34;good smelling&amp;#34; chemicals and fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller sends a follow up email with details about the product and how to apply; I printed it out since the product does not come shipped with all this information or detail. Make sure to read the email through because it is super helpful! The package got to me within 5 days, which was nice. My roommate tried this product and his face came out glowing. My skin naturally dry, so I used a moisturizer after using the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for oily skin types. Anyone with dry skin should use a moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> Love this mask, works great!!</li>
            <li> I like this face mask and noticed a difference after using it.</li>
            <li> I tried the mask right away. I have never used a mask before and my sister recommended this one to me. Just make sure you follow the directions from the free e-book. Make sure you moisturize before and after. I left the Dead sea mud mask on for about 10 minutes and was able to quickly remove it with warm water. My skin feels refreshed, clean and tighten. I will definitely continue using it twice a week. The bottle is huge! it contains 16 oz. The quality of this mask is exactly what your face deserve and i am extremely happy that i got my hands on this. Im really satisfied with the mask.</li>
            <li> So I  fell head over heels in love with this product! If you want a spa like facial for Super cheap buy this.  When you apply the mask it has a cooling sensation keep away from eyes if you can they will start to water. The mask will firm up and dry after about 10 mins.  When I washed this off my face I swear my skin felt like baby skin! No face mask has ever made my skin this soft I will be buying this forever.</li>
            <li> When I applied this to my skin it burned &amp; not the nice sensation you sometimes get with facical mask. My skin isn&#x27;t even all that senestive so I&#x27;m not sure what was going on but it wasn&#x27;t postive.</li>
