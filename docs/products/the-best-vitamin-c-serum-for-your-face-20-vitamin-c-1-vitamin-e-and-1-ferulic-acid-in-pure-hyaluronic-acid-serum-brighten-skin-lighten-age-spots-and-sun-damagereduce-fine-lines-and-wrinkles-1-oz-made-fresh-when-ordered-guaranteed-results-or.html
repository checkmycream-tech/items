            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this C Serum and will ALWAYS keep it in stock.</li>
            <li>After a week or so, it became more liquid</li>
            <li>It would be so much easier if it were a squeeze bottle; not to mention if you drop it there goes the great deal you just scored.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser told me about this product and I am glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>Skin looks firmer and more toned.</li>
            <li>My skin looks brighter, smoother, and is more even.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>My skin looks better, the texture is smoother, I&#x27;ve noticed my fine lines have disappeared.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone fighting visible signs of aging--or wants to feed your skin some delicious vitamins.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff no greasy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It also absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy under moisturizers and makeup...</li>
            <li>Reminds me of Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair, but is more advanced.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it easily turned into brown after using it for 2 months.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a change with that, but I do notice that my skin is brighter &amp; my fine lines are fading.</li>
            <li>Applies very smoothly and makes your skin feel soft and healthy!</li>
            <li>I can tell that it has made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>The combo is amazing for fast results.&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li>My face looks smooth and has a glow about when I use this serum morning and evening.</li>
            <li>The product was so cheap</li>
            <li>I look forward to seeing if it diminishes my fine lines and overall skin texture in good time.  </li>
            <li>this has definitely improved skin clarity is improved and my complexion looks super bright.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other vitamin c serums, but this one has been the best so far.</li>
            <li>From then on my skin has only gotten better and I will never use anything else!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still CLEAR and fabulous!</li>
            <li>This is excellent vitamin C serum, you only need a few drops</li>
            <li>I use them daily in the morning to boost the effectiveness of my SPF and also to help keep a bright and clear complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with aging but want to prevent them and maintain a healthy face as long as I&#x27;m alive.</li>
            <li>As I grow into a &amp;#34;mid&amp;#34; adult I&#x27;ve been noticing some fine lines showing up on my face.</li>
            <li>I noticed differences in my skin within the first three days of use.</li>
            <li>but I really like it!</li>
            <li>I would not be without since first time using it.</li>
            <li>Who exactly does the FDA work you,  </li>
            <li>Everything was okay until I read the ingredients on the back on the bottal .</li>
            <li>Then later on some coagulated stuff are floating in the solution, most of it settling in the bottom.  </li>
            <li>First it&#x27;s a glass bottle with a dropper.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Since you don&#x27;t need a lot, and there&#x27;s only one natural preservative last on the ingredient list; it would be nice to know how long the bottle is good for.</li>
            <li>it is a nice serum and not watered down like some serums I have used before.</li>
            <li>I shook the bottle vigorously and the coagulated stuff melted in the solution turning the color to the more familiar pale champagne color</li>
            <li>I have not opened the large bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast working and not to mention the money I save from this brand.</li>
            <li>Use the whole bottle day and night and you will see results.  </li>
            <li>but it does not disclose the percentage of vitamin E and ferulic acid in their formulation which is very deceiving.  </li>
            <li>but it is very cloudy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It got really pricey</li>
            <li>I was worried that it wasn&#x27;t really hyaluronic acid, or diluted.  </li>
            <li>This serum has really improved my skin already.</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter and much softer.</li>
            <li>You only need a few drops so this will last a while, very happy with results!</li>
            <li>I like this serum, favorite among all the other products I have at my house.</li>
            <li>think that if one is going to imitate the original formulation, it should make it as close as possible to it.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks more even, and I even BREAK OUT LESS.</li>
            <li>GERMALL PLUS is highly toxic according to my research .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>When I contacted customer service, I was told this is normal.</li>
            <li>I really like the effect and just need to keep using it for a few more weeks to see if it can continue to help clear them up</li>
            <li>This specific vitamin C stays fresh for 3 months.</li>
            <li>I started using this product and find that my fine lines have diminished plus my uneven skin tones are becoming less.</li>
            <li>My skin tone has improved my skin looks beter and my fine lines are dissapering and hyperpigmentation less noticable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed even some of the fine lines have become less noticeable.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t seem to use it quick enough before it starts to yellow and look oxidated.</li>
            <li>I went to see my hairdresser who always looks fantastic and uses the most cutting edge products.</li>
            <li>I have slightly sensitive skin and the (stronger) 20% does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>It really brightens my skin and makes it &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; I recommended it to my friend and noticed the same results with her skin -</li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old African-American  woman.</li>
            <li>I have had it for about 1 month so far</li>
            <li>But I was rather surprised.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it really lighten my skin especially it tightens up my skin.</li>
            <li>I first tried this item because I developed a rash that then turned into a strange hyper pigmentation/age spots on my hand and arm.</li>
            <li>He says I look younger everyday :)</li>
            <li>Since hyaluronic is listed before the vitamin C, this would mean that it had more than 20% hyaluronic acid in it.  </li>
            <li>Overall I feel this serum is stickier, less effective, and of poorer quality than other serums I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I understand that it should not be totally clear because natural Vitamin E and ferulic acid both have yellow tinge in them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can definitely feel the tingle, so you definitely don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>When I first opened this there is a thick consistency like that of pure hyaluronic acid not like the one that Skinceuticals have (somewhat of an oily consistency).  </li>
            <li>I make sure to tell them the secret.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do the job that i expected I might have to order another bottle because i have had the discolor so long it may take a little more time to break it down on my skin</li>
            <li>I only tried this because it&#x27;s so much cheaper than other brands.  </li>
            <li>Not only are the results apparent to me, but people have been giving me lots of compliments at parties and so forth...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the higher priced products.  </li>

            <li> He says I look younger everyday :)</li>
            <li> Since hyaluronic is listed before the vitamin C, this would mean that it had more than 20% hyaluronic acid in it.  </li>
            <li> Overall I feel this serum is stickier, less effective, and of poorer quality than other serums I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I understand that it should not be totally clear because natural Vitamin E and ferulic acid both have yellow tinge in them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can definitely feel the tingle, so you definitely don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> When I first opened this there is a thick consistency like that of pure hyaluronic acid not like the one that Skinceuticals have (somewhat of an oily consistency).  </li>
            <li> I make sure to tell them the secret.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do the job that i expected I might have to order another bottle because i have had the discolor so long it may take a little more time to break it down on my skin</li>
            <li> I only tried this because it&#x27;s so much cheaper than other brands.  </li>
            <li> Not only are the results apparent to me, but people have been giving me lots of compliments at parties and so forth...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the higher priced products.  </li>
            <li> They rectified it by sending me the large one and letting me keep the small bottle they mistakenly sent.  </li>
            <li> My next bottle I will put in the refrigerator as it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Unlike Skinceuticals&#x27; which has a slight amber/pale champagne color, this one is clear.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and didn&#x27;t notice a huge change until about week 3.</li>
            <li> I have two minor complaints.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the Skinceuticals formulation has a clear pale champagne color and a hotdog-like smell probably because of the ferulic.  </li>
            <li> I have tried another more expensive Vitamin C previously.</li>
            <li> It contains the proper type of Vitamin C as opposed to other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a short time, but already I can see some of my dark spots</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> They also sent me the small bottle instead of the larger one which I ordered.  </li>
            <li> receiving this product I noticed it had a slightly &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; smell compared to other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help get rid of dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> i also noticed that dark spots and wrinkles are dissapearing.</li>
            <li> After about 3 months, the bottom of the bottle has a thick build up of some white crystals.</li>
            <li> lines just go by by in less than 1 yr of using.</li>
            <li> The bottle says 1 ounce but it is closer to 1 and a half ounces.  </li>
            <li> High end and not so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product has a little less hyaluronic than the dermologica or if the ferulic cancels it out, but no pimples at all.</li>
            <li> It seems a bit harsh on the skin</li>
            <li> rather it smell a little rather than it contain fragrance!</li>
            <li> I bought some expencive serums in the past that smelled and were brownish orange in color.</li>
            <li> It fades redness from past breakouts in a quarter of the time they usually take to go away</li>
            <li> I been using this product every day for the past month.  </li>
            <li> Before my skin looked dull by midday.</li>
            <li> &amp; I stopped and my skin became dull and a bit deflated.</li>
            <li> I work a very dirty job and this has truly helped to keep my pores clear.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested this as she noticed a dramatic change in her sun spots.</li>
            <li> Very sad.</li>
            <li> I was using dermologica skin hydrating booster for my dose of hyaluronic acid, but it runs $56 and is impossible to get a deal on.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this serum, favorite among all the other products I have at my house. It&#x27;s fast working and not to mention the money I save from this brand. I apply it every morning and sometimes at night when I have time.</li>
            <li> It seems a bit harsh on the skin</li>
            <li> Product is to watery. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have just been using this product for one week and I feel that it is helping to keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I saw an improvement in my skin within a week.  I use the serum before my moisturizer both morning and night.  Love the results.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second bottle.. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help get rid of dark under eye circles. I don&#x27;t see a change with that, but I do notice that my skin is brighter &amp; my fine lines are fading.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it smells good, it tingles when you put in on (so you know it&#x27;s working), and the texture of my skin has greatly improved. My skin holds moisture better, helps keep me from sun damage. I don&#x27;t have to use a lightening product because this serum takes care of that. It also absorbs very quickly. I have slightly sensitive skin and the (stronger) 20% does not irritate my skin. I even use it under eye. It really brightens my skin and makes it &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; I recommended it to my friend and noticed the same results with her skin - and it&#x27;s the only product she uses besides soap.</li>
            <li> This is the Best product I have ever put on my face and I have purchased and used many.  High end and not so expensive.  Use the whole bottle day and night and you will see results.  I am on my second bottle.  I went shopping with my son and the salesman refused to believe i was his mother.  He kept trying to guess my age!!  Lol!  Fantastic!!</li>
            <li> This is excellent vitamin C serum, you only need a few drops it is a nice serum and not watered down like some serums I have used before. I bought some expencive serums in the past that smelled and were brownish orange in color. This serum is fresh no smell and good color and a great price as well.My skin tone has improved my skin looks beter and my fine lines are dissapering and hyperpigmentation less noticable. I will continue to use this serum good stuff!</li>
            <li> I can tell that it has made a huge difference in my skin. My skin looks more even, and I even BREAK OUT LESS. I noticed differences in my skin within the first three days of use. It fades redness from past breakouts in a quarter of the time they usually take to go away this has definitely improved skin clarity is improved and my complexion looks super bright. I absolutely love this stuff no greasy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. Applies very smoothly and makes your skin feel soft and healthy! It makes my pores seem much smaller and brightens up my entire face. It diminishes the redness around blemishes and evens out my skin tone. Truly a wonderful product !</li>
            <li> As I grow into a &amp;#34;mid&amp;#34; adult I&#x27;ve been noticing some fine lines showing up on my face. I&#x27;m okay with aging but want to prevent them and maintain a healthy face as long as I&#x27;m alive. I went to see my hairdresser who always looks fantastic and uses the most cutting edge products. She recommended this product to me, and it&#x27;s not sold in her salon so I knew it was legit. I got it, and have been noticing great changes. My face has such a glow to it now and I&#x27;ve noticed even some of the fine lines have become less noticeable. It&#x27;s knocked some years off. Not only are the results apparent to me, but people have been giving me lots of compliments at parties and so forth...I make sure to tell them the secret. Everyone deserves to age gracefully and have great skin&lt;br /&gt;: ) I do recommend though in addition to using this product that you drink lots of water. The combo is amazing for fast results.&lt;br /&gt;High recommend.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do the job that i expected I might have to order another bottle because i have had the discolor so long it may take a little more time to break it down on my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for two weeks but I really like it! I have a glow to my skin that lasts all day! Before my skin looked dull by midday. It goes on easy under moisturizers and makeup... Huge plus! The smell is not the best but quickly goes away. I&#x27;d rather it smell a little rather than it contain fragrance! I can&#x27;t wait to see if it helps even out my skin tone. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I just reordered my second bottle. I love this stuff. I use it nightly and I have noticed reduced pore clog and size. I work a very dirty job and this has truly helped to keep my pores clear. I was skeptical and didn&#x27;t notice a huge change until about week 3. From then on my skin has only gotten better and I will never use anything else! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I been using this product every day for the past month.  My skin looks better, the texture is smoother, I&#x27;ve noticed my fine lines have disappeared.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended using a vitamin C product for my sun damaged skin. I started using this product and find that my fine lines have diminished plus my uneven skin tones are becoming less.</li>
            <li> Love how this feels on my face! The serum gives my skin a nice glow. Good product for the price. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> its amazing! in just weeks my complection became brighter and fresher.  i also noticed that dark spots and wrinkles are dissapearing. the only part about this i dont like is that i wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this vitamin C serum. My face looks smooth and has a glow about when I use this serum morning and evening. I would not be without since first time using it. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C serums on and off for about 3 years. I use them daily in the morning to boost the effectiveness of my SPF and also to help keep a bright and clear complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving this product I noticed it had a slightly &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; smell compared to other brands I have tried. When I contacted customer service, I was told this is normal. After about 3 months, the bottom of the bottle has a thick build up of some white crystals. No amount of shaking will re-dissolve these into the serum. Overall I feel this serum is stickier, less effective, and of poorer quality than other serums I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I first tried this item because I developed a rash that then turned into a strange hyper pigmentation/age spots on my hand and arm. A friend suggested this as she noticed a dramatic change in her sun spots. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 weeks now am/pm and have noticed a decrease in the severity of the color on my spots. I really like the effect and just need to keep using it for a few more weeks to see if it can continue to help clear them up</li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference in tightening of skin.</li>
            <li> Gerwall is listed as a toxic ingredient to be avoided.  So I will not be using this product.  Why doesn&#x27;t the United States protect consumers from additives like thiis? Europe and most of the rest of the world do.  Who exactly does the FDA work you,  it is the consumer.  Very sad.</li>
            <li> Everything was okay until I read the ingredients on the back on the bottal . GERMALL PLUS is highly toxic according to my research . So I will not be ordering this again . I&#x27;m going to try the &amp;#34;Timeless&amp;#34; version .</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair, but is more advanced. Has all the newest repair products, fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already gone through 2 bottles am going to order my 3rd. 2 bottles in 11 months!! Your skin will love this.</li>
            <li> My face and hands turned orange from itI had a heck of a time getting the orange color off of my skin</li>
            <li> With this product I now have makeup optional skin. I love this product. I am a 40 year old African-American  woman. I HAD issues with hyperpigmentation. My skin is now smooth  and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have tried another more expensive Vitamin C previously. This one is cheaper but it is the BEST. I don&#x27;t have a reason to try any others and will continue to reorder. Absolutely love this C Serum and will ALWAYS keep it in stock. This specific vitamin C stays fresh for 3 months. I have had it for about 1 month so far and it&#x27;s still CLEAR and fabulous!</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I reordered twice.</li>
            <li> I broke out!!! I want my money back!!! Wouldn&#x27;t use on an enemy!!!!</li>
            <li> The C+E Ferulic that Skinceuticals have contains 15% C, 1% E, and 0.5% ferulic acid.  Advance Skin Care version claims to have 20% C but it does not disclose the percentage of vitamin E and ferulic acid in their formulation which is very deceiving.  For all we know, this has negligible, if any, vitamin E and ferulic.  Why am I suspicious?  When I first opened this there is a thick consistency like that of pure hyaluronic acid not like the one that Skinceuticals have (somewhat of an oily consistency).  Probably hasn&#x27;t solubilized when they sent it. It was sticking to the dropper and so I  have to wipe it off the dropper with my finger to use it. Unlike Skinceuticals&#x27; which has a slight amber/pale champagne color, this one is clear. After a week or so, it became more liquid so I can squeeze drops on my fingers.  Then later on some coagulated stuff are floating in the solution, most of it settling in the bottom.  I shook the bottle vigorously and the coagulated stuff melted in the solution turning the color to the more familiar pale champagne color but it is very cloudy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I never had this problem with the Skinceuticals brand or the Timeless Skin Care I used before this.  I only tried this because it&#x27;s so much cheaper than other brands.  They also sent me the small bottle instead of the larger one which I ordered.  They rectified it by sending me the large one and letting me keep the small bottle they mistakenly sent.  I have not opened the large bottle but it also has the same coagulated stuff floating in the serum with the bigger chunks settling in the bottom.  Anyway, the Skinceuticals formulation has a clear pale champagne color and a hotdog-like smell probably because of the ferulic.  I understand that it should not be totally clear because natural Vitamin E and ferulic acid both have yellow tinge in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that if one is going to imitate the original formulation, it should make it as close as possible to it.  I don&#x27;t think they wereable to replicate it and also unsure if it&#x27;s working, I&#x27;ll give it another month or so.</li>
            <li> Great anti aging serum, and just as good as Skin Ceuticals.</li>
            <li> I discovered Vitamin C+E Ferulic Acid through the Skinceuticals line and loved what it did for my skin. It got really pricey &amp; I stopped and my skin became dull and a bit deflated. I thought I&#x27;d try this formulation and I&#x27;m so happy with the tone and clarity of my skin after using. I believe I&#x27;m getting results similar to the pricier stuff. I&#x27;m on my second bottle. My next bottle I will put in the refrigerator as it lasts a long time and I can&#x27;t seem to use it quick enough before it starts to yellow and look oxidated. Highly recommend for anyone fighting visible signs of aging--or wants to feed your skin some delicious vitamins.</li>
            <li> This seems 2b the best one I like doesn&#x27;t cake up or too sticky I sware on my vit. C it&#x27;s my daily nightly akin reginen. I basically with Hyalauric  Acid and retinol cream is my skin regimen along with Vit C I&#x27;ve seen wrinkles, sun damage, frown lines just go by by in less than 1 yr of using. I&#x27;ll take an oath. No BOTOX either my fiance cannot believe it. He says I look younger everyday :)</li>
            <li> I was using dermologica skin hydrating booster for my dose of hyaluronic acid, but it runs $56 and is impossible to get a deal on. So I started looking online for something cheaper. This product showed up on my search for a third of the price.  I&#x27;ve been meaning to add ferulic acid to my regimen so this was a bonus. The ingredient list is: hyaluronic acid, L-ascorbic acid (this is your vitamin C), ferulic acid, vitamin E, vegetable glycerin and leucidal liquid. Since hyaluronic is listed before the vitamin C, this would mean that it had more than 20% hyaluronic acid in it.  The product was so cheap I was worried that it wasn&#x27;t really hyaluronic acid, or diluted.  But I was rather surprised.  I could tell by the consistency that it was hyaluronic acid.  Often hyaluronic gives me a couple of pimples, so I use it sparingly.  I don&#x27;t know if this product has a little less hyaluronic than the dermologica or if the ferulic cancels it out, but no pimples at all. The bottle says 1 ounce but it is closer to 1 and a half ounces.  I have two minor complaints. First it&#x27;s a glass bottle with a dropper.  It would be so much easier if it were a squeeze bottle; not to mention if you drop it there goes the great deal you just scored.  Secondly, there is no expiration date on the bottle.  Since you don&#x27;t need a lot, and there&#x27;s only one natural preservative last on the ingredient list; it would be nice to know how long the bottle is good for.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s everything it says it is and the best price!</li>
            <li> This is the Best Vitamin C Serum. It contains the proper type of Vitamin C as opposed to other brands. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this serum because it does all the work it is supposed to. I used it in the morning and evening on my face, neck, and hand. Unfortunately, it easily turned into brown after using it for 2 months. I still have a lot left but they are all brown. Heard that brown color is a sign of spoiling vitamin C. Otherwise, it really lighten my skin especially it tightens up my skin.</li>
            <li> This serum has really improved my skin already. My skin is brighter and much softer. My hairdresser told me about this product and I am glad I tried this. You only need a few drops so this will last a while, very happy with results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a short time, but already I can see some of my dark spots/freckles being lightened.  I find that amazing in and of itself!  I look forward to seeing if it diminishes my fine lines and overall skin texture in good time.  For the price, I think it&#x27;s a great product and worth the time needed to let it &#x27;do its thing&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product! I&#x27;ve tried other vitamin c serums, but this one has been the best so far. You can definitely feel the tingle, so you definitely don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this serum! I have only used it for a few weeks and I have already seen changes in my skin. Skin looks firmer and more toned.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  My skin looks brighter, smoother, and is more even.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the higher priced products.  This C serum is the same thing for a fraction of the cost.  But do keep it refrigerated.  It will last longer.</li>
