            <li>plus you get 3 free samples included which are free.</li>
            <li>I want to buy the whole colors because its so cute c:</li>
            <li>omg I love this so much.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m totally gonna go purchase some more soon!</li>
            <li>Always brings a smile to my face when I use</li>
            <li>It is actually quite moisturizing, so it&#x27;s a nice product to keep in your purse to apply throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I only buy makeup that has cute packaging, that&#x27;s why I love tony moly and etude house so much.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this product, it keeps my lips hydrated and pretty in pink!</li>
            <li>My daughter likes it very much.</li>
            <li>i applied chapstick first</li>
            <li>the lip gloss is like a matte and it makes your lips super soft plus it gives it a nice pretty pink tint color to it.</li>
            <li>but there really isn&#x27;t that much product in it.</li>
            <li>so much omg</li>
            <li>She is 8 and absolutely loves lipgloss, this is extremely sheer, fun packaging, and smell yummy!</li>
            <li>It goes on more like a lipstick, yet the color is sweet and subtle.  </li>
            <li>I love how barely there, natural this looks; but I think that is how make up should be subtle enhancement to your natural shine :)</li>
            <li>Came super early, plus came with an extra sample of BB Cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even borrowed it a few times, feels nice and sheer.</li>
            <li>This shade is a bright, pale pink</li>
            <li>It looks very natural.</li>
            <li>color was a little lighter than I anticipated, but a fine color.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a little bigger but its still longer than most lip products here in America.</li>
            <li>it feels so soft on my lips.</li>
            <li>If I could I would actually buy a whole entire case of it</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t show so much on dark lips, but it does have a light tint of pink.</li>

            <li> however its not really have color on and not stay longer.</li>
            <li> This is gloss is not sticky, no strong smell or taste.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would call this a gloss stick.</li>

            <li> I received this today, it came with a nice note and 4 samples, and it was shipped very fast.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth and the packaging is adorable, which is why I got it.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely repurchasing whenever i run out!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for purse or pocket. Smelled good and color was great</li>
            <li> Its really cute. I thought it would be a little bigger but its still longer than most lip products here in America. I wanted to get something different from my friend&#x27;s birthday and she loves it! I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints yet!</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would call this a gloss stick. It definitely has a glossier finish if your lips are well moisturized. So moisturizer &amp; exfoliate before use! The color lasts an hour if you aren&#x27;t eating or drinking and you&#x27;ll need to re-apply after doing those things. The packaging is ADORABLE. I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments about how cute it is. Always brings a smile to my face when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was a little lighter than I anticipated, but a fine color.</li>

I love how barely there, natural this looks; but I think that is how make up should be subtle enhancement to your natural shine :)</li>
            <li> After reading tooooooons of reviews on the bunny gloss,  I decided to order one of these (cute packaging got me).&lt;br /&gt;Everything was fine with shipping and they gave samples with the order (my mom loved them )  The product itself was cute and smelt nice. Fearing this would dry out my lips i applied chapstick first and then the bunny gloss it it kept enough moisture to not be slimmy or rough. The gloss is okay but i don&#x27;t see myself using for long.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying lip gloss because I love how cute it looks. It smells good and makes my lips shiny and i love the color! I want to buy the whole colors because its so cute c:</li>

            <li> Great for the natural look and really cute packaging</li>
            <li> If anyone has ever tried strawberry Pocky and liked it, then you would love this flavor! it doesn&#x27;t show so much on dark lips, but it does have a light tint of pink. It smells and tastes a bit like strawberry pocky but it doesn&#x27;t last so long. Although, I don&#x27;t usually wear lipgloss for a long time so if you want something long lasting, don&#x27;t expect so much from this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cute and smells lovely, like strawberry candy, but it&#x27;s nothing special. I bought this thinking it would be a gloss but it&#x27;s more of a lip balm. I also thought this would be bigger but there really isn&#x27;t that much product in it. It doesn&#x27;t have any color payoff, it&#x27;s just a nice glaze to put on your lips to make them look nice. It looks very natural. It is actually quite moisturizing, so it&#x27;s a nice product to keep in your purse to apply throughout the day. The packaging it the best part of this product.

            <li> I absolutely loved this product, it keeps my lips hydrated and pretty in pink! The colour actually shows up on your lips and it stays all day. I would recommend buying this. If I could I would actually buy a whole entire case of it</li>
