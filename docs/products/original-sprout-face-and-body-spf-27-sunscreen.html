    <ol>
            <li>But for my hands and my face it is perfect in texture.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect except for the added coconut fragrance, which makes the skin on my face break out.</li>

            <li>Great non-toxic product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>very light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a good sunscreen, this one is not greasy, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, dries quick.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan!</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe for your baby</li>
            <li>My top reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>on smooth (which is nice when you are applying on your infant)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I love this product, I use it on my face, neck and chest and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I LOVE Original Sprout products!</li>
            <li>Great for my 1 yr old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>Good summer sunscreen for me since it does not moisturize much</li>
            <li>It rubs in easily and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Spreads so easily so</li>
            <li>Seems like it would stay on well without washing off easily.</li>
            <li>Original Sprout sits very lightly and has a very mild scent of coconut which dissipates quickly, two more pluses.</li>
            <li>Very gentle scent and nice knowing</li>
            <li>Best sunscreen on the market hands down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit thicker and requires a bit more rubbing when applying compared to the micronized sunscreen that I&#x27;ve used and liked (EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46), but then Original Sprout isn&#x27;t micronized, which is a point in</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not make up friendly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through so many different brands, especially all the ones that claim to be environmentally friendly, non-nano zinc and free of chemicals, and this is definitely the best one that I&#x27;ve tried (out of Honest, Think Baby, Badger, Babo Botanicals, California Baby, Baby Hampton Beach Bum, Alba etc.).</li>
            <li>I am in FL so it really just melts and makes my oily face even more oily.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Original Sprout!</li>
            <li>It dries quickly to a matte finish, which is another point in it&#x27;s favor over EltaMD</li>
            <li>It is scentless and hypo-allergenic and absorbs into the skin right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different mineral sunscreens and so far this comes out on top.</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle sunblock that you can wear on any part of your body exposed to sun.</li>
            <li>We also use it on our 6 month old and it works fabulously.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a long time for a gluten free / allergen free sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li>Only way to make it better is if it applied itself.</li>
            <li>I have been using this daily on my sensitive skin under my make up and love it!</li>
            <li>I consider the 27 SPF adequate for a normal day around the house, at the office, shopping, and in the car.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Goes on very creamy</li>
            <li>I wore it to the beach all day and it worked really well.  </li>
            <li>my kids don&#x27;t complain so much about applying it</li>
            <li>didnt work out very well.</li>
            <li>Would probably be ok for other areas of body.</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for an everyday sunscreen that is not greasy or thick, then this is the best one you will ever find.</li>
            <li>It absorbs and gives me great protection without the scary chemicals and additives.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The only knock on it is that I wish it had a higher spf.  </li>
            <li>This formula is not greasy and spreads pretty easily and the scent is very mild (has a very faint coconutty smell).</li>
            <li>Not for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>clear and soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>However, for outside activities like gardening or a long walk I turn to something with a higher SPF.</li>
            <li>It is spf 27, so you have to reapply (as with other higher spfs)</li>
            <li>It does dry clear, no white zinc look.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is not heavy, oily, or thick.  </li>
            <li> and you never have to worry about harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Almost half the price here!</li>
            <li> wish it was a little less thick</li>
            <li> A little bit thick but rubbing it between your hands before applying,</li>
            <li> Very thick for my needs.  </li>
            <li> helps to thin it out.</li>

            <li> Great non-toxic product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily on my sensitive skin under my make up and love it! No break out issues. We also use it on our 6 month old and it works fabulously. It rubs in easily and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen. I use it for my face.  I don&#x27;t like wearing makeup unless I am going somewhere like a date or an event.  I am in FL so it really just melts and makes my oily face even more oily.  The BB cream I use has sunscreen so I am covered if I am wearing it but if I am not then I need something and I started using this.  It is not heavy, oily, or thick.  The only knock on it is that I wish it had a higher spf.  But for my hands and my face it is perfect in texture. I have to use something else for extended exposure like running or swimming but just for daily use this works great.</li>
            <li> Not for people with sensitive skin. It would be perfect except for the added coconut fragrance, which makes the skin on my face break out. I will use it on my less sensitive shins next summer.</li>
            <li> wish it was a little less thick</li>
            <li> Great product. Dries within seconds. Non greasy. But. It&#x27;s not make up friendly. Makeup does not look good after you have this sunblock on your face. But it&#x27;s hypoallergenic and organic. I really love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a good sunscreen, this one is not greasy, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, dries quick. I love it. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Goes on very creamy and it&#x27;s not near as greasy looking as some of the others.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen on the market hands down. Our doctors told us they have tested every single brand and this sunscreen surpassed them all. Will never use another brand from here on out. It&#x27;s safe for your baby and you never have to worry about harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Not very much smell, which I like, and goes on matte! At first it feels heavy, but then it lifts (sounds strange, I know). Good summer sunscreen for me since it does not moisturize much</li>

            <li> I LOVE Original Sprout products! I am a huge fan! This sunblock is great . My top reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safe ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth (which is nice when you are applying on your infant)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t turn my tan skin purple&lt;br /&gt;Feels great on my face as well&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a long time for a gluten free / allergen free sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out.  This is the perfect sunscreen for that.  It&#x27;s not greasy and it makes a good base for make up for daily wear.  I wore it to the beach all day and it worked really well.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Great for my 1 yr old granddaughter.  Does not irritate her skin in any way.. just wish it was waterproof.  It is water resistant for 30 minutes but need to reapply. Still only thing I will use on her.</li>
            <li> Spreads so easily so my kids don&#x27;t complain so much about applying it and I don&#x27;t either. No white or any bistable haze left after it rubs in. Very gentle scent and nice knowing it has nothing known to be harmful in it. Only way to make it better is if it applied itself.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. I don&#x27;t wind up burned at the end of the day. It spreads nicely without being greasy. It absorbs and gives me great protection without the scary chemicals and additives. Thanks Original Sprout!</li>
            <li> Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee make one with spf 30. pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!! this is an awesome sunscreen. no white sheen. very light. very good.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice sun screen. I&#x27;ve tried many different mineral sunscreens and so far this comes out on top. It&#x27;s a bit thicker and requires a bit more rubbing when applying compared to the micronized sunscreen that I&#x27;ve used and liked (EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46), but then Original Sprout isn&#x27;t micronized, which is a point in it&#x27;s favor. A few minutes after applying it becomes invisible, leaving no white cast on my skin tone (Fitzpatrick 2-3). It dries quickly to a matte finish, which is another point in it&#x27;s favor over EltaMD Clear which on my skin retains a slightly shiny finish.

I consider the 27 SPF adequate for a normal day around the house, at the office, shopping, and in the car. However, for outside activities like gardening or a long walk I turn to something with a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> clear and soft on my skin. use daily</li>
            <li> Very thick for my needs.  Purchased for face so didnt work out very well. Would probably be ok for other areas of body. Seems like it would stay on well without washing off easily.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it on my face, neck and chest and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I did however just notice in a kids haircut place recently, they carry it for $9.75.  Almost half the price here!</li>
            <li> Not greasy.  Makes skin look matted and nice.  Good blockage.  The only problem is it seems to be out of stock for re ordering.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen. A little bit thick but rubbing it between your hands before applying, helps to thin it out. It does dry clear, no white zinc look.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a waterproof or water-resistant sunscreen, this is not for you. However, if you are looking for an everyday sunscreen that is not greasy or thick, then this is the best one you will ever find. I&#x27;ve gone through so many different brands, especially all the ones that claim to be environmentally friendly, non-nano zinc and free of chemicals, and this is definitely the best one that I&#x27;ve tried (out of Honest, Think Baby, Badger, Babo Botanicals, California Baby, Baby Hampton Beach Bum, Alba etc.). This formula is not greasy and spreads pretty easily and the scent is very mild (has a very faint coconutty smell). It is spf 27, so you have to reapply (as with other higher spfs) if you are exposed to sun for a prolonged time. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
