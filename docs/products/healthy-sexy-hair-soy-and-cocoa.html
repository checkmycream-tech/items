            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I figured, what the hey, what&#x27;s one more gonna hurt?</li>
            <li>I use this product in conjunction with the style sexy hair slept in texture cream.</li>
            <li>Both smell ok, nothing drastic.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good shampoo.</li>
            <li>Pretty good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, smells great, and leaves my hair soft without using any sulfates.</li>
            <li>The shampoo suds up nicely and leaves a nice clean feel while the conditioner untangles and conditions very well</li>
            <li>It is so clean and makes my hair so healthy feeling and looking</li>
            <li>, she loves to use it and it makes her curly hair easy to brush through.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is really good for any type of hair and makes my hair super soft and shiny. :)</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT THESE HUGE BOTTLES.</li>
            <li>great price, will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel clean after washing it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice smell though and it makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like my hair got clean and didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>I have to shampoo twice in order for my hair to feel clean.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li>But I really like it so far and the price was good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE BEEN USING REGULAR HEALTHY SEXY HAIR SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER</li>
            <li>It smells good but leaves my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li>Large size pumps fit well in my shower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel this is the right product for me.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair (a lot of it) and I color it in hot colors regularly.</li>
            <li>was so glad to finally find a shampoo and conditioner that do not make my head itch and leave my hair silky.</li>
            <li>That said, for really hot colors like magenta and teal</li>
            <li>I get better results from my 5 dollar drugstore stuff which I&#x27;ve switched back too.  </li>
            <li>After the first wash, my hair felt so much softer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle, overnight cure, but you will see improvement with your first wash.</li>
            <li>Received package a week earlier than expected, everything was great</li>
            <li>Love the product, but took a long time to receive</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m glad that the shampoo left most of the natural oils on my hair because I didn&#x27;t get any moisture back from the conditioner.</li>
            <li>ALSO SAID IT REALLY DOESN&#x27;T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE FOR BLONDE HAIR - MORE IMPORTANT FOR BROWN AND RED.  </li>
            <li>good value and large bottles last a long time.</li>
            <li>Even after washing three times my hair still didn&#x27;t feel clean and barely felt any difference after using the conditioner.</li>
            <li>been using it for a couple months and can really see a diference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get a comb or brush through my very curly hair</li>
            <li>I found that Colure hair products really held the color up much longer than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>This works really well for me.</li>
            <li>Really protects my color.  </li>
            <li>AND REALLY LIKE IT.  </li>
            <li>SAID IT REALLY SHOULDN&#x27;T</li>
            <li>It cleans really well</li>
            <li>Not that much of a deal either.</li>
            <li>Really like this duo.  </li>
            <li>BUT MY HAIR LOOKS DRY AND DOESN&#x27;T STYLE EASILY.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time it is either watered down or counterfeit.</li>
            <li>Only 3 stars for these product because one of the bottles were leaking unfortunately, The product is so good, the seller must take care of it next time and make sure its sealed</li>
            <li>My brother in law suggested I try this before I did anything drastic, like buzzing it shorter than a new Army recruits.</li>
            <li>The only complain I have is it doesn&#x27;t lather very much</li>
            <li>First off, If you want this product...do NOT buy it anywhere but a salon, ESPECIALLY not off of amazon.</li>
            <li>It seemed decent at first and was recommended by my hair stylist, but after using it at home, I broke out in eczema and my hair feels brittle and dry.</li>
            <li>I will just wait til they run on sale for $12.99 at a large beauty retailer next time.</li>
            <li>Frequently colored and trimmed.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was watery, the smell wasn&#x27;t anything pleasant or chocolate scented at all, and my hair (which is pretty thick, just below my shoulders, somewhat dry and color treated) looked like a greasy flat mess.  </li>
            <li>very good.does not leave my hair dry or too greasy</li>
            <li>I have blonde over processed dry hair and I bleach it pretty often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every hair product known to man, including most do-it-yourself recipes with little to no success in taming my frizzy mass of cursed curls.</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft after just one use.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I can leave my hair down without my husband asking which electric socket</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy this product, and with winter on the way I will be buying more of the Rusk Smooth hair masque to help restore health and moisture during this brutal season.</li>
            <li>well not clean really</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone except my worst enemy, because be honest, who wants to help their worst enemy have great hair?</li>
            <li> As I have long hair.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft without going all limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> If I had found this sooner she would still have her long hair.</li>
            <li> DRY.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I tried using these, my hair looked just ok, not fantastic.</li>
            <li> Well, it didn&#x27;t hurt a single thing!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this on my daughters thick hair and her hair was considerably softer and manageable.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t heavy and leaves my hair crazy soft and so pretty looking compared to anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out in mass quantities with other products no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li> This was a tremendous disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam up and leaves my hair feeling funky, like it&#x27;s weighted down.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> but it does leave a slight residue feel to it.</li>
            <li> With every wash my hair got softer and less wiry.</li>
            <li> It made it dry and hard to comb through.</li>
            <li> my 11 year old has curly hair that is difficult to brush through.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this in the past at my salon.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is so difficult that we&#x27;ve cut it short.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is a weird texture, thick and clumpy yet slimy.</li>
            <li> but the conditioner is too thin, and the shampoo kinda leaves my hair feeling ..</li>
            <li> I went back to this product for the smell and associated nostalgia and was very disappointed with the fragrance, the quality of the shampoo and conditioner, and to add insult to injury</li>
            <li> Got the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Not great, bad smell,  stopped using it.</li>
            <li> it was just bad.</li>
            <li> TOO BAD</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I hated them both.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in it.  </li>

            <li> I used both the shampoo and conditioner of Healthy Sexy Hair and I hated them both. Even after washing three times my hair still didn&#x27;t feel clean and barely felt any difference after using the conditioner. I guess I&#x27;m glad that the shampoo left most of the natural oils on my hair because I didn&#x27;t get any moisture back from the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not great, bad smell,  stopped using it. I&#x27;m sorry I tried using these, my hair looked just ok, not fantastic. Plus for the price I paid I wanted to use it but the smell was not only manly it was just bad.</li>
            <li> Love this product and how it&#x27;s packaged. Large size pumps fit well in my shower. The shampoo and conditioner smell nice and leave my hair hydrated and smooth. This product was recommended to me by my stylist and price on Amazon is unbeatable. Will continue to buy this product, and with winter on the way I will be buying more of the Rusk Smooth hair masque to help restore health and moisture during this brutal season. It works miracles.</li>
            <li> very good.does not leave my hair dry or too greasy</li>

            <li> I tried this product because I love the soy renewal.  I was very disappointed in it.  It doesn&#x27;t foam up and leaves my hair feeling funky, like it&#x27;s weighted down.  It doesn&#x27;t feel clean after washing it.  I don&#x27;t recommend this at all.  For the cost, there are much better products out there.  The only thing I like about it is the smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a great value. This is so good for your hair and the price is absolutely a wonderful deal.</li>
            <li> use this all the time.. great price, will definitely reorder! been using it for a couple months and can really see a diference in my hair.</li>
            <li> It says it supposed to come with a nozzle, and I didn&#x27;t receive one.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo out there for colored hair. Especially in the Winter!!</li>
            <li> I love the sexy hair products and this was no exception.  It smells amazing and keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li> was so glad to finally find a shampoo and conditioner that do not make my head itch and leave my hair silky. As I have long hair.</li>
            <li> It smells good but leaves my hair feeling dry. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again</li>
            <li> My Hairdresser uses this in her Salon, Nice Product for your Hair, Love It.</li>
            <li> Simply the best shampoo on the market for dyed hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get a comb or brush through my very curly hair</li>
            <li> Smells great. Left my hair soft after just one use. The only complain I have is it doesn&#x27;t lather very much you have to use a lot of it. But I really like it so far and the price was good</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner . It is so clean and makes my hair so healthy feeling and looking</li>
            <li> First off, If you want this product...do NOT buy it anywhere but a salon, ESPECIALLY not off of amazon. Most of the time it is either watered down or counterfeit. I bought this from jcpenney a couple of weeks ago and it is by far the best that I have ever used in my life. I have blonde over processed dry hair and I bleach it pretty often. Using this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair literally feel like silk and it&#x27;s not weighed down at all. I recommend using the leave in conditioner and argon oil from their line too. It all works soo well!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair (a lot of it) and I color it in hot colors regularly. This is a pretty good shampoo. Good value for money and it makes my hair soft without going all limp and greasy. That said, for really hot colors like magenta and teal I found that Colure hair products really held the color up much longer than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> I used sexy hair products years ago and loved them. Especially the chocolate soy milk shampoo. This was a tremendous disappointment.  The shampoo was watery, the smell wasn&#x27;t anything pleasant or chocolate scented at all, and my hair (which is pretty thick, just below my shoulders, somewhat dry and color treated) looked like a greasy flat mess.  I get better results from my 5 dollar drugstore stuff which I&#x27;ve switched back too.  I went back to this product for the smell and associated nostalgia and was very disappointed with the fragrance, the quality of the shampoo and conditioner, and to add insult to injury, I saw it way cheaper in a Marshall&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Only 3 stars for these product because one of the bottles were leaking unfortunately, The product is so good, the seller must take care of it next time and make sure its sealed</li>
            <li> Great price for this set! Love this sulfate free shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Great product - Great name!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is a weird texture, thick and clumpy yet slimy. It&#x27;s a nice smell though and it makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> A+++ transaction :-)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love love love how my hair looks with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This works really well for me. The products came in good condition. This stuff is really good for any type of hair and makes my hair super soft and shiny. :)</li>
            <li> Great product, very sudsy bubbles and the conditioner makes my hair feel a bit ore healthy</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo.  Really protects my color.  I had been using another brand and noticed a lot of shedding.  I switched to this and it stopped.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like my hair got clean and didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> Love this brand and it is a great price as compared to salons....My hair is well conditioned and not oily!</li>
            <li> Pretty good but the conditioner is too thin, and the shampoo kinda leaves my hair feeling ..well not clean really</li>
            <li> Got the wrong product.</li>
            <li> This product did not work on my hair at all. It made it dry and hard to comb through.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is runny. I have to shampoo twice in order for my hair to feel clean. Also it doesn&#x27;t smell good. I&#x27;ve bought this in the past at my salon. It looks like this deal was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING REGULAR HEALTHY SEXY HAIR SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER AND REALLY LIKE IT.  I HAVE HIGHLIGHTED HAIR (MOSTLY BLONDE) AND THOUGHT  THE COLOR SAFE VERSION WOULD BE GOOD.  BUT MY HAIR LOOKS DRY AND DOESN&#x27;T STYLE EASILY.  I ASKED MY HAIRDRESSER ABOUT COLOR SAFE AND HE GAVE ME AN EDUCATION ON WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM REGULAR SHAMPOO.  SAID IT REALLY SHOULDN&#x27;T MAKE IT LOOK DRY.  ALSO SAID IT REALLY DOESN&#x27;T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE FOR BLONDE HAIR - MORE IMPORTANT FOR BROWN AND RED.  TOLD ME TO STICK WITH WHAT WORKS.  TOO BAD I BOUGHT THESE HUGE BOTTLES.</li>
            <li> It cleans really well but it does leave a slight residue feel to it.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair was falling out in mass quantities with other products no matter what I tried. My hair is healthy no longer falling out and clogging drains. I feel like my hair is the healthiest it&#x27;s even been. Frequently colored and trimmed. Love this product and already have ordered two more sets. Don&#x27;t mind that it didn&#x27;t match the picture cause the bottles I got are the same as I already have so the pump works for these bottles.</li>
            <li> Did not come in package as shown in picture.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but took a long time to receive</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this on my daughters thick hair and her hair was considerably softer and manageable. I immediately ordered it. I am so happy with the results. My daughters hair is so difficult that we&#x27;ve cut it short. If I had found this sooner she would still have her long hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling dry</li>
            <li> I love this brand of shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s moisturizing, smells great, and leaves my hair soft without using any sulfates. However I will not buy it from this seller again. It does not arrive packaged as pictured online. Different bottles came loose in the box and leaked everywhere in transit. Not that much of a deal either. I will just wait til they run on sale for $12.99 at a large beauty retailer next time.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is very fine and gets frizzy a lot. This product isn&#x27;t heavy and leaves my hair crazy soft and so pretty looking compared to anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It seemed decent at first and was recommended by my hair stylist, but after using it at home, I broke out in eczema and my hair feels brittle and dry. I don&#x27;t feel this is the right product for me.</li>
            <li> Never received my shampoo, just the conditioner. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every hair product known to man, including most do-it-yourself recipes with little to no success in taming my frizzy mass of cursed curls. My brother in law suggested I try this before I did anything drastic, like buzzing it shorter than a new Army recruits. I figured, what the hey, what&#x27;s one more gonna hurt? Well, it didn&#x27;t hurt a single thing! After the first wash, my hair felt so much softer! With every wash my hair got softer and less wiry. It&#x27;s not a miracle, overnight cure, but you will see improvement with your first wash. It&#x27;s been 3 months since I started using this product and I will never use a different brand again. I use this product in conjunction with the style sexy hair slept in texture cream. For the first time in my life I can leave my hair down without my husband asking which electric socket I used that day. I would highly recommend this product to everyone except my worst enemy, because be honest, who wants to help their worst enemy have great hair?</li>
            <li> Really like this duo.  The shampoo suds up nicely and leaves a nice clean feel while the conditioner untangles and conditions very well, rinses nicely too.  Both smell ok, nothing drastic.</li>
            <li> my 11 year old has curly hair that is difficult to brush through.  my mom in law got this for us and it works awesome, she loves to use it and it makes her curly hair easy to brush through.  good value and large bottles last a long time.</li>
            <li> It does wonders your hair.  Turned my sister onto the products and she loves them too.</li>
