            <li>I can&#x27;t say I saw a wonderful reduction in wrinkles on either side</li>
            <li>thanked my Sonic cleanser lenders and still remain VERY happy with the Nutra Sonic.</li>

            <li>I am incredibly happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this brush!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for in the shower.</li>
            <li>The product was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Great!  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product !</li>
            <li>VERY happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product as well as an excellent value.  </li>
            <li>skin is beautiful!!</li>
            <li>This is a great cleansing system!  </li>
            <li>Now, when I went to Nordstrom&#x27;s they all raved about how wonderful the clarisonic is, but I just couldn&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li>I have had folks tell me that my skin looks like porcelain &amp; \\&quot; how beautiful it is!</li>
            <li>There is already an excellent, in depth review on this item written by Chandler on Sept 15, 2011 titled \\&quot;First-hand comparison between the Clarisonic and the Nutrasonic cleaning systems\\</li>
            <li>It still works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The four speeds allows me to choose the best treatment for my face.  </li>
            <li>I think this was a very good purchase, and would still give a five star rating.  </li>
            <li>cause there is a very good chance it will stop working within a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Anyway, good luck!</li>
            <li>Once I received and started using my NutraSonic, I loved it!</li>
            <li>It looks gorgeous again and has completley smoothed out!</li>
            <li>Great product, I would give it as a gift.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It should be noted that price varies greatly both on Amazon and the internet.</li>
            <li>, the Clarisonic would make you happy.</li>
            <li>even more...works great, no issues.</li>
            <li>, the Clarisonic would make you happy.</li>
            <li>...works great, no issues.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m a happy camper using in the shower once or twice per week for face and body.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this with great anticipation.  </li>
            <li>the 7 days it worked, it worked great.....</li>
            <li>dont forget vitamins, suppliments and water water water for great skin as well.  </li>
            <li>product worked great.</li>
            <li>My wife saw, and felt a great improvement in her skin.</li>
            <li>It worked great WHILE IT WORKED.</li>
            <li>Great product for cleaning, massaging and polishing face.  </li>
            <li>I bought the model that has scrubbing heads for body and works great on elbows, knees, etc.</li>
            <li>The product was working great</li>
            <li>I brought the Nutra Sonic after recomendations from a friend whose skin had great tone &amp; clarity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been really happy with it.  </li>
            <li>This product is great while it works, no doubt about it.</li>
            <li>This brush looks awesome and the good reviews are really good.</li>
            <li>It works so nice !</li>
            <li>And the battery life lasts a good 10 days, so it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of up-keep, either.</li>
            <li>Olay has a good one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really loved it when it worked, therefore I ordered a replacement unit instead of a refund.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product 5 months ago and have loved having it</li>
            <li>I believed I was doing a good job cleansing my face by the residue from the toner cotton ball, which was used until the ball showed no residue.  </li>
            <li>It is an indicator of the quality of the product by the number of the good reviews, and I always use this as my guide.  </li>
            <li>However, it does seem to splatter a fair amount when you use it at the sink if you care about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the brush.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this item until it stopped working.</li>
            <li>as good as Nutra Sonic.</li>
            <li>I too loved the product for the two months it worked.  </li>
            <li>It did work really good......</li>
            <li>Add me to the list of people who initially loved this product but then my brush just stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, I cannot comment on whether that product is good or not.</li>
            <li>To be fair, my Nutra Luxe lasted for three years before it quit working</li>
            <li>if you get a good one.  </li>
            <li>Turns out I loved it.  </li>
            <li>This is a unisex system, not just for women, so it may wear out from getting more use (lol)    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>We are very pleased with the results of the brush and have recommended this product to the dermatologist as well as friends.</li>
            <li>Maybe the clarisonic is better in some way, I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m happy with what I&#x27;ve got</li>
            <li>I was initially very pleased with the Nutrasonic cleanser I bought</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE JUNE 26, 2013: STILL love it!</li>
            <li>I use mine in the shower and love it!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased it!  </li>
            <li>I should have known it was too good to be true!!</li>
            <li>Great for the skin, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I loved the exfoliation mode on the Nutra Sonic and, in all honesty, the speed difference was VERY important to me.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>Still have smooth skin, still works great.</li>
            <li>Still have smooth skin, still works great.</li>
            <li>In about a week my skin looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>I bought a clarisonic the week after it broke and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>Does a great job exfoliating; leaves skin smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  </li>
            <li>I never write reviews but this product is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>It was amazing.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I own both of those items too</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t measure these rotations on my own...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own when I am not in the room.  </li>
            <li>Both systems were waterproof, for shower use, which I also liked, and had a charging cradle.  </li>
            <li>My kind of price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent product, well-made, waterproof, and reasonably priced compared to the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the idea, though, about the four speeds and face and body brushes that are interchangeable.</li>
            <li>I loved the product while it worked,  But, now I have to spend more money on another sonic cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t own the Clarisonic model</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to add my own cleanser and use my own products though, so Neutrogena was out.</li>
            <li>It does a very good job of gently cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>I have not tried it with the products included, they smell great and lemony fresh, but I am an Olay lady so that is where my loyalty lies, in terms of the product used with the Nutra Sonic  </li>
            <li>good part is that the skin on my face and arms hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth since I don&#x27;t know when.</li>
            <li>I own a Clarisonic which I love and would not be without</li>
            <li>After the first day of each charge, it would work great</li>
            <li>I really love the Nutra Sonic.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes the skin feel after you use it.</li>
            <li>If I am going to spend $100 or more on an item, I do a lot of research</li>
            <li>$25 on most sites but</li>
            <li>Sonic (hereafter referred to as \\&quot;N\\&quot;)$15 on most sites</li>
            <li>, Nutra Sonic truly felt like it had more power...</li>
            <li>however, that also meant there was a bit more splatter.</li>
            <li>, there is a Clarisonic that has more speeds as well</li>
            <li>1 brush&lt;br /&gt;N: 3 brush heads for each speed...</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>This product does a better job than my manual face cleaning</li>
            <li>I do tend to keep it out of the charger most of the time.</li>
            <li>I thought they would and should have read more closely.  </li>
            <li>this made the most sense.</li>
            <li>:) I do recommend this.</li>
            <li>If you travel this could travel well, just make sure you either</li>
            <li>Olay had many pros/cons</li>
            <li>But I still use it and love it</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, cleaner, looks more even toned and   </li>
            <li>I had hoped the NutraSonic would have reduced my pore size more than it has, but there has been some improvement.  </li>
            <li>Maybe with continued use there will be more.    </li>
            <li>My face cream seems to absorb better now.</li>
            <li>it made me sneeze :)  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imaging it working better than this brand.  </li>
            <li>It is better than the rest on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years regularly, and it has worked perfectly since day 1.</li>
            <li>Better product design would solve this problem.</li>
            <li>I do much better with this brush and it leaves my face shining healthy.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate, you will love it, I promise.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, does just what it says...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers made this comment.  </li>
            <li>maybe it will magically turn on again</li>
            <li>Although I can&#x27;t compare, I can&#x27;t see how the clarasonic could be any better than this product.</li>
            <li>Editing to add: I love what this product does for my skin, but it does have issues holding a charge.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Okay so, THANK YOU, Amazon, for providing ZERO customer support for this product.</li>
            <li>Although it is made by the makers of sonicare toothbrush, which I absolutely love that product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I see no reason to change and spend a LOT more money.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU!I also LOVE that it has a body brush.</li>
            <li>When I contacted the company, their response (after I said it was more than a year)</li>
            <li>love my nutra sonic.  </li>
            <li>my skin texture is so much better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to its competitor, but this one sure works well.  </li>
            <li>I refused to  quit using it and waited for three more days..</li>
            <li>and after a month my skin is looking much better, smoother , cleaner an radiant.  </li>
            <li>( I tend to lean towards the lavender a bit more).</li>
            <li>I bought my sister one and she feel in love with it...</li>
            <li>This product is the best item I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time, matter of fact I bought three more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>My face also felt very clean.  </li>
            <li>And as long as it worked, it worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li>Nowadays I am actually excited to wash my face or take showers!</li>
            <li>I got it from Costco (better price) and thankfully will be easy to return.</li>
            <li>My skin felt really clean!  </li>
            <li>This product was working just fine, and I really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>and I feel I have good value for money and would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My skin was smooth and lovely.  </li>
            <li>It cleared up my skin, and made it feel very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with my Nutra Sonic and glad I didn&#x27;t pay 200 more for another product!</li>
            <li>I found this product easy to use and very quick in cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li>The body is molded rubber and is easy to grip    </li>
            <li>and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s going strong.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I first used the Nutrasonic.  </li>
            <li>I should start by saying that meant that I had to buy new brushes since I borrowed the Clarisonic from my mom and the Nutra Sonic from one of my friends and it wouldn&#x27;t be a good thing to use their face brushes in addition to the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost of replacement brushes:&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has been over 3 1/2 years since my purchase, and is functioning fine.  </li>
            <li>The one I kept works fine, but the one I gave to her has not worked from day one:  </li>
            <li>Everything was fine for three months.  </li>
            <li>The very first use, today, I have ZERO blackheads!</li>
            <li>Some reviewers had a problem with the blinking light.  </li>
            <li>When I contacted the vendor, they told me to dispose of it as I saw fit</li>
            <li>My face is soooo smooth afterwards and the redness in my skin is fading away.</li>
            <li>This time the charger light would not come on when the unit was set on the cradle, so it seemed hopeless at this time.</li>
            <li>Now when I try to recharge it, the light does not even come on.</li>
            <li>This time, though, when I took it out of the charger the light wasn&#x27;t on at all</li>
            <li>They must use a cheap battery, hence the cheaper price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light in the handle that shows it is charging won&#x27;t light up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love the Nutrasonic because I just feel like it is tons better than a washcloth or just using hands, my skin really does feel tighter and cleaner.</li>
            <li>I am working with the online shop I purchased it from to get a replacement, but I really think it is more appropriate to go for a Clarisonic at this point.</li>
            <li>: I expected to like the Clarisonic better, I&#x27;ll be honest, because in spite of the fact I knew Nutra Sonic had more power, Clarisonic was pricier.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I just dug out my original receipt and called the manufacturer- Nutra Luxe MD-</li>
            <li>I am aware that this system does not have as many reviews as the Clarisonic, but I am also aware that many purchasers do not take the time to write a review.  </li>
            <li>This is an update of my original review.  </li>
            <li>Overall, affordable, solid construction and a great gift......for yourself!! :)</li>
            <li>Below is my original review, when I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Eventually, the indicator light showed a full charge.</li>
            <li>It does clean well.</li>
            <li>It does clean well.</li>
            <li>It seemed to clean my face</li>
            <li>One thing I did notice was as I got my skin clean</li>
            <li>Girls, it&#x27;s worth the money to get the best for your particular facial regimen...</li>
            <li>Was happy with the way it cleansed my skin, but the machine only lasted 4 months and then would not turn on, i was VERY dissapointed!</li>
            <li>So, based on how many exclamation marks I included in this review, it should come as no surprise that I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Both systems use a pulse action versus just spinning on your face, which I really liked.  </li>
            <li>Following the good reviews of the product on Costco.com and Amazon, I cheaped out and bought this product instead of the Clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t make the wrinkles go away, but it a) gets my skin super clean and b) allows my products to absorb.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely fallen in love with this cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>I already used a buff puff on my face when cleansing, so wasn&#x27;t sure I really needed this.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the different speeds, and the wonderful (paraben free) cleanser and toner&lt;br /&gt;included</li>
            <li>I was searching for a really good facial cleansing brush and I saw this one on amazon.</li>
            <li>Even if that were true, a reliable company would have offered a comparable product or even a discount</li>
            <li>Now, after a full charge, it lasts some 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>I loved it at first, but now I feel like my skin is more dry and flakey.</li>
            <li>I started out using the sensitive, immediately moved up to the normal which cleaned very nicely.  </li>
            <li>Luckily mine stopped working within 30 days of purchasing it, so I was eligible for a full refund.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I am really enjoying this product, am soooo glad that I didn&#x27;t spend double on Clarisonic b/c</li>
            <li>As described and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Changing thebrushes is very easy, one twist and pull apart, reverse action to install    </li>
            <li>All in all, the produce is great while it works, but not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>my skin is still in better shape than it normally would be around this time of the month.</li>
            <li>I noticed from the very first use that it stopped and started during use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more effective than weekly facials and definitely less costly.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin,tons of blackheads, and HUGE pores.  </li>
            <li>After 24 hours, the indicator light did not show that it was fully charged (did not stop blinking), but I couldn&#x27;t wait to see what this product could do, so I went ahead and used it in the shower, for about 15 mins straight on the highest speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>finally purchased a CS and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely ever break out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the wait.....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you whether or not the Nutra Sonic is worth over $80.00.  </li>
            <li>So, when I saw the price difference, I thought it was worth giving the nutrasonic a try.</li>
            <li>brushes have been economical to replace.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not writing about this though, because I didn&#x27;t try it due to the price and already knowing the power wasn&#x27;t as good as the Nutra Sonic going in.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus now the right side of my face has caught up with the left and is equally as smooth and clean!     </li>
            <li>Returned it to Amazon right away and was promptly offered a refund without any questions or hassles</li>
            <li>It just seems to make sense, right??</li>
            <li>Today, I pushed the button that changes the speed, and I pushed it right through the casing.</li>
            <li>Also if you want to use it on your body, the Nutra Sonic works with the intense clean and body brush whereas you can&#x27;t do this with the Clarisonic.</li>

            <li>my face feels so clean and soft !!!</li>
            <li>The system is designed to have the light blink once you replace it in the cradle, it does not mean that the system needs charging.  </li>
            <li>The actual plastic housing/casing doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good a quality as with the Clarisonic, but so far it&#x27;s been holding up well.</li>
            <li>So far so good ( I have only used it for four days, so too soon to tell)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the normal one feels just a little harsher and the softer sensitive brush head feels perfect for me.</li>
            <li>but so far its held up fine.</li>
            <li>When I got it, it worked great for about 2 months, then it was getting hard to turn on.  </li>
            <li>Only down side at this point is I can&#x27;t figureout a great way to clean the handle that has some makeup stains on it.</li>
            <li>Having worked in the cosmetic biz myself, I&#x27;m well aware of that</li>
            <li>but it was, at the time of this review, $200 more than the Nutra Sonic that does the same thing</li>
            <li>/&gt;C: Did a far better job of cleaning than a regular scrubbing with a wash cloth and cleanser, reduced breakouts and smooth feel</li>
            <li>The pores on the left side of my face where I used the Nutra Sonic were MORE reduced, and my skin was smoother.</li>
            <li>they totally holdup and it has a better warranty than the Clarisonic</li>
            <li>all these 7 months later I like it even more</li>
            <li>they totally hold up and it has a better warranty than the Clarisonic</li>
            <li>The first unit I received worked for about a week, then as with many others who left feedback, the unit just refused to work, even after putting it on the charger for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>they are willing to replace it.</li>
            <li>Now, after about 3 more months, the newer version has the same problem.  </li>
            <li>(my first return I&#x27;ve ever had to do with Amazon after 10+ years of doing business).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used all 4 settings when cleaning the first time to test them.</li>
            <li>or take the charging cradle along,(small enough) just make sure you have an electrical, or power outlet for use.    </li>
            <li>Now for the negatives:    I am definitely using more of my beauty products than before.  </li>
            <li>I am simply a woman who has baby bottom soft skin, and much improved appearance, and wanted to give kudos for a good product.  </li>
            <li>I used my system four more times after this happened with the only thing being</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay the big bucks for the top of the line brand</li>
            <li>The first problem occurred around the end of</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and more receptive to my face serums and creams.</li>
            <li>This is my first face cleansing brush of this type.  </li>
            <li>I can really tell  a difference in that the products are not sitting on my skin anymore - they are being absorbed.   </li>
            <li>This brush worked well for more than 2 years of regular use.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Used it for exactly two months</li>
            <li>Nutra Sonic that I buy [the first one I had for 3 years]</li>
            <li>I may get a second one and hope for better battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazingly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Well, after purchasing it, I can only say that it has met my expectations &amp; more.</li>
            <li>First annoyance.  </li>
            <li>The benefit of this daily gentle exfoliation is that removing all the extra dead skin on your face doesn&#x27;t just help your face glow but also allows better for better absorption of product so whatever product you are using, it will help you get the most of it.the most of it.</li>
            <li>I was aware of it before I bought it</li>
            <li>and you have very sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t need a deeper clean</li>
            <li>and you have very sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t need a deeper clean</li>
            <li>It really does work great...for about a month or so, but right off the bat</li>
            <li>you want a sonic cleaner to begin with it: Sonic wave technology has long been proven as far more than a gimmick, though it may sound that way at first.</li>
            <li>My skin always feels so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I found it and that it&#x27;s lasted me as long as it has... and hopefully much longer!</li>
            <li>Plus now the right side of my face has caught up with the left and is equally as smooth and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is pretty fun to use, and it makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>: Has a jitter mode setting so you can use exfoliation cleansers and pretty much get a pro exfoliation.</li>
            <li>So far, the customer service has been adequate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to charge and holds its charge for lengthy facial treatments.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and blackheads</li>
            <li>B000N53QFS 100% Pure Sea Therapy Bath - Organic Eucalyptus 427g/15oz]], and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Pure Organic Sea Therapy Bath Soak for Body</li>
            <li>I have used the Nutrasonic nearly every day for the last 2 years and it&#x27;s still running strong!</li>
            <li>I have not used the cleansing products provided in the kit, still using my old routine, but what a difference in the texture, fine lines, and firmness with my old products.  </li>
            <li>I used my Nutra Sonic for the first time and was pleasantly surprised at how well it cleans  and does a microdermabrasion and yet is still very gentle.  </li>
            <li>no way could I count that fast.</li>
            <li>which didn&#x27;t make much sense to me, but suffice it to say it was just lighter on the power</li>
            <li>The soft pulse of the Clarisonic simply didn&#x27;t do this as much, although I did like it better than a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>The soft pulse of the Clarisonic simply didn&#x27;t do this as much, although I did like it better than a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my NutraSonic for almost a year and really enjoy the deep cleaning and exfoliation it provides.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for skin cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Jitterbug mode,(exfoliator) and use it almost exclusively.  </li>
            <li>I am almost ashamed to write just how much dirt was on my face, but the cotton ball soaked in toner didn&#x27;t lie.  </li>
            <li>The information/instruction pamphlet included regarding the red blinking light on the charging cradle</li>
            <li>So much for writing a review.  </li>
            <li>In my review I stated that the blinking light on the charging system would stop blinking in about ten minutes if lifted, and reset on charging cradle.  </li>
            <li>Rather than rubbing a washcloth, having something that automatically spins and really cleans skin.</li>
            <li>You will see and feel a real change.....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have break outs</li>
            <li>It tickled so much</li>
            <li>And, there is now a light on the charger that flashes when it&#x27;s charging and that&#x27;s solid when it&#x27;s done</li>
            <li>Powerful and complete system for cleansing my face and body.</li>
            <li>The sonic vibrations are intense.</li>
            <li>If you are set on buying this crappy product you should try and get the ones that are sent from amazon or straight from the real manufacturer</li>
            <li>I then tried applying vaseline (much to my break out prone skin&#x27;s dismay) and still the patch persisted.</li>
            <li>The pores on my forehead of gotten significantly smaller, and the preventative products that I smooth on my skin after cleansing literally soak in.</li>
            <li>the recovery time is much reduced.</li>
            <li>It really did work well in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>Really a bummer.</li>
            <li>I was curious to see if the brush would be able to keep its charge, and to my surprise, it did.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>You have to really play with the bushes and the timing to make it work for you.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin looking fresh and clear.</li>
            <li>The brush itself feels good in my hand, sturdy, and not likely to slip out, even when wet.    </li>
            <li>it would shut off more frequently after each use shutting off twice on the fourth use.  </li>
            <li>This has helped my back and my chest clear up as well :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3-4 different brands but so far my favorite has been [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I shipped the charger back along with a copy of my original receipt from March 2011 and as of yet, I have not received a replacement.  </li>
            <li>It has really smoothed out the fine lines, age spots, and dry patches.  </li>
            <li>I loved it, but it is not worth it if it going to quit and Amazon won&#x27;t honor a basic 90 day window.</li>
            <li>(But the price was far higher on their website when I looked than most other sellers of it.)&lt;br /&gt;N: 1 year regardless of where you buy</li>
            <li>(But the price was far higher on their website when I looked than most other sellers of it.)   </li>
            <li>It loses it&#x27;s power faster than when it was new but is good for about 5 days.</li>
            <li>Fast enough handling, and shipping time considering we chose Super Saver method.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic has a sound sensor included that sounds when you have been at one location too long so as not to damage the skin.  </li>
            <li>The light will continue to blink as long as it is plugged in.  </li>
            <li>so I could see it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li>I finally returned to amazon for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>bought this January 2012, so it didn&#x27;t even last a full year.  </li>
            <li>if your skin is very sensitive, there is a softer brush, if you want greater exfoliation, use the harder brush at normal speed, or soften feet and elbows in the shower with the body brush on high speed.</li>
            <li>Why pay more for less, just because of the brand name.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped that it simply needed a good charge, but unfortunately it is simply dead.  </li>
            <li>Decent product when working.</li>
            <li>Sounds like many people have recently had this same prob w the product.</li>
            <li>I particularly like how deep the sonic allows it cleans so that all my facial creams are able to work at a deeper level.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I&#x27;m not usually into intense skin care, I got this brush to prep my skin for my wedding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it just about 3 weeks and was trying to wait a little longer to review, but I just love it.</li>
            <li>The heads are not too expensive and the macine holds a GREAT charge.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised that it felt very relaxing/comfortable and took no time at all.</li>
            <li>It really did help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and tend to over-exfoliate as well as use product that causes me to really break out.  </li>
            <li>Sad, because when it worked, it worked great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, I used one for one week on one side of my face, twice per day and the other on the other side of my face twice per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re interested in a sonic facial cleanser, would probably be worth spending the big bucks on the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Normal Skin    </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ll have to spend the $200+ for the Clarisonic on top of the money wasted on this product.</li>
            <li>It is powerful enough for your body as well.  </li>
            <li>and it seems plenty powerful enough.</li>
            <li>I used the normal brush for 90seconds..</li>
            <li>It does a good job of exfoliation without being too irritating to my skin.     </li>
            <li>I have become addicted to how good my skin looks after using this brush because:    1)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did, buy the right product from the beginning.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get a chance to ship the Nutra Sonic back right away</li>
            <li>The remedy is to wait about five minutes, the reset in the cradle for the light to go steady, about the time it takes for me to tone, apply eye cream, facial serum, and beauty cream so its not a big deal.</li>
            <li>For your face this means it cleans your pores 6 times better than you can via simply washing, reducing breakouts but also helping take away loose skin on the surface</li>
            <li>Plus, I have not yet had to buy ANY new brushes...</li>
            <li>Plus, I have not yet had to buy ANY new brushes...</li>
            <li>I asked for an entirely new replacement unit, and they refused.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now purchasing a new Nutra Sonic to replace her</li>
            <li>I am starting to wonder if I should have spent more money on the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>it sure beats those one speed systems that are a complete waste of your money.  </li>
            <li>It really exfoliates ur skin like no other cleansing brush  </li>
            <li>Received this as a gift from someone who owned the CS and wanted me to be the guinea pig for this since it was &#x27;just like a CS but so much cheaper&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the brush for a couple weeks and it seemed to clean well but make a mess everywhere</li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have a steady red light but no action.  </li>
            <li>After my first used my skin was completely red and could see an immediately formation of new pimples.</li>
            <li>4 speeds: sensitive, normal, and body brush&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin (face and body) feels soooo soft after brushing!   </li>
            <li>blackheads have almost completely dissapeared!     </li>
            <li>My favorite is the 3rd setting where the inner and outer heads occilate in opposite directions.</li>
            <li>This lets me know that a company in business, and also selling product on amazon is probably selling in the gazillions, so I usually do not let smallamounts of negatives deter me in my decision.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was prompt in sending me a second package   and emailing me  a return label for the first.  </li>
            <li>The first one I bought stopped charging after maybe a week, so I sent it back.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay a premium for the name brand, this one does exactly the same thing for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>At first it was a pain to spend the extra minute or two to use it, but now it&#x27;s just a ritual.  </li>
            <li>overall, I am pretty dissapointed.</li>
            <li>but did not want to spend that amount of money who many not love it like I did.</li>
            <li>She further explained that she only used this product to clean her face, neck &amp; shoulders.</li>
            <li>Another nice feature is the pulse action actually stimulates the face without irritation, which actually activates collagen cells to produce, alas the reduction of fine lines, and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I guess that I am using more now because they are actually being absorbed into my skin versus just sitting on top of dirty skin, which is the lesser of two evils.    </li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t mind looking down near the sink to prevent some random water drops that Nutra Sonic sometimes slings with the greater vibrations, or you want to use it in the shower, or you want to exfoliate or have normal skin that sometimes needs a greater scrubbing (although you can still go with gentle too), I&#x27;d choose the Nutra Sonic.</li>

            <li>It is gentle enough for me to use twice daily with no ill effects as is advertised.    </li>
            <li>There was an instruction booklet with mine that clearly explained how to use, charge, etc.</li>
            <li>This is why they are used in professional toothbrushes and in the jewelry cleaner machines your jeweler uses.</li>

            <li>Manufacturer says it&#x27;s made for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;N</li>
            <li>If I had purchased this product from Amazon directly this would not be an issues.  </li>
            <li>I understand the 30 policy, just thought with it dying completely and</li>
            <li>They claimed that the \\&quot;old model\\&quot; had problems and they sent me the newer version (with my old charger).  </li>
            <li>I clearly received a defective unit, and so far the seller has not responded to my email.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive, or irritated skin this is the way to go.    </li>
            <li>Sensitive Skin    </li>
            <li>The pulse action does all the work.  </li>
            <li>We get used to keeping appliances frequently used plugged into an electrical outlet which may shorten it&#x27;s life.  </li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li>So far I am a believer in this product</li>
            <li>but I have always had problem skin and have developed a habit of well-picking.</li>
            <li>I use this brush to exfoliate and, afterwards, my skin feels sooo soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>VERY diappointed, go with a different brand!</li>
            <li>At least you will have warranty on it or amazon will be nice enough to give you a refund or something.</li>
            <li>I have tried other facial brushes that were nowhere as grand as this four speed facial tool.  </li>
            <li>but I can say that a bothersome dry patch that I had under my chin that was a source of both itching and flaking disappeared after my first use.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for my daughter and we were so excited about how it made her face feel after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li>No mess and</li>
            <li>Like others, I had the same issue, it worked very very well for about 2 months or occasional use and then died!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>It is so reasonably priced at less than $100 for the entire system, I figured it was worth a try.      </li>
            <li>I was absolutely thrilled with the results of the Nutra Sonic, and my face saw dramatic improvement within 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>First, it felt like the Clarisonic only had vibration in the middle part of the brush, not all over,</li>
            <li>Low in comparison, but nothing with decent sonic wavelength tech is cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but in this case, for me, Amazon had a link ad on the Nutra Derm page that linked to an outside website that had the Nutra Sonic less and with free shipping so</li>
            <li>It really helped reduce bumps, blackheads and clogged pores, but if I used it too long or often, it would leave a rash on my face</li>
            <li>Came with sensative, normal, and body heads, 4 different occilations(not just speeds, but the WAY the brush turns and vibrates), a cleanser and toner and a carry case as well as the base/cahrger unit.</li>
            <li>I have gone over face several times with no negative effect, just as I would with my scrub pad.    </li>
            <li>I had to use double my normal three (3) balls to get the residue off.  </li>
            <li>I guess I just hadn&#x27;t charged it long enough at the start, and a full 15 minutes of work totally drained the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first got a Mio 2 as a gift and loved it, but the replacement heads and facial cleanser were VERY EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li>It just FEELS so much cleaner, and when I dry my face there is no sign of makeup at all.</li>
            <li>The big brown patch is much thinner, some places I can actually see the skin through it!  </li>
            <li>I followed the charging instructions exactly and let it run down completely between charging.</li>
            <li>I purchased it mid-October and followed all instructions regarding charging it (i.e. 24 hours of charging before first use, allowing brush to run down completely before re-charging, etc.).</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the old saying proves true every time...</li>
            <li>and I have a very large brown patch of rough, wrinkled skin, the size of a quarter on my cheekbone just below my left eye.</li>
            <li>Worked for nearly one week and then started shutting off in the middle of being used.  </li>
            <li>I actually came here to purchase one for my 14 year old niece for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>This was an early Christmas present.  </li>
            <li>I would expect something like this to last far longer than the maybe 3 years that I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li>I used the sensitive brush the second time for 1min.</li>
            <li>My normal routine was using a facial scrub pad with a liquid facial soap, (</li>
            <li>Not hard, but more difficult than the Clarisonic in comparison</li>
            <li>my skin again turned red and had new pimples by next morning.</li>
            <li>I know the Clarisonic is great and even know folks who work there, but I decided to give this a try since it was less expensive.     </li>
            <li>I am also aware that the negative reviews are smaller than the positive.  </li>
            <li>so I was really excited when I found one that wasn&#x27;t so expensive as the clarisonic and does exactly what the clarisonic does.</li>
            <li>Would caution you to only order directly thru Amazon and not a third party seller; your refund experience might not be as satisfactory as mine.</li>
            <li>I was going to try using the sensitive skin brush, for only short periods of time, to see if then i wouldnt get a rash, but it broke.  </li>
            <li>it appears they have a poorly manufactured switch that doesn&#x27;t want to work.&lt;br /&gt;After some rigmorole we could get the switch to function fairly often by pressing it at odd angles and such . .</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and did reduce from daily use after the first week as it seemed to make my face blotchy and break small veins.</li>
            <li>The first package sent me was missing the charging cord.   </li>
            <li>That one has been harder to find than the normal brush</li>
            <li>For a little more money, I got less headaches and a product that works!!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that tends to get dry</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t hold it in any position too long you shouldn&#x27;t have any worries, just use normal movements.  </li>
            <li>My face felt tight and very youthful for 2 days after cleansing.</li>
            <li>I prefer Mary Kay&#x27;s exfoliation cleanser because they are one of the few that uses the exact same exfoliates as dermatologists use...rather than ground peach pits or apricot pits that actually put tiny tears in your skin.</li>
            <li>thus far, my makeup is even better and smoother due to no more dead surface skin.</li>
            <li>thus far, my makeup is even better and smoother due to no more dead surface skin.</li>
            <li>This is both a good and bad thing.</li>

            <li> My skin looks the best it&#x27;s ever looked in 40 years.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I saw a wonderful reduction in wrinkles on either side</li>
            <li> thanked my Sonic cleanser lenders and still remain VERY happy with the Nutra Sonic.</li>

            <li> I am incredibly happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this brush!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for in the shower.</li>
            <li> The product was wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Great!  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product !</li>
            <li> VERY happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product as well as an excellent value.  </li>
            <li> skin is beautiful!!</li>
            <li> This is a great cleansing system!  </li>
            <li> Now, when I went to Nordstrom&#x27;s they all raved about how wonderful the clarisonic is, but I just couldn&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li> I have had folks tell me that my skin looks like porcelain &amp; \\&quot; how beautiful it is!</li>
            <li> There is already an excellent, in depth review on this item written by Chandler on Sept 15, 2011 titled \\&quot;First-hand comparison between the Clarisonic and the Nutrasonic cleaning systems\\</li>
            <li> It still works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The four speeds allows me to choose the best treatment for my face.  </li>
            <li> I think this was a very good purchase, and would still give a five star rating.  </li>
            <li> cause there is a very good chance it will stop working within a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Anyway, good luck!</li>
            <li> Once I received and started using my NutraSonic, I loved it!</li>
            <li> It looks gorgeous again and has completley smoothed out!</li>
            <li> Great product, I would give it as a gift.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It should be noted that price varies greatly both on Amazon and the internet.</li>
            <li> , the Clarisonic would make you happy.</li>
            <li> even more...works great, no issues.</li>
            <li> , the Clarisonic would make you happy.</li>
            <li> ...works great, no issues.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m a happy camper using in the shower once or twice per week for face and body.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this with great anticipation.  </li>
            <li> the 7 days it worked, it worked great.....</li>
            <li> dont forget vitamins, suppliments and water water water for great skin as well.  </li>
            <li> product worked great.</li>
            <li> My wife saw, and felt a great improvement in her skin.</li>
            <li> It worked great WHILE IT WORKED.</li>
            <li> Great product for cleaning, massaging and polishing face.  </li>
            <li> I bought the model that has scrubbing heads for body and works great on elbows, knees, etc.</li>
            <li> The product was working great</li>
            <li> I brought the Nutra Sonic after recomendations from a friend whose skin had great tone &amp; clarity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been really happy with it.  </li>
            <li> This product is great while it works, no doubt about it.</li>
            <li> This brush looks awesome and the good reviews are really good.</li>
            <li> It works so nice !</li>
            <li> And the battery life lasts a good 10 days, so it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of up-keep, either.</li>
            <li> Olay has a good one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really loved it when it worked, therefore I ordered a replacement unit instead of a refund.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product 5 months ago and have loved having it</li>
            <li> I believed I was doing a good job cleansing my face by the residue from the toner cotton ball, which was used until the ball showed no residue.  </li>
            <li> It is an indicator of the quality of the product by the number of the good reviews, and I always use this as my guide.  </li>
            <li> However, it does seem to splatter a fair amount when you use it at the sink if you care about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the brush.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this item until it stopped working.</li>
            <li> as good as Nutra Sonic.</li>
            <li> I too loved the product for the two months it worked.  </li>
            <li> It did work really good......</li>
            <li> Add me to the list of people who initially loved this product but then my brush just stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, I cannot comment on whether that product is good or not.</li>
            <li> To be fair, my Nutra Luxe lasted for three years before it quit working</li>
            <li> if you get a good one.  </li>
            <li> Turns out I loved it.  </li>
            <li> This is a unisex system, not just for women, so it may wear out from getting more use (lol)    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> We are very pleased with the results of the brush and have recommended this product to the dermatologist as well as friends.</li>
            <li> Maybe the clarisonic is better in some way, I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m happy with what I&#x27;ve got</li>
            <li> I was initially very pleased with the Nutrasonic cleanser I bought</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE JUNE 26, 2013: STILL love it!</li>
            <li> I use mine in the shower and love it!  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased it!  </li>
            <li> I should have known it was too good to be true!!</li>
            <li> Great for the skin, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I loved the exfoliation mode on the Nutra Sonic and, in all honesty, the speed difference was VERY important to me.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> Still have smooth skin, still works great.</li>
            <li> Still have smooth skin, still works great.</li>
            <li> In about a week my skin looked amazing.  </li>
            <li> I bought a clarisonic the week after it broke and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> Does a great job exfoliating; leaves skin smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  </li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this product is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> It was amazing.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I own both of those items too</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t measure these rotations on my own...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own when I am not in the room.  </li>
            <li> Both systems were waterproof, for shower use, which I also liked, and had a charging cradle.  </li>
            <li> My kind of price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product, well-made, waterproof, and reasonably priced compared to the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the idea, though, about the four speeds and face and body brushes that are interchangeable.</li>
            <li> I loved the product while it worked,  But, now I have to spend more money on another sonic cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t own the Clarisonic model</li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to add my own cleanser and use my own products though, so Neutrogena was out.</li>
            <li> It does a very good job of gently cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it with the products included, they smell great and lemony fresh, but I am an Olay lady so that is where my loyalty lies, in terms of the product used with the Nutra Sonic  </li>
            <li> good part is that the skin on my face and arms hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth since I don&#x27;t know when.</li>
            <li> I own a Clarisonic which I love and would not be without</li>
            <li> After the first day of each charge, it would work great</li>
            <li> I really love the Nutra Sonic.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes the skin feel after you use it.</li>
            <li> If I am going to spend $100 or more on an item, I do a lot of research</li>
            <li> $25 on most sites but</li>
            <li> Sonic (hereafter referred to as \\&quot;N\\&quot;)$15 on most sites</li>
            <li> , Nutra Sonic truly felt like it had more power...</li>
            <li> however, that also meant there was a bit more splatter.</li>
            <li> , there is a Clarisonic that has more speeds as well</li>
            <li> 1 brush&lt;br /&gt;N: 3 brush heads for each speed...</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> This product does a better job than my manual face cleaning</li>
            <li> I do tend to keep it out of the charger most of the time.</li>
            <li> I thought they would and should have read more closely.  </li>
            <li> this made the most sense.</li>
            <li> :) I do recommend this.</li>
            <li> If you travel this could travel well, just make sure you either</li>
            <li> Olay had many pros/cons</li>
            <li> But I still use it and love it</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, cleaner, looks more even toned and   </li>
            <li> I had hoped the NutraSonic would have reduced my pore size more than it has, but there has been some improvement.  </li>
            <li> Maybe with continued use there will be more.    </li>
            <li> My face cream seems to absorb better now.</li>
            <li> it made me sneeze :)  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imaging it working better than this brand.  </li>
            <li> It is better than the rest on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years regularly, and it has worked perfectly since day 1.</li>
            <li> Better product design would solve this problem.</li>
            <li> I do much better with this brush and it leaves my face shining healthy.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate, you will love it, I promise.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, does just what it says...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers made this comment.  </li>
            <li> maybe it will magically turn on again</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t compare, I can&#x27;t see how the clarasonic could be any better than this product.</li>
            <li> Editing to add: I love what this product does for my skin, but it does have issues holding a charge.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Okay so, THANK YOU, Amazon, for providing ZERO customer support for this product.</li>
            <li> Although it is made by the makers of sonicare toothbrush, which I absolutely love that product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I see no reason to change and spend a LOT more money.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU!I also LOVE that it has a body brush.</li>
            <li> When I contacted the company, their response (after I said it was more than a year)</li>
            <li> love my nutra sonic.  </li>
            <li> my skin texture is so much better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to its competitor, but this one sure works well.  </li>
            <li> I refused to  quit using it and waited for three more days..</li>
            <li> and after a month my skin is looking much better, smoother , cleaner an radiant.  </li>
            <li> ( I tend to lean towards the lavender a bit more).</li>
            <li> I bought my sister one and she feel in love with it...</li>
            <li> This product is the best item I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time, matter of fact I bought three more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> My face also felt very clean.  </li>
            <li> And as long as it worked, it worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Nowadays I am actually excited to wash my face or take showers!</li>
            <li> I got it from Costco (better price) and thankfully will be easy to return.</li>
            <li> My skin felt really clean!  </li>
            <li> This product was working just fine, and I really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> and I feel I have good value for money and would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My skin was smooth and lovely.  </li>
            <li> It cleared up my skin, and made it feel very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with my Nutra Sonic and glad I didn&#x27;t pay 200 more for another product!</li>
            <li> I found this product easy to use and very quick in cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li> The body is molded rubber and is easy to grip    </li>
            <li> and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s going strong.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I first used the Nutrasonic.  </li>
            <li> I should start by saying that meant that I had to buy new brushes since I borrowed the Clarisonic from my mom and the Nutra Sonic from one of my friends and it wouldn&#x27;t be a good thing to use their face brushes in addition to the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost of replacement brushes:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has been over 3 1/2 years since my purchase, and is functioning fine.  </li>
            <li> The one I kept works fine, but the one I gave to her has not worked from day one:  </li>
            <li> Everything was fine for three months.  </li>
            <li> The very first use, today, I have ZERO blackheads!</li>
            <li> Some reviewers had a problem with the blinking light.  </li>
            <li> When I contacted the vendor, they told me to dispose of it as I saw fit</li>
            <li> My face is soooo smooth afterwards and the redness in my skin is fading away.</li>
            <li> This time the charger light would not come on when the unit was set on the cradle, so it seemed hopeless at this time.</li>
            <li> Now when I try to recharge it, the light does not even come on.</li>
            <li> This time, though, when I took it out of the charger the light wasn&#x27;t on at all</li>
            <li> They must use a cheap battery, hence the cheaper price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light in the handle that shows it is charging won&#x27;t light up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love the Nutrasonic because I just feel like it is tons better than a washcloth or just using hands, my skin really does feel tighter and cleaner.</li>
            <li> I am working with the online shop I purchased it from to get a replacement, but I really think it is more appropriate to go for a Clarisonic at this point.</li>
            <li> : I expected to like the Clarisonic better, I&#x27;ll be honest, because in spite of the fact I knew Nutra Sonic had more power, Clarisonic was pricier.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I just dug out my original receipt and called the manufacturer- Nutra Luxe MD-</li>
            <li> I am aware that this system does not have as many reviews as the Clarisonic, but I am also aware that many purchasers do not take the time to write a review.  </li>
            <li> This is an update of my original review.  </li>
            <li> Overall, affordable, solid construction and a great gift......for yourself!! :)</li>
            <li> Below is my original review, when I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Eventually, the indicator light showed a full charge.</li>
            <li> It does clean well.</li>
            <li> It does clean well.</li>
            <li> It seemed to clean my face</li>
            <li> One thing I did notice was as I got my skin clean</li>
            <li> Girls, it&#x27;s worth the money to get the best for your particular facial regimen...</li>
            <li> Was happy with the way it cleansed my skin, but the machine only lasted 4 months and then would not turn on, i was VERY dissapointed!</li>
            <li> So, based on how many exclamation marks I included in this review, it should come as no surprise that I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Both systems use a pulse action versus just spinning on your face, which I really liked.  </li>
            <li> Following the good reviews of the product on Costco.com and Amazon, I cheaped out and bought this product instead of the Clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make the wrinkles go away, but it a) gets my skin super clean and b) allows my products to absorb.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely fallen in love with this cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> I already used a buff puff on my face when cleansing, so wasn&#x27;t sure I really needed this.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the different speeds, and the wonderful (paraben free) cleanser and toner&lt;br /&gt;included</li>
            <li> I was searching for a really good facial cleansing brush and I saw this one on amazon.</li>
            <li> Even if that were true, a reliable company would have offered a comparable product or even a discount</li>
            <li> Now, after a full charge, it lasts some 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first, but now I feel like my skin is more dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> I started out using the sensitive, immediately moved up to the normal which cleaned very nicely.  </li>
            <li> Luckily mine stopped working within 30 days of purchasing it, so I was eligible for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I am really enjoying this product, am soooo glad that I didn&#x27;t spend double on Clarisonic b/c</li>
            <li> As described and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Changing thebrushes is very easy, one twist and pull apart, reverse action to install    </li>
            <li> All in all, the produce is great while it works, but not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> my skin is still in better shape than it normally would be around this time of the month.</li>
            <li> I noticed from the very first use that it stopped and started during use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more effective than weekly facials and definitely less costly.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin,tons of blackheads, and HUGE pores.  </li>
            <li> After 24 hours, the indicator light did not show that it was fully charged (did not stop blinking), but I couldn&#x27;t wait to see what this product could do, so I went ahead and used it in the shower, for about 15 mins straight on the highest speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> finally purchased a CS and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> and I rarely ever break out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the wait.....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you whether or not the Nutra Sonic is worth over $80.00.  </li>
            <li> So, when I saw the price difference, I thought it was worth giving the nutrasonic a try.</li>
            <li> brushes have been economical to replace.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not writing about this though, because I didn&#x27;t try it due to the price and already knowing the power wasn&#x27;t as good as the Nutra Sonic going in.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus now the right side of my face has caught up with the left and is equally as smooth and clean!     </li>
            <li> Returned it to Amazon right away and was promptly offered a refund without any questions or hassles</li>
            <li> It just seems to make sense, right??</li>
            <li> Today, I pushed the button that changes the speed, and I pushed it right through the casing.</li>
            <li> Also if you want to use it on your body, the Nutra Sonic works with the intense clean and body brush whereas you can&#x27;t do this with the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Also if you want to use it on your body, the Nutra Sonic works with the intense clean and body brush whereas you can&#x27;t do this with the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> my face feels so clean and soft !!!</li>
            <li> The system is designed to have the light blink once you replace it in the cradle, it does not mean that the system needs charging.  </li>
            <li> The actual plastic housing/casing doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good a quality as with the Clarisonic, but so far it&#x27;s been holding up well.</li>
            <li> So far so good ( I have only used it for four days, so too soon to tell)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the normal one feels just a little harsher and the softer sensitive brush head feels perfect for me.</li>
            <li> but so far its held up fine.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it worked great for about 2 months, then it was getting hard to turn on.  </li>
            <li> Only down side at this point is I can&#x27;t figureout a great way to clean the handle that has some makeup stains on it.</li>
            <li> Having worked in the cosmetic biz myself, I&#x27;m well aware of that</li>
            <li> but it was, at the time of this review, $200 more than the Nutra Sonic that does the same thing</li>
            <li> /&gt;C: Did a far better job of cleaning than a regular scrubbing with a wash cloth and cleanser, reduced breakouts and smooth feel</li>
            <li> The pores on the left side of my face where I used the Nutra Sonic were MORE reduced, and my skin was smoother.</li>
            <li> they totally holdup and it has a better warranty than the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> all these 7 months later I like it even more</li>
            <li> they totally hold up and it has a better warranty than the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> The first unit I received worked for about a week, then as with many others who left feedback, the unit just refused to work, even after putting it on the charger for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> they are willing to replace it.</li>
            <li> Now, after about 3 more months, the newer version has the same problem.  </li>
            <li> (my first return I&#x27;ve ever had to do with Amazon after 10+ years of doing business).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used all 4 settings when cleaning the first time to test them.</li>
            <li> or take the charging cradle along,(small enough) just make sure you have an electrical, or power outlet for use.    </li>
            <li> Now for the negatives:    I am definitely using more of my beauty products than before.  </li>
            <li> I am simply a woman who has baby bottom soft skin, and much improved appearance, and wanted to give kudos for a good product.  </li>
            <li> I used my system four more times after this happened with the only thing being</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay the big bucks for the top of the line brand</li>
            <li> The first problem occurred around the end of</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and more receptive to my face serums and creams.</li>
            <li> This is my first face cleansing brush of this type.  </li>
            <li> I can really tell  a difference in that the products are not sitting on my skin anymore - they are being absorbed.   </li>
            <li> This brush worked well for more than 2 years of regular use.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Used it for exactly two months</li>
            <li> Nutra Sonic that I buy [the first one I had for 3 years]</li>
            <li> I may get a second one and hope for better battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazingly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Well, after purchasing it, I can only say that it has met my expectations &amp; more.</li>
            <li> First annoyance.  </li>
            <li> The benefit of this daily gentle exfoliation is that removing all the extra dead skin on your face doesn&#x27;t just help your face glow but also allows better for better absorption of product so whatever product you are using, it will help you get the most of it.the most of it.</li>
            <li> I was aware of it before I bought it</li>
            <li> and you have very sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t need a deeper clean</li>
            <li> and you have very sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t need a deeper clean</li>
            <li> It really does work great...for about a month or so, but right off the bat</li>
            <li> you want a sonic cleaner to begin with it: Sonic wave technology has long been proven as far more than a gimmick, though it may sound that way at first.</li>
            <li> My skin always feels so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I found it and that it&#x27;s lasted me as long as it has... and hopefully much longer!</li>
            <li> Plus now the right side of my face has caught up with the left and is equally as smooth and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pretty fun to use, and it makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> : Has a jitter mode setting so you can use exfoliation cleansers and pretty much get a pro exfoliation.</li>
            <li> So far, the customer service has been adequate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to charge and holds its charge for lengthy facial treatments.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and blackheads</li>
            <li> B000N53QFS 100% Pure Sea Therapy Bath - Organic Eucalyptus 427g/15oz]], and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Pure Organic Sea Therapy Bath Soak for Body</li>
            <li> I have used the Nutrasonic nearly every day for the last 2 years and it&#x27;s still running strong!</li>
            <li> I have not used the cleansing products provided in the kit, still using my old routine, but what a difference in the texture, fine lines, and firmness with my old products.  </li>
            <li> I used my Nutra Sonic for the first time and was pleasantly surprised at how well it cleans  and does a microdermabrasion and yet is still very gentle.  </li>
            <li> no way could I count that fast.</li>
            <li> which didn&#x27;t make much sense to me, but suffice it to say it was just lighter on the power</li>
            <li> The soft pulse of the Clarisonic simply didn&#x27;t do this as much, although I did like it better than a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> The soft pulse of the Clarisonic simply didn&#x27;t do this as much, although I did like it better than a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my NutraSonic for almost a year and really enjoy the deep cleaning and exfoliation it provides.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for skin cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Jitterbug mode,(exfoliator) and use it almost exclusively.  </li>
            <li> I am almost ashamed to write just how much dirt was on my face, but the cotton ball soaked in toner didn&#x27;t lie.  </li>
            <li> The information/instruction pamphlet included regarding the red blinking light on the charging cradle</li>
            <li> So much for writing a review.  </li>
            <li> In my review I stated that the blinking light on the charging system would stop blinking in about ten minutes if lifted, and reset on charging cradle.  </li>
            <li> Rather than rubbing a washcloth, having something that automatically spins and really cleans skin.</li>
            <li> You will see and feel a real change.....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have break outs</li>
            <li> It tickled so much</li>
            <li> And, there is now a light on the charger that flashes when it&#x27;s charging and that&#x27;s solid when it&#x27;s done</li>
            <li> Powerful and complete system for cleansing my face and body.</li>
            <li> The sonic vibrations are intense.</li>
            <li> If you are set on buying this crappy product you should try and get the ones that are sent from amazon or straight from the real manufacturer</li>
            <li> I then tried applying vaseline (much to my break out prone skin&#x27;s dismay) and still the patch persisted.</li>
            <li> The pores on my forehead of gotten significantly smaller, and the preventative products that I smooth on my skin after cleansing literally soak in.</li>
            <li> the recovery time is much reduced.</li>
            <li> It really did work well in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Really a bummer.</li>
            <li> I was curious to see if the brush would be able to keep its charge, and to my surprise, it did.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> You have to really play with the bushes and the timing to make it work for you.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin looking fresh and clear.</li>
            <li> The brush itself feels good in my hand, sturdy, and not likely to slip out, even when wet.    </li>
            <li> it would shut off more frequently after each use shutting off twice on the fourth use.  </li>
            <li> This has helped my back and my chest clear up as well :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3-4 different brands but so far my favorite has been [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I shipped the charger back along with a copy of my original receipt from March 2011 and as of yet, I have not received a replacement.  </li>
            <li> It has really smoothed out the fine lines, age spots, and dry patches.  </li>
            <li> I loved it, but it is not worth it if it going to quit and Amazon won&#x27;t honor a basic 90 day window.</li>
            <li> (But the price was far higher on their website when I looked than most other sellers of it.)&lt;br /&gt;N: 1 year regardless of where you buy</li>
            <li> (But the price was far higher on their website when I looked than most other sellers of it.)   </li>
            <li> It loses it&#x27;s power faster than when it was new but is good for about 5 days.</li>
            <li> Fast enough handling, and shipping time considering we chose Super Saver method.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic has a sound sensor included that sounds when you have been at one location too long so as not to damage the skin.  </li>
            <li> The light will continue to blink as long as it is plugged in.  </li>
            <li> so I could see it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li> I finally returned to amazon for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> bought this January 2012, so it didn&#x27;t even last a full year.  </li>
            <li> if your skin is very sensitive, there is a softer brush, if you want greater exfoliation, use the harder brush at normal speed, or soften feet and elbows in the shower with the body brush on high speed.</li>
            <li> Why pay more for less, just because of the brand name.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped that it simply needed a good charge, but unfortunately it is simply dead.  </li>
            <li> Decent product when working.</li>
            <li> Sounds like many people have recently had this same prob w the product.</li>
            <li> I particularly like how deep the sonic allows it cleans so that all my facial creams are able to work at a deeper level.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I&#x27;m not usually into intense skin care, I got this brush to prep my skin for my wedding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it just about 3 weeks and was trying to wait a little longer to review, but I just love it.</li>
            <li> The heads are not too expensive and the macine holds a GREAT charge.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised that it felt very relaxing/comfortable and took no time at all.</li>
            <li> It really did help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and tend to over-exfoliate as well as use product that causes me to really break out.  </li>
            <li> Sad, because when it worked, it worked great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, I used one for one week on one side of my face, twice per day and the other on the other side of my face twice per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re interested in a sonic facial cleanser, would probably be worth spending the big bucks on the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Normal Skin    </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ll have to spend the $200+ for the Clarisonic on top of the money wasted on this product.</li>
            <li> It is powerful enough for your body as well.  </li>
            <li> and it seems plenty powerful enough.</li>
            <li> I used the normal brush for 90seconds..</li>
            <li> It does a good job of exfoliation without being too irritating to my skin.     </li>
            <li> I have become addicted to how good my skin looks after using this brush because:    1)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did, buy the right product from the beginning.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get a chance to ship the Nutra Sonic back right away</li>
            <li> The remedy is to wait about five minutes, the reset in the cradle for the light to go steady, about the time it takes for me to tone, apply eye cream, facial serum, and beauty cream so its not a big deal.</li>
            <li> For your face this means it cleans your pores 6 times better than you can via simply washing, reducing breakouts but also helping take away loose skin on the surface</li>
            <li> Plus, I have not yet had to buy ANY new brushes...</li>
            <li> Plus, I have not yet had to buy ANY new brushes...</li>
            <li> I asked for an entirely new replacement unit, and they refused.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now purchasing a new Nutra Sonic to replace her</li>
            <li> I am starting to wonder if I should have spent more money on the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> it sure beats those one speed systems that are a complete waste of your money.  </li>
            <li> It really exfoliates ur skin like no other cleansing brush  </li>
            <li> Received this as a gift from someone who owned the CS and wanted me to be the guinea pig for this since it was &#x27;just like a CS but so much cheaper&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the brush for a couple weeks and it seemed to clean well but make a mess everywhere</li>
            <li> Also, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have a steady red light but no action.  </li>
            <li> After my first used my skin was completely red and could see an immediately formation of new pimples.</li>
            <li> 4 speeds: sensitive, normal, and body brush&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin (face and body) feels soooo soft after brushing!   </li>
            <li> blackheads have almost completely dissapeared!     </li>
            <li> My favorite is the 3rd setting where the inner and outer heads occilate in opposite directions.</li>
            <li> This lets me know that a company in business, and also selling product on amazon is probably selling in the gazillions, so I usually do not let smallamounts of negatives deter me in my decision.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was prompt in sending me a second package   and emailing me  a return label for the first.  </li>
            <li> The first one I bought stopped charging after maybe a week, so I sent it back.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay a premium for the name brand, this one does exactly the same thing for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> At first it was a pain to spend the extra minute or two to use it, but now it&#x27;s just a ritual.  </li>
            <li> overall, I am pretty dissapointed.</li>
            <li> but did not want to spend that amount of money who many not love it like I did.</li>
            <li> She further explained that she only used this product to clean her face, neck &amp; shoulders.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature is the pulse action actually stimulates the face without irritation, which actually activates collagen cells to produce, alas the reduction of fine lines, and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I guess that I am using more now because they are actually being absorbed into my skin versus just sitting on top of dirty skin, which is the lesser of two evils.    </li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t mind looking down near the sink to prevent some random water drops that Nutra Sonic sometimes slings with the greater vibrations, or you want to use it in the shower, or you want to exfoliate or have normal skin that sometimes needs a greater scrubbing (although you can still go with gentle too), I&#x27;d choose the Nutra Sonic.</li>

            <li> It is gentle enough for me to use twice daily with no ill effects as is advertised.    </li>
            <li> There was an instruction booklet with mine that clearly explained how to use, charge, etc.</li>
            <li> This is why they are used in professional toothbrushes and in the jewelry cleaner machines your jeweler uses.</li>
            <li> 1 speed, soft.</li>
            <li> Manufacturer says it&#x27;s made for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;N</li>
            <li> If I had purchased this product from Amazon directly this would not be an issues.  </li>
            <li> I understand the 30 policy, just thought with it dying completely and</li>
            <li> They claimed that the \\&quot;old model\\&quot; had problems and they sent me the newer version (with my old charger).  </li>
            <li> I clearly received a defective unit, and so far the seller has not responded to my email.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive, or irritated skin this is the way to go.    </li>
            <li> Sensitive Skin    </li>
            <li> The pulse action does all the work.  </li>
            <li> We get used to keeping appliances frequently used plugged into an electrical outlet which may shorten it&#x27;s life.  </li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> So far I am a believer in this product</li>
            <li> but I have always had problem skin and have developed a habit of well-picking.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to exfoliate and, afterwards, my skin feels sooo soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY diappointed, go with a different brand!</li>
            <li> At least you will have warranty on it or amazon will be nice enough to give you a refund or something.</li>
            <li> I have tried other facial brushes that were nowhere as grand as this four speed facial tool.  </li>
            <li> but I can say that a bothersome dry patch that I had under my chin that was a source of both itching and flaking disappeared after my first use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my daughter and we were so excited about how it made her face feel after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> No mess and</li>
            <li> Like others, I had the same issue, it worked very very well for about 2 months or occasional use and then died!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> It is so reasonably priced at less than $100 for the entire system, I figured it was worth a try.      </li>
            <li> I was absolutely thrilled with the results of the Nutra Sonic, and my face saw dramatic improvement within 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> First, it felt like the Clarisonic only had vibration in the middle part of the brush, not all over,</li>
            <li> Low in comparison, but nothing with decent sonic wavelength tech is cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but in this case, for me, Amazon had a link ad on the Nutra Derm page that linked to an outside website that had the Nutra Sonic less and with free shipping so</li>
            <li> It really helped reduce bumps, blackheads and clogged pores, but if I used it too long or often, it would leave a rash on my face</li>
            <li> Came with sensative, normal, and body heads, 4 different occilations(not just speeds, but the WAY the brush turns and vibrates), a cleanser and toner and a carry case as well as the base/cahrger unit.</li>
            <li> I have gone over face several times with no negative effect, just as I would with my scrub pad.    </li>
            <li> I had to use double my normal three (3) balls to get the residue off.  </li>
            <li> I guess I just hadn&#x27;t charged it long enough at the start, and a full 15 minutes of work totally drained the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first got a Mio 2 as a gift and loved it, but the replacement heads and facial cleanser were VERY EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> It just FEELS so much cleaner, and when I dry my face there is no sign of makeup at all.</li>
            <li> The big brown patch is much thinner, some places I can actually see the skin through it!  </li>
            <li> I followed the charging instructions exactly and let it run down completely between charging.</li>
            <li> I purchased it mid-October and followed all instructions regarding charging it (i.e. 24 hours of charging before first use, allowing brush to run down completely before re-charging, etc.).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the old saying proves true every time...</li>
            <li> and I have a very large brown patch of rough, wrinkled skin, the size of a quarter on my cheekbone just below my left eye.</li>
            <li> Worked for nearly one week and then started shutting off in the middle of being used.  </li>
            <li> I actually came here to purchase one for my 14 year old niece for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> This was an early Christmas present.  </li>
            <li> I would expect something like this to last far longer than the maybe 3 years that I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> I used the sensitive brush the second time for 1min.</li>
            <li> My normal routine was using a facial scrub pad with a liquid facial soap, (</li>
            <li> Not hard, but more difficult than the Clarisonic in comparison</li>
            <li> my skin again turned red and had new pimples by next morning.</li>
            <li> I know the Clarisonic is great and even know folks who work there, but I decided to give this a try since it was less expensive.     </li>
            <li> I am also aware that the negative reviews are smaller than the positive.  </li>
            <li> so I was really excited when I found one that wasn&#x27;t so expensive as the clarisonic and does exactly what the clarisonic does.</li>
            <li> Would caution you to only order directly thru Amazon and not a third party seller; your refund experience might not be as satisfactory as mine.</li>
            <li> I was going to try using the sensitive skin brush, for only short periods of time, to see if then i wouldnt get a rash, but it broke.  </li>
            <li> it appears they have a poorly manufactured switch that doesn&#x27;t want to work.&lt;br /&gt;After some rigmorole we could get the switch to function fairly often by pressing it at odd angles and such . .</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and did reduce from daily use after the first week as it seemed to make my face blotchy and break small veins.</li>
            <li> The first package sent me was missing the charging cord.   </li>
            <li> That one has been harder to find than the normal brush</li>
            <li> For a little more money, I got less headaches and a product that works!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that tends to get dry</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t hold it in any position too long you shouldn&#x27;t have any worries, just use normal movements.  </li>
            <li> My face felt tight and very youthful for 2 days after cleansing.</li>
            <li> I prefer Mary Kay&#x27;s exfoliation cleanser because they are one of the few that uses the exact same exfoliates as dermatologists use...rather than ground peach pits or apricot pits that actually put tiny tears in your skin.</li>
            <li> thus far, my makeup is even better and smoother due to no more dead surface skin.</li>
            <li> thus far, my makeup is even better and smoother due to no more dead surface skin.</li>
            <li> This is both a good and bad thing.</li>
            <li> It took maybe a week &amp; a half to two weeks for my new one to arrive, and I will admit that I noticed an increase in breakouts again.</li>
            <li> I usually go to the most negative reviews,(one star)</li>
            <li> I have charged it long enough for it to turn on and it does nothing.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how many bad reviews there were for this item.  </li>
            <li> other thing I like about this particular model is that you can use the body brush, which is a little larger.</li>
            <li> They said they would not normally accept a clarsonic back that was not purchased through them.  </li>
            <li> I wrote a very positive review of this face brush a few months ago, but had to replace the first unit when it failed after two weeks.  </li>
            <li> It only goes back in it&#x27;s charging cradle about once every other month or so.</li>
            <li> other than that, my wife likes it alot, and it does a heavier scrub than her more expensive model that gave out</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s hoping that&#x27;s not for a long, long time</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Contrary to its competitor it charges for a long haul.</li>
            <li> well, no soft velvety skin.</li>
            <li> I have kelatosis pilaris on my arms and since I started using this brush, I have soft, wayyyy less bumpy skin!   </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is less expensive than the clarsonic.  </li>
            <li> I used it a third time, but this time I only used it for less than 35 secs.  </li>
            <li> Some say they had no effect, which is typical of the general population on any product.    </li>
            <li> While I do charge it almost every other night just to avoid having it die on me at random, I am on vacation now and haven&#x27;t charged it for 3 days and still going strong.</li>
            <li> I think they should make that more clear on the base.</li>
            <li> Every single woman on the planet should have it.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; is limited to a # of minutes and then to charge again.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing</li>
            <li> , I am also certain to wipe it down so that it does not remain wet past what it is when I wash my face with it.</li>
            <li> I learned that I can only use it once every other day and only for less than 50seconds.  </li>
            <li> So far, Beauty and Accessories for Less has been LESS then helpful.</li>
            <li> really my only down point</li>
            <li> With the numerous complaints lodged against this company, you would think the state of Florida would shut them down, but they are shrewd and continue to make money off those of us trying to save a buck...don&#x27;t fall for it.</li>
            <li> After one (1) week of use, my pores were much smaller, after two weeks, my mouth lines were less pronounced.  </li>
            <li> While the oiliness has not been reduced, the dry flakes are now minimal.  </li>
            <li> However, less than a month later, it stopped charging again.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s too gentle, or too weak.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Nutra Sonic for just a little over a month now, once daily in the evenings after a shower and brushing the teeth.  </li>
            <li> am a little over a week into using this item twice daily</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t see which clogs pores and dulls skin and renewing skin reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Well, within a few weeks the second unit stopped running.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped that my NutraSonic would be one of the few that actually worked, but - no.  </li>
            <li> few weeks later the unit died again.</li>
            <li> Be careful how you store it.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions about charging it and would only charge it every few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars with you over the years</li>
            <li> Considering the price, this should have definitely lasted a few years as it is not the type of product you plan on buying annually.</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t think this feature was essential, as the brush does all the work, all you do is make contact to your skin, then slowly move the cleaner over your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is the base that is the problem because it would get a bit warm while the brush was in there,</li>
            <li> It lasted about a week before it had to be recharged, and after its second re-charge, it lasted less and less between charges.</li>
            <li> My breakouts were minimal, and usually due to monthly hormone changes.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem is, but after a few days I realizedI won&#x27;t be returning the Nutra Sonic after all, and now I&#x27;m back to using it regularly.</li>
            <li> Incidentally, if I have bad breakouts I do sometimes use the high speed on my face to really exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jitter</li>
            <li> Very frustrating though to see a product that brakes right after the warranty expires.</li>
            <li> I returned it for a refund, not interested in a replacement.</li>
            <li> I am praying mine doesn&#x27;t stop working like it happened to other reviewers because if it does I&#x27;ll freak out.</li>
            <li> and there is no phone number or other way to get a hold of them.</li>
            <li> Did not take it in the shower, as other customers did.</li>
            <li> I have not tested Clarisonic, Oil of Olay, or any other cleansing system, but them for a comparison.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of other reviews that claimed that this happened, but I ignored the warnings.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I was weary of spending $150+ for something that I was unsure if it would work, so after doing some research on Amazon and other sites, I ended up buying the NutraSonic.</li>
            <li> Well, the new clarsonic is now broken again.  </li>
            <li> I hope they feel their poor customer service is worth the loss of sales and negative reviews they will be receiving from me and others.</li>
            <li> they are just average cleaners and not worth the extra mark up for the small bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve seen other reviews stating this product breaks down after a month or so.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as well made, and may have a few less bells and whistles, but If you insist on getting one of these, you may as well save yourself a few bucks and get the cheaper one because I think you will still get the same results in the end.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the brushes are hard to switch.</li>
            <li> It cost me an additional $8 to ship it back for warranty (since it was too late to go through amazon), which I doubt I will be reimbursed for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced any battery issues thus far.</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s get down to how they worked...</li>
            <li> However, I used the Nutra Sonic in the shower and with my face down to the sink since the power of it sometimes splashed water droplets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For results, the Nutra Sonic won for me hands down.     </li>
            <li> It has helped, along with a few other products, to reduce lines on my face.  </li>
            <li> and it still had less sonic power.</li>
            <li> Anyway,I would not recommend this product nor would I recommend buying from Beauty and Accessories for Less.  </li>
            <li> I have serious facial skin problems as a result of autoimmune disorders.  </li>
            <li> I just think $80 is a bit steep for something that needs to be thrown away less than 7 days after receipt.</li>
            <li> and it worked for less than a month.  </li>
            <li> About two weeks into owning it, it started turning on randomly (in the middle of the night!!), and the only way to get it to shut off was to put it on the charging cradle.  </li>
            <li> looks less wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> After less than one year it stopped charging, and I&#x27;ll have to throw it away.</li>
            <li> However, after less than two weeks it quit working.  </li>
            <li> It quit turning on after about a month and a half of use, using it a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> and I was noticing a slight difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Worked half way from the beginning.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, and the day it fails out on me</li>
            <li> Again, that&#x27;s just from me being in the biz for a few years that I know that odd fact.</li>
            <li> little help, Amazon?</li>
            <li> no matter how little cleanser or water I used.  </li>
            <li> &quot; and there is little I can add to that .</li>
            <li> Dermatologists exfoliate for a reason: removing the outer layer of dead skin rejuvenates your skin and prevents clogged pores which lead to acne.</li>
            <li> THE BATTERY HAS BEEN LASTING APPROXIMATELY 10-12 DAYS WITH TWICE A DAY CLEANSING.  </li>
            <li> Once I plugged the adapter into the base for recharging, and the light would not come on.  </li>
            <li> While it is rather messy if you are washing your face over the sink</li>
            <li> The Nutra Sonic stopped working a few months after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Dead.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t purchase the Nutra Sonic Face and Body cleansing system yet you are missing out.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before I bought this product and was nervous about a few things.</li>
            <li> After a few month&#x27;s use, it will not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I also heard feedback that if you had any problems with it that resolution was difficult unless you had bought directly from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> At any rate I notice that with the few breakouts I have managed to get nowadays</li>
            <li> The retailer, Beauty and Accesssories  for Less won&#x27;t replace it because it past 30 days.  </li>
            <li> Actually, they solved a lot of what other reviews said was wrong.</li>
            <li> then, slowly, it held less and less of a charge.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was within the time frame provided, but did seem rather slow compared to other items I&#x27;ve bought on amazon.</li>
            <li> This Nutra Sonic System has the same features and one additional brush as the Clarisonic Plus system which sells for $225 and replacement brushes are less expensive.</li>
            <li> I am also aware that some purchasers may have a bad reaction to a product.  </li>
            <li> The second unit took a little longer to stop working, but fail it did.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing I would say about this product is the crack down the side collects mold after a while, because you can never truly dry the crack.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately It quickly stopped working one day while emitting a horrible, shrill, screeching noise that would only stopped if I hit it hard and then carefully set it down.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived broken--it wouldn&#x27;t connect properly to charge, had no instruction booklet, reeked of cigarette smoke, and was overall bad.  </li>
            <li> Usually I find everything cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li> the service I receive usually from them -</li>
            <li> I started getting breakouts, which usually cleared up in a day or two.  </li>
            <li> Keeping the unit plugged in will overcharge, and possibly shorten the battery life, which may be why some systems have failed.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure what happened with that</li>
            <li> (ps  I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews, but I just had to with this product)</li>
            <li> My face just feels cleaner when I use it in comparison to the days when I feel too lazy to do it.  </li>
            <li> and you are going to lose my future business over a lousy FACE CLEANSING DEVICE.</li>
            <li> BUT, after only about two months of use, the unit has become \\&quot;possessed\\&quot; in that it will come on randomly while not in use, it will sputter, and now will no longer change speeds.  </li>
            <li> I got very frustrated and filled out a return order.</li>
            <li> In hindsight, I would&#x27;ve gone with the clairesonic Mia which allegedly is gentler on your skin and not much more expensive.</li>
            <li> did have a hard time getting it to start charging</li>
            <li> It was so bad and made me so self conscious.</li>
            <li> is confusing.  </li>
            <li> I thought well it finally bit the dust, but alas the body was seated facing the wrong direction.</li>
            <li> and you will have to charged for at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li> In the least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine at least a year</li>
            <li> I thought that the switch might have broken, and that the batteries were dead; so the unit could run when set on the charger cradle.</li>
            <li> After washing my face, the face brush usually turns brown!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after less than a month of use it stopped working.</li>
            <li> The brushes are less expensive as well.</li>
            <li> By next morning i had a bad brake up that i had not seen in years.  </li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong the battery this time, it would start, but within a few seconds it would stop.  </li>
            <li> It started to give me trouble the day after the 30 day return window was up and now, 6 weeks later is useless. :(  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t realize how bad it was until AFTER the one year warranty expired, naturally.</li>
            <li> I think mine was defective, because it was so weak &amp; didn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> and I guess am back on the hunt for a quality home micro-dermabrasion product. :(</li>
            <li> The Cheapest Clarisonic system I would have puchased was approximately $168.00.  </li>
            <li> The Nutri Sonic was approximately $84.00.  </li>
            <li> However, approximately, 2 months after I purchased my NutraSonic, it stopped charging.</li>
            <li> It even started making a noise the last time I put it in the base.</li>
            <li> Why does Amazon sell items that get poor reviews?</li>
            <li> Quality seemed poor with the charging station.</li>
            <li> I contacted the manufacture and they basically told me I cannot return the broken item.</li>
            <li> I have followed the care and charging directions to the letter, and am highly disappointed given the amount of money spent.  </li>
            <li> I felt so bad about disappointing her that I splurged and purchased the Clarisonic Pro as a replacement (she won&#x27;t actually get it until Christmas Day, so</li>
            <li> For the price and dramatic results I will never go without this again.</li>
            <li> You would think it is in the right direction because you plug in the adapter facing forward but the base was in the wrong direction, yes the body can sit on the base in the wrong direction.  </li>
            <li> A friend kept encouraging me to buy the expensive competitor to this product, but I just couldn&#x27;t rationalize the $200+ price tag.  </li>
            <li> I could not understand why some reviewers stated their system failed within five months.  </li>
            <li> there was something else wrong with the unit.</li>
            <li> However, it would start to turn on by itself randomly and now will no longer take a charge at all.</li>
            <li> No turning off at random.</li>
            <li> Then, the power button became difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Terrible product, mine only lasted 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> was \\&quot;sorry, we don&#x27;t sell just the chargers\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> My husband had bought a Milwaukee drill and when the charger failed to work, they AUTOMATICALLY sent him a replacement.</li>
            <li> Sorry to hear others have had issues.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to see if company stands behind this expensive piece of junk !</li>
            <li> But the bad part is that brush lost power and my attempts to re-charge it (a couple hours charge at a time) mostly failed.</li>
            <li> I must like living dangerously.</li>
            <li> Nutraluxe, sort your Nutrasonic batteries out and honour your commitments to your customers when batteries fail!</li>
            <li> Very frustrating and disappointing!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as opposed to the very expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m in the shower and trying to go to the body brush from the face brush, the brush gets slippery and almost impossible to switch.</li>
            <li> I wish I had heeded the bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;both come with charging base</li>
            <li> so I think the base still worked</li>
            <li> I was shocked OMG BECKY!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with it and would not recommend anyone buy this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible product Stopped working after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am really disgusted with this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible shopping place, inferior knock offs and no warranty.</li>

            <li> A friend kept encouraging me to buy the expensive competitor to this product, but I just couldn&#x27;t rationalize the $200+ price tag.  Then I found the Nutra Sonic.  It is so reasonably priced at less than $100 for the entire system, I figured it was worth a try.      My skin looks the best it&#x27;s ever looked in 40 years.  It has really smoothed out the fine lines, age spots, and dry patches.  I used to have pores the size of Texas....now they are smaller than they&#x27;ve ever been!      I really love the Nutra Sonic.  And the battery life lasts a good 10 days, so it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of up-keep, either.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I love the way it makes the skin feel after you use it. Great product, I would give it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I wrote a very positive review of this face brush a few months ago, but had to replace the first unit when it failed after two weeks.  The second unit took a little longer to stop working, but fail it did.  Two duds out of two is enough and I will have to seek an alternative product elsewhere.</li>
            <li> If I am going to spend $100 or more on an item, I do a lot of research and I also ask anyone I know if they have the item so I can try it out. I did that here as well. I should start by saying that meant that I had to buy new brushes since I borrowed the Clarisonic from my mom and the Nutra Sonic from one of my friends and it wouldn&#x27;t be a good thing to use their face brushes in addition to the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost of replacement brushes:&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic (hereafter referred to as \\&quot;C\\&quot;) $25 on most sites but this varies with sales&lt;br /&gt;Nutra Sonic (hereafter referred to as \\&quot;N\\&quot;)$15 on most sites but this varies with sales&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of switching out brushes:&lt;br /&gt;C: Easy&lt;br /&gt;N: Not hard, but more difficult than the Clarisonic in comparison&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why you want a sonic cleaner to begin with it: Sonic wave technology has long been proven as far more than a gimmick, though it may sound that way at first. Sonic wavelength technology is made up of tiny vibrations that allow you to loosen dirt you could not otherwise. This is why they are used in professional toothbrushes and in the jewelry cleaner machines your jeweler uses. I own both of those items too and I can tell you there is an ENORMOUS difference from that and simply a vibrating sonic-wannabe of either. For your face this means it cleans your pores 6 times better than you can via simply washing, reducing breakouts but also helping take away loose skin on the surface you can&#x27;t see which clogs pores and dulls skin and renewing skin reduces wrinkles. Having worked in the cosmetic biz myself, I&#x27;m well aware of that truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#x27;s get down to how they worked...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I used one for one week on one side of my face, twice per day and the other on the other side of my face twice per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonic Power:&lt;br /&gt;C 300 rotations per second&lt;br /&gt;N 400 rotations per second&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nutra Sonic was obviously stronger but I didn&#x27;t measure these rotations on my own...no way could I count that fast. The manufacturers provided these details, both to me and in their advertised specs. This is both a good and bad thing. First, it felt like the Clarisonic only had vibration in the middle part of the brush, not all over, which didn&#x27;t make much sense to me, but suffice it to say it was just lighter on the power, Nutra Sonic truly felt like it had more power...however, that also meant there was a bit more splatter. I could use the Clarisonic standing up, facing the mirror, with no splatter. However, I used the Nutra Sonic in the shower and with my face down to the sink since the power of it sometimes splashed water droplets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, both of these models are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel:&lt;br /&gt;C Felt a bit heavier, maybe because it has heavier parts or because it has a built-in timer whereas the Nutra Sonic does not.&lt;br /&gt;N Lighter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I should add....&lt;br /&gt;Timer:&lt;br /&gt;C Built in timer so you don&#x27;t use it on any part of your face longer than a minute&lt;br /&gt;N No built in timer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speeds:&lt;br /&gt;C 1 speed, soft. Manufacturer says it&#x27;s made for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;N 4 speeds: sensitive, normal, and body brush&lt;br /&gt;(incidentally, there is a Clarisonic that has more speeds as well but it was, at the time of this review, $200 more than the Nutra Sonic that does the same thing and it still had less sonic power. That&#x27;s the Clarisonic Pro. I&#x27;m not writing about this though, because I didn&#x27;t try it due to the price and already knowing the power wasn&#x27;t as good as the Nutra Sonic going in.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;brushes included:&lt;br /&gt;C: 1 brush&lt;br /&gt;N: 3 brush heads for each speed...if your skin is very sensitive, there is a softer brush, if you want greater exfoliation, use the harder brush at normal speed, or soften feet and elbows in the shower with the body brush on high speed. Incidentally, if I have bad breakouts I do sometimes use the high speed on my face to really exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jitter Mode:&lt;br /&gt;C: Has no Jitter Mode setting in addition to speeds&lt;br /&gt;N: Has a jitter mode setting so you can use exfoliation cleansers and pretty much get a pro exfoliation. I prefer Mary Kay&#x27;s exfoliation cleanser because they are one of the few that uses the exact same exfoliates as dermatologists use...rather than ground peach pits or apricot pits that actually put tiny tears in your skin. Again, that&#x27;s just from me being in the biz for a few years that I know that odd fact. Olay has a good one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;both come with charging base&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;C: High&lt;br /&gt;N: Low in comparison, but nothing with decent sonic wavelength tech is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that price varies greatly both on Amazon and the internet. Do compare shipping charges as well. Usually I find everything cheaper on Amazon but in this case, for me, Amazon had a link ad on the Nutra Derm page that linked to an outside website that had the Nutra Sonic less and with free shipping so do explore around as sometimes it&#x27;s cheaper in one place and sometimes another, or sometimes it&#x27;s cheaper on one but the seller jacks up the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleansers:&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, skip the upsell for the cleansers of both models if you have the option and just buy whatever brand you like...they are just average cleaners and not worth the extra mark up for the small bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line...Cleaning&lt;br /&gt;C: Did a far better job of cleaning than a regular scrubbing with a wash cloth and cleanser, reduced breakouts and smooth feel&lt;br /&gt;N: I expected to like the Clarisonic better, I&#x27;ll be honest, because in spite of the fact I knew Nutra Sonic had more power, Clarisonic was pricier. You don&#x27;t always get what you pay for. Sometimes you simply pay for marketing. The pores on the left side of my face where I used the Nutra Sonic were MORE reduced, and my skin was smoother. I can&#x27;t say I saw a wonderful reduction in wrinkles on either side but it may also be too soon to measure that claim by both brands. I loved the exfoliation mode on the Nutra Sonic and, in all honesty, the speed difference was VERY important to me. Dermatologists exfoliate for a reason: removing the outer layer of dead skin rejuvenates your skin and prevents clogged pores which lead to acne. The soft pulse of the Clarisonic simply didn&#x27;t do this as much, although I did like it better than a wash cloth. For results, the Nutra Sonic won for me hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warranty:&lt;br /&gt;C: 1 year but ONLY if your purchase stems from the Clarisonic website. (But the price was far higher on their website when I looked than most other sellers of it.)&lt;br /&gt;N: 1 year regardless of where you buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: If you want to use the sonic cleaner looking into a mirror and never in the shower and you have very sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t need a deeper clean, the Clarisonic would make you happy. It does clean well. However, if you don&#x27;t mind looking down near the sink to prevent some random water drops that Nutra Sonic sometimes slings with the greater vibrations, or you want to use it in the shower, or you want to exfoliate or have normal skin that sometimes needs a greater scrubbing (although you can still go with gentle too), I&#x27;d choose the Nutra Sonic. Also if you want to use it on your body, the Nutra Sonic works with the intense clean and body brush whereas you can&#x27;t do this with the Clarisonic. The Nutra Sonic, however, does not have the built-in timer to tell you when you&#x27;ve been on a part of your face for a minute and should move on but, for me, for the cost savings, I can wing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thanked my Sonic cleanser lenders and still remain VERY happy with the Nutra Sonic. Plus now the right side of my face has caught up with the left and is equally as smooth and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this daily since my review and all these 7 months later I like it even more...works great, no issues. And my mom now has a Nutrasonic too! Ha! Plus, I have not yet had to buy ANY new brushes...they totally holdup and it has a better warranty than the Clarisonic anyway so should I have an issue...I will report back in and exchange it as well...thus far, my makeup is even better and smoother due to no more dead surface skin. I still like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve had the Nutrasonic for a year now. Still have smooth skin, still works great.

            <li> Love this thing. Have had it 2+ years and it is still going strong. The heads are not too expensive and the macine holds a GREAT charge.</li>
            <li> I found this product easy to use and very quick in cleansing my face.  Skin feels clearer and smoother.  This product does a better job than my manual face cleaning and I feel I have good value for money and would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my NutraSonic for almost a year and really enjoy the deep cleaning and exfoliation it provides. I have fairly sensitive skin and did reduce from daily use after the first week as it seemed to make my face blotchy and break small veins. Now I&#x27;m a happy camper using in the shower once or twice per week for face and body.  I&#x27;ve not experienced any battery issues thus far. I do tend to keep it out of the charger most of the time. It only goes back in it&#x27;s charging cradle about once every other month or so.</li>
            <li> Nutra Sonic works well, when it works.  I ordered is on 12/10/11 and it stopped working 1/21/11.  The retailer, Beauty and Accesssories  for Less won&#x27;t replace it because it past 30 days.  When you take into account shipping time, I don&#x27;t beleive I have even had it for 30 days.  Regardless, now I have to deal with Nutra Sonic in an attempt to get a replacement.  So far, Beauty and Accessories for Less has been LESS then helpful. I asked for warrenty contact information and they responded the information was in the box.  If I had the box I wouldn&#x27;t be asking for the information.  Anyway,I would not recommend this product nor would I recommend buying from Beauty and Accessories for Less.  If I had purchased this product from Amazon directly this would not be an issues.  The warning here is don&#x27;t purchase anything from Amazon unless they are the vendor.  I will let you know how this saga turns out.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  Bought this as a cheaper alternative to the Clarisonic but item was faulty and would not charge.  I returned it for a refund, not interested in a replacement.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with great anticipation.  The first unit I received worked for about a week, then as with many others who left feedback, the unit just refused to work, even after putting it on the charger for 24 hours.  I really loved it when it worked, therefore I ordered a replacement unit instead of a refund.  What were the chances I would get a 2nd defective item?  Well, within a few weeks the second unit stopped running.  There was nothing wrong the battery this time, it would start, but within a few seconds it would stop.  I gave up and got a refund.  I ordered a Mia.  For a little more money, I got less headaches and a product that works!!</li>
            <li> I received the Nutra Sonic for Christmas.  It seemed to clean my face well though I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin.  Unfortunately after less than a month of use it stopped working. It is supposed to be waterproof but water got inside and must&#x27;ve shorted it out.  I never immersed it, but I did use it in the shower. I got it from Costco (better price) and thankfully will be easy to return.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after reading several reviews about it and the Clarisonic. I know the Clarisonic is great and even know folks who work there, but I decided to give this a try since it was less expensive.     So far I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It does a very good job of gently cleaning my face. It does a good job of exfoliation without being too irritating to my skin.     The battery actually lasts longer without needing to be recharged than what the manual indicates.     The actual plastic housing/casing doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good a quality as with the Clarisonic, but so far it&#x27;s been holding up well. I&#x27;ve used it in the shower and in cleaning up at the sink. It works well in both conditions.</li>
            <li> I cannot afford the Clarisonic brush my aesthetician recommended, so I did some research and found this product. Bought it about 3 weeks ago and I cannot get enough of it!! Nowadays I am actually excited to wash my face or take showers! I am praying mine doesn&#x27;t stop working like it happened to other reviewers because if it does I&#x27;ll freak out. I have become addicted to how good my skin looks after using this brush because:    1) After washing my face, the face brush usually turns brown! Yes! I can see the dirt on the face brush!   2) My skin (face and body) feels soooo soft after brushing!   3) I have kelatosis pilaris on my arms and since I started using this brush, I have soft, wayyyy less bumpy skin!   4) I have large pores and blackheads are my chronic headache, but since I started using this brush my pores are a lot cleaner/smaller and blackheads have almost completely dissapeared!     So, based on how many exclamation marks I included in this review, it should come as no surprise that I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have serious facial skin problems as a result of autoimmune disorders.  I constantly have the orangey patches and freckle-looking things and I have a very large brown patch of rough, wrinkled skin, the size of a quarter on my cheekbone just below my left eye. I have very oily skin,tons of blackheads, and HUGE pores.  The very first use, today, I have ZERO blackheads! My face is clearer and brighter and tons of the melasma is gone.  The big brown patch is much thinner, some places I can actually see the skin through it!  I am incredibly happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this product 5 months ago and have loved having it however it just stopped working. I wrote to facemedix through Amazon and have gotten no response and there is no phone number or other way to get a hold of them. I just dug out my original receipt and called the manufacturer- Nutra Luxe MD- they are willing to replace it. We are sending it into them today. They assure a prompt turnaround.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that my NutraSonic would be one of the few that actually worked, but - no.  Five weeks after I began using it, it stopped working.  I have a steady red light but no action.  UPDATE 7/28/12:  I returned it for an exchange.  The second one worked for four months and then it stopped.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> While I tried both and this works just as well. It started to give me trouble the day after the 30 day return window was up and now, 6 weeks later is useless. :(  I loved it, but it is not worth it if it going to quit and Amazon won&#x27;t honor a basic 90 day window. I thought they would and should have read more closely.  I understand the 30 policy, just thought with it dying completely and the service I receive usually from them - this made the most sense. Next time - I am going to Costco.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I first used the Nutrasonic.  My skin felt really clean!  However, within 3 months it stopped working and I returned it to Nutrasonic.  They claimed that the \\&quot;old model\\&quot; had problems and they sent me the newer version (with my old charger).  Now, after about 3 more months, the newer version has the same problem.  When I charged it, it doesn&#x27;t start...then starts on it&#x27;s own when I am not in the room.  I am very disappointed with it and would not recommend anyone buy this product.</li>
            <li> Worked for nearly one week and then started shutting off in the middle of being used.  Needs recharged, you say?  No.  Left it on the charger overnight and made no difference (and yes, I read the instructions of how it was to be charged in the cradle backwards).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the 7 days it worked, it worked great.....I just think $80 is a bit steep for something that needs to be thrown away less than 7 days after receipt. Returned it to Amazon right away and was promptly offered a refund without any questions or hassles (my first return I&#x27;ve ever had to do with Amazon after 10+ years of doing business).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re interested in a sonic facial cleanser, would probably be worth spending the big bucks on the real thing.  Would caution you to only order directly thru Amazon and not a third party seller; your refund experience might not be as satisfactory as mine.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews comparing this to the Clarisonic and decided to try.  I wish I had heeded the bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my daughter for Christmas and it worked for less than a month.  About two weeks into owning it, it started turning on randomly (in the middle of the night!!), and the only way to get it to shut off was to put it on the charging cradle.  Since absolutely NO material as far as instructions or warranty came with the product, we wondered if that was what it did when the battery was going low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it simply stopped working.  I had hoped that it simply needed a good charge, but unfortunately it is simply dead.  I clearly received a defective unit, and so far the seller has not responded to my email.  If they do, I will amend this review.  If not, I will be filing a claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since bought my daughter a Clarisonic Mia, which actually came with instructions and warranty information!</li>
            <li> Horrible product Stopped working after 2 weeks. Just stopped charging. Did not take it in the shower, as other customers did.</li>
            <li> I first got a Mio 2 as a gift and loved it, but the replacement heads and facial cleanser were VERY EXPENSIVE. I bought this sonic cleanser from the site for $159. Came with sensative, normal, and body heads, 4 different occilations(not just speeds, but the WAY the brush turns and vibrates), a cleanser and toner and a carry case as well as the base/cahrger unit. I let it charge for 24 hours before trying it so I could see it&#x27;s full potential. I was very pleasantly surprised that it felt very relaxing/comfortable and took no time at all. My face felt tight and very youthful for 2 days after cleansing. I used all 4 settings when cleaning the first time to test them. My favorite is the 3rd setting where the inner and outer heads occilate in opposite directions. :) I do recommend this. It has worked just as well as the Clarisonic Mia 2 I had, but will cost 1/4 the price to replace heads and buy cleanser. I am very happy with this brush!</li>
            <li> I really like this product for skin cleansing.  I have not tested Clarisonic, Oil of Olay, or any other cleansing system, but them for a comparison. My normal routine was using a facial scrub pad with a liquid facial soap, (Clinique&#x27;s Wash Away Gel)followed by several cotton balls of toner, Oil of Olay Regenerist Serum,then moisturizer.  My skin type is oily/normal.  I wear makeup, but do go bareskinned regularly. I also use an eye cream, and an exfoliator  St. Ives Elements Microdermabrasion twice a week.  I believed I was doing a good job cleansing my face by the residue from the toner cotton ball, which was used until the ball showed no residue.  My face also felt very clean.  My breakouts were minimal, and usually due to monthly hormone changes.  Being a frugal person, but also wanting a bang for my buck I researched the Clarisonic, and the Nutrisonic systems.  I omitted the Oil of Olay cleansing system, simply because the brush simply rotates on your face, basically what I was doing the the facial scrub pad.  So for the rest of this review I will only compare the Clarisonic vs Nutrisonic systems.    Both systems use a pulse action versus just spinning on your face, which I really liked.  If you have sensitive, or irritated skin this is the way to go.    Both systems were waterproof, for shower use, which I also liked, and had a charging cradle.  The Nutrisonic has four speeds:    1. Sensitive Skin    2. Normal Skin    3. Jitterbug Mode (exfoliator)    4. Body Mode (all over skin)    The Clarisonic has a sound sensor included that sounds when you have been at one location too long so as not to damage the skin.  Nutrisonic does not have this feature.  I personally didn&#x27;t think this feature was essential, as the brush does all the work, all you do is make contact to your skin, then slowly move the cleaner over your skin. It may have been designed this way if you are giving someone a facial this seems to be the only benefit. The pulse action does all the work.  I especially like it for the nose area, and underneath the eyes.  As long as you don&#x27;t hold it in any position too long you shouldn&#x27;t have any worries, just use normal movements.  I have gone over face several times with no negative effect, just as I would with my scrub pad.    I really like the Jitterbug mode,(exfoliator) and use it almost exclusively.  I started out using the sensitive, immediately moved up to the normal which cleaned very nicely.  I am almost ashamed to write just how much dirt was on my face, but the cotton ball soaked in toner didn&#x27;t lie.  I had to use double my normal three (3) balls to get the residue off.  Ditto for my neck.  I was shocked OMG BECKY! I was amazed.  The next morning I used the Jitterbug mode, with the same effect.  I used the Jitterbug mode twice a day, until I got the dirt off of my face.  It is gentle enough for me to use twice daily with no ill effects as is advertised.    One thing I did notice was as I got my skin clean I started getting breakouts, which usually cleared up in a day or two.  So I guess I was getting the ground in dirt beneath the surface.    Another nice feature is the pulse action actually stimulates the face without irritation, which actually activates collagen cells to produce, alas the reduction of fine lines, and wrinkles.  Try that with a rotating brush.  The brush itself feels good in my hand, sturdy, and not likely to slip out, even when wet.    If you travel this could travel well, just make sure you either have it fully charged. or take the charging cradle along,(small enough) just make sure you have an electrical, or power outlet for use.    The body is molded rubber and is easy to grip    After one (1) week of use, my pores were much smaller, after two weeks, my mouth lines were less pronounced.  I took a photo of my face before using this system, and I can definitely see improvement. I have been using this system now for five weeks.    I have been using it on my elbows, and my feet. Changing thebrushes is very easy, one twist and pull apart, reverse action to install    Now for the negatives:    I am definitely using more of my beauty products than before.  I guess that I am using more now because they are actually being absorbed into my skin versus just sitting on top of dirty skin, which is the lesser of two evils.    The information/instruction pamphlet included regarding the red blinking light on the charging cradle is confusing.  The system is designed to have the light blink once you replace it in the cradle, it does not mean that the system needs charging.  The light will continue to blink as long as it is plugged in.  The remedy is to wait about five minutes, the reset in the cradle for the light to go steady, about the time it takes for me to tone, apply eye cream, facial serum, and beauty cream so its not a big deal. You can leave it blinking if you like. It does not adversely affect the system.  Some reviewers had a problem with the blinking light.  this is misinformation provided by the manufactuer.    This is a unisex system, not just for women, so it may wear out from getting more use (lol)    Bottom line:    The Cheapest Clarisonic system I would have puchased was approximately $168.00.  The Nutri Sonic was approximately $84.00.  My kind of price.  Why pay more for less, just because of the brand name.  You do the math.    I have not used the cleansing products provided in the kit, still using my old routine, but what a difference in the texture, fine lines, and firmness with my old products.  That is another way I can see improvement.    I am aware that this system does not have as many reviews as the Clarisonic, but I am also aware that many purchasers do not take the time to write a review.  I am one of those people.  I am also aware that the negative reviews are smaller than the positive.  This lets me know that a company in business, and also selling product on amazon is probably selling in the gazillions, so I usually do not let smallamounts of negatives deter me in my decision.  I usually go to the most negative reviews,(one star) then work my way up to the five stars.  It is an indicator of the quality of the product by the number of the good reviews, and I always use this as my guide.  I am also aware that some purchasers may have a bad reaction to a product.  Some say they had no effect, which is typical of the general population on any product.    So much for writing a review.  I do not have stock, or a vested interest, or affiliation with the company, or this product.  I am simply a woman who has baby bottom soft skin, and much improved appearance, and wanted to give kudos for a good product.  I wrote this, and I approve of this message.    UPDATE OF REVIEW:  January 22, 2012    In my review I stated that the blinking light on the charging system would stop blinking in about ten minutes if lifted, and reset on charging cradle.  This has occurred for my system.  I could not understand why some reviewers stated their system failed within five months.  I finally realized that the system has a charging unit, and not just an electrical plug.  The system should be fully charged as stated in the manual, then unplugged either by the adapter, or the electrical cord.  Keeping the unit plugged in will overcharge, and possibly shorten the battery life, which may be why some systems have failed.  I have been trying this method for about 4 weeks now with no adverse effects.  What occurs when the battery is low is it will stop.  It will turn back on immediately.  I used my system four more times after this happened with the only thing being it would shut off more frequently after each use shutting off twice on the fourth use.  It would start up immediately.  I assume this is an indidcation to recharge the unit.     PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THE BATTERY SHOULD BE DISCHARGED, THEN RECHARGED.  THE BATTERY HAS BEEN LASTING APPROXIMATELY 10-12 DAYS WITH TWICE A DAY CLEANSING.  RECHARGE FOR 24 HOURS THEN UNPLUG UNIT.  ALSOIT CAN BE USED DURING THIS TIME.    We get used to keeping appliances frequently used plugged into an electrical outlet which may shorten it&#x27;s life.  I hope this information helps!    UPDATE OF REVIEW: 10/07/2014  This is an update of my original review.  My Nutrisonic facial cleansing system is still working.  It has been over 3 1/2 years since my purchase, and is functioning fine.  Once I plugged the adapter into the base for recharging, and the light would not come on.  I thought well it finally bit the dust, but alas the body was seated facing the wrong direction. You would think it is in the right direction because you plug in the adapter facing forward but the base was in the wrong direction, yes the body can sit on the base in the wrong direction.  I was surprised at how many bad reviews there were for this item.  I think this was a very good purchase, and would still give a five star rating.  I actually came here to purchase one for my 14 year old niece for Christmas.  I must like living dangerously.</li>
            <li> This product arrived broken--it wouldn&#x27;t connect properly to charge, had no instruction booklet, reeked of cigarette smoke, and was overall bad.  When I contacted the vendor, they told me to dispose of it as I saw fit (no need to return it) and they would refund my money.  My money was refunded promptly and into the trash the Nutra Sonic went.  Spend the extra money and buy a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve had it just about 3 weeks and was trying to wait a little longer to review, but I just love it. Ever since the Neutrogena Wave came out I have always wanted to try some sort of spinning face cleanser. It just seems to make sense, right?? Rather than rubbing a washcloth, having something that automatically spins and really cleans skin. I wanted to be able to add my own cleanser and use my own products though, so Neutrogena was out. Olay had many pros/cons but I wanted a rechargeable option and to have different sized brushes. Clarisonic was just way out of my price range so for $80 I wanted to try the Nutrasonic. While I do charge it almost every other night just to avoid having it die on me at random, I am on vacation now and haven&#x27;t charged it for 3 days and still going strong. I&#x27;ve heard they&#x27;ll go about 5 days or so without a charge. While it is rather messy if you are washing your face over the sink [splatters everywhere!] it&#x27;s perfect for in the shower. Recently I&#x27;ve begun using it with no product to just remove the makeup from my face, and you can see the makeup on the brush, then putting face wash on and using it again and the makeup is all gone. My face is soooo smooth afterwards and the redness in my skin is fading away. It just FEELS so much cleaner, and when I dry my face there is no sign of makeup at all. I really love the Nutrasonic because I just feel like it is tons better than a washcloth or just using hands, my skin really does feel tighter and cleaner. I highly recommend this product, and the day it fails out on me I&#x27;ll be back to update. Here&#x27;s hoping that&#x27;s not for a long, long time though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE JUNE 26, 2013: STILL love it! My skin always feels so soft and clean. I have used the Nutrasonic nearly every day for the last 2 years and it&#x27;s still running strong! I am always bragging about it to my friends and family when I get compliments on my skin and I rarely ever break out. Only down side at this point is I can&#x27;t figureout a great way to clean the handle that has some makeup stains on it. But I still use it and love it and I&#x27;m so glad I found it and that it&#x27;s lasted me as long as it has... and hopefully much longer!</li>
            <li> I have been using my Nutra Sonic for just a little over a month now, once daily in the evenings after a shower and brushing the teeth.  I have not tried it with the products included, they smell great and lemony fresh, but I am an Olay lady so that is where my loyalty lies, in terms of the product used with the Nutra Sonic  It takes 12 hours to charge.......really my only down point, I wanted to plug it in and scrub my face immediatly, but girls it&#x27;s worth the wait.....You will see and feel a real change.....dont forget vitamins, suppliments and water water water for great skin as well.  Overall, affordable, solid construction and a great gift......for yourself!! :)</li>
            <li> The first package sent me was missing the charging cord.   Amazon was prompt in sending me a second package   and emailing me  a return label for the first.  I used my Nutra Sonic for the first time and was pleasantly surprised at how well it cleans  and does a microdermabrasion and yet is still very gentle.  I&#x27;m 60 with drier skin and was hoping over time it would help even out   my complexion and help diminish wrinkles.  I have now used it for a month ~ three times a week.   My skin is softer, cleaner, looks more even toned and   looks less wrinkled.  Kudo&#x27;s to Nutra Sonic and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the NutraSonic for about a month, and I like it.  I debated buying this, because I have some manual pads for years that I never used, but kept meaning to.  Buying this was enough of a incentive to actually use it daily.  I have combination skin.  While the oiliness has not been reduced, the dry flakes are now minimal.  I had hoped the NutraSonic would have reduced my pore size more than it has, but there has been some improvement.  Maybe with continued use there will be more.    My face cream seems to absorb better now.</li>
            <li> The product was wonderful.  In about a week my skin looked amazing.  Then it stopped working.  Would not hold a charge.  Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay the big bucks for the top of the line brand so I decide to go with the NutraSonic. It really did help clear up my skin. But now about 5 months in it has stopped working. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be charging. So I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The Nutra Sonic stopped working a few months after I bought it. I had read a lot of other reviews that claimed that this happened, but I ignored the warnings. Do not make the same mistake I did. Even while it did function, I thought the brushes and vibrations were way too rough for my face (and i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin). I bought a clarisonic the week after it broke and the difference is amazing. Unfortunately the old saying proves true every time... You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> When I finally received it, I plugged it in to charge and would not take a charge.  Spoke to the company and they said they were having problems with them charging.  Sent it back.</li>
            <li> I think mine was defective, because it was so weak &amp; didn&#x27;t hold a charge. Maybe they are not all like that.</li>
            <li> We ordered this Nutra Sonic 1020 4 Speed on December 15, 2011. Received it on December 25, 2011. Fast enough handling, and shipping time considering we chose Super Saver method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product worked great. My wife saw, and felt a great improvement in her skin. It was smoother, and she feels that the pores on her nose, for example, got smaller over time. The first problem occurred around the end of February.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit stopped working, then it would start charging for a period and run without turning the unit on. Pressing the power buttons would not stop the unit from running. When I would take the unit off of the charger it would stop. I asked my wife if she submerged the unit, as I feared that it might have leaked. She said no as she only rinsed it as per the instructions. I thought that the switch might have broken, and that the batteries were dead; so the unit could run when set on the charger cradle. Since I feared that water might have gotten in, I told her we would let it sit for a couple days. After a couple days the unit started working again. Yippee!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks later the unit died again. This time the charger light would not come on when the unit was set on the cradle, so it seemed hopeless at this time. Dead. I decided to open it up to see what the rechargeable batteries looked like. Low and behold, there was water inside. There was also rust. Enough water that the ends of the battery pack which are shielded with some sort of brown material were saturated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye Bye unit, and bye bye money.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t purchase the Nutra Sonic Face and Body cleansing system yet you are missing out. This product is the best item I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time, matter of fact I bought three more for Christmas gifts. Since I have started using the system my skin looks and feels softer and brighter than ever before. My pores are smaller and more receptive to my face serums and creams. A must have!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first face cleansing brush of this type.  I bought it based on the reviews.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 days in a row and my face is already clearing up.  I don&#x27;t really have break outs but I have/had blackheads.  The exfoliating setting has done wonders.  I see a difference already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a hard time getting it to start charging and I&#x27;m not sure what happened with that but it started working so it was a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using on the tzone, specifically the nose area, whoa.  It tickled so much it made me sneeze :)  I&#x27;m getting used to it now.  I&#x27;m very please with my Nutra Sonic and glad I didn&#x27;t pay 200 more for another product!</li>
            <li> Following the good reviews of the product on Costco.com and Amazon, I cheaped out and bought this product instead of the Clarisonic brush. I wish I didn&#x27;t. It worked great WHILE IT WORKED. After less than one year it stopped charging, and I&#x27;ll have to throw it away. A complete waste of money. Now I&#x27;ll have to spend the $200+ for the Clarisonic on top of the money wasted on this product. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did, buy the right product from the beginning.</li>
            <li> Hi, all. Just wanted to write b/c I read all the reviews before I bought this product and was nervous about a few things. I&#x27;ve been using it 6 months and have had no problems. Actually, they solved a lot of what other reviews said was wrong. There was an instruction booklet with mine that clearly explained how to use, charge, etc. the product. Also, it&#x27;s never stopped working on me - despite being dropped in the shower several times. And, there is now a light on the charger that flashes when it&#x27;s charging and that&#x27;s solid when it&#x27;s done (details are explained in the instruction manual). Anyway, I am really enjoying this product, am soooo glad that I didn&#x27;t spend double on Clarisonic b/c I can&#x27;t imaging it working better than this brand.  Oh! And I forgot - I agree with some of the other reviews. This doesn&#x27;t make the wrinkles go away, but it a) gets my skin super clean and b) allows my products to absorb. I can really tell  a difference in that the products are not sitting on my skin anymore - they are being absorbed.   Anyway, good luck!</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and one for my daughter.  The one I kept works fine, but the one I gave to her has not worked from day one:  it refuses to hold a charge.  This was an early Christmas present.  I felt so bad about disappointing her that I splurged and purchased the Clarisonic Pro as a replacement (she won&#x27;t actually get it until Christmas Day, so let&#x27;s hope that one works!)  I can&#x27;t tell you whether or not the Nutra Sonic is worth over $80.00.  However, I&#x27;d say think twice about ordering, since there appears to be an inordinate amount of defective units.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this nutra sonic as a christmas present so I was really excited when I found one that wasn&#x27;t so expensive as the clarisonic and does exactly what the clarisonic does. NOT!!!! From the moment I received the brush, it never held a charge what so ever. I called the place that fulfilled it with amazon and no answer. I called Nutraluxe and they said sometimes it arrrives not charged and you will have to charged for at least 24 hours. Did that and nothing happen. I kept it for 2 weeks thinking something will finally happen, nothing. I finally returned to amazon for a full refund.  Please, please stay away!</li>
            <li> I got this product with the intention of helping my mild/moderate acne. The shipping was within the time frame provided, but did seem rather slow compared to other items I&#x27;ve bought on amazon. The first one I bought stopped charging after maybe a week, so I sent it back. It took maybe a week &amp; a half to two weeks for my new one to arrive, and I will admit that I noticed an increase in breakouts again. It is pretty fun to use, and it makes my skin feel very soft. However, it does seem to splatter a fair amount when you use it at the sink if you care about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I just had to send my SECOND unit back because the power button stopped working.  It cost me an additional $8 to ship it back for warranty (since it was too late to go through amazon), which I doubt I will be reimbursed for.  I am starting to wonder if I should have spent more money on the Clarisonic.  So far, the customer service has been adequate.</li>
            <li> I considered several products before selecting the Nutra Sonic Face &amp; Body Brush System.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.  It&#x27;s an excellent product, well-made, waterproof, and reasonably priced compared to the Clarisonic.  I use mine in the shower and love it!  Does a great job exfoliating; leaves skin smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This brush worked well for more than 2 years of regular use.  However, after being packed away (temperature controlled storage room) for a year, the plastic discolored and the buttons dissolved/fell apart and was no longer useable.  Be careful how you store it.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this product is simply amazing. Every single woman on the planet should have it. It is better than the rest on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought the NutraSonic in November 2011 because my dermatologist recommended a Clarisonic. I was weary of spending $150+ for something that I was unsure if it would work, so after doing some research on Amazon and other sites, I ended up buying the NutraSonic. It appeared to work just as well as the Clarisonic, but at a fraction of the price. Once I received and started using my NutraSonic, I loved it! It cleared up my skin, and made it feel very smooth and clean. However, approximately, 2 months after I purchased my NutraSonic, it stopped charging. I called NutraSonic. They told me to send it back to them (on my dime), and they would see what they could do. After about 2 weeks, I received a package from NutraSonic. They told me the problem was in the handle, and they had replaced it. Great!  However, about a month later, I had the same problem. This time NutraSonic sent me a prepaid shipping label to send it back to them. When they returned it to me about 2 weeks later, they said that the problem was in the handle and it had been replaced. However, less than a month later, it stopped charging again. I contacted NutraSonic again. I told them my story, and informed them that they a) kept replacing my unit with another defective unit; b) were not replacing my unit as they said they were; or c) there was something else wrong with the unit. I told them that I would not keep sending my NutraSonic back to them every 1-2 months because of their defective product. I asked for an entirely new replacement unit, and they refused. I am now going to purchase a Clarisonic system at Nordstrom, where I know they will take it back if it ever stops working. All in all, the produce is great while it works, but not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years regularly, and it has worked perfectly since day 1. The only bad thing I would say about this product is the crack down the side collects mold after a while, because you can never truly dry the crack. Better product design would solve this problem.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely fallen in love with this cleansing brush.  I cannot say enough good things about it.  I already used a buff puff on my face when cleansing, so wasn&#x27;t sure I really needed this.  I am so glad I purchased it!  I have sensitive skin and tend to over-exfoliate as well as use product that causes me to really break out.  I do much better with this brush and it leaves my face shining healthy.  It has helped, along with a few other products, to reduce lines on my face.  There is no comparison to a regular toothbrush and an electric toothbrush in efficiency and results, and the same goes for handwashing with anything vs using the Nutra Sonic.  It is powerful enough for your body as well.  Don&#x27;t hesitate, you will love it, I promise.  (ps  I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews, but I just had to with this product)</li>
            <li> Love this product, does just what it says...Don&#x27;t pay a premium for the name brand, this one does exactly the same thing for a fraction of the cost. I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Sonic for about 8 months now and I can definitely tell the difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  My face just feels cleaner when I use it in comparison to the days when I feel too lazy to do it.  At first it was a pain to spend the extra minute or two to use it, but now it&#x27;s just a ritual.  Unless I&#x27;m using an exfoliating cleanser that day, I&#x27;m using this.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my daughter and we were so excited about how it made her face feel after just a few uses.  Unfortunately It quickly stopped working one day while emitting a horrible, shrill, screeching noise that would only stopped if I hit it hard and then carefully set it down.  We are so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Only lasted about one month.  Recharged it once.  Now when I try to recharge it, the light does not even come on. I paid over $80.00 for a piece of junk!!!</li>
            <li> I loved the brush.  My skin was smooth and lovely.  However, after less than two weeks it quit working.  It worked in this morning, but tonight, nada.  Many reviewers made this comment.  I should have listened.</li>
            <li> Remember the brush faces the power cord when it is charging.  Design is not intuitive.  I thought it was defective then realized I had it on the charger backwards. Pictures show it in the holder brush facing out but that&#x27;s not the charging position.  I think they should make that more clear on the base.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this item until it stopped working. I followed the charging instructions exactly and let it run down completely between charging. After a few month&#x27;s use, it will not hold a charge. It even started making a noise the last time I put it in the base. This concerned me so I haven&#x27;t tried to charge it since. Sad, because when it worked, it worked great.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product ! VERY happy with it. Powerful and complete system for cleansing my face and body.</li>
            <li> Used it for exactly two months and now it won&#x27;t turn on at all! I followed the instructions about charging it and would only charge it every few days. After the first day of each charge, it would work great but then each day it would get weaker and weaker until I recharged it again. This time, though, when I took it out of the charger the light wasn&#x27;t on at all and when I tried turning it on, nothing! Very frustrating and disappointing! I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews. I really liked the idea, though, about the four speeds and face and body brushes that are interchangeable. I should have known it was too good to be true!! I&#x27;m going to let it sit for a day or so and then try it again...maybe it will magically turn on again but I doubt it. Why does Amazon sell items that get poor reviews?</li>
            <li> This product was working just fine, and I really enjoyed using it. However, it would start to turn on by itself randomly and now will no longer take a charge at all. It&#x27;s a shame that it was not made to last.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product as well as an excellent value.  My daughter&#x27;s dermatologist recommended getting an ultrasonic facial brush to help with exfoliation for the treatment of her acne. I did some research online and talked to a friend who owns one.  I was taken aback by the cost of the Clarisonic system at $225.  I also heard feedback that if you had any problems with it that resolution was difficult unless you had bought directly from Clarisonic. This Nutra Sonic System has the same features and one additional brush as the Clarisonic Plus system which sells for $225 and replacement brushes are less expensive. We are very pleased with the results of the brush and have recommended this product to the dermatologist as well as friends.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd. Nutra Sonic that I buy [the first one I had for 3 years] Great for the skin, easy to use. Contrary to its competitor it charges for a long haul. The &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; is limited to a # of minutes and then to charge again.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing as good as Nutra Sonic. I had recommended it to all my friends and to people that ask :&amp;#34;What do you use?&lt;br /&gt;Your skin is beautiful!!</li>
            <li> I started doing research on the clarasonic becuase it was recommended by a local dermatologist who has a radio show. She talks about the clarasonic all the time! So, when I saw the price difference, I thought it was worth giving the nutrasonic a try. Although I can&#x27;t compare, I can&#x27;t see how the clarasonic could be any better than this product. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the brushes are hard to switch. When I&#x27;m in the shower and trying to go to the body brush from the face brush, the brush gets slippery and almost impossible to switch. I found out that holding the brush with a washcloth works. The sonic vibrations are intense. I didn&#x27;t care for the cleanser, it seemed too drying. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product for cleaning, massaging and polishing face.  I bought the model that has scrubbing heads for body and works great on elbows, knees, etc.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleansing system!  I especially like the different speeds, and the wonderful (paraben free) cleanser and toner&lt;br /&gt;included in my kit!</li>
            <li> I too loved the product for the two months it worked.  There seems to be a problem with the charging station ceasing to charge.  Contacted the company who told me to send it back for a replacement. I shipped the charger back along with a copy of my original receipt from March 2011 and as of yet, I have not received a replacement.  Quality seemed poor with the charging station. Decent product when working.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a really good facial cleansing brush and I saw this one on amazon. I read the reviews about how for some people the brush just stopped working after a couple of months and I was like pshhh... what are the odds of that happening to me? This brush looks awesome and the good reviews are really good. So for my birthday I asked my husband to get me a face brush. I didn&#x27;t even give him a specific one and he got me this one. It did work really good......WHILE IT WORKED. I have not even had it for a year yet and it will not turn on anymore. I have charged it long enough for it to turn on and it does nothing. I contacted the manufacturer after asking amazon what to do. Well even though it was purchased off of amazon.com the dealer who sent it to me is an unauthorized dealer. So the manufacturer does not do a year warranty on the product. If you are set on buying this crappy product you should try and get the ones that are sent from amazon or straight from the real manufacturer cause there is a very good chance it will stop working within a couple of months. At least you will have warranty on it or amazon will be nice enough to give you a refund or something.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as opposed to the very expensive alternative. So far so good ( I have only used it for four days, so too soon to tell) but I can say that a bothersome dry patch that I had under my chin that was a source of both itching and flaking disappeared after my first use. It had been there for about two weeks despite my efforts to exfoliate with my olay regenerist and moisturize with my olay regenerist moisturizer. I then tried applying vaseline (much to my break out prone skin&#x27;s dismay) and still the patch persisted. So far I am a believer in this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:12/13/11&lt;br /&gt;I am a little over a week into using this item twice daily and although I am at the second week purging stage (which happened to line up with my time of the month) my skin is still in better shape than it normally would be around this time of the month. The pores on my forehead of gotten significantly smaller, and the preventative products that I smooth on my skin after cleansing literally soak in. My skin is noticeably softer. I will try and report back at one month of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:12/29/11&lt;br /&gt;So I am three weeks in to using this as part of my daily skin care regime and I have started to notice something else. I am only 21 but I have always had problem skin and have developed a habit of well-picking. At any rate I notice that with the few breakouts I have managed to get nowadays the recovery time is much reduced. I am going to contribute this to the improved circulation as a result of using this regularly, and not only that but the scars I have from years of acne breakouts are being dramatically reduced. It only cuts off on me when it needs a charge and I charge it once a week, I am also certain to wipe it down so that it does not remain wet past what it is when I wash my face with it.</li>
            <li> Purchased the nutrasonic brush system from Facemedix on amazon. It really helped reduce bumps, blackheads and clogged pores, but if I used it too long or often, it would leave a rash on my face and it&#x27;d start peeling.  I was going to try using the sensitive skin brush, for only short periods of time, to see if then i wouldnt get a rash, but it broke.  It quit turning on after about a month and a half of use, using it a couple times a week. Facemedix won&#x27;t take it back as they won&#x27;t make exchanges after 30 days even for a defective product. Thus I am trying to get a replacement from the manufacturer. Sounds like many people have recently had this same prob w the product. I had been using it in the shower.  In hindsight, I would&#x27;ve gone with the clairesonic Mia which allegedly is gentler on your skin and not much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have not tried a Clarisonic but have no desire after using the nutrisonic. Ive had it for a couple months and use it every day. It loses it&#x27;s power faster than when it was new but is good for about 5 days. For the price and dramatic results I will never go without this again. It&#x27;s more effective than weekly facials and definitely less costly.</li>
            <li> I bought my Nutra Sonic several years ago. Three maybe. Today, I pushed the button that changes the speed, and I pushed it right through the casing. It is now no longer waterproof. Which is no bueno. I would expect something like this to last far longer than the maybe 3 years that I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> Add me to the list of people who initially loved this product but then my brush just stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this January 2012, so it didn&#x27;t even last a full year.  It really did work well in the beginning.  It actually made the pores around my nose smaller.  It was amazing.  then, slowly, it held less and less of a charge.  Then one day, just wouldn&#x27;t charge at all.  I don&#x27;t think it is the base that is the problem because it would get a bit warm while the brush was in there, so I think the base still worked, it&#x27;s just the battery in the brush would no longer hold a charge.  They must use a cheap battery, hence the cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to buy, I would suggest going with another brand.  I might try to return if I can dig up my receipt.</li>
            <li> Below is my original review, when I gave it 5 stars. Editing to add: I love what this product does for my skin, but it does have issues holding a charge. I hope it lasts the 3 weeks that are left before my wedding, and I&#x27;ll be charging it after every use. Really a bummer. I may get a second one and hope for better battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m not usually into intense skin care, I got this brush to prep my skin for my wedding. After reading the reviews, I got the Nutra Sonic brush as opposed to the Clarisonic. When it arrived I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, but still charged it for 24 hours according to the instructions. After 24 hours, the indicator light did not show that it was fully charged (did not stop blinking), but I couldn&#x27;t wait to see what this product could do, so I went ahead and used it in the shower, for about 15 mins straight on the highest speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good part is that the skin on my face and arms hasn&#x27;t felt this smooth since I don&#x27;t know when. Amazingly smooth and soft. Love it. But the bad part is that brush lost power and my attempts to re-charge it (a couple hours charge at a time) mostly failed. It just refused to stay turned on. I got very frustrated and filled out a return order. In the meantime, I still had to prepare for my wedding and ordered the Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get a chance to ship the Nutra Sonic back right away, so I just left it in the charging station for a day or two. Eventually, the indicator light showed a full charge. I was curious to see if the brush would be able to keep its charge, and to my surprise, it did. No turning off at random. I guess I just hadn&#x27;t charged it long enough at the start, and a full 15 minutes of work totally drained the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I got the Clarisonic and... well, no soft velvety skin. It just doesn&#x27;t work as well as he Nutra Sonic for me. Maybe it&#x27;s too gentle, or too weak. Not sure what the problem is, but after a few days I realizedI won&#x27;t be returning the Nutra Sonic after all, and now I&#x27;m back to using it regularly. My skin looks and feels amazing. Just gotta keep the brush well charged.</li>
            <li> Okay so, THANK YOU, Amazon, for providing ZERO customer support for this product. I used it for a year, then it simply stopped working. And as long as it worked, it worked flawlessly. But now it sits and stares at me. Laughing. &amp;#34;Haha, you&#x27;re the dummy who bought me and now you have a half-dozen replacement brushes for a head unit. That doesn&#x27;t even work. After a year. So the joke&#x27;s on you, sir.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is there any user-friendly way to determine the WARRANTY on this product? No, of course not. Shame on you, Amazon. I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars with you over the years and you are going to lose my future business over a lousy FACE CLEANSING DEVICE. I. Am not. Amused. In the least. And in Amazon&#x27;s infinite wisdom, is there even a link on the company site to &amp;#34;file an appeal&amp;#34; or ask for some help? No. There is not. I just want a functioning unit, that is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little help, Amazon?</li>
            <li> I bought the Nutra Sonic and used it for about 1 month. It stopped working so I tried to call amazon and they said. Had to return it to the manufacture. I contacted the manufacture and they basically told me I cannot return the broken item.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve seen other reviews stating this product breaks down after a month or so. I&#x27;ve been using mine at least a year and it&#x27;s going strong. Now, when I went to Nordstrom&#x27;s they all raved about how wonderful the clarisonic is, but I just couldn&#x27;t afford it. So, I cannot comment on whether that product is good or not. Although it is made by the makers of sonicare toothbrush, which I absolutely love that product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the nutrasonic and it seems plenty powerful enough. Also, I have very sensitive skin and it does not irritate it, and I use the brush for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I would recommend this product. Maybe the clarisonic is better in some way, I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m happy with what I&#x27;ve got so I see no reason to change and spend a LOT more money.</li>
            <li> Was happy with the way it cleansed my skin, but the machine only lasted 4 months and then would not turn on, i was VERY dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Purchased in October.  Everything was fine for three months.  Then, the power button became difficult to use.  Finally, it quit all together.  I loved the product while it worked,  But, now I have to spend more money on another sonic cleaner.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, mine only lasted 2 weeks. The product was working great and I was noticing a slight difference on my skin. Once the battery died it would no longer charge. Luckily mine stopped working within 30 days of purchasing it, so I was eligible for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I have been using the nutra sonic for about a month now. I have never had acne in my life until I hit 25. It was so bad and made me so self conscious. I had tried everything. The nutra sonic has cleared my face in only one month. It looks gorgeous again and has completley smoothed out! THANK YOU!I also LOVE that it has a body brush. This has helped my back and my chest clear up as well :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, and I really don&#x27;t see a big difference in my skin. I loved it at first, but now I feel like my skin is more dry and flakey. the only improvement I have seen is that it has eliminated my blackheads. overall, I am pretty dissapointed. I bought the cheaper drugstore version (Olay) before this one. it&#x27;s not as well made, and may have a few less bells and whistles, but If you insist on getting one of these, you may as well save yourself a few bucks and get the cheaper one because I think you will still get the same results in the end.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely thrilled with the results of the Nutra Sonic, and my face saw dramatic improvement within 2 weeks of use.  BUT, after only about two months of use, the unit has become \\&quot;possessed\\&quot; in that it will come on randomly while not in use, it will sputter, and now will no longer change speeds.  In some cases, it can&#x27;t even be turned off.  I have followed the care and charging directions to the letter, and am highly disappointed given the amount of money spent.  Am just heartbroken that it is now unusable and I guess am back on the hunt for a quality home micro-dermabrasion product. :(</li>
            <li> I brought the Nutra Sonic after recomendations from a friend whose skin had great tone &amp; clarity. She further explained that she only used this product to clean her face, neck &amp; shoulders. Well, after purchasing it, I can only say that it has met my expectations &amp; more. I have had folks tell me that my skin looks like porcelain &amp; \\&quot; how beautiful it is! \\&quot;. I particularly like how deep the sonic allows it cleans so that all my facial creams are able to work at a deeper level. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> it appears they have a poorly manufactured switch that doesn&#x27;t want to work.&lt;br /&gt;After some rigmorole we could get the switch to function fairly often by pressing it at odd angles and such . . other than that, my wife likes it alot, and it does a heavier scrub than her more expensive model that gave out</li>
            <li> Do NOT order this. Worked half way from the beginning. After a year it won&#x27;t hold a charge. The light in the handle that shows it is charging won&#x27;t light up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to see if company stands behind this expensive piece of junk !</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and it quit working after a couple of months. It is supposed to be shower-safe but she could hear water swishing around in it and eventually it just died. I contacted the company and they told me it couldn&#x27;t be replaced because they didn&#x27;t have anymore of them. Really?  Even if that were true, a reliable company would have offered a comparable product or even a discount but no, all I got was a &amp;#34;sorry&amp;#34;.  To be fair, my Nutra Luxe lasted for three years before it quit working so I guess it&#x27;s hit or miss if you get a good one.  I will be replacing both her and my Nutra Luxes with a Clairasonic Mia.  I hope they feel their poor customer service is worth the loss of sales and negative reviews they will be receiving from me and others.</li>
            <li> I was initially very pleased with the Nutrasonic cleanser I bought but the charger has never worked correctly. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t realize how bad it was until AFTER the one year warranty expired, naturally. It will no longer hold a charge through even ONE treatment. When I contacted the company, their response (after I said it was more than a year) was \\&quot;sorry, we don&#x27;t sell just the chargers\\&quot;.  My husband had bought a Milwaukee drill and when the charger failed to work, they AUTOMATICALLY sent him a replacement. No questions asked. I would never buy from NutraSonic again :0(</li>
            <li> As described and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this two years ago.  My daughter had just bought a clarsonic.  When I got it, it worked great for about 2 months, then it was getting hard to turn on.  I contacted Amazon and had a replacement very shortly afterwards.  My daughters clarsonic broke about 4 months ago. So almost 1 1/2 years after her purchase.  She bought it from Amazon.  She contacted clarsonic about the problem.  They said they would not normally accept a clarsonic back that was not purchased through them.  But they did.  Well, the new clarsonic is now broken again.  I&#x27;m now purchasing a new Nutra Sonic to replace her clarsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my nutra sonic.  I love the fact that it is less expensive than the clarsonic.  The brushes are less expensive as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading an article about sonic cleansing systems.  Like others, I had the same issue, it worked very very well for about 2 months or occasional use and then died!!!!!!  Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift from someone who owned the CS and wanted me to be the guinea pig for this since it was &#x27;just like a CS but so much cheaper&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the brush for a couple weeks and it seemed to clean well but make a mess everywhere no matter how little cleanser or water I used.  First annoyance.  Then after a month it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  Called the manufacturer and got nothing from them. stay away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally purchased a CS and it is amazing.  No mess and my skin texture is so much better.</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for my face.  I can&#x27;t compare it to its competitor, but this one sure works well.  I use my Philosopy Purity with it, and my face is softer than I think it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> I am really disgusted with this product. I purchased it mid-October and followed all instructions regarding charging it (i.e. 24 hours of charging before first use, allowing brush to run down completely before re-charging, etc.). I noticed from the very first use that it stopped and started during use. It lasted about a week before it had to be recharged, and after its second re-charge, it lasted less and less between charges. Now, after a full charge, it lasts some 10 seconds. I am working with the online shop I purchased it from to get a replacement, but I really think it is more appropriate to go for a Clarisonic at this point. Nutraluxe, sort your Nutrasonic batteries out and honour your commitments to your customers when batteries fail!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to a friend of mine for her birthday because she was having problems with her skin.  She has used it and loves it.  I own a Clarisonic which I love and would not be without but did not want to spend that amount of money who many not love it like I did.</li>
            <li> I have acne oily skin. After my first used my skin was completely red and could see an immediately formation of new pimples. I used the normal brush for 90seconds.. By next morning i had a bad brake up that i had not seen in years.  and my skin was peeling off.  I didn&#x27;t use it for about 3 days .  I used the sensitive brush the second time for 1min. my skin again turned red and had new pimples by next morning. I refused to  quit using it and waited for three more days.. I used it a third time, but this time I only used it for less than 35 secs.  and my skin didn&#x27;t turn red or broke up.  I learned that I can only use it once every other day and only for less than 50seconds.  and after a month my skin is looking much better, smoother , cleaner an radiant.  You have to really play with the bushes and the timing to make it work for you.</li>
            <li> There is already an excellent, in depth review on this item written by Chandler on Sept 15, 2011 titled \\&quot;First-hand comparison between the Clarisonic and the Nutrasonic cleaning systems\\&quot; and there is little I can add to that . I didn&#x27;t own the Clarisonic model but I did get a chance to try it out and I, too, preferred the Nutra Sonic for its cost and feel.  I have had this item for 2 years now and its still kicking and working marvelously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face:&lt;br /&gt;The brushes have been economical to replace.  I have sensitive skin that tends to get dry so I only use it once a day at night. I&#x27;ve found that the normal one feels just a little harsher and the softer sensitive brush head feels perfect for me. That one has been harder to find than the normal brush but I&#x27;ve found them on ebay for about $11-$15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body:&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I like about this particular model is that you can use the body brush, which is a little larger. It seems that you can submerge the cleanser itself in water (not the charger) and I use it in baths but I try not to push my luck and try to avoid doing that but so far its held up fine. I try to take a bath once a week ( I do shower in between those baths..) and I&#x27;ve recently started adding bath salts or milk mixtures to them. I&#x27;ve tried 3-4 different brands but so far my favorite has been [[ASIN:B000N53QFS 100% Pure Sea Therapy Bath - Organic Eucalyptus 427g/15oz]], and [[ASIN:B000S95QGG 100% Pure Organic Sea Therapy Bath Soak for Body --Lavender -- 15 oz.]] ( I tend to lean towards the lavender a bit more). I add them to my bath, after soaking about 15 minutes I use this brush to exfoliate and, afterwards, my skin feels sooo soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been really happy with it.  The benefit of this daily gentle exfoliation is that removing all the extra dead skin on your face doesn&#x27;t just help your face glow but also allows better for better absorption of product so whatever product you are using, it will help you get the most of it.the most of it.</li>
            <li> I bought my Nutra Sonic at TJ Maxx several years ago.  I had no idea about the brand at the time. Turns out I loved it.  It still works perfectly.  And I use it almost every day.  Keeps my skin looking fresh and clear. Sorry to hear others have had issues.</li>
            <li> This product is great while it works, no doubt about it. However, after one year, it stopped charging, problem that has been reported over and over again...I was aware of it before I bought it but I guess I didn&#x27;t think it would happend to me. Very frustrating though to see a product that brakes right after the warranty expires. Considering the price, this should have definitely lasted a few years as it is not the type of product you plan on buying annually. VERY diappointed, go with a different brand!</li>
            <li> I have tried other facial brushes that were nowhere as grand as this four speed facial tool.  It&#x27;s easy to charge and holds its charge for lengthy facial treatments. The four speeds allows me to choose the best treatment for my face.  Girls, it&#x27;s worth the money to get the best for your particular facial regimen...it sure beats those one speed systems that are a complete waste of your money.  I bought my sister one and she feel in love with it...she had been using a one speed system.</li>
            <li> It works so nice ! It really exfoliates ur skin like no other cleansing brush  my face feels so clean and soft !!!</li>
            <li> The only difference between this and the more expensive Clairsonic is that you won&#x27;t be pulling your hair out from frustration.  It really does work great...for about a month or so, but right off the bat you will notice that is does not hold a charge, which according to instructions should last a week. It needs to be on the charger every minute it is not in use.  With the numerous complaints lodged against this company, you would think the state of Florida would shut them down, but they are shrewd and continue to make money off those of us trying to save a buck...don&#x27;t fall for it.</li>
            <li> It fell apart the 1st time my wife used it!  It was a birthday gift and I travel for work so she just mentioned it to me. I was told We had a 1 year warranty, but Amazon only gives a month to return it so were out of luck. Horrible shopping place, inferior knock offs and no warranty. P.O.S.</li>
