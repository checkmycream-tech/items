            <li>and I LOVE the darks.</li>
            <li>and i got like more browns than pinks which id prefer more pinks</li>
            <li>but over all i love this and would purchase again and or for gifts</li>
            <li>And most of the colors that was listed was not in the package.</li>
            <li>I have so many lipsticks, but I never wanted to spend a lot of money on just one lip liner.  </li>
            <li>There are also so many brows</li>
            <li>Over all... the buy was ok.</li>
            <li>Love the products they are very pigmented great in quality lots of colors to choose from the shipping was also a breeze</li>
            <li>I wish the colors were more pigmented.</li>
            <li>I thought I got too many browns, by the color on the caps.</li>
            <li>I love the assortment of colors, and that there are a lot of browns (which I wear a lot of).</li>
            <li>I also got 5 retractable lip liners, which I love.</li>
            <li>Most of the colors are browns</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use them :)</li>
            <li>Everything and more ...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>After putting on some lip gloss it made them look better</li>
            <li>but I mostly received browns which I am never going to use.</li>
            <li>Yes there are more brownish colors in the mix</li>
            <li>deffinetly buying more</li>

            <li>I personally love it</li>
            <li>but I wish there were more color options.  </li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love the combo that these lip liner pencils come in … some are pencils and some are twist up</li>
            <li>but most are brown</li>
            <li>I tried most of them on and i love them.</li>
            <li>but they should be okay with a lip primer.  </li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many glitter shades if you aren&#x27;t into that.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this collection.</li>
            <li>I love these lip liners they are perfect if ur just starting ur kit cant ask for more for that price will recommend that to anyone</li>

            <li>Yes they give you more brown shades than anything else</li>
            <li>I thought that there&#x27;d be a lot more pinks or reds, maybe even purples, but was kinda dissapointed.</li>

            <li>I love them.</li>

            <li>Worth the price and love the colors</li>
            <li>so happy I finally did!</li>
            <li>the fact that you get so many colors makes this that much more fun and worth the price</li>
            <li>I have light colored lips</li>
            <li>These liners are smooth, don&#x27;t skip, creamy, pigmented, and long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>Overall great quality.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality, lots of browns, not made in the USA.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these lip liners, I even use them as lipstick by coloring in my lips and then applying a gloss.</li>
            <li>the color doesn&#x27;t go on smooth for me and when I sharpen the pencils, the crayon falls apart.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to be able to have so many different shades</li>
            <li>and I believe these are cruelty free, too.</li>
            <li>and it was smooth to go on</li>
            <li>However, you can&#x27;t really complain because the price is amazing for how pigmented mine are.</li>
            <li>The actual length on them are great also.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think these will be cheap based on price.</li>
            <li>They go on so smooth .</li>
            <li>I was really satisfied with all these lip pencils, they were cheap and worth it</li>
            <li>I love that you get so many for not so much.</li>
            <li>The colors are very nice and last.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery,  amazing colors and the pencil is long very worth it , I&#x27;m one happy camper</li>
            <li>Brought it for my granddaughter and she is in love, she love them and she highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I also received 4 of the more premium lip pencils which are pretty fabulous.</li>
            <li>The application is very smooth and wearing it with a top coat of clear lip gloss is to die for!</li>
            <li>Amazing highly recommend</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>OMG I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT MY PURCHASE.</li>
            <li>So i got these today i was so excited.</li>
            <li>Fun is all I can say and they stay on!</li>
            <li>but hey it&#x27;s worth the price !  </li>
            <li>but I went ahead and it was worth it!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first cause there are so many</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very good quality, came in less than three days, and are super cheap</li>
            <li>i have been using them to cover my entire lips because lets be honest who has that many lipsticks to match all of those colors?</li>
            <li>it goes smooth and almost last good time but</li>
            <li>I think these are better suited for a medium to dark complexion than a fair to light complexion.  </li>
            <li>These and the 60 PC round lipstick set were purchased for me by my husband, and I could not be more pleased!!</li>
            <li>playing around with the pinks and nudes to see which I like best before I buy a more expensive brand, but might just keep buying this brand if they don&#x27;t break easily</li>
            <li>I use them as full lip color, so basically lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was taken back by some of them (in a good way).</li>
            <li>Love that it comes with A TON of lip liners but lets be real here</li>
            <li>One full size one purse size.</li>
            <li>I am having a good time playing with the colors and learning different lip liner techniques.</li>
            <li>The glitter really isn&#x27;t that noticeable, which to me, makes them more wearable.</li>
            <li>but out of 54 not bad.</li>
            <li>Other then that they were great specially for the price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re too many browns, but other than that the red/pinks were perfect since I have a bunch of different shades of these two colors</li>
            <li>I was super excited, they are great quality for the price, you might get some colors that you don&#x27;t want but overall they are a very buy and steal</li>
            <li>OTHER THAN THAT GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>And as for the quality, they&#x27;re as good as anything you&#x27;d get from a drug store (I think a little better) .</li>
            <li>Luckily, Nabi quickly gave me a replacement.</li>
            <li>There are a couple of repeats but luckily my friend purchased this as well</li>
            <li>The colors are super pigmented.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Went on very smooth and good variety of colors although quite a few Brown&#x27;s in the bunch but still worth it.</li>
            <li>also the shipping was very fast !</li>
            <li>Many many different colors to choose from and I am more of a dark lip kind of a girl</li>
            <li>Some of the lip liners are shorter than the others, about 6-8 out of the 54, but overall love them!</li>
            <li>There are some browns that actually look brown against my skin but most look purpley!  </li>
            <li>Not too  bold and just the right amount of colour for her.</li>
            <li>just a few weren&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li>The product itself is very opaque, smooth, and stays on.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $27.</li>
            <li>It is a fun thing to order for yourself or share with roommate, sister, friend, etc.</li>
            <li>I saw a girl use them in a tutorial as a regular kind of lipstick, so when I found this deal, I took it.</li>
            <li>They look nice and there are a lot of different colors</li>
            <li>I read reviews thought they would be worth it</li>
            <li>but they are totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I personally like using them to color the whole lip and it looks good just like that.</li>
            <li>The go on nice enough to wear by itself or just a bit of lip balm or go all out and pair with a lipstick  or gloss.</li>
            <li>But still, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>worth buying .i</li>
            <li>you will get your money worth</li>
            <li>Worth the money and saves her time shopping</li>
            <li>The product itself is fine, goes on well and stays on decently.  </li>
            <li>They got shipped pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is good quality and extremely affordable</li>
            <li>picking the right color was difficult.&lt;br /&gt;Considering</li>
            <li>BE PURCHASING AGAIN AS WELL AS RECOMMENDING TO FRIENDS.SO CHEERS TO MY NEW ADDITION TO MY LOVE LARGE MAKEUP COLLECTION</li>
            <li>so if you love to wear dark lipsticks, this is the set for you :)</li>
            <li>I recieved my package very quickly and I can honestly say I feel like a little girl in a candy store...soooo many different colors to choose from!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping...</li>
            <li>We got this product in very reasonable price and product quality is according to expectations.</li>
            <li>with a little lip balm they do great as lipsticks and they mix great with each other overall</li>
            <li>Some of them were great color payoff, some of them were so hard to put on.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel that there were actually that many.</li>
            <li>Love how they come in different shapes and styles.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how much this matters to anyone; felt it needed to be stated though in case someone is looking for some great matte lipsticks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the things that I didn&#x27;t like , most of the color is darker color and very same colors .</li>
            <li>first I was thinking to return it</li>
            <li>Most are the same colors.</li>
            <li>Exactly 54 pieces!&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>throughout the day, lovely mix of colours from dark to light.</li>
            <li>The lip liners are really pigmented and this is really worth your money.</li>
            <li>i just can&#x27;t say anything wrong about this product , it&#x27;s AMAZING!!!!!</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast also!</li>
            <li>Too many of same colours</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and fast shipment!</li>
            <li>I received 54 lipliners, and there was so many repeated colors with same numbers.</li>
            <li>pretty colors)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some of the shades repeat, so be aware.</li>
            <li>The only reason I went with 4 stars is because I dislike how many browns there are.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Shipping was amazingly fast!</li>
            <li>Was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much a steal!</li>
            <li>These are great liners and very comparable to liners way more expensive.</li>
            <li>I accidentally deleted my first review .</li>
            <li>cause I&#x27;m so white , but my friends love them .&lt;br</li>
            <li>, if you&#x27;re a fan of glitter you&#x27;ll love the glittery ones , but personally I don&#x27;t like glitter</li>
            <li>I MEAN THEY ARE GREAT FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>Love love love these lip liners they are long and last such a long time I highly recommend them I use them on my clients and they absolutely love them !</li>
            <li>Whether you&#x27;re a makeup artist or just starting out with makeup, I&#x27;d suggest the set because it has so many colors and wears very well.</li>
            <li>, you have to retouch very often it runs very fast</li>
            <li>They are very consistent with replying to emails and are very professional.</li>
            <li>Although you do have to apply it pretty frequently, I really don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t order again due to quality but it is fun having this many liners in my bathroom to choose from when applying make up.</li>
            <li>the only thing is there was some repeated colors and some where tinny but other then that they are great</li>
            <li>#34;plum, dark rose, grape&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>As a final note, if you can find the retractable lip liner version, go for those because they&#x27;re definitely more pigmented (I&#x27;ve used both with the primer and noticed a decent difference).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these lipliners to my girlfriends and I will also be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li>They are pretty smooth on the lips and they are definitely pigmented.</li>
            <li>They last mmmmmm... not all day but a good long while.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend trying these out.</li>
            <li>Colors are nice but not long lasting.</li>
            <li>I got a mix of solid pencils and retractable pencils, which isn&#x27;t mentioned anywhere in the description, but I&#x27;m fine with the mixture.</li>
            <li>I only received two duplicates which was perfectly fine</li>
            <li>; what that means is that per pack they cram in about 1-2 pencils that are half the size of the rest so they can add up to the total of 54.&lt;br /&gt;Great pencils, crappy color range (unless all you wear is different shades of brown), not the best packaging style.</li>
            <li>PLUS there&#x27;s six pencils that are a little glittery, the rest are regular liner colors ranging from pinks, to reds, deep purple, rose colors, really nice browns and so on.</li>
            <li>I found that the color indicated by the NAME on the pencil to be accurate, not the color on the outside of the pencil.</li>
            <li>My primer dims the vibrancy, but regardless if you take the &amp;#34;Apple Red&amp;#34; and put it straight on</li>
            <li>which is sort of the color it wants to</li>
            <li>There are alot of browns which i dont really wear</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to start their makeup collection..</li>
            <li>You pay for what you get, really applies theses products.</li>
            <li>That was very upsetting.</li>
            <li>it really stays i apply it once</li>
            <li>Very waxy&lt;br /&gt;Poor</li>
            <li>for the price, this really gives you a lot of options.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t wear very often.</li>
            <li>WELL.A WHOLE DAY</li>
            <li>but there really ARE a lot of browns.</li>
            <li>The ad does show the colors well so really look at the hues.</li>
            <li>I really dont recomened it .</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like them that much.</li>
            <li>Some of the glitter shades are frosted and glide on very well.</li>
            <li>Colors are very pigmented and do have a matte finish except for the glitters of course.</li>
            <li>I regret this purchase so much.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really give you 54 just saying , they give you 40 although the colors do stand out</li>
            <li>Besides that the colors are nice and I only had to reapply once for it to last all day.</li>
            <li>They were really nice only thing was sinew came in 2 of the same color.</li>
            <li>Would deffo purchase again would be even better if they were waterproof and less dry but still a lovely product.</li>
            <li>But I  love the other pencils and I use them to fill in my whole lip and it works like a matte lipstick that lasts for hours</li>
            <li>There are a lot of browns, but only about 1/2 what I originally thought.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed even with 27 colors I have enough to have plenty of variety.</li>
            <li>The lip liners are nice and long lasting.</li>
            <li>so I had no problem with the many browns and dark shades.</li>
            <li>I rated them 2 stars though because more than half of the pencils are browns.</li>
            <li>Out of the 52 however more than half were an assortment of browns and orangey-browns.</li>
            <li>Love having such a selection, as my lip liner &amp; lipstick is on daily.</li>
            <li>The browns are very, very similar and many look the same.  </li>
            <li>I wear them everyday if I feel like going out a wear a red when I&#x27;m going to the store I wear a not to bright color  </li>
            <li>These are highly pigmented, long-lasting, vibrantly colored pencils.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these pencils.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>They go on very smoothly and last for a long time.</li>
            <li>A little too many Browns.</li>
            <li>There were a few repeats but you have so many to choose from you barley notice.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that a few shades are repeated, and many of the 54 pencils  are a shade of brown.</li>
            <li>Although some stated that the received doubles of some colors, I recieved 54 fun different colors.</li>
            <li>Love this product every color is long lasting ..works well with my complexion</li>
            <li>Love the lip liner it last a long time.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t care for dark lip liners other than that I loved it.</li>
            <li>its incredible, ill be repurchasing again!</li>
            <li>The only thing I really didn&#x27;t understand was I got about 6 smaller sizes of lip liners and the rest were full size.</li>
            <li>but you can coat it with a lipstick to create a new color.</li>
            <li>Too many light colors come in the pack and they are basically useless for lining lips.  </li>
            <li>My only negatives are the repeat colors and half of the liners being smaller, but it&#x27;s still a good set to invest in.</li>
            <li>and I actually have used just the liner on my whole lips because I didn&#x27;t have a lipstick that matched the color liner and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>I mean really, why do I need so many browns.</li>
            <li>last long, flexible and so so easy to use.</li>
            <li>But other than that, I was overall satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>When I first got the product I went through and segregated by color and found out there are definitely some duplicates in there...</li>
            <li>Usually implied as you&#x27;ll be going over top with a color that will cover that,</li>
            <li>I could still see my original lip color underneath and they made my lips  appear extremely chapped, even though they weren&#x27;t...</li>
            <li>Soft pencil !</li>
            <li>Do not waste money on this!</li>
            <li>and it last longer than most of my other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m such a huge fan of deep brown and red</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why those 4 were sharpened extremely short.</li>
            <li>the only thing really bothers me, the majority of what you&#x27;re getting is brown variations.</li>
            <li>SO EARLY ARRIVAL IS A PLUS</li>
            <li>WOW..</li>
            <li>The negative about this is that there are many shades of brown.</li>
            <li>So far, these have worn as well as my Mac liners</li>
            <li>The color doesn&#x27;t stay when you use the lip liners by themselves and if you put too much product on it becomes lumpy and gritty feeling.</li>
            <li>Much of the same Color.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my fiance she loved them and tries a different colour everyday.</li>
            <li>So many colors were missing such as pinks.</li>
            <li>They are pretty dry and do not line well.</li>
            <li>several of the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant or deep as i&#x27;d like, but it really does give you a variety to choose from.</li>
            <li>everything else were different shades of brown from dark to light and purples and pinks</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I got two of the same color and is not that i recived 55 pcs, i got exactly 54.</li>
            <li>Definitely I Would Highly Recommend This Product.</li>
            <li>I am a pro artist who uses high end products such as mac, nars, Chanel, etc.</li>
            <li>Most of the colors repeated, and some were missing, was not what i expected.</li>
            <li>More mauve, purple, few pink hues and not many warm colors in red, orange, and warmer pink shades.  </li>
            <li>I got 52 lip liners and 2 eyeliners which were a glitter green and glitter black, honest mistake, they all look the same.</li>
            <li>Wish they were a little bit softer then they&#x27;d be worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Well worth the little bit of money they cost.</li>
            <li>Yes a few that look a like but still worth the investment</li>
            <li>They are super creamy, though they do need to be sharpened first because the tips are a little dried out.</li>
            <li>They only problem I may have had was the application was a little harder to do, and I kind of expected them to just glide on</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the glitter shades, but they actually turned out to be my favorite colors!  </li>
            <li>but... i am very sad with thjs purchase the colors do not show on my lips it wipes off super easy</li>
            <li>This product was really great, I was a little skeptical because of the price</li>
            <li>They are not dark enough for under the eye as a gel liner would be, but for the price- you can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li>These are ok, but not good for long wear, even under a lipstick.</li>
            <li>As far as the colors go, well there were way to many browns, at least half of the colors were browns.</li>
            <li>Yes there are a lot of brown shades but they are actually pretty different from each other and slightly different than the color portrayed on the pencil.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little bit iffy about ordering nabi lip liners considering I&#x27;ve never used the product before.</li>
            <li>Due to the high number of brown shades</li>
            <li>I must admit that I was very skeptical that these pencils would be of good quality, especially considering the low price.</li>
            <li>About half of the product is shorter than the other half, but I&#x27;m totally okay with that.</li>

            <li> I wish there were more pinks and reds</li>
            <li> but I do wish it had more colors instead of so many brown shades.</li>

            <li> and I LOVE the darks.</li>
            <li> and i got like more browns than pinks which id prefer more pinks</li>
            <li> but over all i love this and would purchase again and or for gifts</li>
            <li> And most of the colors that was listed was not in the package.</li>
            <li> I have so many lipsticks, but I never wanted to spend a lot of money on just one lip liner.  </li>
            <li> There are also so many brows</li>
            <li> Over all... the buy was ok.</li>
            <li> Love the products they are very pigmented great in quality lots of colors to choose from the shipping was also a breeze</li>
            <li> I wish the colors were more pigmented.</li>
            <li> I thought I got too many browns, by the color on the caps.</li>
            <li> I love the assortment of colors, and that there are a lot of browns (which I wear a lot of).</li>
            <li> I also got 5 retractable lip liners, which I love.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors are browns</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use them :)</li>
            <li> Everything and more ...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> After putting on some lip gloss it made them look better</li>
            <li> but I mostly received browns which I am never going to use.</li>
            <li> Yes there are more brownish colors in the mix</li>
            <li> deffinetly buying more</li>

            <li> But it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Okay so I totally love these lip liners.</li>
            <li> I personally love it</li>
            <li> but I wish there were more color options.  </li>
            <li> By the way I bought this for my wife and this review is based on feedback from her:)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love the combo that these lip liner pencils come in … some are pencils and some are twist up</li>
            <li> but most are brown</li>
            <li> I tried most of them on and i love them.</li>
            <li> but they should be okay with a lip primer.  </li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many glitter shades if you aren&#x27;t into that.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this collection.</li>
            <li> I love these lip liners they are perfect if ur just starting ur kit cant ask for more for that price will recommend that to anyone</li>
            <li> there are many browns</li>
            <li> There is a variation of colors not just browns like many people claim there is.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure if I should order them because of reviews</li>
            <li> I love them all :))  </li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> Love all the colors can use almost all of them.</li>
            <li> Yes they give you more brown shades than anything else</li>
            <li> I thought that there&#x27;d be a lot more pinks or reds, maybe even purples, but was kinda dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Came in so many colors, mostly browns and pinks tho.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>

            <li> so happy I finally did!</li>
            <li> the fact that you get so many colors makes this that much more fun and worth the price</li>
            <li> I have light colored lips</li>
            <li> These liners are smooth, don&#x27;t skip, creamy, pigmented, and long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> Overall great quality.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality, lots of browns, not made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these lip liners, I even use them as lipstick by coloring in my lips and then applying a gloss.</li>
            <li> the color doesn&#x27;t go on smooth for me and when I sharpen the pencils, the crayon falls apart.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to be able to have so many different shades</li>
            <li> and I believe these are cruelty free, too.</li>
            <li> and it was smooth to go on</li>
            <li> However, you can&#x27;t really complain because the price is amazing for how pigmented mine are.</li>
            <li> The actual length on them are great also.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think these will be cheap based on price.</li>
            <li> They go on so smooth .</li>
            <li> I was really satisfied with all these lip pencils, they were cheap and worth it</li>
            <li> I love that you get so many for not so much.</li>
            <li> The colors are very nice and last.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,  amazing colors and the pencil is long very worth it , I&#x27;m one happy camper</li>
            <li> Brought it for my granddaughter and she is in love, she love them and she highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I also received 4 of the more premium lip pencils which are pretty fabulous.</li>
            <li> The application is very smooth and wearing it with a top coat of clear lip gloss is to die for!</li>
            <li> Amazing highly recommend</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> OMG I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT MY PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> So i got these today i was so excited.</li>
            <li> Fun is all I can say and they stay on!</li>
            <li> but hey it&#x27;s worth the price !  </li>
            <li> but I went ahead and it was worth it!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first cause there are so many</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very good quality, came in less than three days, and are super cheap</li>
            <li> i have been using them to cover my entire lips because lets be honest who has that many lipsticks to match all of those colors?</li>
            <li> it goes smooth and almost last good time but</li>
            <li> I think these are better suited for a medium to dark complexion than a fair to light complexion.  </li>
            <li> These and the 60 PC round lipstick set were purchased for me by my husband, and I could not be more pleased!!</li>
            <li> playing around with the pinks and nudes to see which I like best before I buy a more expensive brand, but might just keep buying this brand if they don&#x27;t break easily</li>
            <li> I use them as full lip color, so basically lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was taken back by some of them (in a good way).</li>
            <li> Love that it comes with A TON of lip liners but lets be real here</li>
            <li> One full size one purse size.</li>
            <li> I am having a good time playing with the colors and learning different lip liner techniques.</li>
            <li> The glitter really isn&#x27;t that noticeable, which to me, makes them more wearable.</li>
            <li> but out of 54 not bad.</li>
            <li> Other then that they were great specially for the price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too many browns, but other than that the red/pinks were perfect since I have a bunch of different shades of these two colors</li>
            <li> I was super excited, they are great quality for the price, you might get some colors that you don&#x27;t want but overall they are a very buy and steal</li>
            <li> OTHER THAN THAT GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> And as for the quality, they&#x27;re as good as anything you&#x27;d get from a drug store (I think a little better) .</li>
            <li> Luckily, Nabi quickly gave me a replacement.</li>
            <li> There are a couple of repeats but luckily my friend purchased this as well</li>
            <li> The colors are super pigmented.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Went on very smooth and good variety of colors although quite a few Brown&#x27;s in the bunch but still worth it.</li>
            <li> also the shipping was very fast !</li>
            <li> Many many different colors to choose from and I am more of a dark lip kind of a girl</li>
            <li> Some of the lip liners are shorter than the others, about 6-8 out of the 54, but overall love them!</li>
            <li> There are some browns that actually look brown against my skin but most look purpley!  </li>
            <li> Not too  bold and just the right amount of colour for her.</li>
            <li> just a few weren&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li> The product itself is very opaque, smooth, and stays on.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $27.</li>
            <li> It is a fun thing to order for yourself or share with roommate, sister, friend, etc.</li>
            <li> I saw a girl use them in a tutorial as a regular kind of lipstick, so when I found this deal, I took it.</li>
            <li> They look nice and there are a lot of different colors</li>
            <li> I read reviews thought they would be worth it</li>
            <li> but they are totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I personally like using them to color the whole lip and it looks good just like that.</li>
            <li> The go on nice enough to wear by itself or just a bit of lip balm or go all out and pair with a lipstick  or gloss.</li>
            <li> But still, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> worth buying .i</li>
            <li> you will get your money worth</li>
            <li> Worth the money and saves her time shopping</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine, goes on well and stays on decently.  </li>
            <li> They got shipped pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is good quality and extremely affordable</li>
            <li> picking the right color was difficult.&lt;br /&gt;Considering</li>
            <li> BE PURCHASING AGAIN AS WELL AS RECOMMENDING TO FRIENDS.SO CHEERS TO MY NEW ADDITION TO MY LOVE LARGE MAKEUP COLLECTION</li>
            <li> so if you love to wear dark lipsticks, this is the set for you :)</li>
            <li> I recieved my package very quickly and I can honestly say I feel like a little girl in a candy store...soooo many different colors to choose from!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping...</li>
            <li> We got this product in very reasonable price and product quality is according to expectations.</li>
            <li> with a little lip balm they do great as lipsticks and they mix great with each other overall</li>
            <li> Some of them were great color payoff, some of them were so hard to put on.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel that there were actually that many.</li>
            <li> Love how they come in different shapes and styles.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how much this matters to anyone; felt it needed to be stated though in case someone is looking for some great matte lipsticks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the things that I didn&#x27;t like , most of the color is darker color and very same colors .</li>
            <li> first I was thinking to return it</li>
            <li> Most are the same colors.</li>
            <li> Exactly 54 pieces!&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> throughout the day, lovely mix of colours from dark to light.</li>
            <li> The lip liners are really pigmented and this is really worth your money.</li>
            <li> i just can&#x27;t say anything wrong about this product , it&#x27;s AMAZING!!!!!</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast also!</li>
            <li> Too many of same colours</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> I received 54 lipliners, and there was so many repeated colors with same numbers.</li>
            <li> pretty colors)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the shades repeat, so be aware.</li>
            <li> The only reason I went with 4 stars is because I dislike how many browns there are.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Shipping was amazingly fast!</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty much a steal!</li>
            <li> These are great liners and very comparable to liners way more expensive.</li>
            <li> I accidentally deleted my first review .</li>
            <li> cause I&#x27;m so white , but my friends love them .&lt;br</li>
            <li> , if you&#x27;re a fan of glitter you&#x27;ll love the glittery ones , but personally I don&#x27;t like glitter</li>
            <li> I MEAN THEY ARE GREAT FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Love love love these lip liners they are long and last such a long time I highly recommend them I use them on my clients and they absolutely love them !</li>
            <li> Whether you&#x27;re a makeup artist or just starting out with makeup, I&#x27;d suggest the set because it has so many colors and wears very well.</li>
            <li> , you have to retouch very often it runs very fast</li>
            <li> They are very consistent with replying to emails and are very professional.</li>
            <li> Although you do have to apply it pretty frequently, I really don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order again due to quality but it is fun having this many liners in my bathroom to choose from when applying make up.</li>
            <li> the only thing is there was some repeated colors and some where tinny but other then that they are great</li>
            <li> #34;plum, dark rose, grape&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> As a final note, if you can find the retractable lip liner version, go for those because they&#x27;re definitely more pigmented (I&#x27;ve used both with the primer and noticed a decent difference).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these lipliners to my girlfriends and I will also be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> They are pretty smooth on the lips and they are definitely pigmented.</li>
            <li> They last mmmmmm... not all day but a good long while.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend trying these out.</li>
            <li> Colors are nice but not long lasting.</li>
            <li> I got a mix of solid pencils and retractable pencils, which isn&#x27;t mentioned anywhere in the description, but I&#x27;m fine with the mixture.</li>
            <li> I only received two duplicates which was perfectly fine</li>
            <li> ; what that means is that per pack they cram in about 1-2 pencils that are half the size of the rest so they can add up to the total of 54.&lt;br /&gt;Great pencils, crappy color range (unless all you wear is different shades of brown), not the best packaging style.</li>
            <li> PLUS there&#x27;s six pencils that are a little glittery, the rest are regular liner colors ranging from pinks, to reds, deep purple, rose colors, really nice browns and so on.</li>
            <li> I found that the color indicated by the NAME on the pencil to be accurate, not the color on the outside of the pencil.</li>
            <li> My primer dims the vibrancy, but regardless if you take the &amp;#34;Apple Red&amp;#34; and put it straight on</li>
            <li> which is sort of the color it wants to</li>
            <li> There are alot of browns which i dont really wear</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to start their makeup collection..</li>
            <li> You pay for what you get, really applies theses products.</li>
            <li> That was very upsetting.</li>
            <li> it really stays i apply it once</li>
            <li> Very waxy&lt;br /&gt;Poor</li>
            <li> for the price, this really gives you a lot of options.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t wear very often.</li>
            <li> WELL.A WHOLE DAY</li>
            <li> but there really ARE a lot of browns.</li>
            <li> The ad does show the colors well so really look at the hues.</li>
            <li> I really dont recomened it .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them that much.</li>
            <li> Some of the glitter shades are frosted and glide on very well.</li>
            <li> Colors are very pigmented and do have a matte finish except for the glitters of course.</li>
            <li> I regret this purchase so much.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really give you 54 just saying , they give you 40 although the colors do stand out</li>
            <li> Besides that the colors are nice and I only had to reapply once for it to last all day.</li>
            <li> They were really nice only thing was sinew came in 2 of the same color.</li>
            <li> Would deffo purchase again would be even better if they were waterproof and less dry but still a lovely product.</li>
            <li> But I  love the other pencils and I use them to fill in my whole lip and it works like a matte lipstick that lasts for hours</li>
            <li> There are a lot of browns, but only about 1/2 what I originally thought.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed even with 27 colors I have enough to have plenty of variety.</li>
            <li> The lip liners are nice and long lasting.</li>
            <li> so I had no problem with the many browns and dark shades.</li>
            <li> I rated them 2 stars though because more than half of the pencils are browns.</li>
            <li> Out of the 52 however more than half were an assortment of browns and orangey-browns.</li>
            <li> Love having such a selection, as my lip liner &amp; lipstick is on daily.</li>
            <li> The browns are very, very similar and many look the same.  </li>
            <li> I wear them everyday if I feel like going out a wear a red when I&#x27;m going to the store I wear a not to bright color  </li>
            <li> These are highly pigmented, long-lasting, vibrantly colored pencils.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these pencils.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> They go on very smoothly and last for a long time.</li>
            <li> A little too many Browns.</li>
            <li> There were a few repeats but you have so many to choose from you barley notice.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that a few shades are repeated, and many of the 54 pencils  are a shade of brown.</li>
            <li> Although some stated that the received doubles of some colors, I recieved 54 fun different colors.</li>
            <li> Love this product every color is long lasting ..works well with my complexion</li>
            <li> Love the lip liner it last a long time.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t care for dark lip liners other than that I loved it.</li>
            <li> its incredible, ill be repurchasing again!</li>
            <li> The only thing I really didn&#x27;t understand was I got about 6 smaller sizes of lip liners and the rest were full size.</li>
            <li> but you can coat it with a lipstick to create a new color.</li>
            <li> Too many light colors come in the pack and they are basically useless for lining lips.  </li>
            <li> My only negatives are the repeat colors and half of the liners being smaller, but it&#x27;s still a good set to invest in.</li>
            <li> and I actually have used just the liner on my whole lips because I didn&#x27;t have a lipstick that matched the color liner and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> I mean really, why do I need so many browns.</li>
            <li> last long, flexible and so so easy to use.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I was overall satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> When I first got the product I went through and segregated by color and found out there are definitely some duplicates in there...</li>
            <li> Usually implied as you&#x27;ll be going over top with a color that will cover that,</li>
            <li> I could still see my original lip color underneath and they made my lips  appear extremely chapped, even though they weren&#x27;t...</li>
            <li> Soft pencil !</li>
            <li> Do not waste money on this!</li>
            <li> and it last longer than most of my other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a huge fan of deep brown and red</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why those 4 were sharpened extremely short.</li>
            <li> the only thing really bothers me, the majority of what you&#x27;re getting is brown variations.</li>
            <li> SO EARLY ARRIVAL IS A PLUS</li>
            <li> WOW..</li>
            <li> The negative about this is that there are many shades of brown.</li>
            <li> So far, these have worn as well as my Mac liners</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t stay when you use the lip liners by themselves and if you put too much product on it becomes lumpy and gritty feeling.</li>
            <li> Much of the same Color.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiance she loved them and tries a different colour everyday.</li>
            <li> So many colors were missing such as pinks.</li>
            <li> They are pretty dry and do not line well.</li>
            <li> several of the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant or deep as i&#x27;d like, but it really does give you a variety to choose from.</li>
            <li> everything else were different shades of brown from dark to light and purples and pinks</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I got two of the same color and is not that i recived 55 pcs, i got exactly 54.</li>
            <li> Definitely I Would Highly Recommend This Product.</li>
            <li> I am a pro artist who uses high end products such as mac, nars, Chanel, etc.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors repeated, and some were missing, was not what i expected.</li>
            <li> More mauve, purple, few pink hues and not many warm colors in red, orange, and warmer pink shades.  </li>
            <li> I got 52 lip liners and 2 eyeliners which were a glitter green and glitter black, honest mistake, they all look the same.</li>
            <li> Wish they were a little bit softer then they&#x27;d be worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Well worth the little bit of money they cost.</li>
            <li> Yes a few that look a like but still worth the investment</li>
            <li> They are super creamy, though they do need to be sharpened first because the tips are a little dried out.</li>
            <li> They only problem I may have had was the application was a little harder to do, and I kind of expected them to just glide on</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the glitter shades, but they actually turned out to be my favorite colors!  </li>
            <li> but... i am very sad with thjs purchase the colors do not show on my lips it wipes off super easy</li>
            <li> This product was really great, I was a little skeptical because of the price</li>
            <li> They are not dark enough for under the eye as a gel liner would be, but for the price- you can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li> These are ok, but not good for long wear, even under a lipstick.</li>
            <li> As far as the colors go, well there were way to many browns, at least half of the colors were browns.</li>
            <li> Yes there are a lot of brown shades but they are actually pretty different from each other and slightly different than the color portrayed on the pencil.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little bit iffy about ordering nabi lip liners considering I&#x27;ve never used the product before.</li>
            <li> Due to the high number of brown shades</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was very skeptical that these pencils would be of good quality, especially considering the low price.</li>
            <li> About half of the product is shorter than the other half, but I&#x27;m totally okay with that.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of &amp;#34;browns&amp;#34; but what nobody is saying is that on pale skin those &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; colors look very purple/magentaish.</li>
            <li> Honestly if anyone is skeptical about this product, don&#x27;t be!</li>
            <li> or if they last long.</li>
            <li> However they do work, just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> , they last long</li>
            <li> I had to really press hard to get the color to actually show up</li>
            <li> the price being so cheap I should have expected the poor quality of these.</li>
            <li> The lighter colors are hardly pigmented and the glitter ones are pretty dry and they skip.</li>
            <li> Also 46 are regular size and 8 are little bit smaller, and i only received 2 repeated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get lip liners for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this set because of the low price and unknown brand.</li>
            <li> actually it arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> If I had to break it down, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re getting equal parts pink and red</li>
            <li> Had some trouble with the delivery of this product when the delivery man left my package outside without my consent.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t last long (maybe an hour and a half)</li>
            <li> Wish there was a dark red included.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO irritation, and after warming the colors on the back of my hand, the color pay-off is extremely pigmented.</li>
            <li> so I have two or even three of the same color and again mostly dark ones .</li>
            <li> Almost all the colors were dark there was only one nude and one skin tone color in the pack</li>
            <li> The ones that are dark enough to line lips...</li>
            <li> I do wish there was a wider variety of reds, particularly dark red..</li>
            <li> Also, there are few mauves or purples in general.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I would say is that they should have more reds and other colors in the pack.</li>
            <li> Ive personally have boughten these lip liners (individually) in the past.</li>
            <li> They have a soft tip, but when I was applying it too my lip, the color was hard to get on...</li>
            <li> There are about 9 colors that I am in love with and they aren&#x27;t too bad when it comes to quality.</li>
            <li> Everybody says these pencils are great but my experience with them has been horrible.  </li>
            <li> I got these 54 shade lip liners yesterday , I used one of the pink color</li>
            <li> It was a few of same colors  </li>
            <li> so, I look so dead without any colors on them Totally recommend</li>
            <li> I also got a few colors that weren&#x27;t listed, I still only got 54, but 54 colors are not listed on the description.</li>
            <li> when I use anew color i roll the tip on the back of my hand to round it</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of darker colors and varying shades of pink.</li>
            <li> Got them way before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> They arrived before the expected delivery date</li>
            <li> so it takes a little long to apply.</li>
            <li> A makeup junkies ,,,,,Was not at all what I expected, save time and money just 10 or 11 pencils is good but others pencils very bad the same colors and hard when you put it .</li>
            <li> 24 of the liners is smaller size ( exactly half size ) and a few are mechanical .</li>
            <li> Will be trying other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> so I could not even try them due to the delay</li>
            <li> As said with the other reviewers there is a lot of brownish tone colors</li>
            <li> I ordered them like a week ago &amp; they came in before expected !</li>
            <li> Holy cow there are 54 of them.</li>
            <li> and I was using the dark colored lip liners for this</li>
            <li> and my lips aren&#x27;t even dark.</li>
            <li> so i was turned down a bit.</li>
            <li> So, i gave this four stars just because i got half small pencils and half long pencils?</li>
            <li> They are very sharp so</li>
            <li> The glitter pencils were especially the worst, you can barely see them and really I have no use for them.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t wear dark brown or  black/brown on my lips!</li>
            <li> colors are a little darker</li>
            <li> You may have to wet them a little and even then it&#x27;s still hard.</li>
            <li> Majority were very dark lip liners.  </li>
            <li> Also I got a few retractable ones</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist in Houston, Tx and have used this product on myself and my clients everyday since ordering.</li>
            <li> I feel like a few...</li>
            <li> if I bought lip liners at the store I wouldve gotten a few for 24 bucks</li>
            <li> But one I started to use on my lips they were pigmented at all and were harsh on my lips</li>
            <li> I also ordered the 60 piece round lipstick and 24 piece eye and brow liners but have yet to received them.</li>
            <li> What am I missing here?  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago, no duplicates.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that just got like 5 full size and the rest were little :/</li>
            <li> Not sure how I can usw the glittery ones, some are very dark others are bearly pigment.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely hate using lip pencils that are hard and don&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> : Quantity is NOT better than quality.</li>
            <li> Ill have to see how they do during the day when it comes to how lasting they are</li>
            <li> I usually buy them for a dollar, and two I can always compare them to MAC lip liners or NYX lip liners.</li>
            <li> Only thing I was sad aboutwas</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use with a lip gloss over as the liners just rub away once anything is applied over it.</li>
            <li> But i do have to say the shipping was late</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of money i am not happy</li>
            <li> Seriously....</li>
            <li> , seriously you get what you payed for</li>
            <li> They feathered really bad,  and had no long wear to them at all.  </li>
            <li> I had a few duplicates and even though I need to reapply them every so often, it&#x27;s not that bad, at least for me.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> they are poor quality.</li>
            <li> I use e.l.f.&#x27;s eyelid primer as a base to help it stay longer (may seem strange, but it works) and</li>
            <li> so you never get bored.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> awful some were short pencils.</li>
            <li> SAVE your money and go to sephora and buy their liners if MAC is too expensive for you.</li>
            <li> YOU CANT GO WRONG FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> omg I&#x27;m obsessed</li>
            <li> A lot of repeat  colors, I hated the glitter lip liners and the retractable ones that you get are small.</li>
            <li> -- I would recommend them if you like changing up your look on occasion but don&#x27;t want to spend boat loads on crazy colors</li>
            <li> otherwise I feel like I am stabbing my lip.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s impossible to sharpen these without losing a lot of liner.</li>
            <li> I didint expect the quality of the lip liner it not good , its horrible</li>
            <li> i was so shocked by the quality.</li>
            <li> I hate to give a bad review</li>
            <li> I feel like I threw my money out the window in having bought these. :(</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> The glitter ones are horrible.</li>
            <li> , it looks terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely worth the money! A lot of people say you get too many browns but I don&#x27;t feel that there were actually that many. I love the variety of colors and that I have a liner that will always suit whatever color i&#x27;m wearing! (:</li>
            <li> A lot of pencils.  I got this a a present for my wife she loves them.</li>
            <li> really liked the color and consistency.  The glide on easily.</li>
            <li> I received this package earlier than anticipated, which was definitely a plus. The colors are amazing and awesome variety from neutrals to pinks and purples and they were truly 54 pcs.  The only downside was that some one the pencils were of different lengths, especially the the four that I took a picture of (not including the retractable ones). I really don&#x27;t know why those 4 were sharpened extremely short. But other than that, I was overall satisfied with this purchase. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> They come in 4 plastic bags separated by shades, they have great variety of colors, and they are actually very nice and soft to work with, they slide easily in ur skin, i love them!! There are 15 glittery ones but not of them are so glittery... Also 46 are regular size and 8 are little bit smaller, and i only received 2 repeated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this lip liners! They are the best thing... Totally recommend it. Lip liners are in my daily routine there for with this purchase I&#x27;m extremely happy. Love how they come in different shapes and styles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving these lip liners. Definitely worth the $27.</li>
            <li> Love having such a selection, as my lip liner &amp; lipstick is on daily.</li>
            <li> i loveeeeeee them all!!!! pretty good for the price !</li>
            <li> This is probably the best brand of lip liners I&#x27;ve come across, they are so creamy they can be used alone, and feel like a lipstick!  The color payoff is incredible!</li>
            <li> Birthday present for my daughter she was very happy.</li>
            <li> Great buy I&#x27;m loving all the different shades that came with it you can never have to many lip and eye liners great buy</li>
            <li> Honestly if anyone is skeptical about this product, don&#x27;t be! They are perfect and sharpened once they arrived I was super excited, they are great quality for the price, you might get some colors that you don&#x27;t want but overall they are a very buy and steal</li>
            <li> Just got them yesterday and I absolutely love them! There is so many for the price, they&#x27;re creamy, and they have great pigment! There were a few repeats but you have so many to choose from you barley notice. Also I got a few retractable ones so that was a plus. I wish there were more pinks and reds but overall they&#x27;re amazing!! I would definitely buy again :)</li>
            <li> When I first got the product I went through and segregated by color and found out there are definitely some duplicates in there...but not enough to get upset about. To fully review this product, let me provide some particulars about how I used them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I use e.l.f.&#x27;s eyelid primer as a base to help it stay longer (may seem strange, but it works) and&lt;br /&gt;2. I use them as full lip color, so basically lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here&#x27;s what I have to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nabi makes a quality product, there&#x27;s no doubt about that; here&#x27;s what I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My primer dims the vibrancy, but regardless if you take the &amp;#34;Apple Red&amp;#34; and put it straight on it&#x27;s not that vampy/retro/pinup red which is sort of the color it wants to mimic.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s matte. Usually implied as you&#x27;ll be going over top with a color that will cover that, so I&#x27;m not sure how much this matters to anyone; felt it needed to be stated though in case someone is looking for some great matte lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;3. And this is the kicker as it&#x27;s AWESOME: it wears off evenly. Which means, no it&#x27;s not an all-day product (again remember I&#x27;m using this as lipstick); but it&#x27;s refreshing that I don&#x27;t have to worry about random spots of color clinging to my lips and looking weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the only thing really bothers me, the majority of what you&#x27;re getting is brown variations. If I had to break it down, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re getting equal parts pink and red (so about 12 each) and the rest is brown. As a final note, if you can find the retractable lip liner version, go for those because they&#x27;re definitely more pigmented (I&#x27;ve used both with the primer and noticed a decent difference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. They sharpen well; you&#x27;re not sharpening only to have it break off and restart, then repeating the process.</li>
            <li> I Love these, such a great deal but I do wish it had more colors instead of so many brown shades.</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself because i love lipstick and lipliners. I was debating for a while if i should purchase these. I read all the reviews and most of them were really good so i thought i would trust the viewers and order them. I received them within 4 days after i purchased them. They work just as good as the NYX brand. The only thing i did not like is that i got some duplicates. There are alot of browns which i dont really wear so i was turned down a bit. I wish they had more pinks and corals maybe even purples! Theres 54 of these pencils so i know i wont be needing anymore lipliners for a while! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to start their makeup collection..you can always buy your favorite lipsticks and line them with these pencils. Overall i rated this product a 2 just because of the color selection and how i recieved alot of browns instead of pinks!</li>
            <li> You pay for what you get, really applies theses products. They feathered really bad,  and had no long wear to them at all.  The product crumbled easily upon use.  The colors on the end of the pencils didn&#x27;t match up to the the colors inside so picking the right color was difficult.&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price being so cheap I should have expected the poor quality of these.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiance she loved them and tries a different colour everyday. Not too  bold and just the right amount of colour for her.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the quality of this product. I won&#x27;t by it again.</li>
            <li> Lots of brown shades. One of my liners did not have a cap. That was very upsetting. I thought maybe the cap had fallen off but nope, no cap in the package. I didn&#x27;t anticipate the lip liners being two different sizes either. Oh well. They work though :)</li>
            <li> I Love It. Just As Described And The Colors Are AWESOME. Definitely I Would Highly Recommend This Product.</li>
            <li> I love the lip liners</li>
            <li> Amazing pigmentation! Amazing deal. Great buy! 👍🏻🙌🏻</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this set. It comes with just about every color you could possibly need and the quality is great!</li>
            <li> Love this set, price is awesome as well. lots of great colors for every occasion...i have been using them to cover my entire lips because lets be honest who has that many lipsticks to match all of those colors? LOL love the pinks and purples....do wish there wasnt as many browns but all is well :)</li>
            <li> I am very happy that i ordered these! I love love the lipliners all the colors are beautiful. I did get 2 of the same but out of 54 not bad. They go with my Kat Von D studded lipsticks perfectly. They are so creamy and go on like a dream. My lipstick stays put all day unless i eat something too greasy. I would most definately buy these again.</li>
            <li> Good quality lip liners, glides smoothly. Definitely a must-have for make-up lovers.</li>
            <li> MUST WATCH FOR MORE INFO    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;nrZudaZFjmE</li>
            <li> Its not that easy to apply but with the price cant beat it.Lots of similar color though.</li>
            <li> Great to have so many colors, its a keeper lots of fun!</li>
            <li> Nice selection of colors with no duplicates. Almost every shade of brown on the planet. However, it&#x27;s impossible to sharpen these without losing a lot of liner. Wish there was a dark red included.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very good quality, came in less than three days, and are super cheap</li>
            <li> absolutely loved these liners! no duplicates but lots of similar colors. Browns are my color so I&#x27;m glad majority were some shade of brown.... pretty good quality. totally worth it and a great starter kit. playing around with the pinks and nudes to see which I like best before I buy a more expensive brand, but might just keep buying this brand if they don&#x27;t break easily or if they last long.</li>
            <li> I think for the price it is a really good deal. As far as the colors go, well there were way to many browns, at least half of the colors were browns. So if you like brown go for it. Package was on time.</li>
            <li> Good product. Lots of color selections so you never get bored. Yes there are a lot of brown shades but they are actually pretty different from each other and slightly different than the color portrayed on the pencil. I was taken back by some of them (in a good way). I highly recommend these pencils. They are awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought these to put in a group of early teen aged girls&#x27; Christmas stockings.  Arrived in good condition and offered a good variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Loved the assortment I received. A great price for the quantity and quality received. I did not get any duplicates and all colors matched when they were uncapped. I also received 4 of the more premium lip pencils which are pretty fabulous.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! The colors are so smooth and I LOVE the darks. I&#x27;m such a huge fan of deep brown and red so if you love to wear dark lipsticks, this is the set for you :)</li>
            <li> Love these they are perfect love every color</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist in Houston, Tx and have used this product on myself and my clients everyday since ordering. Absolutely NO irritation, and after warming the colors on the back of my hand, the color pay-off is extremely pigmented. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS GREAT,,,DIDN&#x27;T QUITE LIKE THE APPLICATION.</li>
            <li> these are honestly amazing i would say they could be dupes for nyx lip liners some are lighter than i thought theyd be and i got like more browns than pinks which id prefer more pinks but over all i love this and would purchase again and or for gifts</li>
            <li> Love the quality and variety of colors!</li>
            <li> So, i gave this four stars just because i got half small pencils and half long pencils? Other than that I&#x27;m a very happy customer. I recieved my package very quickly and I can honestly say I feel like a little girl in a candy store...soooo many different colors to choose from!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Affordable! And good quality.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors repeated, and some were missing, was not what i expected. And most of the colors that was listed was not in the package.</li>
            <li> I have so many lipsticks, but I never wanted to spend a lot of money on just one lip liner.  These are perfect and literally come in every shade.  Although you do have to apply it pretty frequently, I really don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of colors and nice quality too.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality with repeat colors over and over. Some are 5 of the same. We all know that you will not get quality lip liners at that price. However they do work, just doesn&#x27;t last long. The glitter ones are horrible. End up with  glitter all over your face. Lots of brown but I use those as eyebrow pencils. I wouldn&#x27;t order again due to quality but it is fun having this many liners in my bathroom to choose from when applying make up.</li>
            <li> No I didn&#x27;t care for the quality at all,  I also didn&#x27;t care for the fact that some of the colors were retractable and some of the pencils were shorter than the rest of them.  The colors are also not that great,  they do not show up on the lips like I want them to. The glitter pencils were especially the worst, you can barely see them and really I have no use for them. There are also so many brows I mean really, why do I need so many browns.</li>
            <li> The colors r great  . There are a lot of browns I must say. Not sure how I can usw the glittery ones, some are very dark others are bearly pigment.  Over all... the buy was ok.</li>
            <li> Love them period they are a good investment I recommend them if you love lip liners</li>
            <li> these things can totally  be a cheaper alternative to NYX lip liners.  Their the same consistency and everything just different packaging.  Perfect if you cant afford NYX</li>
            <li> Worth the price and love the colors</li>
            <li> This was a great buy 54 colors to chose from. ...with a little lip balm they do great as lipsticks and they mix great with each other overall I had some minor problems but Nabisco customer service is amazing and products are great.  Would/  will buy again and recommend</li>
            <li> Colors are nice but not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Love these! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the products they are very pigmented great in quality lots of colors to choose from the shipping was also a breeze literally i ordered these on the 12th of july i received it on the 15th of july</li>
            <li> Had some trouble with the delivery of this product when the delivery man left my package outside without my consent. Luckily, Nabi quickly gave me a replacement. Great customer service. The lip liners are nice and long lasting. The only bad thing I would say is that they should have more reds and other colors in the pack. A little too many Browns.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that just got like 5 full size and the rest were little :/</li>
            <li> I wish the colors were more pigmented. It&#x27;s hard to use with a lip gloss over as the liners just rub away once anything is applied over it. They are pretty dry and do not line well. Love that it comes with A TON of lip liners but lets be real here: Quantity is NOT better than quality. Quality is lacking with these Nabi &amp;#34;High Quality&amp;#34; Lip Liners. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I ordered it twice</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product! Went on very smooth and good variety of colors although quite a few Brown&#x27;s in the bunch but still worth it. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> The quality of the pencils is quite good, expecially for the price. It is a fun thing to order for yourself or share with roommate, sister, friend, etc. There are a lot of pencils. I thought I got too many browns, by the color on the caps. Then I read the colors written on the pencils, and there were no duplicates. Some looked (by the color stripe on the end of the pencil) that they would be brown. But they said &amp;#34;plum, dark rose, grape&amp;#34;. I found that the color indicated by the NAME on the pencil to be accurate, not the color on the outside of the pencil.There are a lot of browns, but only about 1/2 what I originally thought. There are no reds, oranges. A lot of neutrals, but not all brown. Colors almost everyone can wear. There are only 6 out of 54, I can&#x27;t wear. I thought 2 were mistakes, they sent eye pencils. But they both said lip pencil. I won&#x27;t wear dark brown or  black/brown on my lips! But the fact I can wear 48 is amazing, and I like the texture of the pencil itself.</li>
            <li> Good quality item. I was very pleased with these lip liners. They go on very smoothly and last for a long time. I love the assortment of colors, and that there are a lot of browns (which I wear a lot of). They are quite comparable to Nyx, for a fraction of the price. Worth it!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it! I am beyond happy with this purchase! I was debating buying them for a while but im so happy I finally did!</li>
            <li> great pigmentation i was so shocked by the quality. it really stays i apply it once and im set for the day. i dont need to retouch with this lip pencils.</li>
            <li> I got these 54 shade lip liners yesterday , I used one of the pink color and I really liked it . it goes smooth and almost last good time but the things that I didn&#x27;t like , most of the color is darker color and very same colors . It was a few of same colors  so I have two or even three of the same color and again mostly dark ones . 24 of the liners is smaller size ( exactly half size ) and a few are mechanical . first I was thinking to return it but then I decided to keep it because it is good price when you breakdown the price , I may give away the colors that I don&#x27;t like or have more than one .</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors.. Great gift for the holidays</li>
            <li> Most are the same colors. Aren&#x27;t that pigmented. And their quite drying.</li>
            <li> Exactly 54 pieces!&lt;br /&gt;Last throughout the day, lovely mix of colours from dark to light. Shared some out with my sisters and they also love them! Would deffo purchase again would be even better if they were waterproof and less dry but still a lovely product.</li>
            <li> last long, flexible and so so easy to use. the fact that you get so many colors makes this that much more fun and worth the price</li>
            <li> Very waxy&lt;br /&gt;Poor product&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy</li>
            <li> Did swatches of all of them. They go on really nice, yes there are a lot of browns, not a fan, but I like about 50% of the colors, the ones that weren&#x27;t brown,  and for the price? It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> The lip liners are really pigmented and this is really worth your money. About half of the product is shorter than the other half, but I&#x27;m totally okay with that. I also got 5 retractable lip liners, which I love. Most of the colors are browns but you get your mauves, pinks, purples, and reds too which I was looking for! There was like 3 duplicates but it&#x27;s colors I would use a lot. I have light colored lips so, I look so dead without any colors on them Totally recommend</li>
            <li> All the colors are great and now I&#x27;m,more determined to find lipstick for all of them !</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use them :)</li>
            <li> Perfect! Everything and more ...</li>
            <li> Great product i am very pleased with my purchase thank you for your great service....</li>
            <li> I fell in love as soon a swatch these lip liners, they&#x27;re so pigmented, great quality and very affordable! If your in a look of lip liners set i would recommend you this product! also the shipping was very fast ! i just can&#x27;t say anything wrong about this product , it&#x27;s AMAZING!!!!! Definitely will purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Tons of colors, but  the lasting power varies from liner to liner</li>
            <li> awful some were short pencils. who sends pencils various sizes.</li>
            <li> colors are a little darker but i LOVE this product! deff a good buy!</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS LINERS. I MEAN THEY ARE GREAT FOR THE PRICE. I AM A MATTE KIND OF PERSON AND OF LOT OF THE LINERS HAVE GLITTER. OTHER THAN THAT GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I feel like a few...just a few weren&#x27;t all that great. But for the most part...I loved them!</li>
            <li> Lots of browns and reds that compliment brown girls. Love it. Some pinks were too sheer and glittery but they can also double as eyeliners. Must have for any makeup kit.</li>
            <li> Love these! Yes they do come with a lot of browns. But as a free lance makeup artist i think this set is great. I even wear these as lipsticks. They are creamy and I will definitely be purchasing these again in the future.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of browns in this pack. Besides that the colors are nice and I only had to reapply once for it to last all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get lip liners for a long time. I saw a girl use them in a tutorial as a regular kind of lipstick, so when I found this deal, I took it. They just arrived today and I&#x27;ve already tried out several. They are alight for the price. They have a soft tip, but when I was applying it too my lip, the color was hard to get on... I had to really press hard to get the color to actually show up and I was using the dark colored lip liners for this and my lips aren&#x27;t even dark. When I got closer to the mirror to see how it looked I could still see my original lip color underneath and they made my lips  appear extremely chapped, even though they weren&#x27;t... After putting on some lip gloss it made them look better though.&lt;br /&gt;For the price they are pretty great though. I had a few duplicates and even though I need to reapply them every so often, it&#x27;s not that bad, at least for me. They were a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li> They look nice and there are a lot of different colors but they do not come on easley. You may have to wet them a little and even then it&#x27;s still hard. Wish they were a little bit softer then they&#x27;d be worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Love it so many colors for a good price! They work really great if I bought lip liners at the store I wouldve gotten a few for 24 bucks this gives you more!</li>
            <li> I read reviews thought they would be worth it but they&#x27;re not received today and I swatched all on my hand and they look so good! But one I started to use on my lips they were pigmented at all and were harsh on my lips</li>
            <li> This product was really great, I was a little skeptical because of the price but they are totally worth it. They are super creamy, though they do need to be sharpened first because the tips are a little dried out. I also got a few colors that weren&#x27;t listed, I still only got 54, but 54 colors are not listed on the description. I only didn&#x27;t get one color listed, 56 lilac glitter, that I was looking forward to but that&#x27;s no big deal. The color selection is good, but there are a lot of browns.</li>
            <li> Love it and the price is the best</li>
            <li> these lip liners are so amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;and for the price...its incredible, ill be repurchasing again! the shipping was fast also!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price point for what you get! Love it!</li>
            <li> These and the 60 PC round lipstick set were purchased for me by my husband, and I could not be more pleased!! These liners are smooth, don&#x27;t skip, creamy, pigmented, and long-lasting.  I was skeptical about the glitter shades, but they actually turned out to be my favorite colors!  I definitely recommend this product to any makeup lover!</li>
            <li> I like these but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. It is a really great price if you use all the colors but I mostly received browns which I am never going to use. Also, I received about 8 glittery pencils. I don&#x27;t want glittery lips. But I  love the other pencils and I use them to fill in my whole lip and it works like a matte lipstick that lasts for hours</li>
            <li> You should definitely consider buying this set of lip liners! The shipping was incredibly fast (2 days :D). The pigmentation looks wonderful. The application is very smooth and wearing it with a top coat of clear lip gloss is to die for! The price is great for the value of these products.</li>
            <li> I was worried about purchasing this because of the mixed reviews but I did it anyways. I am just now starting to care about putting on makeup and what not and by doing so can end up spending a lot of money on different products. Getting these lip liners will save you money. Yes there are more brownish colors in the mix but you can coat it with a lipstick to create a new color. I personally like using them to color the whole lip and it looks good just like that.</li>
            <li> Love love love these lip liners they are long and last such a long time I highly recommend them I use them on my clients and they absolutely love them ! deffinetly buying more</li>
            <li> I love them. Yea it has alot of browns but great for me cause i like all the browns. I recomen to buy them.</li>
            <li> Great color pay off, excellent pricing. Overall great quality.</li>
            <li> for the price, this really gives you a lot of options. several of the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant or deep as i&#x27;d like, but it really does give you a variety to choose from. great packaging, fast shipping -- I would recommend them if you like changing up your look on occasion but don&#x27;t want to spend boat loads on crazy colors you won&#x27;t wear very often.</li>
            <li> Great color ! Soft pencil ! Get to go with there 34 lipstick package ! 💕</li>
            <li> Good price and colors</li>
            <li> Loved the liners!!! Very good pigmentation!!!!</li>
            <li> Almost all the colors were dark there was only one nude and one skin tone color in the pack everything else were different shades of brown from dark to light and purples and pinks</li>
            <li> Cheap quality, lots of browns, not made in the USA. Save your money and buy something else!</li>
            <li> So yep you get a tons of lip liners. There are 54 pcs but you get two of each color. One full size one purse size. I am not disappointed even with 27 colors I have enough to have plenty of variety. There are colors to suit all skin tones. I am loving them. They are very sharp so when I use anew color i roll the tip on the back of my hand to round it otherwise I feel like I am stabbing my lip. They last mmmmmm... not all day but a good long while. The colors are well saturrated with pigments so you get a nice even color consistancy on your lips. It is easy to blend colors. The go on nice enough to wear by itself or just a bit of lip balm or go all out and pair with a lipstick  or gloss. I am having a good time playing with the colors and learning different lip liner techniques.</li>
            <li> Good but breaks easily. Too many of same colours</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed the variety of colors and the quality of the pencils. There are a couple of repeats but luckily my friend purchased this as well and we did some trading. Will be trying other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> this lip liners and the customers svc are great 15 stars for them</li>
            <li> The orden Didn&#x27;t get to me at the time it was estimated. I am not from the states so I could not even try them due to the delay and I had to leave.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably good deal!</li>
            <li> Great product very pigmented!!!!!</li>
            <li> OMG I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT MY PURCHASE. LOL THEY CAME TODAY SO EARLY ARRIVAL IS A PLUS AS WELL.A WHOLE DAY BEFORE.FIRST IMPRESSION THEY ARE GREAT.ONLY TWO COLORS I HAD RESPECT ON.TO ME THAT OKAY.I STILL LOVE THEM THEY ARE SMOOTH AND GLIDE WELL.I LOVE THAT THEY ARE MATTE.THEY WILL GO WELL WITH MY M.A.C LIPSTICKS I BOUGHT FOR FALL.WILL BE PURCHASING AGAIN AS WELL AS RECOMMENDING TO FRIENDS.SO CHEERS TO MY NEW ADDITION TO MY LOVE LARGE MAKEUP COLLECTION</li>
            <li> I got two eye liners but that was it. There were no duplicates</li>
            <li> Ask different colors. Some are smoother gliding than others as they have different brandings mixed in but this was a great buy for great looks</li>
            <li> I only got 47 . Not 54 . Like it said</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them yet but they look very good for the price. The only thing is that I got two of the same color and is not that i recived 55 pcs, i got exactly 54. But it&#x27;s ok I have a lot to choose from.</li>
            <li> WOW.. WHAT AN ARRAY OF COLORS!! The product itself is good quality and extremely affordable</li>
            <li> My rating based on just getting an email from them apologizing for the shipping delay, and the repeated colors and refunding me $10.  The product itself is fine, goes on well and stays on decently.  I got a mix of solid pencils and retractable pencils, which isn&#x27;t mentioned anywhere in the description, but I&#x27;m fine with the mixture. I would have preferred not so many shades of brown!</li>
            <li> I just received my 54 piece lip liners in the mail I&#x27;m totally in love!! I have swatched most and they go on super easy! It came in before the actual delivery date. I also ordered the 60 piece round lipstick and 24 piece eye and brow liners but have yet to received them.</li>
            <li> Okay so I totally love these lip liners. They&#x27;re very smooth; easy to sharpen. My cousin bought this for me and it&#x27;s honestly the best gift I&#x27;ve ever received in the mail. Mine also came with 8 retractable ones. I recommended get  the retractable ones. They are AMAZING. The negative about this is that there are many shades of brown. I personally love it but not everyone will. I recommend putting a bigger variety of shades!</li>
            <li> Holy cow there are 54 of them. They seem to cover well and there&#x27;s a wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY disappointed!  Majority were very dark lip liners.  Will never purchase from this seller again!</li>
            <li> A makeup junkies ,,,,,Was not at all what I expected, save time and money just 10 or 11 pencils is good but others pencils very bad the same colors and hard when you put it . Do not waste money on this! Seriously....</li>
            <li> Honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to be this good. Very nice colors! There are some duplications, but with there being 54 I wouldn&#x27;t expect there not to be.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these lip liners, I even use them as lipstick by coloring in my lips and then applying a gloss.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was very skeptical that these pencils would be of good quality, especially considering the low price. I absolutely hate using lip pencils that are hard and don&#x27;t go on smoothly. These pencils are very smooth, thank goodness! I have noticed that a few shades are repeated, and many of the 54 pencils  are a shade of brown. I&#x27;m still very pleased with my purchase. I have never had such a variety of shades, including glitter-infused ones. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and feel the product is good but there really ARE a lot of browns. The browns are very, very similar and many look the same.  I cannot complain about the quality, delivery or the product but I wish there were more color options.  More mauve, purple, few pink hues and not many warm colors in red, orange, and warmer pink shades.  Due to the high number of brown shades I think these are better suited for a medium to dark complexion than a fair to light complexion.  You&#x27;ll have enough in the brown family to share with friends as they are very similar in color. The ad does show the colors well so really look at the hues.</li>
            <li> I hate to give a bad review i always give 5 star but... i am very sad with thjs purchase the colors do not show on my lips it wipes off super easy it&#x27;s a waste of money i am not happy wish i could say possitive things about this product.</li>
            <li> great quality lip pencils NYx dupes BUT BETTER!</li>
            <li> What am I missing here?  Everybody says these pencils are great but my experience with them has been horrible.  Too many light colors come in the pack and they are basically useless for lining lips.  The ones that are dark enough to line lips...the color doesn&#x27;t go on smooth for me and when I sharpen the pencils, the crayon falls apart.  I feel like I threw my money out the window in having bought these. :(</li>
            <li> I didint expect the quality of the lip liner it not good , its horrible I really dont recomened it .</li>
            <li> Colors are amazing! Although some stated that the received doubles of some colors, I recieved 54 fun different colors. Product doesn&#x27;t last long (maybe an hour and a half) but it&#x27;s nice to be able to have so many different shades</li>
            <li> Love this product every color is long lasting ..works well with my complexion</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price!</li>
            <li> We got this product in very reasonable price and product quality is according to expectations. I would highly recommend it. By the way I bought this for my wife and this review is based on feedback from her:)</li>
            <li> Unbelieveable buy, Great Colours, would recommend .</li>
            <li> What an awesome deal for the price</li>
            <li> Great liners, some are softer than others, so far though good purchase. I won&#x27;t need liners for a while. They are not dark enough for under the eye as a gel liner would be, but for the price- you can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li> Bought this set to use on clients because of the great variety, and I&#x27;m glad I did! My fellows estheticians looove them and are ordering for themselves. I do wish there was a wider variety of reds, particularly dark red.. Also, there are few mauves or purples in general. But still, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Brought it for my granddaughter and she is in love, she love them and she highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them that much.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this set because of the low price and unknown brand. After reading the reviews I decided to give them a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. There are 50 pencil liners and 5 retractable liners. There are 6 repeat pencils but it shouldn&#x27;t be a deterrent when looking at the set. It has a lot of darker colors and varying shades of pink. Whether you&#x27;re a makeup artist or just starting out with makeup, I&#x27;d suggest the set because it has so many colors and wears very well. So far, these have worn as well as my Mac liners and I believe these are cruelty free, too. They could also double as eyeliner if they last well on your skin. I&#x27;ve included photos of what the set looks like in the packaging, lined up and swatched. My only negatives are the repeat colors and half of the liners being smaller, but it&#x27;s still a good set to invest in. The liners with the color facing up are the repeats in my set so you can get an idea.</li>
            <li> I love the combo that these lip liner pencils come in … some are pencils and some are twist up</li>
            <li> A lot of browns but great quality lip liners! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> I received 54 lipliners, and there was so many repeated colors with same numbers. in the picture it also shows that there should be atleast 10-15 colors with glitters but in actual there were only 5 lip colors with glitters. So many colors were missing such as pinks. 80% were brown same brown. Not happy with the purchase. In actual I only received 38 different colors rest 16 were repeated3-4 times.</li>
            <li> Really liked this product too!! Just don&#x27;t care for dark lip liners other than that I loved it.</li>
            <li> Good product gave four stars because it has a lotttt of browns. I wear them as lip color too and it last longer than most of my other products.</li>
            <li> Amazing highly recommend</li>
            <li> I was really satisfied with all these lip pencils, they were cheap and worth it</li>
            <li> there are about 15 good colors but most are brown&lt;br /&gt;i am using like 10 of them (pretty colors)&lt;br /&gt;there are about 5 glitter ones&lt;br /&gt;and soo many brown ones!</li>
            <li> So i got these today i was so excited. They got shipped pretty quickly.  Got them way before the expected delivery date. I tried most of them on and i love them. The colors are super pigmented. You get great color pay off, and they go on smoothly. Ill have to see how they do during the day when it comes to how lasting they are but they should be okay with a lip primer.  I got all 54 the only thing was that i did get repeats (like two or three colors....only reason i gave them 4 stars) and some of them were the retractable ones. Other then that they were great specially for the price. Definitely will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> The only reason im giving it two stars is because two of them came without a cap. BUT i really dont care since all the colors are BEAUTIFUL and i only recieved two repeated</li>
            <li> Not as creamy as nyx but great for the price, if you want it to be creamier while applying it, just take a lighter to the tip for about 4 seconds</li>
            <li> Very nice lip pencils. I love that you get so many for not so much. They are pretty smooth on the lips and they are definitely pigmented. Some of the glitter shades are frosted and glide on very well. The glitter really isn&#x27;t that noticeable, which to me, makes them more wearable. There aren&#x27;t many glitter shades if you aren&#x27;t into that. Some of the shades repeat, so be aware. I like that they do because I&#x27;ll probably use those shades a lot.</li>
            <li> These are highly pigmented, long-lasting, vibrantly colored pencils.  I am incredibly pleased with the quality and price and can confidently recommend this collection!</li>
            <li> excellent buy, very beautiful and lasting colors. recommended! !</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before ordering and I am very happy that I ordered these liners; they are really good and creamy and easy to apply. I received 54 pencils as it stated and some were retractable which was fine. I only received two duplicates which was perfectly fine I will definitely use them all. I received the package in a timely fashion actually it arrived sooner than expected which was awesome. I would certainly recommend trying these out.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this collection. They go on smooth, are easy to apply and blend! The only reason I went with 4 stars is because I dislike how many browns there are. However, for the price it is still and excellent and recommended buy!</li>
            <li> Received my package today!! They are perfect! I am excited!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I am in love with these lip liners they have a great color to all of them which is great the only thing is there was some repeated colors and some where tinny but other then that they are great</li>
            <li> Fun is all I can say and they stay on!</li>
            <li> These lipliners are amazing , I will never run out! The quality is great. I&#x27;m highly impressed on the color payoff and the variety of browns. I&#x27;m a neutral/dark lippie type of girl so having all these shades of brown is truly great. The customer service is superb as well. They are very consistent with replying to emails and are very professional. I would highly recommend these lipliners to my girlfriends and I will also be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li> Here is a Review on My Youtube Channel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;BYD_UFkoKd8</li>
            <li> I love these lip liners they are perfect if ur just starting ur kit cant ask for more for that price will recommend that to anyone</li>
            <li> Ive personally have boughten these lip liners (individually) in the past. I love them because for one the price is amazing I usually buy them for a dollar, and two I can always compare them to MAC lip liners or NYX lip liners. They last forever literally and the application stays on matte. I was so happy when I saw this great haul on Amazon, but sadly I only received 43 of them not 54 a bummer but I am content with them, yes there are many browns but they are lovely! There is a variation of colors not just browns like many people claim there is. I hope the seller contacts me because I&#x27;m upset i did not receive all 54</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving these lip liners so many colors to choose from .yes there are a lot of browns but there like different Browns but hey it&#x27;s worth the price !  They go on smoothly and  has good pigmentation .Definitely worth buying .i wasn&#x27;t sure if I should order them because of reviews but I went ahead and it was worth it!</li>
            <li> Such a deal! Reds, browns, mauve,  pinks, nudes, purples and glitter! Comparable to nyx. I am very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> All the colors are beautiful and all 54 lip pencils came complete and very very fast shipping</li>
            <li> They arrived a day before scheduled delivery which I thought was a plus on Amazon&#x27;s part. Many many different colors to choose from and I am more of a dark lip kind of a girl so I had no problem with the many browns and dark shades. They only problem I may have had was the application was a little harder to do, and I kind of expected them to just glide on so it takes a little long to apply. Colors are very pigmented and do have a matte finish except for the glitters of course. Over all very good product! You can&#x27;t beat 54 pcs of lip liners.</li>
            <li> Love them great variety&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast!!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too many browns, but other than that the red/pinks were perfect since I have a bunch of different shades of these two colors</li>
            <li> I love them all :))  I wear them everyday if I feel like going out a wear a red when I&#x27;m going to the store I wear a not to bright color  I love them</li>
            <li> A lot of repeat  colors, I hated the glitter lip liners and the retractable ones that you get are small. The color doesn&#x27;t stay when you use the lip liners by themselves and if you put too much product on it becomes lumpy and gritty feeling. These are ok, but not good for long wear, even under a lipstick.</li>
            <li> The price was perfect, quick delivery. About 8 of the colors have 2 of the same color, and some pencils are mechanical.</li>
            <li> Love this item!!! Arrived quickly. I have a lot more options than I really need, but love it! Great price. Liner goes on smooth and perfect every time .</li>
            <li> They are great! But i do have to say the shipping was late and i only got 49 pencils</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I saw a bunch of good reviews and I wrote a good review my self after swatching these liners once they were delivered to me.... they are poor quality. When you apply any of the liners they leave a residue like a crayon does on a piece of paper. SAVE your money and go to sephora and buy their liners if MAC is too expensive for you. I regret this purchase so much. I tried wearing them and I just can&#x27;t, it looks terrible. I exfoliate my lips and moisturizer my lips before application, so it is not my lips that are the problem, the liners are the issue.</li>
            <li> The best lip liners you will ever find..</li>
            <li> They were really nice only thing was sinew came in 2 of the same color. Other than that I really liked them!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Love all the colors can use almost all of them.</li>
            <li> Great colors! A lot of browns though</li>
            <li> Amazing! Will buy again! Such a good value!</li>
            <li> Surprise at the quality!</li>
            <li> Looooooove them! Good selection and not drying. Shipping was amazingly fast! Well worth the little bit of money they cost. Have already told friends about them.</li>
            <li> These are pretty awesome! They arrived before the expected delivery date so that&#x27;s a plus! Yes they give you more brown shades than anything else but they are all different and even thought Im trying to go for different colors I always tend to fall back to the brown shades so I&#x27;m pretty happy with these, they last long and I actually have used just the liner on my whole lips because I didn&#x27;t have a lipstick that matched the color liner and it worked really well. Definitely a good deal I recommend it 100% actually buying them again for my sisters bday. Only thing I was sad aboutwas one of the liners didn&#x27;t have a cap.</li>
            <li> The pencils themselves are great they go on super smooth and most have a pretty nice matte finish. I rated them 2 stars though because more than half of the pencils are browns. I thought that there&#x27;d be a lot more pinks or reds, maybe even purples, but was kinda dissapointed. Another fault with this product is that the pencils come in 4 packs of &amp;#34;12&amp;#34; what that means is that per pack they cram in about 1-2 pencils that are half the size of the rest so they can add up to the total of 54.&lt;br /&gt;Great pencils, crappy color range (unless all you wear is different shades of brown), not the best packaging style.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, thank you!!</li>
            <li> Loved them! Came in so many colors, mostly browns and pinks tho.</li>
            <li> great. you will get your money worth</li>
            <li> I love them. The colors are very nice looking and it was smooth to go on</li>
            <li> I AM INLOVE WITH THIS!! NOT TO MENTION THE PRICE POINT IS AMAZING ! I AM A FREELANCE MUA AND THIS IS A MUST HAVE THE QUALITY OF THE PENCILS ARE GREAT SOME ARE PENCIL SOME ART THE ONES YOU SCREW UP WHICH I LOVE ! I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE ! YOU CANT GO WRONG FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Great variety of colors! As said with the other reviewers there is a lot of brownish tone colors but that is what my sister and I were looking for! Lasts all day when worn under lipstick. Great quality compared to my high end lipliners👍🏼</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth the money! But if ISNT no MAC so you get what you pay for. I&#x27;d buy it for a friend.</li>
            <li> Great price for the quality. Some of them work well and some don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Even for this brown hue lover, Way too many Browns. But over all, I now own a liner pencil for every lipstick and lipgloss I own... That&#x27;s a lot!!! Even great alone with my fav lipglass</li>
            <li> There are a lot of different browns, but the pencils are all different. The colors are all perfect. PLUS there&#x27;s six pencils that are a little glittery, the rest are regular liner colors ranging from pinks, to reds, deep purple, rose colors, really nice browns and so on. ALL neutrals of course. Really good selection. Love them all!!!</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described. Glides on lips smoothly and the colors are excellent. Yes a few that look a like but still worth the investment</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago, no duplicates. I absolutely love it! I don&#x27;t ever write reviews, but this deserved one. The only downfall is the fact that there are a lot of brown. However, you can&#x27;t really complain because the price is amazing for how pigmented mine are. The actual length on them are great also.</li>
            <li> Much of the same Color. Still good tho.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little bit iffy about ordering nabi lip liners considering I&#x27;ve never used the product before. I am a pro artist who uses high end products such as mac, nars, Chanel, etc. these lip liners are amazing! Comparable to nyx, a bit similar to mac. The product itself is very opaque, smooth, and stays on. After doing swatch tests on my hand and lips the product wouldn&#x27;t come off which is the best. YES THEIR IS 54 LIP LINERS! The only thing I really didn&#x27;t understand was I got about 6 smaller sizes of lip liners and the rest were full size. Can&#x27;t complain for almost 30 bucks it&#x27;s pretty much a steal!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!! can be worn alone or with nabis beautiful lipsticks, so affordable, got to me in time, creamy, great color payoff, many colors to chose from, worth the buy!!!</li>
            <li> It is came on time.Love the lip liner it last a long time.Will buy it again :):)</li>
            <li> Bought for my girlfriend. Worth the money and saves her time shopping</li>
            <li> Literally my favorite lip liners. omg I&#x27;m obsessed</li>
            <li> These were amazingly creamy and I love the assorted colors. This is a must buy.</li>
            <li> I love these colors....</li>
            <li> Great colors and price, cheaper than the dollar store plus tons to choose from... Solid purchase</li>
            <li> I must say, I love these lip pencils and the 60 lipsticks. I must say a great product!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really give you 54 just saying , they give you 40 although the colors do stand out , you have to retouch very often it runs very fast and I&#x27;d recommend you nyx , seriously you get what you payed for</li>
            <li> Some of them were great color payoff, some of them were so hard to put on. I think it&#x27;s a great price. I&#x27;ve used most of them.</li>
            <li> I got 52 lip liners and 2 eyeliners which were a glitter green and glitter black, honest mistake, they all look the same. Out of the 52 however more than half were an assortment of browns and orangey-browns. There are about 9 colors that I am in love with and they aren&#x27;t too bad when it comes to quality. The lighter colors are hardly pigmented and the glitter ones are pretty dry and they skip. You get what you paid for!</li>
            <li> Such a great deal! Tons of shades!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,  amazing colors and the pencil is long very worth it , I&#x27;m one happy camper (:</li>
            <li> These are amazing!! Every color you need is here!! The colors are very nice and last. Don&#x27;t think these will be cheap based on price. These are great liners and very comparable to liners way more expensive. Love these and will purchase again no doubt.</li>
            <li> Some of the lip liners are shorter than the others, about 6-8 out of the 54, but overall love them!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of &amp;#34;browns&amp;#34; but what nobody is saying is that on pale skin those &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; colors look very purple/magentaish. There are some browns that actually look brown against my skin but most look purpley!  And as for the quality, they&#x27;re as good as anything you&#x27;d get from a drug store (I think a little better) .</li>
            <li> Thank you!  Super fast shipping... and I loved the liners. They go on easy and smooth and the color is great!</li>
            <li> I accidentally deleted my first review . But I absolutely LOVE these liners . They go on so smooth . If you&#x27;re thinking about buying them , do it ! You won&#x27;t regret it . I was hesitant at first cause there are so many but once I got them I fell in love . I ordered them like a week ago &amp; they came in before expected ! So that was a plus .&lt;br /&gt;I gave the brown colors away to my friends because I don&#x27;t they look good on me cause I&#x27;m so white , but my friends love them .&lt;br /&gt;Also , if you&#x27;re a fan of glitter you&#x27;ll love the glittery ones , but personally I don&#x27;t like glitter .&lt;br /&gt;But al the pinks , reds , purples , etc . they&#x27;re just perfect !! Definitely will buy again .</li>
