            <li>Welllll, what can you say, these wipes are pretty awesome for what they do.</li>
            <li>to buy more or these and the price quadrupled!</li>
            <li>First these are the best wipes that I have used.</li>
            <li>Vey effective and makes unpleasantly more pleasant.</li>
            <li>The cloths work and smell amazing.</li>
            <li>No, they don&#x27;t turn you into some kind of boardroom superstar or a swarthy lothario.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll tell you honestly.</li>
            <li>a more masculin fregrance, good packaging.</li>
            <li>These are nice.</li>
            <li>Nice manly scent</li>
            <li>Nice price too.</li>
            <li>Soothing and effective</li>
            <li>these were handy , did not care for the scent so gave most away, but my biggest problem was getting out of the package, i always ended up grabbing four or so.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent and they do a good job of removing sweat.</li>
            <li>Wow, these are awesome.  </li>
            <li>Great product to have while traveling to keep everything fresh.</li>

            <li>I just want a nice, easy scent, maybe like a dove soap bar.</li>
            <li>nice light fragrance abd work well</li>
            <li>The packaging is appealing and the price is well within what I&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li>replace a shower, but is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>Also, they work well on dogs to make them smell better without bathing them.</li>
            <li>but I found these to be a substantially better option price per wipe</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li>I have used the ones my wife buys for herself and they are okay</li>
            <li>Even though I have mostly used them at the gym, I have also pulled them out of my gym bag while at the office.  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying it grealty&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like taking more than 1 shower a day.</li>
            <li>Most of the wipes were not flushable and that was a turn off for me.</li>
            <li>I want to be able to flush it.</li>
            <li>If they could lessen the strength of the smell, these would probably get a better rating from me.</li>
            <li>Creamy and refreshing to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If they could lessen the strength of the smell, these would probably get a better rating from me.</li>
            <li>Creamy and refreshing to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the portable aspect of this item and that I can use it at home or on the go.</li>
            <li>i used all 6 packages and i just ordered 6 more</li>
            <li>They Smell Better -</li>
            <li>Sure, that&#x27;s a lot of wipes, but they store well under the sink, save me from having to re-order as often, and minimize the risk of running out.  </li>
            <li>Deployed soldiers just can&#x27;t have too many of this type of product.  </li>
            <li>All in all for the price you get an okay deal</li>
            <li>these are fantastic and get the job done with one wipe - quick and easy and smell great.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just nice to have around whenever I need to clean up.  </li>
            <li>They have a nice clean man scent.  </li>
            <li>Great deal, works well, not hard to remove from package as others state -</li>
            <li>Very convient, with a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>Ok so this is my fault for ordering using the android app where the descriptions arent so easy to read...</li>
            <li>Mild aftershave kinda smell that is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt so clean!</li>
            <li>I love how easy they are to use and how easy they are to transport.  </li>
            <li>which is probably one of the most important parts.  </li>
            <li>They smell great and masculine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad these were cheap.  </li>
            <li>The perfect tool for a quick cleanup when it&#x27;s not possible to take a shower.</li>
            <li>If it are more mild in its smell it would be a lot better</li>
            <li>The seal is strong, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying out and becoming sandpaper.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easily flushable.  </li>
            <li>they are easy to get out and don&#x27;t tear as easy as these do.</li>
            <li>They leave my hand smelling really strong, even after washing in the sink.</li>
            <li>They do what they were made for but smell too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>They leave my hand smelling really strong, even after washing in the sink.</li>
            <li>They do what they were made for but smell too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>but the fragrance is a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li>Has a strong perfume/cologne scent that I could do without but is fine otherwise</li>
            <li>They are much better lubricated than normal handy wipes.</li>
            <li>Give them a lighter, cleaner, less cologne like smell, and they would be almost perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Give them a lighter, cleaner, less cologne like smell, and they would be almost perfect for me.</li>
            <li>They have such a good smell to them not a girly fruity smell, but just a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>These little things are awesome!!!  </li>
            <li>These wipes are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for multiple uses as well!</li>
            <li>About 4 is needed to work effectively when the brand I use will work very well with 1</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell and the ease with which this product is used.  </li>
            <li>Finally a product I can buy and display and say proudly, &amp;#34;Yes</li>
            <li>This is important.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these.</li>
            <li>Shower facilities are not always available and these help keep you relatively clean between showers.  </li>
            <li>They have a good texture and are strong enough to avoid break-thru.</li>
            <li>I use them mostly for an armpit refresh when I&#x27;ve got to work two jobs with no shower between, so I don&#x27;t mind the scent, which isn&#x27;t really that strong.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this package in the mail.</li>
            <li>and you want to clean up after the bathroom, again...</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have a clean tush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to accidentally clean my rear with my hand.</li>
            <li>you have a clean feeling at all times and the smell is manely</li>
            <li>Its a clean, manly smell.  </li>
            <li>They give you that feeling that you are clean in all the right places!  </li>
            <li>I like everything about these, the price, the look of packaging(I&#x27;m big on if it looks good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to order more.</li>
            <li>and if you like the scent so much the better for you.</li>
            <li>had a friend that told me he would buy baby wipes to keep him smelling fresh and clean &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>These are bigger, smell better and the package recloses better.</li>
            <li>I went directly to Amazon to see if they were available, and of course they were and at a better price.</li>
            <li>Great way to freshen up or just clean up a spill or mess.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to all wipers&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting more when these run out</li>
            <li>They help get/keep you clean and the price is right.</li>
            <li>No lie, they smell clean without that baby smell (or in this case cheap cologne) and use witch hazel which I have to say really gets you cleaned up.</li>
            <li>Whether after...personal...activities, or just to freshen up a little, before these heavy-duty, great smelling wipes, guys had to rely on products meant for babies and women if they wanted a quick cleanup.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!!!</li>
            <li>I also wanted to be able to use a wipe that is strong enough for adults and still flushable.</li>
            <li>Its been 2 weeks since I received these little towelettes of joy.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I use these with Fresh Balls and I come home with the freshest...</li>
            <li>and she can&#x27;t detect anything except the fresh fragrance of these wipes.</li>
            <li>Wipes have a fresh scent and clean very well.  </li>
            <li>One day while surfing on Amazon, I came upon these Mangroomer Biz Wipes, the price was right</li>
            <li>I really like to feel clean and was hoping this item would be the answer for me.</li>
            <li>I own other Mangroomer products (The Mangroomer, which I highly recommend if you have back hair lol), and went on to their website because I had a friend that was interested in getting a Mangroomer for himself.</li>
            <li>I have very large hands</li>
            <li>I have very large hands</li>
            <li>Its a little overbearing, kind of like a cheap aftershave you would buy from the supermarket.</li>
            <li>Its a little overbearing, kind of like a cheap aftershave you would buy from the supermarket.</li>
            <li>I think if they smelled more natural and less like a cheap cologne, they would be much better.</li>
            <li>I think if they smelled more natural and less like a cheap cologne, they would be much better.</li>
            <li>they clean somewhat less effectively.</li>
            <li>I first purchased these from Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li>There was more, a lot more for only $4 extra.</li>
            <li>I agree with another reviewer who said it&#x27;s hard to grab just one out of the dispenser however it&#x27;s not enough of a problem for me to reduce my excellent five star rating.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish was different is an option to buy a plastic case that opens from the top for easy dispensing.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think this is the only good brand out there, but it definitely one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>They have a faint musk cologne smell and are great for freshening up and feeling totally clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do a whole lot of special manscaping or mangrooming, like the young guys do.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok as long as you don&#x27;t pay too much.</li>
            <li>They are easy enough to use.</li>
            <li>They are easy enough to use.</li>
            <li>I recommend getting a single pack to make sure you like the scent before getting the multi pack as the scent is much stronger than any store bought wipe.</li>
            <li>Great price for something not available locally... haven&#x27;t seen anything like these in store.</li>
            <li>The executive scent is fantastic because you don&#x27;t leave your business smelling or feeling like you just left your business!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Way to much cologne smell for me.</li>
            <li>The .delivery was very speedy.</li>
            <li>They are great at home with the only issue being that they are folded in such a way that only one comes out at a time.</li>
            <li>and it doesnt linger  really once you are dressed.</li>
            <li>and I am really liking them.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend really likes the smell too.  </li>
            <li>I know you will like them as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent, but didn&#x27;t so much for the womens version.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when these finally came back in stock</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have to think someone is being paid off to write good reviews, it&#x27;s not that the product is bad, it&#x27;s just that this product is so over priced.  </li>
            <li>I am a big guy that likes to feel and stay clean all the time.</li>
            <li>I just want to feel clean back there.</li>
            <li>I just want to feel clean back there.</li>
            <li>These personal wipes leave me feeling actually clean</li>
            <li>Most of the wipes I saw in the store were pretty small.</li>
            <li>but find that you kinda have to as you get a tad older...</li>
            <li>At first I thought the scent was a little strong, but I&#x27;ve grown to like it.</li>
            <li>I Recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Strong enough to use without a finger foul,,, yet gentle enough for a woman..</li>
            <li>Wow, Mangoomer really hit the mark on this product.</li>
            <li>so pretty much you can only use them at home or if you stick them in a backpack.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but the wipes just lay flat on each other</li>
            <li>The act of what they do is pretty much the same as a baby wipe or others</li>
            <li>My only complain would be that they do tear easily if you miss the lip of the next wipe.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The individual packs are easy to open up and re-seal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The individual packs are easy to open up and re-seal.</li>
            <li>At the same time, I don&#x27;t want to take a shower right before I work out either, just so I can come home and take one again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for guys who are hairy, heavy sweaters, workout enthusiasts, or just want to be clean!</li>
            <li>like the smell, it&#x27;s a little strong when you first open the bag</li>
            <li>On average, I&#x27;d wager men are a lot more gross than babies.</li>
            <li>I want a large enough wipe that will stay in between my hand and my &amp;#34;holy&amp;#34; area</li>
            <li>The scent is manly and masculine and not feminine at all.  </li>
            <li>They seem very durable and are moist enough for the packaging.</li>
            <li>These wipes have a Manly &#x27;Old Spice&#x27; kinda smell, not a childish baby</li>
            <li>They were delivered when promised, perhaps a day or two early.</li>
            <li>For starters, I think pouches like these keep the wipes moist for much longer than the plastic dispensers of the big national brands.  </li>
            <li>Say I&#x27;m at work where I dont have a private bathroom right off my private office?</li>
            <li>I am a big guy, so this item is very helpful on keeping me fresh down</li>
            <li>which usually I get out more than I need and getting them back in is a nightmare</li>
            <li>This is a high quality wipe; the wipes are thick, strong and come in a well designed package where they do not dry out.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the next wipe was lifted by the previous one like other wipes.</li>
            <li>; It smells more like really cheap bad cologne.</li>
            <li>If its to much per wipe the don&#x27;t buy it, simple enough.</li>
            <li>Poor packaging will likely doom an otherwise nice product.  </li>
            <li>Go to the bathroom, wipe with normal toilet paper and then wipe with one of these afterwards.</li>
            <li>Go to the bathroom, wipe with normal toilet paper and then wipe with one of these afterwards.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller for offering military shipping.</li>
            <li>Also, it is very convenient to use after you wipe with the dry toilet paper.  </li>
            <li>While it smells pleasant and performs well, it is nearly impossible to extract one from the packaging without tearing it.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say about these things is the fragrance isn&#x27;t bad.</li>

            <li> Perfect to have in the bathroom or in your car if you need a quick refresh.</li>
            <li> Best of all works well for keeping me nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> Great price for this many.  </li>
            <li> Great freshen up especially on hot, humid days.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Biz Wipes I just received.</li>
            <li> Good price, great scent, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Welllll, what can you say, these wipes are pretty awesome for what they do.</li>
            <li> to buy more or these and the price quadrupled!</li>
            <li> First these are the best wipes that I have used.</li>
            <li> Vey effective and makes unpleasantly more pleasant.</li>
            <li> The cloths work and smell amazing.</li>
            <li> No, they don&#x27;t turn you into some kind of boardroom superstar or a swarthy lothario.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll tell you honestly.</li>
            <li> a more masculin fregrance, good packaging.</li>
            <li> These are nice.</li>
            <li> Nice manly scent</li>
            <li> Nice price too.</li>
            <li> Soothing and effective</li>
            <li> these were handy , did not care for the scent so gave most away, but my biggest problem was getting out of the package, i always ended up grabbing four or so.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent and they do a good job of removing sweat.</li>
            <li> Wow, these are awesome.  </li>
            <li> Great product to have while traveling to keep everything fresh.</li>
            <li> way too strong and overpowering!  </li>
            <li> I just want a nice, easy scent, maybe like a dove soap bar.</li>
            <li> I just want a nice, easy scent, maybe like a dove soap bar.</li>
            <li> nice light fragrance abd work well</li>
            <li> The packaging is appealing and the price is well within what I&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li> replace a shower, but is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> Also, they work well on dogs to make them smell better without bathing them.</li>
            <li> but I found these to be a substantially better option price per wipe</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li> I have used the ones my wife buys for herself and they are okay</li>
            <li> Even though I have mostly used them at the gym, I have also pulled them out of my gym bag while at the office.  </li>
            <li> I am enjoying it grealty&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like taking more than 1 shower a day.</li>
            <li> Most of the wipes were not flushable and that was a turn off for me.</li>
            <li> I want to be able to flush it.</li>
            <li> If they could lessen the strength of the smell, these would probably get a better rating from me.</li>
            <li> Creamy and refreshing to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If they could lessen the strength of the smell, these would probably get a better rating from me.</li>
            <li> Creamy and refreshing to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the portable aspect of this item and that I can use it at home or on the go.</li>
            <li> i used all 6 packages and i just ordered 6 more</li>
            <li> They Smell Better -</li>
            <li> Sure, that&#x27;s a lot of wipes, but they store well under the sink, save me from having to re-order as often, and minimize the risk of running out.  </li>
            <li> Deployed soldiers just can&#x27;t have too many of this type of product.  </li>
            <li> All in all for the price you get an okay deal</li>
            <li> these are fantastic and get the job done with one wipe - quick and easy and smell great.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just nice to have around whenever I need to clean up.  </li>
            <li> They have a nice clean man scent.  </li>
            <li> Great deal, works well, not hard to remove from package as others state -</li>
            <li> Very convient, with a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Ok so this is my fault for ordering using the android app where the descriptions arent so easy to read...</li>
            <li> Mild aftershave kinda smell that is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt so clean!</li>
            <li> I love how easy they are to use and how easy they are to transport.  </li>
            <li> which is probably one of the most important parts.  </li>
            <li> They smell great and masculine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad these were cheap.  </li>
            <li> The perfect tool for a quick cleanup when it&#x27;s not possible to take a shower.</li>
            <li> If it are more mild in its smell it would be a lot better</li>
            <li> The seal is strong, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying out and becoming sandpaper.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easily flushable.  </li>
            <li> they are easy to get out and don&#x27;t tear as easy as these do.</li>
            <li> They leave my hand smelling really strong, even after washing in the sink.</li>
            <li> They do what they were made for but smell too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> They leave my hand smelling really strong, even after washing in the sink.</li>
            <li> They do what they were made for but smell too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> but the fragrance is a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li> Has a strong perfume/cologne scent that I could do without but is fine otherwise</li>
            <li> They are much better lubricated than normal handy wipes.</li>
            <li> Give them a lighter, cleaner, less cologne like smell, and they would be almost perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Give them a lighter, cleaner, less cologne like smell, and they would be almost perfect for me.</li>
            <li> They have such a good smell to them not a girly fruity smell, but just a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> These little things are awesome!!!  </li>
            <li> These wipes are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for multiple uses as well!</li>
            <li> About 4 is needed to work effectively when the brand I use will work very well with 1</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell and the ease with which this product is used.  </li>
            <li> Finally a product I can buy and display and say proudly, &amp;#34;Yes</li>
            <li> This is important.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these.</li>
            <li> Shower facilities are not always available and these help keep you relatively clean between showers.  </li>
            <li> They have a good texture and are strong enough to avoid break-thru.</li>
            <li> I use them mostly for an armpit refresh when I&#x27;ve got to work two jobs with no shower between, so I don&#x27;t mind the scent, which isn&#x27;t really that strong.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this package in the mail.</li>
            <li> and you want to clean up after the bathroom, again...</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have a clean tush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to accidentally clean my rear with my hand.</li>
            <li> you have a clean feeling at all times and the smell is manely</li>
            <li> Its a clean, manly smell.  </li>
            <li> They give you that feeling that you are clean in all the right places!  </li>
            <li> I like everything about these, the price, the look of packaging(I&#x27;m big on if it looks good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to order more.</li>
            <li> and if you like the scent so much the better for you.</li>
            <li> had a friend that told me he would buy baby wipes to keep him smelling fresh and clean &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These are bigger, smell better and the package recloses better.</li>
            <li> I went directly to Amazon to see if they were available, and of course they were and at a better price.</li>
            <li> Great way to freshen up or just clean up a spill or mess.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to all wipers&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting more when these run out</li>
            <li> They help get/keep you clean and the price is right.</li>
            <li> No lie, they smell clean without that baby smell (or in this case cheap cologne) and use witch hazel which I have to say really gets you cleaned up.</li>
            <li> Whether after...personal...activities, or just to freshen up a little, before these heavy-duty, great smelling wipes, guys had to rely on products meant for babies and women if they wanted a quick cleanup.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!!!</li>
            <li> I also wanted to be able to use a wipe that is strong enough for adults and still flushable.</li>
            <li> Its been 2 weeks since I received these little towelettes of joy.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I use these with Fresh Balls and I come home with the freshest...</li>
            <li> and she can&#x27;t detect anything except the fresh fragrance of these wipes.</li>
            <li> Wipes have a fresh scent and clean very well.  </li>
            <li> One day while surfing on Amazon, I came upon these Mangroomer Biz Wipes, the price was right</li>
            <li> I really like to feel clean and was hoping this item would be the answer for me.</li>
            <li> I own other Mangroomer products (The Mangroomer, which I highly recommend if you have back hair lol), and went on to their website because I had a friend that was interested in getting a Mangroomer for himself.</li>
            <li> I have very large hands</li>
            <li> I have very large hands</li>
            <li> Its a little overbearing, kind of like a cheap aftershave you would buy from the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Its a little overbearing, kind of like a cheap aftershave you would buy from the supermarket.</li>
            <li> I think if they smelled more natural and less like a cheap cologne, they would be much better.</li>
            <li> I think if they smelled more natural and less like a cheap cologne, they would be much better.</li>
            <li> they clean somewhat less effectively.</li>
            <li> I first purchased these from Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li> There was more, a lot more for only $4 extra.</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer who said it&#x27;s hard to grab just one out of the dispenser however it&#x27;s not enough of a problem for me to reduce my excellent five star rating.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was different is an option to buy a plastic case that opens from the top for easy dispensing.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think this is the only good brand out there, but it definitely one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> They have a faint musk cologne smell and are great for freshening up and feeling totally clean.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do a whole lot of special manscaping or mangrooming, like the young guys do.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok as long as you don&#x27;t pay too much.</li>
            <li> They are easy enough to use.</li>
            <li> They are easy enough to use.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting a single pack to make sure you like the scent before getting the multi pack as the scent is much stronger than any store bought wipe.</li>
            <li> Great price for something not available locally... haven&#x27;t seen anything like these in store.</li>
            <li> The executive scent is fantastic because you don&#x27;t leave your business smelling or feeling like you just left your business!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Way to much cologne smell for me.</li>
            <li> The .delivery was very speedy.</li>
            <li> They are great at home with the only issue being that they are folded in such a way that only one comes out at a time.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt linger  really once you are dressed.</li>
            <li> and I am really liking them.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes the smell too.  </li>
            <li> I know you will like them as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent, but didn&#x27;t so much for the womens version.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when these finally came back in stock</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have to think someone is being paid off to write good reviews, it&#x27;s not that the product is bad, it&#x27;s just that this product is so over priced.  </li>
            <li> I am a big guy that likes to feel and stay clean all the time.</li>
            <li> I just want to feel clean back there.</li>
            <li> I just want to feel clean back there.</li>
            <li> These personal wipes leave me feeling actually clean</li>
            <li> Most of the wipes I saw in the store were pretty small.</li>
            <li> but find that you kinda have to as you get a tad older...</li>
            <li> At first I thought the scent was a little strong, but I&#x27;ve grown to like it.</li>
            <li> I Recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Strong enough to use without a finger foul,,, yet gentle enough for a woman..</li>
            <li> Wow, Mangoomer really hit the mark on this product.</li>
            <li> so pretty much you can only use them at home or if you stick them in a backpack.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, but the wipes just lay flat on each other</li>
            <li> The act of what they do is pretty much the same as a baby wipe or others</li>
            <li> My only complain would be that they do tear easily if you miss the lip of the next wipe.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The individual packs are easy to open up and re-seal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The individual packs are easy to open up and re-seal.</li>
            <li> At the same time, I don&#x27;t want to take a shower right before I work out either, just so I can come home and take one again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for guys who are hairy, heavy sweaters, workout enthusiasts, or just want to be clean!</li>
            <li> like the smell, it&#x27;s a little strong when you first open the bag</li>
            <li> On average, I&#x27;d wager men are a lot more gross than babies.</li>
            <li> I want a large enough wipe that will stay in between my hand and my &amp;#34;holy&amp;#34; area</li>
            <li> The scent is manly and masculine and not feminine at all.  </li>
            <li> They seem very durable and are moist enough for the packaging.</li>
            <li> These wipes have a Manly &#x27;Old Spice&#x27; kinda smell, not a childish baby</li>
            <li> They were delivered when promised, perhaps a day or two early.</li>
            <li> For starters, I think pouches like these keep the wipes moist for much longer than the plastic dispensers of the big national brands.  </li>
            <li> Say I&#x27;m at work where I dont have a private bathroom right off my private office?</li>
            <li> I am a big guy, so this item is very helpful on keeping me fresh down</li>
            <li> which usually I get out more than I need and getting them back in is a nightmare</li>
            <li> This is a high quality wipe; the wipes are thick, strong and come in a well designed package where they do not dry out.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the next wipe was lifted by the previous one like other wipes.</li>
            <li> ; It smells more like really cheap bad cologne.</li>
            <li> If its to much per wipe the don&#x27;t buy it, simple enough.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging will likely doom an otherwise nice product.  </li>
            <li> Go to the bathroom, wipe with normal toilet paper and then wipe with one of these afterwards.</li>
            <li> Go to the bathroom, wipe with normal toilet paper and then wipe with one of these afterwards.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller for offering military shipping.</li>
            <li> Also, it is very convenient to use after you wipe with the dry toilet paper.  </li>
            <li> While it smells pleasant and performs well, it is nearly impossible to extract one from the packaging without tearing it.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing I can say about these things is the fragrance isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> When you open a new package it is tough to get the first 2 or 3 out without ripping them</li>
            <li> Occasionally I&#x27;ll mop up a sweaty groin - California has a long ball-sweat season -</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the last sheets start to dry out a little bit if you don&#x27;t use them quick enough.</li>
            <li> And the individual sheets are much smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Toilet paper is the Blackberry of 2013.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use them as a toilet paper adjunct.</li>
            <li> Drop it in the toilet and all gone!</li>
            <li> Drop it in the toilet and all gone!</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think the doom will take a long time in coming.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have long fingernails they can be tricky to grip and pull out of the package.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have long fingernails they can be tricky to grip and pull out of the package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even had my wife sniff all around after a long day of work</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not something that you&#x27;re going to be smelling long after use.  </li>
            <li> And finally, I like that these ship to military APO/FPO addresses.  </li>
            <li> The are like all wipes, a little hard to pull out the first several.</li>
            <li> These wipes aren&#x27;t any thicker, softer or better, as a matter of fact, buy the store brand that now are pop-up, because this item is not, it is difficult to get out of the package, without putting a little hole or tear in it.  </li>
            <li> Second, I prefer the smell of these to other brands.  </li>
            <li> It seems like packaging is sturdy as well because we&#x27;ve had the same package open for awhile and it hasn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li> It is slightly embarrassing to walk with these to a public restroom.</li>

            <li> and they don&#x27;t seem to hold up as well as other wet wipes.</li>

            <li> other than that</li>
            <li> I just think I will stick to other options.</li>
            <li> Not great - the scent is very &#x27;old man&#x27; ish</li>
            <li> Wish they had an option for single packets so I could throw a few in my backpack while I am at school or when I am at the airport.</li>
            <li> I think the smell leaves me thinking they will burn me if I scrub too hard back there with them but its probably just in my head.</li>
            <li> I think the smell leaves me thinking they will burn me if I scrub too hard back there with them but its probably just in my head.</li>
            <li> but really just some weird idea of what someone thinks smells &amp;#34;executive.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> They are thick enough</li>
            <li> The plus, they are soft and non irritating.</li>
            <li> other wipes have made me hurt before, but not these!</li>
            <li> but I just fold them in half to fix that.  </li>
            <li> I bought these over the ones I bought previously.</li>
            <li> are half that amount</li>
            <li> Save your money, go to the store and buy Cottonell or Charmin at about half the cost.  </li>
            <li> but as you use the wipes they become less fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will put a little tear in them trying to get them out.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will put a little tear in them trying to get them out.</li>
            <li> Usually use these after the gym as i dont have time to shower, smell is bad at all or overbearing leaves you feeling clean</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a few days now</li>
            <li> If you are a guy you need to have a few of these on hand..  </li>
            <li> Not a strong smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical of &amp;#34;flushable&amp;#34; claims by just about anything heavyweight enough to hold moisture, and I don&#x27;t want to test the lousy old plumbing in this building.</li>
            <li> I usually wake up in the morning, go to the bathroom, do my work</li>
            <li> and I have never had an issue with these being too small.</li>

            <li> Without exception, I have had to add tap water to those other wipes in the plastic dispensers because they dried out and started to become uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> but I never really liked the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy them again - my husband seems indifferent towards them!</li>
            <li> I mean...</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> I was working out in the yard the other day and wasn&#x27;t too dirty  </li>
            <li> Getting them out of the package is really impossible unless you have very long finger nails, but these are from &amp;#34;man groomer&amp;#34</li>
            <li> First let me say the scent is horrible.</li>
            <li> I mean, why didn&#x27;t someone think of this years ago!  </li>
            <li> You know what&#x27;s worse than a man using baby wipes?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly difficult to get one wipe out of the package to use it without it tearing.  </li>
            <li> If your worried about how it smells, then I suppose people are sniffing around in the wrong places.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to go to the gym feeling stinky or dirty.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of bad reviews because of the price, you know the price when you buy it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Basically just baby wipes with some cologne added. They&#x27;re ok as long as you don&#x27;t pay too much. No, they don&#x27;t turn you into some kind of boardroom superstar or a swarthy lothario.</li>
            <li> The perfect tool for a quick cleanup when it&#x27;s not possible to take a shower. I Recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Great deal, works well, not hard to remove from package as others state - it just takes a gentle tough and understanding of how the are dispensed</li>
            <li> these were handy , did not care for the scent so gave most away, but my biggest problem was getting out of the package, i always ended up grabbing four or so.</li>
            <li> The executive scent is fantastic because you don&#x27;t leave your business smelling or feeling like you just left your business! A lot of guys may initially feel a little uneasy about the idea of using a wipe but I&#x27;ll tell you honestly. Get over it and join this century these are fantastic and get the job done with one wipe - quick and easy and smell great.</li>
            <li> The packaging is a little big so pretty much you can only use them at home or if you stick them in a backpack. The packaging seems well designed, a fold away adhesive that reseals when you open it to take a wipe out.  They are thick enough so I have never gone threw with my hand which is probably one of the most important parts.  Not much of a scent.  When you open a new package it is tough to get the first 2 or 3 out without ripping them but I just fold them in half to fix that.  Best of all works well for keeping me nice and clean.  I see a lot of bad reviews because of the price, you know the price when you buy it.  If its to much per wipe the don&#x27;t buy it, simple enough.</li>
            <li> After years of buying the store brand flushable wipes for our bathrooms, I happened upon these and opted for a purchase.  I am not regretting it at all.  The scent is manly and masculine and not feminine at all.  This might be a turn off for some people putting them in their bathroom but they work great for us and our guests.  My only complain would be that they do tear easily if you miss the lip of the next wipe.  Otherwise, good quality and very pleasant scent!</li>
            <li> Great for on the go senerios. No time for shower.... No problem</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, but the wipes just lay flat on each other and it&#x27;s a pain in the keister to remove just one without tearing the wipe. So basically, it&#x27;s not like Kleenex where pulling one out will bring the next one available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I like them.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Great price for this many.  Has a strong perfume/cologne scent that I could do without but is fine otherwise</li>
            <li> Bought these instead of dude wipes. Wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Wipes have a fresh scent and clean very well.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> Very convient, with a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> a more masculin fregrance, good packaging. the individual package is easier to remove the wipes</li>
            <li> Guys, you KNOW you need this. Whether after...personal...activities, or just to freshen up a little, before these heavy-duty, great smelling wipes, guys had to rely on products meant for babies and women if they wanted a quick cleanup. No longer! Buy the case, and prepare to reorder. You&#x27;ll want to keep them in the bathroom, in your desk, in the car, and I even keep a package of them in the tail bag of my Harley (no jokes, please). Worth every penny. I&#x27;m reordering soon.</li>
            <li> nice light fragrance abd work well</li>
            <li> These are nice. Awesome value for the money. Gym Bag, Vehicle, Office Desk, Home, Camping... you name it.</li>
            <li> I first purchased these from Bed Bath and Beyond. They decided not to carry these anymore so I found them on Amazon and ordered them in this bulk package. These wipes have a multitude of uses. Using them after using the bathroom, freshening up when working out in the field or on a break during a motorcycle ride. The fragrance is man like not like baby wipes. I keep a package in the glove compartment of my cars and in my toiletry kits I use for travel. I agree with another reviewer who said it&#x27;s hard to grab just one out of the dispenser however it&#x27;s not enough of a problem for me to reduce my excellent five star rating.</li>
            <li> These wipes are fantastic.  Good price, great scent, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Welllll, what can you say, these wipes are pretty awesome for what they do. They have a pleasant smell, not too overpowering at all. They seem very durable and are moist enough for the packaging. It seems like packaging is sturdy as well because we&#x27;ve had the same package open for awhile and it hasn&#x27;t dried out. They&#x27;re great for multiple uses as well! Great price for something not available locally... haven&#x27;t seen anything like these in store.</li>
            <li> Best wipes around. I keep one at home and one at work. Great freshen up especially on hot, humid days. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this forever.  They smell great and masculine.  They&#x27;re easily flushable.  The packaging is appealing and the price is well within what I&#x27;d expect.  I&#x27;m definitely buying again when I run out.  The only thing I wish was different is an option to buy a plastic case that opens from the top for easy dispensing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mangroomer wipes for a couple years now.  They are excellent wipes and always help if you need a quick freshen up and don&#x27;t have time for a good shower.</li>
            <li> Way to much cologne smell for me. They should make an unscented product.</li>
            <li> I bought the product for my boyfriend because I use feminine wipes. The .delivery was very speedy. Came withing 2 days after ordering. It smells really good BUT its not resistant compare to what I use. About 4 is needed to work effectively when the brand I use will work very well with 1</li>
            <li> Ok so this is my fault for ordering using the android app where the descriptions arent so easy to read... What I thought I ordered was 6 boxes of 50 individually wrapped wipes... What Did I get, 6 packs of 50 wipes (bulk). WHat&#x27;s the big deal? Say I&#x27;m at work where I dont have a private bathroom right off my private office? So now I need to carry this pack of 50 wipes to the bathroom? How convenient is that?!? Say your on a date and you want to clean up after the bathroom, again... its 50 wipes per pack. SMH shoulda read closer... esp since I just bought a case of bulk wipes for home at a warehouse store... for 1/2 the price for 2x the qty...</li>
            <li> Not great - the scent is very &#x27;old man&#x27; ish and they don&#x27;t seem to hold up as well as other wet wipes. I would call them a semi-practical novelty item. I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy them again - my husband seems indifferent towards them!</li>
            <li> Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t replace a shower, but is the next best thing. Pleasant man smell as well.</li>
            <li> They are much better lubricated than normal handy wipes. The plus, they are soft and non irritating. The minus they clean somewhat less effectively. Use in combo with paper and you&#x27;ll have a clean tush. Also, they work well on dogs to make them smell better without bathing them.</li>
            <li> I bought these over the ones I bought previously. There was more, a lot more for only $4 extra. I like everything about these, the price, the look of packaging(I&#x27;m big on if it looks good I buy it), and the smell. They have such a good smell to them not a girly fruity smell, but just a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> These are exceptional wipes! I really enjoy the scent and they do a good job of removing sweat. Perfect for post workout or use in the bathroom. The only drawback is the size of the package 5&#x27;&#x27; x 3&#x27;&#x27; x 1&#x27;&#x27;, but I found these to be a substantially better option price per wipe then any other wipe on Amazon. I keep a pack at work, bedroom, bathroom, workout bag, and my golf bag.</li>
            <li> Started using wipes this year and they do make you feel a lot cleaner. These smell great. Only complaint is the last sheets start to dry out a little bit if you don&#x27;t use them quick enough. other than that a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to buy more or these and the price quadrupled! $84?! This is madness.</li>
            <li> Great to carry in the gym bag and in the car.  Nice manly scent so you dont run around smelling like a baby all day.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.  While it smells pleasant and performs well, it is nearly impossible to extract one from the packaging without tearing it.  Poor packaging will likely doom an otherwise nice product.  And, considering the cost is about $5 per package and competitive products are half that amount, I don&#x27;t think the doom will take a long time in coming.</li>
            <li> Overly Perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;Impossible to pull sheets out of package without tearing.  They sheet do not pop out.  Who thought that one through?</li>
            <li> I just recently received my order of MANGROOMER Biz Wipes!  Wow, these are awesome.  They give you that feeling that you are clean in all the right places!  I highly recommend for guys who are hairy, heavy sweaters, workout enthusiasts, or just want to be clean!</li>
            <li> Great smelling and does a good job of cleaning. Couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li> The leading edge of each sheet does not present itself.  One must pick and pinch at the sheets to get the next one to come out.</li>
            <li> I have used the ones my wife buys for herself and they are okay but they don&#x27;t compare to these. These are bigger, smell better and the package recloses better.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when these finally came back in stock so I could buy them again. Perfect to have in the bathroom or in your car if you need a quick refresh.</li>
            <li> These little things are awesome!!!  I mean, why didn&#x27;t someone think of this years ago!  I bought these on a whim and then started using them after gym workouts.  I love how easy they are to use and how easy they are to transport.  They fit perfectly into my bag or into my car console.  Even though I have mostly used them at the gym, I have also pulled them out of my gym bag while at the office.  They&#x27;re just nice to have around whenever I need to clean up.  I highly recommend these!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to all wipers&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting more when these run out&lt;br /&gt;nice scent and comfort level</li>
            <li> Wish they had an option for single packets so I could throw a few in my backpack while I am at school or when I am at the airport.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad these were cheap.  It&#x27;s incredibly difficult to get one wipe out of the package to use it without it tearing.  And the individual sheets are much smaller than I expected.  The only good thing I can say about these things is the fragrance isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> At this present time I don not have anything additional to write baout this product.  I am enjoying it grealty&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this package in the mail. I am a big guy that likes to feel and stay clean all the time. I work out every day and sweat a lot when doing so. I also poop 1 to 2 times a day. I really like to feel clean and was hoping this item would be the answer for me. I don&#x27;t like taking more than 1 shower a day. I usually wake up in the morning, go to the bathroom, do my work (I work from home), go to the gym or kickboxing and then come home and shower before I go to my night job. I don&#x27;t want to go to the gym feeling stinky or dirty. At the same time, I don&#x27;t want to take a shower right before I work out either, just so I can come home and take one again. Thats where these Biz wipes would come in...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a friend that told me he would buy baby wipes to keep him smelling fresh and clean &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;. While browsing around in the supermarket one day, I came across the baby isle and noticed the regular baby wipes there. They reminded me of what my friend said so I decided to look through them. Most of the wipes were not flushable and that was a turn off for me. I don&#x27;t want to wipe my rear with something and then throw it out in a trash can. I want to be able to flush it. I also wanted to be able to use a wipe that is strong enough for adults and still flushable. I want it to be big enough for my hands too. Most of the wipes I saw in the store were pretty small. I don&#x27;t want to accidentally clean my rear with my hand. I want a large enough wipe that will stay in between my hand and my &amp;#34;holy&amp;#34; area lol.  I own other Mangroomer products (The Mangroomer, which I highly recommend if you have back hair lol), and went on to their website because I had a friend that was interested in getting a Mangroomer for himself. While on the website I discovered these wipes. I went directly to Amazon to see if they were available, and of course they were and at a better price. They only came in a case of 6 but I figured I would give some away to my guy friends for gag gifts. I ordered them and they came quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The individual packs are easy to open up and re-seal. Very effective. I find it a little difficult to remove a single wipe though. If you don&#x27;t have long fingernails they can be tricky to grip and pull out of the package. Sometimes I will put a little tear in them trying to get them out. They are easy enough to use. Go to the bathroom, wipe with normal toilet paper and then wipe with one of these afterwards. Drop it in the toilet and all gone! They are the perfect size too. I have very large hands and I have never had an issue with these being too small. They measure out to be 7.4 inches by 5.3 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a big fan of the scent. They leave my hand smelling really strong, even after washing in the sink. If they could lessen the strength of the smell, these would probably get a better rating from me. Its a little overbearing, kind of like a cheap aftershave you would buy from the supermarket. I think the smell leaves me thinking they will burn me if I scrub too hard back there with them but its probably just in my head. I have never felt any burning from using them. I think if they smelled more natural and less like a cheap cologne, they would be much better. I don&#x27;t want them to smell like fruit though. I just want a nice, easy scent, maybe like a dove soap bar. Creamy and refreshing to smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I give these 4 stars out of 5. They do what they were made for but smell too strong for my liking. Give them a lighter, cleaner, less cologne like smell, and they would be almost perfect for me. I just want to feel clean back there. I don&#x27;t want to smell like I sprayed cologne in my rear end.friends for gag gifts.

            <li> excellent product, when combined with TP  you have a clean feeling at all times and the smell is manely</li>
            <li> Its been 2 weeks since I received these little towelettes of joy. I always felt like smearing with TP just was barbaric and uncivilized. These personal wipes leave me feeling actually clean and I now look forward to my daily duty.</li>
            <li> First these are the best wipes that I have used. The only problem is that they are not portable. It is slightly embarrassing to walk with these to a public restroom. They are great at home with the only issue being that they are folded in such a way that only one comes out at a time. It would be nice if the next wipe was lifted by the previous one like other wipes.</li>
            <li> way too strong and overpowering!  I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.  If it are more mild in its smell it would be a lot better</li>
            <li> Hey I&#x27;m liking these.I don&#x27;t do a whole lot of special manscaping or mangrooming, like the young guys do. I mean... but find that you kinda have to as you get a tad older... dont let things get out of control ya know? So this was one thing I thought I&#x27;d try...Strong enough to use without a finger foul,,, yet gentle enough for a woman.. well she doesn&#x27;t use &#x27;em but she could...Mild aftershave kinda smell that is a nice touch. Not a strong smell and it doesnt linger  really once you are dressed. Brought them traveling in Europe and they were great. I use them on my ears, neck and feet too!</li>
            <li> How do you review these... Well, they wipe, they smell good, and they work. Nice price too. Did I say smell good? Yep.</li>
            <li> The cloths work and smell amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a few days now and I am really liking them.  They have a faint musk cologne smell and are great for freshening up and feeling totally clean.  I was working out in the yard the other day and wasn&#x27;t too dirty  but we decided to go out to grab dinner.  I just used two of these and wipe up and off we went feeling like I had just taken a shower.  My girlfriend really likes the smell too.  If you are a guy you need to have a few of these on hand..  I know you will like them as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality wipe; the wipes are thick, strong and come in a well designed package where they do not dry out. I really like the scent, but didn&#x27;t so much for the womens version. I recommend getting a single pack to make sure you like the scent before getting the multi pack as the scent is much stronger than any store bought wipe.</li>
            <li> This item is great.  I enjoy the smell and the ease with which this product is used.  I&#x27;m ready to order more.</li>
            <li> Wow, Mangoomer really hit the mark on this product. I love the portable aspect of this item and that I can use it at home or on the go. The wipes are awesome and work as described.</li>
            <li> These smell great and feel nice.</li>
            <li> Vey effective and makes unpleasantly more pleasant. Good product at a good price</li>
            <li> These are great wipes for their intended purpose and unlike anything else on the market.  They have a nice clean man scent.  The are like all wipes, a little hard to pull out the first several. Great product to have while traveling to keep everything fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt so clean! I use these with Fresh Balls and I come home with the freshest... well... private area! I&#x27;ve even had my wife sniff all around after a long day of work and she can&#x27;t detect anything except the fresh fragrance of these wipes. The scent reminds me of aftershave. I keep them in the office and in every bathroom around the house. Very nice and I will be buying again after I run out.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have to think someone is being paid off to write good reviews, it&#x27;s not that the product is bad, it&#x27;s just that this product is so over priced.  Save your money, go to the store and buy Cottonell or Charmin at about half the cost.  These wipes aren&#x27;t any thicker, softer or better, as a matter of fact, buy the store brand that now are pop-up, because this item is not, it is difficult to get out of the package, without putting a little hole or tear in it.  If your worried about how it smells, then I suppose people are sniffing around in the wrong places.  This item had some great marketing around it, but save the money, that&#x27;s the wisest thing you can do.</li>
            <li> I am a big guy, so this item is very helpful on keeping me fresh down there- if you know what I mean.  Also, it is very convenient to use after you wipe with the dry toilet paper.  Great great product!!!</li>
            <li> Usually use these after the gym as i dont have time to shower, smell is bad at all or overbearing leaves you feeling clean</li>
            <li> I love these things, they are great!  I keep a pack in my car and in the bathroom, you never know when you may need them.  Great way to freshen up or just clean up a spill or mess.</li>
            <li> totally love these!! they smell great and get the job done.  other wipes have made me hurt before, but not these! i used all 6 packages and i just ordered 6 more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a grown man and, yes, I use wipes. I&#x27;ve been a fan of wipes for years. I can&#x27;t even count the number of questions I&#x27;ve had to field when someone would spot them in my bathroom or the number of conversations I&#x27;ve had at the checkout counter while buying beer, a frozen pizza, and baby wipes. I don&#x27;t have a baby. You know what&#x27;s worse than a man using baby wipes? A man not using baby wipes. On average, I&#x27;d wager men are a lot more gross than babies. Finally a product I can buy and display and say proudly, &amp;#34;Yes, I use wipes. If you don&#x27;t, please don&#x27;t sit on my couch.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is as good as any wipes I&#x27;ve ever purchased. The seal is strong, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying out and becoming sandpaper. This is important. At first I thought the scent was a little strong, but I&#x27;ve grown to like it. Its a clean, manly smell.  I bought the 6-pack and keep one at the office, car, and gym. Toilet paper is the Blackberry of 2013. Who misses the roller ball?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used baby wipes when camping but I never really liked the smell. One day while surfing on Amazon, I came upon these Mangroomer Biz Wipes, the price was right so I decided to order them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes come in a plastic resealable bag just like baby wipes only there are two big differences with the Mangroomer Biz Wipes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - They are larger. The size of the wipe is much larger than similar Baby Wipes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - They Smell Better - These wipes have a Manly &#x27;Old Spice&#x27; kinda smell, not a childish baby smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these wipes are great for guys camping or at the job site porta potty.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell, it&#x27;s a little strong when you first open the bag but as you use the wipes they become less fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Product, Great Price</li>
            <li> Bought a bunch at reduced price. Soothing and effective but the fragrance is a bit strong for me. Will try individual wipes (wrapped) for convenience next time.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Biz Wipes I just received. I had been looking for some time for a man&#x27;s cleanup wipe; this fills the bill. They have a good texture and are strong enough to avoid break-thru. They were delivered when promised, perhaps a day or two early. I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> I use them mostly for an armpit refresh when I&#x27;ve got to work two jobs with no shower between, so I don&#x27;t mind the scent, which isn&#x27;t really that strong. Occasionally I&#x27;ll mop up a sweaty groin - California has a long ball-sweat season - but I don&#x27;t use them as a toilet paper adjunct. I&#x27;m skeptical of &amp;#34;flushable&amp;#34; claims by just about anything heavyweight enough to hold moisture, and I don&#x27;t want to test the lousy old plumbing in this building.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these. They help get/keep you clean and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this product.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of brands and I don&#x27;t think this is the only good brand out there, but it definitely one of my favorites.  For starters, I think pouches like these keep the wipes moist for much longer than the plastic dispensers of the big national brands.  Without exception, I have had to add tap water to those other wipes in the plastic dispensers because they dried out and started to become uncomfortable.  That has never been my experience with these wipes.  Second, I prefer the smell of these to other brands.  That may seem obvious when comparing these to baby wipes, but I&#x27;m talking about compared to national brands.  These definitely have a scent to them but it&#x27;s not something that you&#x27;re going to be smelling long after use.  Third, I like that this sells in the six pack.  Sure, that&#x27;s a lot of wipes, but they store well under the sink, save me from having to re-order as often, and minimize the risk of running out.  And finally, I like that these ship to military APO/FPO addresses.  Deployed soldiers just can&#x27;t have too many of this type of product.  They&#x27;re used not only below the belt but also for a freshening of the neck and face and under the arms.  Shower facilities are not always available and these help keep you relatively clean between showers.  I&#x27;m a fan and repeat customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I last ordered these in March of 2015.  I ordered two cases (6 per case) and paid $19.71 per case.  Thanks to the seller for offering military shipping.</li>
            <li> I had heard about these on the radio and wanted to give them a try. First let me say the scent is horrible. Not offensive horrible but really just some weird idea of what someone thinks smells &amp;#34;executive.&amp;#34; It smells more like really cheap bad cologne. Getting them out of the package is really impossible unless you have very long finger nails, but these are from &amp;#34;man groomer&amp;#34; so you would think a man is not sporting a french manicure to get out these things (not that there is anything wrong with a man with a manicure :) ). The act of what they do is pretty much the same as a baby wipe or others so nothing revolutionary here. The best I have ever used are the preparation H medicated wipes. No lie, they smell clean without that baby smell (or in this case cheap cologne) and use witch hazel which I have to say really gets you cleaned up. they are easy to get out and don&#x27;t tear as easy as these do. (The biz wipes tend to tear on me when I am trying to get them out..which usually I get out more than I need and getting them back in is a nightmare so I just wet up the ducks&#x27; bottom as it were). All in all for the price you get an okay deal and if you like the scent so much the better for you. I just think I will stick to other options.</li>
