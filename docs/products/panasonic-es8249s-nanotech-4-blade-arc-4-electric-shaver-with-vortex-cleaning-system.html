            <li>The perfect shaver for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Still the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor for my fiance for Christmas and he says it&#x27;s the best elecric shaver he&#x27;s had.  </li>
            <li>for a wet/dry this has to be the best bang for the buck out there..</li>

            <li>Still very happy with this and trying to decide if I want to get another one or get an upgrade.  </li>
            <li>Shaves great!</li>
            <li>I love this razor!!!  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, they make the best electric razor out there and for a very good price.</li>
            <li>And a very pleasant surprise was the cleaning system that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is very good, and I use it to pick off stubborn hairs.  </li>
            <li>The product shaves very good where it works.</li>
            <li>I take very good care of the shaver.</li>
            <li>Does a very good job.  </li>
            <li>which is very good.    </li>
            <li>Very good shaver.</li>
            <li>Battery life is very good between charges.</li>
            <li>but it still gets incredibly close.</li>
            <li>Got a great deal on this razor for 90 bucks, best investment I ever made!  </li>
            <li>Simply incredible.  </li>
            <li>When you use this with shaving cream it&#x27;s a gret shave - as good as any razor without the nicks and cuts!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good bit faster!</li>
            <li>Literally, I had never had as good or as close of a shave, even with a razor!</li>
            <li>This shaver has been ahuge hit for me, I can now shave my head and face every day without suffering from rash/burn/acne, the quality of the shave is very good, and the convenience of the cleaning system is welcome.    </li>
            <li>The price is incredible given the great job it does.</li>
            <li>After this post, I got a call from Panasonic&#x27;s Rebate vendor company and they have found my paperwork in good order, check&#x27;s in the mail, and to edit my comments to reflect excellent service.</li>
            <li>Depending on the price it becomes a very good buy or a not so good buy.  </li>
            <li>It is self-cleaning which is a great bonus, and it hums instead of growls.  </li>
            <li>Shaves great dispite the inability to adjust the shave depth.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this, its a great product and the price is a steal.</li>
            <li>My husband being this happy -</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is great.</li>
            <li>Great shave in 4 minutes that lasts thru the evening vs. 10 minutes on others that get you to 5:00 without the closeness.  </li>
            <li>This is a great electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Great Design?</li>
            <li>The heating/fan mechanism does a great job of drying the razor.  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor.  </li>
            <li>We are happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li>Bottom line: A great shavor at a great price.</li>
            <li>I know this one works and does a great job.</li>
            <li>A great item.</li>
            <li>but I am incredibly happy that I stumbled upon it.</li>
            <li>SO FREAKING HAPPY</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>I used the blade in my youth, but the sensitivity of my skin was too great.</li>
            <li>maybe that indicates that it is working.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Now that I have had this for two years I want to say that it still works great.</li>
            <li>I switched to Panasonic this time because of the great deal I got with Amazon.com, and because of the reputation and reliability of Panasonic&#x27;s electronic products.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>~just buy it as a birthday gift  for my father,he is so happy when receive it</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>when you compare the price this one also does a great job.</li>
            <li>but after finding all the great reviews on these Panasonic ES series razors I decided to pull the trigger on one.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with that and neither was my wife.    </li>
            <li>but i just want anyone who reads this to know what a great product this is.</li>
            <li>When he heard all of the great compliments about the Braun (from hubby), he wanted one too.</li>
            <li>the self cleaning works great.  </li>
            <li>The wet/dry feature is great in case you want to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>So I stumbled upon the Panasonic on amazon with great reviews, so</li>
            <li>The 8109 got particularly great reviews</li>
            <li>I get a great shave and the product is quality throughout.</li>
            <li>I also shave my head and the shaver does a great job on it as well.</li>
            <li>Great shaver.</li>

            <li>Great price.  </li>

            <li>Closest to a blade I have ever experienced in an electric razor and</li>
            <li>The charging/cleaning system does a great job cleaning and DRYING the razor head.  </li>
            <li>All told, I&#x27;ve never been as happy with a razor as I am with this one.</li>
            <li>It also does a great job on my head which i like to shave periodically.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>then that&#x27;s a great day  </li>
            <li>and I was quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great price for a really great shaver.</li>

            <li>I like to thank Amazon; Amazon has the excellent price (drop price for one day) along with top notch customer service.</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t Panasonic just make something that&#x27;s going to be the best for more than two years?    </li>
            <li>Loving it!</li>

            <li>To top it off, the cleaning station is a very welcome addition.  </li>
            <li>It is a remarkable razor.  </li>
            <li>After using it for more than a month now I have to say say that this shaver is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I can do a good job in about 3.5 minutes with the Panasonic and a great job in about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>and Im sure it works awesome,</li>
            <li>Shaving the sideburns and the jawline is a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>It is easily the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is an excellent razor, and I&#x27;d easily suggest this to my friends.</li>
            <li>This one was a very suitable replacement in all regards.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it and look forward to many more years of close shaves!</li>
            <li>Blades still do a better job around the neck, but this Panasonic does a very good job.  </li>
            <li>Good luck to all on the never ending search for the perfect (and therefore comfortable) shave.</li>
            <li>This razor works perfectly, and is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li>After reading good reviews on this razor</li>
            <li>Battery is good; day after day shaving (every time around 5 minutes) need to charge every 10 days.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for christmas to replace my Mach 3 manual shaver as this product has received good reviews.</li>
            <li>Had Norelco&#x27;s over the years, but they did not give a good shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it and look forward to many more years of close shaves!does a great job.</li>
            <li>and the percent charged is a nice feature to have when you gotta fly out</li>
            <li>In fact this razor is so good</li>
            <li>But, as I said, it&#x27;s just as good as a Gillette Fusion or Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always use the cleaning system, but when I do it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Bought an ES8239 - and it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>The charger, modes, cleaning, sound, and grip are totally excellent.</li>
            <li>If you just want an inexpensive shaver that is really good - get Panasonic ES8243A for $80.  </li>
            <li>and I am delighted with it.</li>
            <li>Panasonic is a good name.</li>
            <li>and you get a good, QUALITY shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so good that I recommended it to my father...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the cheapest, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good shave, this is the one I would suggest.</li>
            <li>Shaver is good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my dads braun 8995 for 4 years this is not as good as it is.</li>
            <li>After some research I found the 8249 to be a good balance of price and quality.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for 12 hours.</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t giving me a good shave and missed alot of hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li>That was Christmas of 09&#x27; and my shaver is still as good as the day i bought it.</li>
            <li>but the price was not as good as the deal I had gotten when I purchased hubby&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li>then what good is the product.</li>
            <li>then what good is the product.</li>
            <li>I would say Panasonic 8249 or 8243 shaver is the best cost-performance shaver available in the market.</li>
            <li>Good but not a close shave as razor, I like how you can use it while taking a shower</li>
            <li>Also, on the package for the cleaning cartridge, it says that the detergent will stay good for 6 months after opening</li>
            <li>Nothing beats a blade, no matter how good anyone claims it is.  </li>
            <li>Four years ago I picked up the Panasonic ES8077S system, and I&#x27;ve loved it.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d have a good test when I got it.  </li>
            <li>I have a good 5 o&#x27;clock shadow every day and often, I let my face grow for two maybe three days before I shave.</li>
            <li>surprisingly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They did a good job</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t shave good,</li>
            <li>so I take that as a sign of the good work that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No hassle, just drop it off at the end end of the week and your good</li>
            <li>; if this model is this good, is the five blade model even better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I looked through the reviews to find what might fit me best.    </li>
            <li>I get a wonderfully close and smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do a good job of manually cleaning/washing my shaver</li>
            <li>I bought this Panasonic based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li>It did do a good job, but not as good as a razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as a blade, but almost so</li>
            <li>I would recommend this shaver, it is a good unit for the money.</li>
            <li>The reviews on the Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers were good, so I thought I would give this one a try.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with the ES-LA93 model.</li>
            <li>and you are good to go).  </li>
            <li>The battery life is good</li>
            <li>it shaves good and doesnt leave me with any irratation.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job without pulling but does not get a close shave everywhere.</li>
            <li>in all a good purchase, and i would not hesitate to purchase another.</li>
            <li>The cleaning kit is awesome, you just shave and put it in the cleaning kit; it&#x27;ll clean &amp; charge it for you.    </li>
            <li>and so I went back to manual shaving with the best of the best in a manual shave:</li>
            <li>Quick review, this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>He loves the good shave that he gets with it, and he loves the self-cleaning even more!</li>
            <li>It has the great advantage that I can use it in the shower, it feels very comfortable in my hand, and cleaning is a breeze.</li>
            <li>Very good shaver; smooth shave</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the Panasonic ES8249S Arc IV Nanotech Vortex razor.</li>
            <li>Having used a rechargable Remmington for years was reluctant to take a chance, I am very pleased that I did.  </li>
            <li>so I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It does not miss very many hairs, and it takes me about 3-4 minutes to shave thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased by the shave and performance.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my decision to change to Panasonic.</li>
            <li>He has told me he loves this product, and is very satisfied with the closeness of shave.</li>
            <li>I bought the ES 8249 over 2 years ago &amp; have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>;  I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great update for the guy who has everything :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this razor.  </li>
            <li>After a month of use, I am very pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase and the shaver&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with how close the shave is.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Also, he is very pleased with how close of a shave he gets from this razor.</li>
            <li>On the plus side this shaver is very safe.    </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.the shower and cleaned before I use it because it has replaced her Venus bladed shaver.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I also got the best price right here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love it!    </li>
            <li>Phenomenal!</li>
            <li>The shaver is outstanding!</li>
            <li>They say it takes a while for your face to adjust but my first shave was the best shave I have had in years.</li>
            <li>And I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>This is my first Panasonic and it&#x27;s the best of the 3 shavers.  </li>
            <li>My husband has had many razors over the years, but this one was a hit!</li>
            <li>NOT ANY MORE!  </li>
            <li>But my point is that I LOVE this razor!</li>
            <li>in my opinion, this shaver gives a shave that is BETTER THAN A BLADE!</li>
            <li>It works well after my face adjusted to the razor and it works even better in the shower!</li>
            <li>is still going strong and giving great</li>
            <li>It has a great self cleaning module and easily travels.</li>
            <li>In addition, using this with a good ol&#x27; fashioned shaving brush and shaving soap will give a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Certainly even the best made products can be sent out defective.</li>
            <li>With regards to the product, well, it is certainly the best shaver I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Panasonic is very effective in providing a close shave, and it is easy to use and maintain with the included automatic cleaner.</li>
            <li>In both cases it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>SIMPLY AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>For that money this is an amazing buy.</li>
            <li>It provides an amazing shave that feels amazingly close to as if I had shaved with a razor.  </li>
            <li>the included cleaning station is a huge bonus and does a great job of cleaning the shaver head.</li>
            <li>Its so comfortable to use and works great on my neck region as well.</li>
            <li>and I was given a Braun Series 7 which was amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The speed of the razor is amazing.  </li>
            <li>the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with, it seemed to be taking more time and more passes.  </li>
            <li>The cleaner machine is kind of neat, although I wish there was a way to use it without having to keep buying the soap cartridge.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I really liked the ES88043.  </li>
            <li>Nearly as good as Norelco on my neck and better than Braun on my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked that brand though for TV and audio electronics.</li>
            <li>what kind of shaver I was getting when I bought this Arc IV</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.</li>
            <li>It cleans nicely and the cleaning solution lasts between 30-40 days.</li>
            <li>He is so happy with this shaver and constantly says it is the very best he has ever had</li>
            <li>The self-cleaning feature is nice and seems to work well.</li>
            <li>-LCD display is nice to have  </li>
            <li>To be honest,  I was hesitant to buy a Panasonic shaver since I was always under the impression that \\&quot;You gotta get a Norelco or Braun\\&quot; to get a quality shave.  </li>
            <li>And the cleaning capability works great, much better than the more expense system that Braun uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost regretful that I didn&#x27;t step up to the $200 version on Amazon for the 14,000 rpm over the 13,000 rpm for this one, but it was an $87 difference, and I wasn&#x27;t even sure if this kind of razor would work good for me at the time.  </li>
            <li>Nice shaver.  </li>
            <li>So if your considering this as a gift, or you want a razor that holds a charge and honestly works as well as shaving cream and a safety razor,</li>
            <li>But honestly buy it</li>
            <li>You dont HAVE to use it and it make a handy holder</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this shaver.</li>
            <li>the pricing at Amazon is really the best.</li>
            <li>The shave is nice looking.</li>
            <li>I really liked this shaver, until it quit.</li>
            <li>Nice shaver.  </li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s Panasonic, and yes I am 100% happy with mine, the most comfortable shave ever!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled with my choice.</li>
            <li>Nice shave.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a battery charge indicator also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never shaved with an electric razor I liked until now.</li>
            <li>can honestly recommend this shaver whole-heartedly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives a really nice close shave and irritation</li>
            <li>Was very nice and smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast service is very good.</li>
            <li>works very good like it very much</li>
            <li>, this is an awesome razor and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It works great and is very easy to maintain and keep clean</li>
            <li>Just decided to try something new and was really impressed with this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>Works great in the shower to the point that my wife can use it on sensitive areas with great results.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great: This is best wet electric shaver I&#x27;ve found.    </li>
            <li>and it does a great job and a quick one too.</li>
            <li>His hair grows quickly, so he does it every morning and looks great.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>We both love it! :)</li>
            <li>For me it works perfectly, even better than a classic shaver.</li>
            <li>This is the best razor i&#x27;ve ever had as far as closeness shaving.</li>
            <li>This thing is excellent so far....</li>
            <li>This is the best electric razor so far, but the jury is still out regarding the neck hair shaving.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best shaver I have ever owned!!</li>
            <li>The price at Amazon was by far the best!</li>
            <li>and I found the foil-type razor to work much better than the rotary, but it was still not as effective as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>Amazon delivered it two days early which is awesome.</li>
            <li>decided to trust all the strangers out there who were extremely pleased with their purchases and buy my own.  </li>
            <li>The unit is really light and feels good in the hands.  </li>
            <li>So far, it has performed flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>The skin feels smooth and the finish is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still far and away the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Still far and away the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shaver, it&#x27;s smooth and easy to use, but there is a problem with the readout screen.  </li>
            <li>Easily 5 stars!  </li>
            <li>a few days ago, very good price [...], and very good expirience / quality.    </li>
            <li>Otherwise cleans great, smooth &amp; comfortable</li>
            <li>The shave, particularly with a pre-shave oil like \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; is brilliant.</li>
            <li>Norelco was better at getting the hairs on my neck, but Braun seemed better on my face and came with a nice cleaning unit.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is great, and the shaver is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is good if you need it for clean shave.</li>
            <li>This is a very great price, better than many of the razors available at even higher prices.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for an electric razor that I can use in the shower, that doesn&#x27;t require any special shaving cream/oil/lotion, and gives a good, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A great electric shaver at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>While I have been pretty happy with results, I just have to add some thoughts.  </li>
            <li>It provided a very smooth and close shave.  </li>
            <li>My face is very smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The shave is also a very comfortable one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic handles it well and provides a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Using it in the shower is like shaving without a blade: very smooth and close.</li>
            <li>Recieved the product as described, Read instructions (nicely set out and easy to follow).</li>
            <li>the automatic cleaner is a nice, easy feature.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>After reading reviews I chose the Panasonic, and I have been delighted from the very first shave.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth, close, easy to maintain, and does a really good job.  </li>
            <li>Better around neck and very smooth.</li>
            <li>This is very nice and convenient and makes the razor perform like new and smell nice.</li>
            <li>A very nice touch making the shaver actually feel pleasant going across your face.</li>
            <li>Doing so leaves a kind of rusty smell for the next shave, but the shave is still very good.     </li>
            <li>The shave is top notch and build quality is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but this one does a better job in this area than any I have used before.</li>
            <li>I still love the razor and cleaning/charging unit</li>
            <li>comfortable foil head which is flexible and the self-cleaning charging station makes this just an amazing package.  </li>
            <li>At the same time I went a looking for a replacement of the Arcitec and ran across this razor which had many impressive reviews.   </li>
            <li>and I was blown away by how close it was able to shave.  </li>
            <li>If you have a defective unit better hope it breaks within your 30 day return period</li>
            <li>As stated above, this is a excellent shaver.  </li>
            <li>The auto cleaner is Ok but overkill</li>
            <li>I also think it is a better value.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is truly outstanding.</li>
            <li>Bought this shaver for myself for xmas in 2010 and have to say that I absolutely love the thing.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>Surely the technology has improved.  </li>
            <li>however I decided to try Panasonic one more time.</li>
            <li>This fantastic shaver eliminates that possibility!  </li>
            <li>My hubby is very happy with his Christmas present!  </li>
            <li>but this one is even better.</li>
            <li>but Panasonic is clearly better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d have to say it shaves slightly better than the Norelco did.  </li>
            <li>In a month, perhaps there will be better news.    </li>
            <li>Also, I ran out of Mach 3 blades as well, so I looked for a replacement that would not need the touching</li>
            <li>If you drive a Corvette, expect to pay more for the tires when it&#x27;s time to replace them than those for a Camry.    </li>
            <li>Remington razors have always been my favorite razors until I bought this Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Well I will let the detailed reviews stand on their own.  </li>
            <li>and I would have paid more for it.</li>
            <li>After a year of daily usage, I can say this is the best unit I&#x27;ve purchased in the 10+ years of Panasonic wet/dry units.  </li>
            <li>Used Norelco for years, then switched to the latest Braun a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li>The panasonic is the better shave and that&#x27;s what I was paying/looking for.</li>
            <li>I had which was 80 dollars more when I bought it.    </li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews and showing him the top picks, he chose this one.</li>
            <li>He mostly uses that one.</li>
            <li>One more thing to take care of.</li>
            <li>Like with most electrics I had to go over and over it until I got results (except for a Braun I owned years ago).  </li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be just as satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is what I do most days for work, etc.</li>
            <li>I gotta say everything from the packaging to the build quality of the razor are top notch.  </li>
            <li>Now for the 5 star - what a close and smooth shave!</li>
            <li>but I would imagine just how my face feels this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>I have had most brands of shavers in my 50 years but never Panasonic.</li>
            <li>The latest model, the Panasonic ES-LA93-K Men&#x27;s Shaver, is a 14,000 rpm motor.     </li>
            <li>I ended up getting this razor at Target on vacation after my Norelco died (after many years of valiant service).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for many years, and was always looking for an alternative to alleviate skin problems.</li>
            <li>Excellent shaver overall, and</li>
            <li>I love the wet/dry feature and cleaning</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am able to shave in about 4 minutes while the shower is warming up as opposed to closer to 10 minutes with the razor.</li>
            <li>Absolutely outstanding product.</li>
            <li>I have had it for two months and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several electric shavers since the 1950&#x27;s as well as shaving manually for many years, and I can now say that the Panasonic ES8249S gives me the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I challenge anyone to tell the difference between the results of this electric shaver and a manual shave.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is the best out of the last five I have owned.</li>
            <li>Way better than the Norelco</li>
            <li>I like the cleaning system better than my Braun.  </li>
            <li>Much more convenient,</li>
            <li>I love Amazon. :)</li>
            <li>I researched, read many reviews, and the lot fell on this Panasonic Arc IV.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the shaver and only hope it continues to perform as it does now.</li>
            <li>And, love the shaver.</li>
            <li>good thing!!!!!!!!very useful</li>
            <li>Much better than the Norelco I had been using.  </li>
            <li>Once I got home I decided I better read some reviews before I opened the box, since I&#x27;d bought a $165.00 razor on impulse.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is outstanding.</li>
            <li>The reason for my 4 rating has nothing to do with the shaver itself, which I rate as outstanding.</li>
            <li>I believe i coud have found a better price if I would have shopped around.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve allready seen some simalar razors for a better price ,even a braun.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>so they could \\&quot;find out more info\\&quot; by asking their co-workers, (or whatever tech support people do when they put you on hold.)</li>
            <li>I thought it would be OK.</li>
            <li>I expect better quality.</li>
            <li>Next to his car and our cats, it&#x27;s the best thing that ever happened to him...</li>
            <li>Quite simply this is one of the best shaving instruments i have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I also wanted something that could be used on the underarms as most womens razors pull the hair or pinch the skin in this area.      </li>
            <li>Better than most shaves</li>
            <li>-Safe</li>
            <li>While using the braun, shaving was okay.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic provides such a great shave that I never have to worry about a mini-mustache, even after working a 12 hour day!    </li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried many, many shavers.  </li>
            <li>I have now discarded all my blades as this shaver does a better job than even my razors.  </li>
            <li>I was going to buy the top of the line Norelco this time but a friend said i should try the Braun models.</li>
            <li>I bought the top of the line Braun and used it for a week after which time i returned it.</li>
            <li>Most people said that going from a Rotary type shaver to a Foil, it would take my face a while to get used to the shaver.</li>
            <li>Love all of my deals buying through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used an electric shaver for many many years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for many years.</li>
            <li>Have used the Norelco for the last 10 years and have been very happy.  </li>
            <li>It gives him a better, closer shave than a razor.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on many different razors it sounded like the best deal for the money.</li>
            <li>I never tried Braun, but the price of Braun is $30-50 more than Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel I can gain a lot the by spending 30-50% more.     </li>
            <li>(better use it with shaving gel or foam)  2.</li>
            <li>I owned a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver many, many years ago</li>
            <li>maybe more.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it and having purchased it on sale for $93 with a $20 rebate, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve gotten a good value.</li>
            <li>I love Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li>It does a much better job than my Norelco at shaving my face.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research and came up with the Panasonic as my top choice</li>
            <li>I really love this razor.  </li>
            <li>All i have to compare it to is a norelco shaver, but this thing works so much better.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to use a razor without ingrown hairs and redness/ itchiness.  </li>
            <li>The shaver gets more of the hairs around my neck and nose than the braun ever did</li>
            <li>works better than the braun activator / series 5  </li>
            <li>I love the cleaner, but dislike that i have to replace the filter every month.</li>
            <li>Also, I invested in some Proraso cream after-shave balm; $16 with free shipping if you have Amazon prime, but so far one of the best after-shaves I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I know what I&#x27;ll be replacing this one with in a couple years, though. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I read many reviews regarding Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers before deciding to purchase this model.  </li>
            <li>I have owned this for about five weeks and am thoroughly pleased with it&#x27;s performance and close shaving comfort.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But when it comes to shaving, it was clearly a better unit than the ES8077S</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ll be able to better judge that, since nobody likes getting part way into shaving their heads and have the razor run out of juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flimsy as most are, and a lot of tugging and pain  when used.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ll be able to better judge that, since nobody likes getting part way into shaving their heads and have the razor run out of juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flimsy as most are, and a lot of tugging and pain  when used.  </li>
            <li>I was not even in the market for a shaver but could not pass this bargain up. :)</li>
            <li>what the hey. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>However I do like the fastersmoother shave or the Norelco better</li>
            <li>over all could not be more satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Therefore, after researching numerous reviews for Braun, Remington, Phillips, and Panasonic, I was impressed with the reviews of the Panasonic ES8249S ArcIV and made a decision to purchase one via Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it and am more than satisfied with this model and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed :).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>It took too many passes to get anything off from under my chin, to the point where I&#x27;d end up with razor burn (and some patches that, once missed for a day, I&#x27;d have to use the popup trimmer on).  </li>
            <li>This thing just does a much better job for me.</li>
            <li>It shaves with ease and makes shaving more enjoyable...</li>
            <li>It is much better than the Braun series7 and 5 and also the Norelco which irritated my face  </li>
            <li>I will tell more after 30 days.</li>
            <li>Love the brand and the self-cleaning part.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>And the blades are excellent quality; I haven&#x27;t replaced them in two years and still give me a deep shave.  </li>
            <li>and it was taking more than 5 minutes every time to get an acceptable shave.</li>
            <li>I have had many electric razars and been dissapointed with all of them.  </li>
            <li>I paid top dollar for this shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a Christmas gift for my son and he states that it gives a nice, close, nick free shave.</li>
            <li>Contrary to many reviews</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of money, and spending $150 on something I wasn&#x27;t sure would even work for me was risky.</li>
            <li>I did it though, and I will tell ya what. :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many electric shavers over the years</li>
            <li>I love this electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolute joy</li>
            <li>Yes, I do need to do more then one pass to get rid of the hair.  </li>
            <li>I have not used the self cleaning mode, but I will be able to try it out after my trip in March.  </li>
            <li>I like the cleaning system better than the braun, which uses an alcohol based solvent for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The self cleaning cycle is also many times quieter than the braun&#x27;s system.  </li>
            <li>The shaver does switch on and off, but it&#x27;s volume is more than tolerable (sounds a bit like a mobile phone ringing while set on &#x27;vibrate&#x27;).  </li>
            <li>Love being able to shave in the shower with shave cream too.  </li>
            <li>Before finding this, I tried the best of Braun and Phillips Norelco - both three-headed monsters and the same style as this one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also able to do my head a lot faster with the Panasonic shaver than my Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>you also want to do something in return...:)    </li>
            <li>hope it gets better after each shave.    </li>
            <li>Love this Shaver.    </li>
            <li>He loves it more than his Braun electric.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you made the decision to switch.</li>
            <li>have continued to love my shaver until now.</li>
            <li>Shaving results with the Panasonic are much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mostly in the latter case, so shaving time goes from 5 to 10 minutes if I want everything perfect.</li>
            <li>I had an electric more than 10 years ago</li>
            <li>I have only used the shaver for about a month but at this point in time I am very impressed with the shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been satisfied with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>It is excellent all around, BUT the actual shave.  </li>
            <li>That was OK...</li>
            <li>Noisy, but OK.</li>
            <li>many times before it felt like I was fully shaved.</li>
            <li>This is Ultimately the best shaver on the market..</li>
            <li>$80 sure.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems like more rpms and cuts better, no stubble.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>is okay.</li>
            <li>I am not a 100% satisfied with the finish and the time it takes, but there are no cuts, bruises etc.</li>
            <li>They sent me the latest [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>He now heads to work looking handsome and well-groomed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am SO satisfied with this razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am SO satisfied with this razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I feel like my Norelco from 2005</li>
            <li>does a better job still at shaving.  </li>
            <li>He is in love with this shaver.</li>
            <li>More than once this thing has run out of batteries on me mid-shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaved again the next day and still perfect.</li>
            <li>I now have to make sure I get it out of the shower and cleaned before I use it because it has replaced her Venus bladed</li>
            <li>and I am beginning to like it more.</li>
            <li>Already the battery charge is better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK electric shaver, does the work.</li>
            <li>It is an ok product.</li>
            <li>Great shave every day with a very close/clean shave and no razer</li>
            <li>and I researched that this type of shaver is best for such skin types.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to thoroughly clean it while on vacation when one doesn&#x27;t have the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>Where the Braun did a pretty good job, the Panasonic produced a fantastically smooth skin surface (I&#x27;m seconding his opinion!)</li>
            <li>The base/charger also has a nice option to clean the razor as well.</li>
            <li>The Braun did clean well, but the solution would evaporate quickly in warm weather, and did make the bathroom smell a bit.  </li>
            <li>Where the Braun did a pretty good job, the Panasonic produced a fantastically smooth skin surface (I&#x27;m seconding his opinion!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s REALLY nice to not even have to clean your shaver yourself.</li>
            <li>Even though the price was good the shaver is too noisy and it does not shave very fast .</li>
            <li>The razor looks very high tech (a must for a tech geek like myself) and the led screen is a nice touch!  </li>
            <li>(though I am sure the new models work great too).  </li>
            <li>I use an electric shaver because my skin isn&#x27;t very smooth, so I get cuts and irritation easily with a razor.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic es8249s wet/dry shaver is the best shaver i have ever used, Its quiet, Fits good in my hand and shaves really close in about 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>My skin has really cleared up since I have been using this because my face has been able to heal from the trauma of using a Mach 3 razor every day (even though a Mach 3 Fusion is awesome, after shaving 5 days straight my skin gets traumatized).</li>
            <li>This shaver was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The Arcitec did a pretty good job</li>
            <li>I used to buy the best I could find, been using the Mach3 Turbo for a long time... and some others...</li>
            <li>I have used it for almost 2 years now and feel that I have a pretty good handle on what I like and don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>While it was working it did a pretty good job although I have one of those kinds of beards that don&#x27;t do well with electric razors.  </li>
            <li>good and first to use gadget in the morning&#x27; &#x27;better shape and holds easy&#x27; &#x27;</li>
            <li>It works great on upper and lower legs and works amazingly on underarms.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good machine and a good buy.</li>
            <li>This does a fairly good job, not as good as the earlier Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Shaving with the Arc IV is ridiculously quick; I can get a pretty good shave in 2.5 minutes (no joke), and a pretty great shave in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, smooth shaving, easy cleaning and charging.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean (run it through some water) and</li>
            <li>Quick, clean shave, easy clean up, great battery life</li>
            <li>, i felt as clean as using a blade!     </li>
            <li>Like most other reviews, I&#x27;ve been extremely impressed with the Panasonic ES8249 wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, extremely satisfied, great razor!!</li>
            <li>I looked on the net and found that Panasonic razors were getting very good reveiws.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great shaver, fast quiet motor, looks great, feels good in your hand, charges quick, easy to clean...</li>
            <li>this razor does an incredible job in short time with no burn and no stubble.</li>
            <li>Gives a closer shave than my triple head blade razor and is great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gives close shave&lt;br /&gt;Works great with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Arc IV does an outstanding job of getting my face smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is easier to use than my ES8078; the shaver is more comfortable to hold and easier to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>This is my first amazon review and I&#x27;m writing this because I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Norelco has perhaps been the most comfortable electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Two of the most important things about shaving: speed and closeness.</li>
            <li>It cuts the best, is quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>A wet shave means a great shave and so far this is the best, easist on my face shave ever.</li>
            <li>Great razor so far.</li>
            <li>So far, great shaver.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin  3.</li>
            <li>This shaver replaced my Braun 5 series shaver and has so far been great.    </li>
            <li>This thing is light years better than the Norelco and its also ranked #2 in the Consumer Reports</li>
            <li>I also had a 14 year old Panasonic which offered a great cut and like all electric razors......</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make it short and sweet: This is the best electric shaver I have ever had.</li>
            <li>I will tell you that it does give a close shave and it more comfortable than the Braun.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Assuming the thing is reasonably durable, this is full of win.  </li>
            <li>bought this to use primarily on my head and it&#x27;s done a fantastic job!  </li>
            <li>I do not use it in the shower, but the WET/DRY capability makes clean up so easy - just remove the top and put both the top and the head of the razor under running water.</li>
            <li>With this Panasonic, smooth and healthy looking every day.</li>
            <li>The norelco is quiet which is real nice but</li>
            <li>I had to keep a spare cutter block/foil pair handy because I want every shave to be as good as possible and never got more than 6 months out of one without performance suffering.    </li>
            <li>Features on it are nice and worth 3 or 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Face looks good after getting this and is gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>The Norelco with its fair cut sent me running for a blade and would use the electric for a fast shave.    </li>
            <li>The cleaning system is hands down better and the shaver is excellent (read the reviews).  </li>
            <li>It is quiet, smooth, and on top of it, does a perfect job from the very first use.</li>
            <li>Also the charger - cleaning system is a plus, less work for you and great maintenance for your new best friend.</li>
            <li>I had a perfect shave the very first time with no pain or red bumps.</li>
            <li>Shave is amazingly close and amazingly comfortable, the shaver is easy to hold, and the lithium-ion battery charges quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a true baby-hiny-smooth shave!     </li>
            <li>This would probably be four out of five stars if the email department had handled the problem originally without directing me to take three more steps before someone handled the problem.</li>
            <li>This would probably be four out of five stars if the email department had handled the problem originally without directing me to take three more steps before someone handled the problem.</li>
            <li>Tried the ES8249S and Panasonic is totally correct, its as good as a blade!  </li>
            <li>My first electric shaver and I love it!</li>
            <li>easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Self</li>
            <li>It cleans easily with liquid soap lathered up by turning it on.  </li>
            <li>that gets the job done very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It also falls off somewhat easily</li>
            <li>but the ES8249 easily outperforms them.</li>
            <li>However, though I would like a closer shave, I also care more about my shave looking clean than feeling close.</li>
            <li>Close shave easy on the neck (and cleans up the neck hairs without razor burn.)</li>
            <li>It will run a couple of weeks between charges, but when it&#x27;s so easy to charge in the cradle, why wait?</li>
            <li>Cleaning under the tap was easy, but then I had to leave the parts separate</li>
            <li>Easy to use with no problems.</li>
            <li>Bought this shaver a while ago and liked it so much, that bought one more as a gift for my friend.</li>
            <li>The fact that you can also clean with liquid soap and water more than makes up for this flaw.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is extremely easy and convenient  5.</li>
            <li>Cleanup is exceptionally easy</li>
            <li>Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves close and easy to take care of.</li>
            <li>An easy five stars.</li>
            <li>love that you can just rinse the \\&quot;blades\\&quot; under the faucet to clean the razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and easy to manipulate around my face.</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, I was enjoying a fantastic shave within 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The razor also can be cleaned easily by taking off the foil and running water through it while on turbo mode (see instructions).</li>
            <li>Having used a shaver for many years with fair results I was surprised at the quality of the work that this shaver accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She says it is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>There is a pouch also which makes it easy to carry</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and to work.  </li>
            <li>So it was an easy buy.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>- Incredibly close shave, much better than I expected from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a Gold Deal and found that it is a good razor for my replacement of another older Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I bought it on a special pricing and don&#x27;t think that I could have gotten any better at any price.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is an amazing razor!  </li>
            <li>However I just had my first shave with this one and trust me guys its amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked the shaver at first and it still does work well however after 3 years the cleaning system gave out and began leaking.</li>
            <li>Let me first say that I prefer shaving with a blade, but if I had a really great electric that didn&#x27;t take just as long to give me a good shave, I would opt for that.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is pretty nice</li>
            <li>So the self-cleaning and drying feature is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>This was on sale for $89 and decided it was a good deal, considering the reviews and the normal price in stores.  </li>
            <li>The shaver works pretty nice.</li>
            <li>The screens warm up while shaving, making for a soft warm comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>This was the best shave that i had ever had in my life, hands down.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Cleans quick and effectively  Shaves quick and close    Summary of cons:  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say invest in a good electric pre-shave and an after shave balm that is good for your skin (takes some experimenting to find the right stuff, but I&#x27;ve seen good stuff about Trumper&#x27;s Coral Skin Food, Proraso cream after-shave balm, and if you want to go a little cheaper even OTC Nivea Extra-Soothing After Shave Balm, right now I&#x27;m still using some 2 year old after shave balm an aunt got me for Christmas from Bathand Body Works, but they don&#x27;t carry that line any more,) but this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>and now the shaver is as good as new.</li>
            <li>So, I researched and agonized over switching to a new brand as my research suggested, thinking Brawn was superior.</li>
            <li>I am using the manual cleaning proces and it works just fine, no need for the automatic system and cost.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t give the Norelco enough time to adjust but the Panasonic worked perfectly from the first day; didn&#x27;t need any time to adjust.    </li>
            <li>You can wash the razor off under the tap just fine, and you don&#x27;t have to pay for cleaning solution packs to do it.    </li>
            <li>I have previously had two of the highly-hyped (and up-to-now best electric shavers on the market)</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t charge it in your bedroom when you are trying to sleep and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>The cleaning cycle works fine.   </li>
            <li>This is a fine shaver and does a creditable job.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>I think the more potent motor from the higher end model should be adopted by all Panasonic foil shavers.    </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been very happy with this razor and would recommend this product to anyone looking for a new electric razor.  </li>
            <li>No pain, easy, fast, and a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In closing, it is a great shaver, and will last a very long time before blades need eventual replacement, otherwise is ideal just as it is out of the box.</li>
            <li>As far as the shaver performance goes it is the best I have ever had, it shaves close like a razor and has a swiveling head with spring action for easy shaving.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable, easy to use, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This little bugger is unequivocally the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It shaves quickly and very cleanly.</li>
            <li>He used it dry and absolutely LOVED it!  </li>
            <li>the head looked huge...</li>
            <li>It is really a smooth shaver; easy to use and easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>This shaver gives me a fantastic baby smooth, irritation free shave in around five minutes.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is smooth and painless.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked the convenience of the electric razor while I&#x27;ve appreciated the closer shave that you can get with the manual razor.  </li>
            <li>My legs are so smooth, you&#x27;d think I had used a razor blade.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean without it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon price and free shipping with Amazon prime truly made this an affordable gift.  </li>
            <li>and I think you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>My last shaver was a panasonic ES8043 which was great</li>
            <li>How does one walk about town or go to work with a bizarre, patchy look?  </li>
            <li>This shaver has had numerous great reviews on all the sites I looked at when researching it</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth after a shave and not irritated at all.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much in fact, that I bought each of my two son-in-laws one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>, either i grow titanium hair follicles or this shaver is simply not that great.  </li>
            <li>so razor burn has always been the primary reason for trying electric shavers.</li>
            <li>This gives me just as smooth of a shave as I can get with a razor but with no irritation.</li>
            <li>but the shaver is so smooth there is no irritation.  </li>
            <li>This is the very best at shaving my heavy beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting for the next generation because Panasonic cannot be trusted to sell me a product that will be great for five years and keeps making obsolete its $300 shavers every two years.      </li>
            <li>Before I got this shaver, my wife had no idea my face could be so smooth.</li>
            <li>I wished it cuts closer to leave the skin smooth but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If not, I have to result to using a blade razor to make it smooth.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face as smooth as if I had shaved both with and then against the grain with a razor.</li>
            <li>Was going to buy one again, but Amazon had a fantastic price on this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly comfortable to hold</li>
            <li>Let me tell you this model is as smooth as it gets i have been using for a month now</li>
            <li>The ES8246S shaves my face as smooth as a babies bottom....  </li>
            <li>The razor is fantastic.</li>
            <li>then anything I have ever found available to women.  </li>
            <li>Does a great close shave on his face and neck in a very short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Although the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t sound like you have entered a jet engine test cell when it&#x27;s doing the cleaning....</li>
            <li>well worth it for the many years</li>
            <li>In 2.5 minutes, my face is smooth.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re having problems getting a smooth shave, try the old-fashioned electric pre-shave stuff.</li>
            <li>if I have an important meeting in the afternoon.</li>
            <li>It is a fabulous razor.  </li>
            <li>However, Amazon does have them available for around $8-11 for a 3-pack.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how close and smooth the shave was.</li>
            <li>Overall, the shaver works well and is a great value.  </li>
            <li>Overall it works great.</li>
            <li>It works great unless you move it in a way that causes the trimmer to try and fold back to the stored position.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face smooth and does not hurt, even when I go four days without shaving.  </li>
            <li>It was working great until the self-cleaner stopped draining the second time I used it.</li>
            <li>the price and thought it was quite cheap in comparison to what I paid for the Braun, and clicked to buy.    </li>
            <li>I thought it felt cheap and</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>I bought it with cheap price in Amazon.</li>
            <li>Easy use , clean up and never make me hurt in using .</li>
            <li>so you can use it in shower  easy to clean under running water  </li>
            <li>I can do a really great shave including the back of my neck in about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Its so close and smooth</li>
            <li>that even my wife can&#x27;t tell that I didn&#x27;t use a blade razor, and for that I can&#x27;t be happy enough.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your face as \\&quot;smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I replaced the blades only once, about a year or so ago, and it&#x27;s still working great and still holding a charge.  </li>
            <li>My skin is as smooth as after I shave with a razor.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is simple, this shaver works great.</li>
            <li>The wet shave is even closer and brilliant in the shower</li>
            <li>Simply put shaving cream on your face and this razor cuts great.</li>
            <li>told, I&#x27;ve never been as happy with a razor as I am with this one.e, which means I no longer have razor burn mixed with missed whiskers.    </li>
            <li>It feels great in your hand and it&#x27;s designed to get to different contours of your face and neck.</li>
            <li>All the reviews I read praising this device were justified.  </li>
            <li>Shaves close, charges quickly, easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am extremely happy with this shaver from Panasonic and</li>
            <li>However, it was so smooth and pain free.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shaver, fantastic value.</li>
            <li>The shave is so close, so smooth, as smooth as a blade.  </li>
            <li>My face is amazingly smooth in under five minutes.  </li>
            <li>I also have a light beard</li>
            <li>amazing piece of technology that really delivers what men want</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, even without the cleaning unit.  </li>
            <li>I think it helps in such a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday and his face is always smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the overall performance of this shaver!</li>
            <li>but they were either hand me downs or cheap models.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly light growth, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite a smooth as a razor blade, but I&#x27;ve never cut myself with the ES8249S</li>
            <li>and it get&#x27;s me about 99% as smooth.  </li>
            <li>- my primary purpose was my dome -</li>
            <li>The razor delivers a close smooth shave with its \\&quot;4 Blade Technology\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Before cleaning it in the support I brush away the cut hair from inside - I think this way I can renew the cleaning liquid more rarely.  </li>
            <li>The shaver head glides smoothly over the contours of my neck and jaw.  </li>
            <li>charge life and easy to clean even with out the station.</li>
            <li>Provides comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to be redundant and go on about how great a shaver this product is, but I would like to stress that the cleaning cartridge while not necessary to cleaning the shaver does an excellent job at cleaning and maintaining the blades.</li>
            <li>I used it becuase of the noise, and sound does not travel well in my house.  </li>
            <li>which is  primarily why I got this shaver.</li>
            <li>and I ordered a cheap electric shaver, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>A perfectly smooth face, and my neck didn&#x27;t feel like hamburger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing is ever perfect, and I do have a few quibbles.</li>
            <li>It gives a good shave, but takes longer than my old Norelco&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>These were only slightly better, but, (to be fair)</li>
            <li>but the dry/wet versitility of this shaver makes it far superior to the Braun.  </li>
            <li>I tried the wet shave feature yesterday and my lady rubbed my face and said \\&quot;nice; and that is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Has a nice cleaning system built into the charger, which is nice, but have found it to be entirely unecessary.</li>
            <li>Takes some space, but charger can be connected directly to shaver without it (good for travel).  </li>
            <li>and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>on old skin like mine under neck just fair.</li>
            <li>I even shaved Kim Kardashian&#x27;s kitty for her and made it nice and smooth, she shows it off as much as she can</li>
            <li>good shaving, very clean, and quiet.    </li>
            <li>So happy I bought this - thank you to all the other masses that have put this on top of the pack for me.</li>
            <li>I had read the great reviews weeks ago, but when my older Panasonic died two days ago I was in a pickle and had to act fast.  </li>
            <li>It cleans up easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li>After reading several reviews before my purchase, I do agree with people who stated that cleaning system is not that impressive and takes 4 times longer than my previous shaver and doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job.</li>
            <li>Quick &amp; Easy review here...</li>
            <li>Makes shaving quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy and quick..</li>
            <li>The BJ Hydroplane shave cream provides a remarkably smooth shave,and if it begins to dry out before finishing, I can just add more water and it is good to go again.</li>
            <li>I may just need a new head, but instead of spending up to $40 on a new head, I decided to check out the latest and greatest in new shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Immediately, i noticed very little to no irritation on my neck, which was awesome.</li>
            <li>I originally had the three blade version (ES8103S)</li>
            <li>I have to shave over and over to get a close shave as when originally purchased.</li>
            <li>, close shaves even though I&#x27;m still using the original foil and cutters.</li>
            <li>But the price was originally $299</li>
            <li>i am very pleased and surprised at the performance of this shaver.</li>
            <li>It shaves pretty well, even under the neck (make sure to do it when the skin is dry)&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: If you are willing to spend $70 more - buy Braun series 7 electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Summary I am happy with the price/performance of this product but not surprised with it.</li>
            <li>It works great and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li>So far I am very satisfied with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>He was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to help shave my head with a razor to do the follow-up work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the WET shave once with this razor and it was really good almost as good as a real razor.  </li>
            <li>It shaves extremely close and it&#x27;s honestly the next best thing to using a blade.</li>
            <li>This is BETTER than any other shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, shaves as close as the fusion blades (nearly to 99%), but that is PERFECT for me.</li>
            <li>I got it real cheap on the deal of the day and needed a new one anyway.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have around, but you could live without it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to give it a glowing review right out of the box because it seems I always have a great first impression of something new.  </li>
            <li>Every once in a while, the cleaning system isn&#x27;t completely clean.</li>
            <li>Even more amazing it was done with relatively low effort.  </li>
            <li>Now I just clean the shaver manually and I doubt whether I&#x27;ll buy any shaver with a cleaning system.</li>
            <li>you can just run the razor under running water to clean it.</li>
            <li>The ability to clean with soap and water is convenient.  </li>
            <li>The screen tells you when to clean the shaver.</li>
            <li>and I have a clean razor.  </li>
            <li>You can also just clean the shaver with water and put it on dry/charge.</li>
            <li>I might give up on the cleaning system and clean by hand</li>
            <li>It does take a while to clean (perhaps about an hour), but I just set it and forget it while I am on my way out the door in the morning.    </li>
            <li>It cuts closer and is easier to use as well as to clean.</li>
            <li>Clener takes an hour to clean.</li>
            <li>Its clean shave is satisfactory.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the dry shaves, but not blown away.</li>
            <li>I went out and bought the Norelco 1280X/42 3D with the Jet Clean System.</li>
            <li>It would be 5 out of 5 stars if I did not have to use a toothpick to clean the cleaner every two times I use it.</li>
            <li>It would be 5 out of 5 stars if I did not have to use a toothpick to clean the cleaner every two times I use it.</li>
            <li>I usually clean it by removing the shaving head cover, running that under water, then switching the shaver on to the cleaning mode and running it under the shower water for about 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>it selfs clean while charging.</li>
            <li>You just pop off the shield, clean it under running water, and then hold the power button for two seconds to take it up to supersonic speeds to clean the blades.  </li>
            <li>Damn clean shave.....      </li>
            <li>The head of this razor is relatively huge with its 4 blades, which is why the shave is so quick.    </li>
            <li>recurring \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; was \\&quot;it&#x27;s noisy when in clean mode...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it holds the charge as long as stated but shaves very nicely</li>
            <li>Stop reading the (enormously positive, and accurate) reviews and just buy it already!</li>
            <li>Very smooth, he thought it could be the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The F5790 is an excellent razor that is fast with extreme close shave</li>
            <li>and then I got a special email from Amazon than made my mind up for me.  </li>
            <li>but when it came on special for $89.99, baddabing baddaboom....</li>
            <li>It was on a Gold Box special for $89</li>
            <li>(if you are a shower shaver do yourself a favor and order some right now!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;A very good shaver with a few caveats.  </li>
            <li>This shaver gave me the closest shave I have ever experienced with absolutely no irritation or burn.  </li>
            <li>I had never had a wet shave with an electric shaver and it felt GREAT.    </li>
            <li>And the Fusion gave me a great shave with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>Also, I legitimately think it shaves better when my face is greasy or wet, with or without gel, so I&#x27;m very pleased.    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to get the absolute closest shave the first week you own it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many electric razors over the years, but none really worked with my situation.  </li>
            <li>The full combo is to clean/dry/charge.</li>
            <li>, the orange glow of the screen was kinda cool looking</li>
            <li>Shaving was a chore and took over ten minutes to get fairly close.</li>
            <li>(love the wet mode), and my skin looks much better already, and the process is much more pleasurable than with Gillette blades.</li>
            <li>After a full charge, I used my razor.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll add one more star to say, thanks.</li>
            <li>It also has a solid feel and a good battery</li>
            <li>The overall shaving effect is almost as good as that using razor.</li>
            <li>I try different brands and styles before, but none of them will give me a good shave like this Panasonic.</li>
            <li>and I cannot say enough good things about it -</li>
            <li>No matter how many passes I make, the shave REMAINS gentle.  </li>
            <li>I am officially blown away by this product, as the shave is as good/better and is much more gentle on my face.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually better at shaving a head than a face, but I have a very tricky patch on my neck that always seems to need a blade to get</li>
            <li>It would take me about 7 or 8 minutes to do a full head shave with a blade (taking care not to cut myself).  </li>
            <li>gives you such a good result..</li>
            <li>thanks:)</li>
            <li>The ability to charge the shaver with the cord connected directly to the shaver instead of the use of the cleaning system is a nice option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately this was a gold box deal and its good enough to keep without returning.</li>
            <li>it was SUCH a good deal, so I just had to buy this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used it now for 4 days and still has a full charge.</li>
            <li>feel like you&#x27;d be better off buying just the razor instead of the cleaning system because lets be real here, its a wet/dry razor.</li>
            <li>The sellers warranty was only good for 90 days.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>Still not a bad shaver if you use these types.  </li>
            <li>I asked what am I supposed to use in the mean time, and was told basically that is not their problem, this is their warranty procedure and even after 30 days with a defective unit that is the best they can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No mess of any kind.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I have owned with a battery meter, it is very nice and a must have in the future for me.</li>
            <li>For this price well worth it, but at full price, I think I&#x27;d stick with the standalone razor and just use the liquid soap to clean it</li>
            <li>For this price well worth it, but at full price, I think I&#x27;d stick with the standalone razor and just use the liquid soap to clean it</li>
            <li>After my first shave, my face was so smooth and clean...</li>
            <li>THIS LAST SUMMER, STILL GOING STRONG!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, my husband is happy with the shaver.</li>
            <li>Anyways, other than the cleaning system cartlidges, this for the price is great.</li>
            <li>Long story short, this thing is incredible and is much better than the Braun.</li>
            <li>It did a nice smooth and complete job beginning with the first use.</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re looking to switch to a good electric razor or maybe just looking to save some money in the long run but don&#x27;t mind putting up a good bit of money to start out, I would definitely recommend this razor to you.  </li>
            <li>Took a quick try with it right out of the box (there was enough charge in it) and was happy with the first impression, so I decided to keep it and give it a full whirl in the morning.    </li>
            <li>has the best price along with top notch customer service, but I bought mine down the street at my local Target for 6 dollars</li>
            <li>has the best price along with top notch customer service, but I bought mine down the street at my local Target for 6 dollars</li>
            <li>and I use it after every three shaves and it does keep my shaver clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Gives more options than my older Braun charger and cleaner did.</li>
            <li>Luckily, putting this on Amazon&#x27;s subscription service also saves you 15% on the price.    </li>
            <li>The trick is not moving too quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, since it shaves quickly the razor can go 7-10 days between charging.</li>
            <li>seemed similar to the last electric razor i tried 10 years ago; not too impressed.</li>
            <li>It provides a quick and close shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>-cleaning solution can be picked up on Amazon for 3 pack for around $12  -quick</li>
            <li>The self-cleaning feature is super convenient.</li>
            <li>I just recieved the razor and took it for a quick spin .</li>
            <li>This model charges quickly.</li>
            <li>It can be cleaned quickly under a stream of water or with handsoap.  </li>
            <li>Shaver charges quickly I was using a Remington</li>
            <li>A quiet, comfortable shave, nice and close with no razor burn either.  </li>
            <li>I do really like the cleaner units because they do such a great job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I do really like the cleaner units because they do such a great job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Quick recharge.  </li>
            <li>Two minutes is all that&#x27;s needed for a quick shave&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>a quick rinse under the tap does just as well.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was amazingly quick (even over the holidays).  </li>
            <li>I quickly became a believer.</li>
            <li>I immediately turned it on for a quick shave test.</li>
            <li>I use a gel shaving cream with a quick renise after use then just a stand cleaning about once every 1-2 weeks you don&#x27;t need to buy cleaning detergent refills for each month.</li>
            <li>and I have the luxury of a quick afternoon/evening shave</li>
            <li>it works slightly better than my Norelco 8240XL (which is now my travel shaver), and the cleaning system is decent.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, have been using it daily for last four or five years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient for a quick shave, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>its his most favorite birthday present</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been high on Braun products, and I will say I was satisfied.  </li>
            <li>So if you are buying a shaver for your spouse, I recommend this one highly since you will definitely be enjoying the benefits of it.</li>
            <li>So if you are buying a shaver for your spouse, I recommend this one highly since you will definitely be enjoying the benefits of it.</li>
            <li>I got a close shave quickly on the very first usage, i.e. no break in time.</li>
            <li>- can clean it right in the shower or sink, or place it in the self cleaner.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, ergonomic, leaves skin smooth like never before, and a clear 5 stars in my book.</li>
            <li>and this is the first electric shaver that has ever gotten my head completely smooth.  </li>
            <li>These are great shavers but they have to be able to last for SEVERAL years before needing service.</li>
            <li>Having had Brauns until about 9 years ago, I was very pleased with the last Panasonic shaver I had.  </li>
            <li>I have never expected an electric razor to match the closeness of a safety razor, but this one comes the closest of any model I have ever used (including Braun and Norelco) -- and I am thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the first week, I installed the cleaning cartridge and filled the cleaning reservoir with tap water.  </li>
            <li>and you have a nice, clean shaver waiting for you the next day.</li>
            <li>charging clean is great, cleaning doesn&#x27;t need to happen everyday.</li>
            <li>Was a great investment and hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li>the little cleaning station cant do more than you can easily do by just throwing some antibacterial soap on it and turning it on while dunked in a sink full of water, its more of a gimmic if you ask me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a lifetime customer of the Norelco rotary razor having practically one of every new model including up to the latest [[ASIN:B000PKKAGO</li>
            <li>That tells me Panasonic is going to roll out a new model again and it will be better.     </li>
            <li>Previously, I had a Braun electric that i was happy with, until the child tried to shave the Maltese puppy, which irritated both me and the dog.  </li>
            <li>It is very lite and the flexibility of the head made it so easy to get around the contours of the jaw line.  </li>
            <li>i think it takes me this long as i&#x27;m figuring out all the best angles to get the different grain directions of my hair.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better than a hot lather shave with this razor, and the self-cleaner makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li>but I have found that the shave is very close and the easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am someone who is willing to spend a little bit more for a quality product and good customer service.</li>
            <li>I am someone who is willing to spend a little bit more for a quality product and good customer service.</li>
            <li>It easily shaves the hard to get areas on my neck and the self cleaning feature is great.</li>
            <li>At first this missed an ingrown hair or two, but after a week or two of using it, I always walk away with a clean shave.      </li>
            <li>I agree with many of the other people in that it&#x27;s probably best to just rinse the shaver using water and a little bit of liquid soap under turbo-mode and following up using the cleaning system with &#x27;dry-only&#x27; cycle to keep the blades nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I am agreed with all review regarding its cleaning system; after I tried it one time, I prefer to clean it manually    cleaning system takes long time and not 100% effective.   </li>
            <li>He said he will be shaving much more often and is certain that he has found a real keeper in this electric</li>
            <li>In fact, I don&#x27;t really see the need for the large cleaning, charging device, as you can clean it under the tap with body wash, and could just as easily plug it in to charge it.</li>
            <li>That, combined with background noise and distorted sound, was a real challenge.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and use, but from a straight razor to an electric one takes adjustment.  </li>
            <li>It was smooth and fast and did the job with no muss or fuss.  </li>
            <li>The Braun had trouble coping with the neck area whereas the Panasonic did a great job there.</li>
            <li>An amazingly smooth and fast shaver.</li>
            <li>I was so astounded at how smooth my skin felt that I just kept shaving till my whole face and neck was shaved.</li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy this shaver as much as he does.</li>
            <li>Conclusion: A fantastic razor at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The Braun had trouble coping with the neck area whereas the Panasonic did a great job there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value when you think of how much money you save and give a great shave without any cutting or niks.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Ok, just send it in and get it fixed.  </li>
            <li>I have more professional trimmers, so I will not use the one that is a part of this one.    </li>
            <li>This was worth the money</li>
            <li>so I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>The shaver can be used directly in the shower which is where he loves to use it the most.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently my buddy bought a Braun Series 3 shaver, but never really said much about it...certainly never bragged about how great it was.  </li>
            <li>My older Braun shavers lasted 5-6 years easy.</li>
            <li>but again the Panasonic wins again.</li>
            <li>So, Mr. Panasonic, I&#x27;m not buying your latest model, the almost two-year old Panasonic ES-LA93-K.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s rarely any razor burn (sometimes around the adam&#x27;s apple</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin and have not shaved two days in a row for probably 10 years or more.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this shaver a try after reading multiple reviews and performing some research on my own.</li>
            <li>Better than my old Braun</li>
            <li>Shaves closer than my admitted old Panasonic and captures longer hairs better than any electric shaver I&#x27;ve used (30+ years).  </li>
            <li>I was glad it arrived in only 3 days, even using the \\&quot;Supersaver\\&quot; free shipping.    </li>
            <li>I am also pleased that it uses a Lithium-Ion battery, as opposed to the NiCads of old.    </li>
            <li>I tried changing cartridges more frequently (every three weeks), I am cleaning it every day, but...</li>
            <li>but so far the shave and the battery are both top notch.</li>
            <li>My last shaver (same $50 Braun for 3 years) was excellent for my skin, but this Panasonic is much closer--</li>
            <li>nearly razor close--at the cost of significantly more irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better now than I was with my old shaver with regards to cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Also, I am VERY pleased with the exceptionally long battery life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m off to the post office to ship this to Panasonic&#x27;s exchange center, making good use of the 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li>Wet shave using gel/cream is good.</li>
            <li>I would only use it once a week if I did and since the manual says the cleaning pad is only good for a month no matter how many times you use it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money I paid ($100).</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Completely worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>with most electric razors, the flip out trimmer in back is more of a nod towards convention than something really usable.  </li>
            <li>with most electric razors, the flip out trimmer in back is more of a nod towards convention than something really usable.  </li>
            <li>Overall, after reading many reviews from various sources, this shaver is rated in the top three from many of these sources and I can attest</li>
            <li>its also good for touch ups after a wet shave.  </li>
            <li>I already own one of these shavers for the last two years, but I lost the charger and to replace it, it was going to cost me about $30 dollars.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system is also pretty cool</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different electric razors over the years, and have never found one that I&#x27;ve liked or that did a comparable job to blades.  </li>
            <li>I had not used an electric shaver in many years and was pleasantly surprised at the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised to find that the top model on every website I found was this one, by Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>; a fast, smooth, irritation free, very close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 66 years old, so I&#x27;ve tried many of them.</li>
            <li>From all the different brands available, Panasonic is the one I like the most.</li>
            <li>The independent 4 blade system is a nice design.  </li>
            <li>Beauty Encounter send the product on time (early) and over both of us are pleased.</li>
            <li>I tried the soft position but the locked one gives better results for me.</li>
            <li>The old one was outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Most electric shavers just shorten the stuble, but this one actually shaves it off leaving your face smooth.  </li>
            <li>So I still keep a razor handy and run it through those areas where there is still left over hair.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>The cleaning station regularly gets clogged with hair, and it just did not seem to do anything spectacular</li>
            <li>I love everything about this shaver except how terribly loud it is when it&#x27;s going through its self-cleaning.</li>
            <li>- You can get the cartridges right here on amazon, they aren&#x27;t very much - the shaver doesn&#x27;t need the full cleaning cycle each time...</li>
            <li>So while the reviews here were very positive, I wasn&#x27;t overly optimistic about the ES8249S.</li>
            <li>The cleaning/recharging station is great for keeping the shaver clean and ready to go although the cleaning cartridges are a little pricey.  </li>
            <li>My blades are still as sharp as they were when I got over a year ago... and the cleaning system works great - - I would rather spend about $10 for 3-4 months of cartridges vs. spending alot more for razors and replacing the blades and especially cleaning it by hand....</li>
            <li>It was worth waiting for the right price .  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, and I only use the stand to clean it once a month.  </li>
            <li>Then I tried Norelco about 3 years ago, with better, but similar result (significant irritation).</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t take you from a beard to clean shaven, but it will certainly keep 1-day of stuble in check.  </li>
            <li>I think having a warm, wet head helps the ES8249S give a closer shave, and it certainly makes keeping the sink area clean since there are no hair clippings to clean up.</li>
            <li>and because I rinse off the shaver before I put it in the cleaning solution I&#x27;m able to extend the cleaner to last 4-6 months without having to replace it and the shaver feels and smells clean.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you buy this razor don&#x27;t waste your money on the cleaning/charging unit, you can clean the shaver just as good and charge it with the power cord.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to take as many passes to cleanly shave my face, which means I no longer have razor burn mixed with missed whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it does a perfectly adequate job for an electric, I find that there are razors for $40 less that do just as good a job.  </li>
            <li>The facts that you can use the shaver in the shower and always have it spotlessly clean and ready by using the accompanying self-cleaning recharger makes this electric shaver ideal for any man who wants a consistently clean shave in least amount of time and effort.</li>
            <li>Very clean shave, no irritation on neck area compared to old one.</li>
            <li>- I have what some would call a babyface and I experienced little to no irritation after first use.  </li>
            <li>the shaver is pretty good, a little loud i think, but it is very smooth and quick.  </li>
            <li>, it goes right thru it.</li>
            <li>RIGHT OFF!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had packed it in my suitcase for my drive home from vacation, it worked right when I packed it</li>
            <li>The size is about right for travel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll treat that kitty right.</li>
            <li>and I can shave my neck, right along the beard, without it yanking any hairs at all.</li>
            <li>The charging/washing unit thing doesn&#x27;t wash it right anymore, but it still charges and dries it well.</li>
            <li>The shaver is very LIGHT - I would think good for those who are arthritic  The ultra thin foil shaves COMFORTABLY and GENTLY.  </li>
            <li>It gives a close, comfortable shave without grabbing or yanking the hairs like some of my older razors did.  </li>
            <li>I sparingly use the clean cyle as I feel the \\&quot;required\\&quot; frequency to use it is too much.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t even courteous enough to give me the exact part number that I would need.</li>
            <li>First shave out of the box, I knew it was something far better than anything I&#x27;d ever used - three minutes</li>
            <li>Clean shaves, worked very well.  </li>
            <li>The razor is really high class with its look and the grip is extremely comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and not necessary to buy a ton of the cleaning cartridges - I get far more cleans out of them than they say one should.    </li>
            <li>Smooth, incredible close shave wet or dry!</li>
            <li>Read reviews and most people advised that it takes some time for your skin to adjust to new shaving mechanism and you need to use this shaver for 2-3 weeks before you can really feel it.    </li>
            <li>It was worth spending a little extra to get the best.</li>
            <li>It has good shave time and easy to read screen and one charge lasts at least for 14-18 shaves.</li>
            <li>I think this electric is definitely worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>It would still be worth it even at the higher price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced in the past with electric Razors.</li>
            <li>Before the Arc IV, I used an electric Braun shaver (don&#x27;t remember the model, I bought it from costco), which shaved alright under most conditions, but was absolutely useless when my face was greasy or sweaty, and ended up causing me more pain than I&#x27;d have liked.</li>
            <li>There are no bad things to really say about this shaver</li>
            <li>and it works great for a quick shave, when I don&#x27;t want to reshave for the night.. or go out for a few minutes.. highly recommended.</li>
            <li>in all a super high tech unit with the bast wash system have used by far being more cost effective and even has a fan and heater to dry the razar.</li>
            <li>this shaver admittedly shaves the face well, but does not work well on the neck/under chin area - in fact, its pretty disappointing in light of the overwhelming number of great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Face still feels shaved after 8 hours (this is very strange, but nice).</li>
            <li>Clear, easy to read display,</li>
            <li>I still think that this is the best performance shaver out there however a blade life that lasts only a few months is unacceptable.</li>
            <li>after decades of using various electric shavers on an intermittant basis, i have finally found one that works just great.  </li>
            <li>Powerful battery&#x27;&#x27;Love the package&#x27;if send as present&#x27;</li>
            <li>Review indicated that it was almost as good as an equivalet Braun and half the price.  </li>
            <li>However, even the good ones (i.e. high-end Philip Norelcos and Brauns) gave my sensitive facial skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a big deal because it can be taken in the shower and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>If I wanted to look smooth longer (no five o&#x27;clock shadow) I&#x27;d use a razor, but I enjoy the convenience of an electric, especially when traveling.    </li>
            <li>My wife and I both love that she can use it in the shower, clean it under the water, and put it on dry when she gets out so</li>
            <li>Only concern is, this shaver doesn&#x27;t work great unless the hair is VERY short.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system does a much better job keeping the head clean (and dry).  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I bought a second identical shaver to keep in my office.</li>
            <li>I got this for less than ninety bucks, so probably was a good deal.</li>
            <li>being someone that has to shave every single day for work, Its nice to have this electric shaver</li>
            <li>There is a turbo mode with an extremely high vibration rate to clean the blades under running water.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews on Amazon and other sites, and studying the specifications, I decided to give it a chance, and I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>within 24 hours of my first electric wet shave i tried electric wet shaving again; guess what, it was perfect!</li>
            <li>I switched to blades to get a closer shave and was pretty satisfied with the results and figured the smoother face was worth the extra hassle.    </li>
            <li>Completely unecessary to be quite honest, but nice for the lazy folks.  </li>
            <li>Simplle, quiet, and a close shave out of the box make this a purchase seem to be a great deal, especially with the great Amazon price, at least $40 below any price I could find.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used the charger cleaner and don&#x27;t know that I will very much since its costly</li>
            <li>I like this very much.  </li>
            <li>It shaved closer than other models, was smoother and more comfortable on my face, and you could wash the heads.</li>
            <li>There is also a pop-out trimmer that seems to work fine, but doesn&#x27;t trim nearly as close as the shaver head cuts (of course, it&#x27;s not designed to).      </li>
            <li>It is a bit louder than my old Panasonic shaver but works fine.  </li>
            <li>but an older man with \\&quot;scruff\\&quot; just isn&#x27;t cool.</li>
            <li>One thing that was nice about it was that it actually seemed to do better in wet conditions or right after a shower.  </li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to buy the razor with the cleaning system--but I am delighted with the charging/cleaning station.  </li>
            <li>The spot was completely smooth and clean, I continued, my neck, jaw, and even the stragglers on my upper cheek were cut off, and my face felt like it did when I was 8!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this is a nice product overall; I mainly got it because I wanted an electric shaver with a charging stand.</li>
            <li>and I find that another good sign that they will last much longer, giving me the chance to either just rinse the razor after use or use hand soap to clean and just use the drying and charging functions on the station; though I tend to only charge the battery when I get to 10% to preserve the battery.  </li>
            <li>The first week there was some minor irritation and a little bit of a learning period as I figured out how best to maximize the efficiency of the razor.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good or better than any electric I&#x27;ve ever used, especially with a little soap or cream to lubricate the skin.</li>
            <li>I clean it in the stand 4 times/week, which keeps the shaver looking new every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I replaced my first one with a 3-blade ES8092 6 years ago.</li>
            <li>I bought this model because it was only about $25 more than the ES8243 model without the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>so I am not going to change my rating on this razor, just making you aware of the companies policies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same blades since I got the shaver and while I was still able to get the close shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is if you are lucky enough to receive a working unit, most likely you will be fine.</li>
            <li>husband used the razor yesterday (26 Dec) for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I owned a Panasonic electric shaver before and it did a mediocre job at best</li>
            <li>I have read numerous review on this model that it is supposed to be better than the three blade version.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t believe any electric can), it get&#x27;s pretty darn close, and the cleaning system is about as dummyproof as you can get.</li>
            <li>Without question, I gave this shaver 5 stars because it has met or exceeded all of my expectations, and it shaves close enough that most people would never know that I used an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I always found it somewhat funny that the instructions always said something to the effect of, \\&quot;use for 30 days, as skin may take time to adapt to electric razor use.\\</li>
            <li>My first self-cleaning electric razor was a Braun, bought 2.5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I will tell you the same results can be achieved with both razors, however, it takes more time and (in my case) irritation with the Braun.  </li>
            <li>Stays charged a long time, is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>To that end, I&#x27;d be willing to do away with the automatic cleaning feature.</li>
            <li>ordered with overnight Saturday delivery, and tore the shaver out of the box first thing.  </li>
            <li>thanks Panasonic!    </li>
            <li>it used to bother me having two days and more stubble going to meetings and such, but now i need not worry.    </li>
            <li>After the first shave he got rid of the one he had.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as solid either, but I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li>He was amazed the first time he used the razor.</li>
            <li>but I personally wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $120 for it.  </li>
            <li>Since this is the first electric razor I have used, I was amazed at how well it seems to shave.</li>
            <li>This is my first Panasonic electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>This shaver does its job very well!  </li>
            <li>My first Panasonic was the 8109s.  </li>
            <li>ok, I bought a second one for him and he loves it too!!!  </li>
            <li>The first time I shaved with the Arc IV was after 2 days of not shaving, and I just wanted to see how it would cut.</li>
            <li>It is waterproof, so afyer using, simply pop the top and run under the faucet...</li>
            <li>Looked pretty good for a day or two (once the blood dried)...</li>
            <li>Actually better at neck areas but still can pick a hair after 20 times passing the same area.</li>
            <li>-pretty</li>
            <li>One charge a week is more than enough.</li>
            <li>which was my first experience with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Always make that my first shopping place.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my husband about six months ago and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>This is my first upgrade in shaving since 2001</li>
            <li>My husband has a thick beard and Panasonic ES82594 Arc IV works great for him.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased it, I was concerned that cleaning it would always require the cleaning stand with solution, etc.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted me 10+ years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of foil shavers but I bought this shaver for my head based on some recommendations and it does an outstanding job.  </li>
            <li>This is my first linear razor.  </li>
            <li>Until I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still more than enough for a week&#x27;s vacation without having to worry about taking the cord.     </li>
            <li>Very close to a blade and never a nick!</li>
            <li>-The cleaning station consistently gets clogged.  </li>
            <li>At first I had the activator.  </li>
            <li>It has a higher pitched sound but is still not quite as loud if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li>For the first week I had it</li>
            <li>You do not have to go over the same area as many times.  </li>
            <li>Have yet to try the cleaning system but from my first impressions the shaver itself has exceeded my expectation and would throughly recommend.</li>
            <li>better than I get with some blades actually.  </li>
            <li>This one just bulks more overall.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had before I got my first Panasonic in 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First, keep in mind</li>
            <li>, I understand why it&#x27;s a top rated shaver, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The first shave removed hairs that had been dodging the blade on every morning shave for months.  </li>
            <li>first one was a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I use a trimmer first and then this.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY ZERO!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go for a cheaper model electric razor that will lift hair before it cuts, this will most likely cause skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>This razor amazed me on the first use.  </li>
            <li>First, I do NOT find this to be a &#x27;one pass&#x27; shaver.</li>
            <li>It is FAST!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was astounded after my first shave.  </li>
            <li>I had used a Norelco rotary product before, and it destroyed my skin on the first use.</li>
            <li>My most recent electric shaver was on</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s just not difficult to rinse off just the blades and foil, and not soak the rest of the unit.  </li>
            <li>I used to use electric razors when I first started shaving</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product and am glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li>Let me begin by saying this is my first electric razor.  </li>
            <li>(that built-in timer is pretty handy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am using any electric Shaver</li>
            <li>First, it shaves closer than my Braun.  </li>
            <li>Shaves ok and if I work at it can get a relatively close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not whisper quiet, but I sure don&#x27;t find it</li>
            <li>Pretty neat.</li>
            <li>This shaver is outstanding, quiet, non-pulling, thorough and pricier than the one I returned for repair.  </li>
            <li>I first got a Panasonic ES8077S.</li>
            <li>My wife woke up the first morning</li>
            <li>I primarily purchased this to replace a 2 Blade Braun shaver that was close to 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>the first was a three blade model which I used for about a year before getting this one on Hot Deals.</li>
            <li>I purchased this based on the quality and performance of the first two and on Amazon&#x27;s rating.  </li>
            <li>The system isn&#x27;t worth much, though.</li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I shaved with it I decided to go on a Friday night to give my face the weekend to recover.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a four blade shaver, it has four independently floating shave screens that sit on top of two blades.</li>
            <li>The pop up trimmer seems pretty flimsy to me and doesn&#x27;t exactly glide well for straightening around moustaches or goatees, so i still have need of my bladed shaver for trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i know it will only get better with time.</li>
            <li>so I was able to send it back to Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I used the self cleaner for the first year or so</li>
            <li>Is still doing exactly what it is designed to do 2 years on.</li>
            <li>All in all, a good razor and I would recommend you try it if you are thinking of changing your current brand or just ready to replace your old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Need to use a blade every few days to get a good trim line for sideburns and goatee.  </li>
            <li>It gives a close shave and although it has a few \\&quot;nits\\&quot;, it was a good buy.on&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It gives a close shave and although it has a few \\&quot;nits\\&quot;, it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>considered trying something new rather than getting the same shaver since my old one is actually still working perfectly.</li>
            <li>But, most importantly, it shaves closer, with less time and effort, and it is more quiet, both shaving and during cleaning.    </li>
            <li>If you only shave short stubbles then you will have a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>i expect this time to come down as i get more familiar with the style of shaving.      </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;d never used a \\&quot;foil\\&quot; shaver, the reviews seemed pretty positive, so I decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li>I eventually had to replace the case as well, due to the on/off switch malfunction that is popular with them.</li>
            <li>and I always developed significant rashes and skin reactions to them.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and needed a shaver that would accommodate and this one has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it dry once or twice when needs must, and the results were good, just a little more irritation.</li>
            <li>At first I just used it dry as a normal electric shaver and loved it more than any other shaver I had.</li>
            <li>The only time I was able to get a truly good shave was the one time each week that I used a regular razor (more than once a week was too hard on my skin).  </li>
            <li>While your mileage may vary, my face didn&#x27;t need any adjustment time with this shaver, as I typically have when switching to a new shaver, which was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall a very good product I highly recommend it, especially for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Seriously though, this is a great razor.  </li>
            <li>but my wife liked me to have at least a semi smooth face when I didn&#x27;t feel like using my Mach3.  </li>
            <li>It shaves really close to my face, and I&#x27;ve never been able to use electric shavers because they don&#x27;t get close enough for my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>Arc IV never skipped a beat, never pulled or tugged a hair, and left my face feeling fresh and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several high-end shavers over the years with only fair results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plenty good enough for my daily needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Arc IV is wonderful to clean; because it&#x27;s waterproof, you just put a little ordinary liquid soap and water on the head, operate the turbo mode, then take it apart and rinse the pieces off under a faucet.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by the quick charge time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, specially useful for the neck area.</li>
            <li>All of the positive comments about it convinced me to try it.  </li>
            <li>Was looking at Braun and Norelco but came across research and all the positive feedback from Panasonic owners and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>This product works well and provides a decent shave (not as clean as a razor, but better than all other electrics I have tried).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve very impressed, I even payed alot less than my other one!</li>
            <li>no matter how long, what direction or how many passes I made on my neck -- even after replacing the blades).   </li>
            <li>My husband really likes it, and this is his first electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It also took way too long to shave, requiring too many repeated swaths.</li>
            <li>I still have many questions - when do you replace the blades, how long will this battery hold up, etc.</li>
            <li>After using the Panasonic for 5 shaves in just over a week, something i don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been able to do in who knows how long, I am ecstatic.</li>
            <li>The other thing I like is how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself has done pretty well and gives me a reasonable shave.</li>
            <li>And based on the users&#x27; review, Panasonic&#x27;s rating is as good as Braun&#x27;s if not better.  </li>
            <li>past experiences were not so good.</li>
            <li>I explained the problem and even though they had stated that their warranty would not cover the issue, they replaced the foil (I am guessing because it is uncommon for the foil to fail a little after 2 months, they are actually trying to keep a customer happy or both!).</li>
            <li>I explained the problem and even though they had stated that their warranty would not cover the issue, they replaced the foil (I am guessing because it is uncommon for the foil to fail a little after 2 months, they are actually trying to keep a customer happy or both!).</li>
            <li>Ive always wanted the category to perform better and it appears that someone has finally made a decent one.</li>
            <li>It recharges very fast and its quite easy to clean with water and a little bit of soap.  </li>
            <li>It is truly amazing compared to the Braun and my previous razors.</li>
            <li>The shave is completely atraumatic and quick.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Norelco shaver for almost 30 years, but this Panasonic is shaves me quickly, and completely.  </li>
            <li>Since first using it I have been very pleased and blown away by the self-cleaning tool that takes no more than 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Granted, I don&#x27;t shave dry often, most of the time I shave in the shower with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>and/or with shaving lotion, but for me it is a much better shave dry with a moist towel-off afterwards in all reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I feel like it&#x27;s better when using it dry.  </li>
            <li>but when I need a quick, close shave, I reach for my old blade.</li>
            <li>The cleaning cartridges, since they are dry, CAN not spill and are more compact to STORE.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has traveled with me to several countries now, and the charge easily lasts for two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I had tried electric razors previously but never found them effective</li>
            <li>The quality of the shave with the shave gel versus shaving dry is much better.</li>
            <li>This gest just as close, looks just as nice, and takes much less time.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find a shaver strong enough to shave my head as well as my face</li>
            <li>This shaver really does a much better job on those trouble spots than other electric shavers - but not as good as a blade.  </li>
            <li>The head is different than I&#x27;m used to from the other Panasonic, the whole top floats, rather than just the foils floating inside a more stationary plastic cover.  </li>
            <li>It shaves MORE closely in a single pass.  </li>
            <li>It provides MANY shaves from a single charge.</li>
            <li>I doubt I&#x27;d buy this again, and I certainly recommend that anyone looking for a shaver take a pass on this one.</li>
            <li>This year, instead of replacing the blades on my aging Norelco Smart Touch XL, I purchased this Panasonic ES8249S.</li>
            <li>But technology advances, and this shaver certainly reflects that.      </li>
            <li>B00008DQJQ Factory Reconditioned Braun 7526 Syncro Smart Logic Shaver]] purchased from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>, I take Panasonic trimmer and get rid of all the large areas.</li>
            <li>and it certainly does</li>
            <li>I hesitated at the large price tag but took the leap</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried wet shaving yet, but the dry shaving performance is great.  </li>
            <li>It works great wet or dry without any razor burns.</li>
            <li>It cuts the hair quickly and smoothly with minimal irritation.  </li>
            <li>Works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li>it gives a great shave both wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It is fast and easy and preferable to a traditional razor.</li>
            <li>All in all this is a good, clean cutting razor that is very simple and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The length of the shave time is probably a good half minute shorter than with the old Remington as well, and I don&#x27;t have to contort my skin in every direction like with the Remington.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the razor for over 2 weeks now, and the dry cleaning cartridge seems to work much better than Braun&#x27;s series cartidges; not to mention they are much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it just might be something I need to get used to, I still need to use the trimmer more than I did with my other razors&lt;</li>
            <li>This shaver has a very high build quality.  </li>
            <li>I own a less than 2-year-old top-of-the-line Norelco, and I constantly need to touch up my sessions with a real razor, in order to get a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really liked the ergonomics of this little guy</li>
            <li>and it even comes with a nice little cleaning/charging station.  </li>
            <li>Really nice little shaver esp.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done anything special as far as upkeep, just using the cleaning system and occasionally using some soap and alchol to clean the blades and foil.</li>
            <li>From the first time I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve had a clean shave equal to the shave I get from a Gillette Fusion or Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>I recognized that the Panasonic ES8249S was consistently rated highly by just about every reviewer.   </li>
            <li>cleaning base is great, and since you can pick clean, charge, or dry, it&#x27;s nice to be able to clean it myself and then drop it in to dry properly, or just drop it in once a week for a full cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li>It still doesn&#x27;t give a very good neck shave and the size of the head makes it difficult to navigate into nooks and crannies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is really easy to clean using a little shampoo and water.</li>
            <li>It is nice looking, relatively small, gives a comfortable, close shave that will make your significant other want to make-out more and not worry about looking like a sand-paper attack victim.</li>
            <li>On those rare occasions that I am on leave and allow my facial hair to grow a little this shaver is still able to cut smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It vibrates fast and smooth, instead of clunky like my last one.</li>
            <li>Very quiet, light weight, and shaves very close.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t clean, dumps water everywhere, and leaves the cleaning part where the razor sits half filled with water at the end of the cycle.  </li>

            <li>I have a very course beard.</li>
            <li>Nowadays, I travel a lot and because of the restrictions on liquids for carry on, electric razors are just so much easier.    </li>
            <li>Much easier (and cheaper)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Panasonic ES8249S!</li>
            <li>To both of our shock it gave him a very close shave</li>
            <li>After much searching and being led around in circles, I found a page that said enter zip code and click.  </li>
            <li>He HATES to shave- absolutely dreads it.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver</li>
            <li>Neither beats a shave with a real razor, of course.  </li>
            <li>My skin has reacted with raised patches, dryer skin, and unshaved portions that needed touch-ups with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>Besides, if you want to make some patterns by your beard, it cannot help so much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast shave.  </li>
            <li>straight razor kicks its ass any day of the week, and i regret spending the cash on this model.</li>
            <li>I have a very assymetrical hair growth on my neck, and I found that this shaver wasn&#x27;t very efficient there.  </li>
            <li>and at a cost of over $100 with shipping, it makes no sense not to just replace the whole thing here.</li>
            <li>I must say my faith in electric shavers has been restored, after years of using a straight edge...</li>
            <li>thanks Panasonic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how it used to be, you either had a close shave or a fast one.</li>
            <li>I can shave reasonably well in about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to miss as much stubble as the Braun did.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system uses a soapy module and water in its cleaning system and is much quieter than the Braun, which always scared my wife when it would start up again after a pause.    </li>
            <li>My husband said nothing could shave like a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>but so much easier.</li>
            <li>Acceptable shave, but found it took as much as 8 to 9 minutes to get one.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li>It is absolutely as close as a blade.</li>
            <li>Also handles neck hairs very well, which the Arcitec would not cut.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t get longer hairs very well.  </li>
            <li>I bought a ES-RT31S because it was very well priced.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t think that would really matter.  </li>
            <li>Battery seems to not have lost much capacity.</li>
            <li>He would really to have one that would work well for him.  </li>
            <li>All in all - This is a very well designed unit.</li>
            <li>It is much faster to just wash off under the faucet than it is to put it through the process of cleaning it automatically.</li>
            <li>The dock is also very noisy for me when it isn&#x27;t doing anything.</li>
            <li>It shows how much time you spend shaving and what percentage of battery remains (after two 2.5 minute shaves it shows 90%</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very noisy.</li>
            <li>I really like it now.  </li>
            <li>- Shaves the neck very well  - quieter cleaning system  </li>
            <li>I can only fit one side of the shaving foil in there.  </li>
            <li>Be careful and make sure to look at what the shaver is compatible with.  </li>
            <li>The price, at around $150, was a bit too much for me to justify</li>
            <li>It was the closest thing to a straight razor shave that I have ever had with an electric razor.</li>
            <li>Well, I don&#x27;t really consider this a problem.</li>
            <li>It also is much quicker</li>
            <li>and he loves it just as much.  </li>
            <li>Very close, no irritation.</li>
            <li>(I am now 64 years old) that I rarely shave on the weekends.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m on a blood thinner now, I really didn&#x27;t want to continue nicking my face when I shaved.</li>
            <li>Quiet and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I am a guy with fast growing beard</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had to use a blade for my primary shave as my beard is very coarse and grows  rapidly.  </li>
            <li>(And believe me, this guy has high standards!)</li>
            <li>He shaves his whole head and his face with it, and loves how close if gets and</li>
            <li>how much faster it is since he can now shave without water or soap.     </li>
            <li>real problem started just two months after I bought it.</li>
            <li>Very close to skin.</li>
            <li>Build-in quality is great; the design is not fancy, but simple and low key.      </li>
            <li>It gets a much closer shave and doesnt irritate the skin nearly as much.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and quiet.</li>
            <li>but they all do, it gives a very close shave between 4 - 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now, add that you can use this in the shower or bath and this thing really shines.  </li>
            <li>it is ready for me.  </li>
            <li>I find the system to work real well.</li>
            <li>At that point I started to buy the cheapest disposables I could find (which turn out to be Wilkinson&#x27;s Sword at Walmart; an 8 pack costs just under $6 with the Personna version being 10 cents cheaper but of much lower quality.)</li>
            <li>Handy for the times when I&#x27;ve got a low battery and don&#x27;t know if I really have enough of a charge to do a shave that morning or not.  </li>
            <li>in all a fantastic unit, especially if you can find a deal on</li>
            <li>Handy for the times when I&#x27;ve got a low battery and don&#x27;t know if I really have enough of a charge to do a shave that morning or not.  </li>
            <li>in all a fantastic unit, especially if you can find a deal on</li>
            <li>Very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave both ways (as close as my blade).  </li>
            <li>Also, it charges amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>However, neither of the razors I&#x27;ve owned before this Panasonic really did the job all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I actually had a truly smoothly shaved face.  </li>
            <li>It really handles everything.</li>
            <li>Dont pay much for the upgrade.</li>
            <li>The shave is much closer (equivalent to a blade) and you are done much faster.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s intended use, but I&#x27;m not going to use a straight razor for that</li>
            <li>I like how the cleaning cycle is much quieter than the Braun</li>
            <li>; it took appproximately a week for it to keep gray beard on chin cut real low; now it maintains a smooth shave</li>
            <li>It shaves fast and efficiently.</li>
            <li>an aside, the second razor, which then became my primary shaver has also now quit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Signed,&lt;br /&gt;Someone who buys a whole lot of stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy who shaves my whole head too.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work very well</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t think it even needs that.  </li>
            <li>Very over rated.  </li>
            <li>I am very please with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It is quieter, with a monotone hum at precisely A below Middle C.  </li>
            <li>The pop up trimmer also works very well for shaping sideburns etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this shaver for a month now and find it to give me a much better/closer shave than the  Braun shaver it has replaced.  </li>
            <li>No irritation, and a really close shave.</li>
            <li>According to the manufacturer&#x27;s specs, they should last about a month, but I get the \\&quot;status\\&quot; light telling me to change my cartridge after two weeks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>what I do have is very wiry.    </li>
            <li>but when a product where you put so much bucks...</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t unusual for me to go 30</li>
            <li>I suppose the Braun&#x27;s alcohol-based rinse cleaning system is much inferior to the foaming detergent system of the Panasonic and that accounts for the difference.</li>
            <li>There is too much documentation.</li>
            <li>I also shave against the grain for a very close shave.</li>
            <li>This electric shaver performs very well, so I&#x27;ve been told.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>however that doesn&#x27;t really matter much to me.  </li>
            <li>much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went straight away to using it in the shower, since I&#x27;ve never had an electric razor with this capability.</li>
            <li>This thing is on a whole &#x27;nother level.hit the button, and it cleans, dries, and charges your razor for you.</li>
            <li>This thing is on a whole &#x27;nother level.</li>
            <li>Shaver cuts very close without irritation, could be because its in the shower.</li>
            <li>That method is much simpler and cheaper than the fancy system.</li>
            <li>(All is well now, thanks.)  </li>
            <li>Gave me a real close shave.  </li>
            <li>Cleaned very well with the cleaning</li>
            <li>I used a sensitive skin preshave, a sensitive skin shave gel, a sensitive skin after shave and face emollients along with the popular five blade sensitive skin shaver.</li>
            <li>Not even so much as any redness or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Holds charge very well, and doesn&#x27;t require any additional accessories.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>He reports that it gives him a very close shave without any irritation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, shaves better, faster and closer than my old Braun.</li>
            <li>This razor has a 13,000 rpm motor,but doesn&#x27;t really shave any better than my old panasonic with a standard motor.</li>
            <li>I anticipate it will provide quiet, effective shavingwhile preparing for the next shave by self cleaning.    </li>
            <li>he, being a lifelong Norelco guy, was totally amazed at how good the shave was.</li>
            <li>I think razor blades such as the mach 5 do a far better job than any electric shaver.</li>
            <li>As mentioned above, the clean-up is so simple and effective.</li>
            <li>Firstly, after two and half months, it still shaves closer than I am able to with a razor.  </li>
            <li>Braun can&#x27;t find any hair after 6 or 8 times passing the same area and it becomes like a razor shaving with a little harsh on your skin but does an excellent job for special days.</li>
            <li>but this is the first NEW one that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I used my new Panasonic in the shower the first time and used shaving gel after reading this worked well with the shaver.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a good value due to the features, performance and should last for years.    </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this one is that it is VERY loud.</li>
            <li>Terrific price here on Amazon, well worth the money!</li>
            <li>When using this shaver as a \\&quot;wet shaver\\&quot; with shaving cream etc., this Panasonic is literally as good as shaving with a normal razor only with all the speed and convenience of an electric!  </li>
            <li>It may due to the fact that it deliver more force at shaving.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than the 3 rotating heads found on other types.</li>
            <li>Just bought this the other day to replace a $100 subpar Norelco and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that it really does live up to what others have been praising it for!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like a whole new world!  </li>
            <li>and when he did need a clean close shave he would break out in rashes using a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much smoother than my older Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>about the same time it took to prep, shave, and clean up using a blade.    </li>
            <li>If you use the shaver daily, then you get 1 month from a cartridge no matter how often you clean it.</li>
            <li>I even used it a while back when I was shaving my whole head and, done in the shower, it was quick, painless and very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always despised shaving, but, at least for this first month, I&#x27;ve kind of been looking forward to it.</li>
            <li>He loves the close shave, quickness of shaving, holds a charge a long time, the travel case, and the fact that it gets cleaned really well, and is comfortable in his hand.</li>
            <li>Charged it up before I left, put it in the included pouch, packed it in the luggage, and got a close, clean shave every day.</li>
            <li>This shaver cost more than I usually spend for a shaver, but I think it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty confident that if I went over my beard with this thing, it would shave it off with a few passes without any hair-pulling.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my wife immediately commented on how much louder it was than my old shaver.</li>
            <li>Like the idea of the cleaning station, will probably just clean it whenever the battery runs low</li>
            <li>You have to clean it after every 2-3 strokes to work properly.</li>
            <li>If I had to choose a negative aspect of this shaver, it would be that the stand cleaner operates somewhat loudly so it would be best if you let it run during the day or if your bathroom is far enough away from your bedrooms.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because of the High speed motor and paid to much money.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this and it has changed my perception about the viability of electric razors in the modern age.    </li>
            <li>the cleaning unit is not worth the extra expense,I seem to get it just as clean or even better by just rinsing it under water.</li>
            <li>&quot; (being a bit large when comparing to my old shaver) cannot fit around my ears to shave the side-of-the-head areas just above them.</li>
            <li>The clean cycle is not that clean, and it&#x27;s designed to re-use water a few times before changing it.</li>
            <li>Out of several previous electric shavers, this one is superior.  </li>
            <li>I get a nice (dry) face shave using facesaver, HOWEVER, the NECK remains a big problem!!</li>
            <li>so you can forget that option (unless you enjoy an hour long shave that goes nowhere...).  </li>
            <li>I should mention that i have long used Norelco triple headers, but have also tried and returned Braun and Remington shavers within their free return periods).</li>
            <li>I usually shave in my truck and it takes about 5 minutes to get a nice close shave that is ALMOST as a blade.</li>
            <li>Being that I shave my entire head each day, taking between 8 and 10 minutes, and considering that most people only shave the face, I use my shaver about 3 to 4 times as much as a once-per-day face shaver does.</li>
            <li>However, I knew after my first shave with the Panasonic that it was a keeper and far out performed my Braun products.  </li>
            <li>The newer high-end model looks really cool with the extra motor in the head</li>
            <li>Tried the top of the line Braun, seemed to take too long to shave, and had to go over the same area 5 times to get a close shave (also VERY noisy)!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it was a great investment and my husband will never go back to a traditional straight edge or even a cheaper brand of electric shavers.    </li>
            <li>As far as the shaving, it gets pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li>Nice small carrying pouch.  </li>
            <li>I found it full of really gross liquid.</li>
            <li>I have been stuck with my Gillette Fusion for years now since most electric shavers I have tried only irritated my skin and left much stubble on my face.</li>
            <li>The added cleaning feature is nice to have though I&#x27;m not sure it is a necessity for everyone.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver and I have used Gillette Mach/Fusion so far.</li>
            <li>One can also clean normally with just regular liquid soap.  </li>
            <li>You may want more cartridges down the line for cleaning, but all self cleaning razors are like that.  </li>
            <li>I finally decided that the technology of these shavers has gotten to a point where it would be worth trying to make the switch, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that I was right.    </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and had to try my new purchase, I removed it from the recharger and pressed the chrome button...with a nice little hum the new shaver came to life.  </li>
            <li>Guys if you need a new shaver do not even hesitate to pick this Panasonic up!</li>
            <li>if you need a new shaver do not even hesitate to pick this Panasonic up!er years of using a straight edge...</li>
            <li>Works very well when new.</li>
            <li>About an hour later the razor is clean like new, and charged.  </li>
            <li>So while a head shaving guy like me will need to replace the blades once every 4 months or so, a face shaver should be able to get away with replacing the blades once a year or less.    </li>
            <li>From previous purchases, Panasonic does not honor most rebates so you have been duly advised.    </li>
            <li>Using it 5 times a week in the shower for 3+ minutes at a time  I am able to get about a week and a half out of one charge.</li>
            <li>I have used my Panasonic for over a month now and like it better than all of my previous electric razors.</li>
            <li>While it comes with the holder that will charge, clean, and dry the shaver, you actually have a lot of choices about how you clean it after using it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, on a couple of short vacations, the charge has been more than adequate for wet shaving and rinsing the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my shaving habits were less strenuous and I was able to put up with the neck and face irritation I got by reducing shaving or growing a beard for months on end.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to hold on to, even when it is wet.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different razors over the last 30 years, and this tops them all.  </li>
            <li>but if I were to buy another one I would save a few bucks and go without the cleaning station as it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything better than the soap and water trick that they suggest in the manual.</li>
            <li>I read some better reviews of the Panasonic than the more expensive Braun and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, the ES8249S has so far proven to be a different breed of electric.</li>
            <li>In only two shaves it is has already shown tremendous improvement over the norelco</li>
            <li>It produces a decent shave in about 4 minutes for me.  </li>
            <li>Super silent, and self cleaning and charge holds for what seems like forever.  </li>
            <li>- Cleaning system seems better, no big fluid cartridges, uses tap water and powder.  </li>
            <li>Though it takes close to a month for the shaver to get used to your face and give a decent shave, and that has improved, I am lowering my rating from 3 stars to 2.</li>
            <li>I have not used the cleaning station yet because a quick rinse is enough.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend getting them with Subscribe &amp; Save here, though unfortunately Amazon doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;once every four month\\&quot; option which would be perfect.    </li>
            <li>After some initial confusion completely related to the ineptitude of the USPS, I received my shaver and am completely satisfied with the vendor and product.</li>
            <li>I had an older, cheaper panasonic</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone looking for a decent neck shave though.  </li>
            <li>This has happened to me too many times and has finally driven me back to Norelco which I used for years before the two Panasonic.</li>
            <li>If you like the way an older model worked, you should like this model too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Often you have to go over the same spot many times and from different directions.</li>
            <li>and after so much rashing and sensitive shaving (that hurt!)</li>
            <li>and I loved it - it was small, gave a very close shave, was waterproof, and only cost me about $35.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;d endure from the first shave from a new blade on my old \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Panasonic&#x27;s Arc IV 4-blade shavers.  </li>
            <li>Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] which I reviewed and gave high marks to.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend that bald guys give this electric a try.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Then I tried a Phillips mid-level rotary since my brother in law thinks highly of them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You can shave in or out of the shower (highly convenient) with this</li>
            <li>I would never pay this high of a price ( $133.00 ) for an electri razor again or get the cleaning unit.&lt;br /&gt;other</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand and model.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The high speed 4 blade system gives a close shave.</li>
            <li>Got a smokin deal on the high quality shaver.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li>With the initial cost of the unit, the price for the replacement cutting head/foil, and the always-evaporating cleaner solution I really wasn&#x27;t sold on this being any cheaper or better than a good shaving cream and Gillette.     </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product, and it was $92 and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Panasonic ES8249S Arc IV Wet/Dry shaver is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t shaved twice in a day since high school.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone who likes to get a 90% close shave in 20% of the time without having to worry about water or shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic shaver head is very large and covers a lot of face, which likely accounts for much of the speed.</li>
            <li>I have heard complaints about how long it takes to clean and how noisy it is.</li>
            <li>The braun was a pain in the ass thatin that it decided when and for how long it would clean.  </li>
            <li>feature I find most useful is the ability to use it wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>Now, after about a year and one new cartridge and one new blade set I&#x27;m ready to toss this into the landfill.</li>
            <li>-Cleans very easily with water and handsoap, takes 3 minutes and can be air dried in the docking station!</li>
            <li>The razor works ok after a little over a month, no complaints regarding that.</li>
            <li>All I can say is, WOW!!</li>
            <li>used this razor for a little more than a year.</li>
            <li>The price point was a little better once I look around.  </li>
            <li>I opted for the most bang for my buck and a model that was wet dry, you can actually use shaving cream with this model, which helps to nearly eliminate the break in irritation of most razors.  </li>
            <li>Cut decently, though never great, and never did that good of a job under the chin.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent razor, it delivers an OK shave but has trouble on the neck.  </li>
            <li>Rarely am I disapointed with a highly customer rated amazon product, but this one fell short for me.  </li>
            <li>It takes over an hour to clean and dry.</li>
            <li>It also provides a very close shave and is completely self cleaning.  </li>
            <li>but I was surprised to feel a much closer shave than I&#x27;d remember getting from the Norelco.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t shave every day with those either, too much irritation to my sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>However, it takes me 8 to 10 minutes to get a reasonable shave versus 4 to 5 minutes with my old Braun( Model Pulsonic 9595)    </li>
            <li>Much, much, much faster than my old Norelco foil shaver I got when I turned 16.  </li>
            <li>It takes about 1-1.5 hr to clean dry and charge the shaver.  </li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin on my neck and it doesnt sem to irriatate it too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a few electric razors, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for nearly two months now, and I really don&#x27;t have much to complain about so far.    </li>
            <li>This is frustrating as the shaver performs beautifully but does not last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the same shaver, just has no cleaning system.</li>
            <li>You are better off cleaning in tap everyday using turbo mode and do the 1 hour cleaning once a week.  </li>
            <li>Overall for the price of $90 I paid, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I had seen a few reviews stating something along the lines of: if you like braun, you&#x27;ll love panasonic.</li>
            <li>since i&#x27;ve only had it a month, but this product is well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>If I skip shaving all weekend, Monday morning I spend about 30 to 60 seconds longer (according to the timer) than my normal three-minute shave.  </li>
            <li>The price at Amazon was only about $105, which I figure would be about a years worth of manual shaving supplies.</li>
            <li>It is so powerful that it literally makes facial hair disappear as if it is being &#x27;erased&#x27; from your face as you shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wet/dry razor, so I took it in the shower like I normally do with the blade.</li>
            <li>The last thing I hated about my Braun is the time it took to shave: 5-7 minutes for a good shave, 7-10 for a great shave.</li>
            <li>Normally, I believe its priced $130 which I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy at that price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is normal for hair trimming to fall on your clothes / body if you are shaving.</li>
            <li>I did however purchase another shaver that, though not quite as good as the panasonic, does have a company that stands behind their product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been getting closer to 40-45 days out of each one, and that&#x27;s with a clean after every single shave.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been getting closer to 40-45 days out of each one, and that&#x27;s with a clean after every single shave.  </li>
            <li>It also goes weeks on a single charge and the docking station that clean</li>
            <li>I got lucky because I was looking to replace my old Norelco (which constantly irritates my skin) at the time and had seen this up on amazon&#x27;s gold box deal of the day.</li>
            <li>Even the dry shave was better than my standard razor.  </li>
            <li>This gives my a nice close shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li>This shaver will only cut hairs growing in the right direction.  </li>
            <li>The on button seems to me to be too big and the ergonomics put it right</li>
            <li>Plus the next few shaves got even better!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver for my husband, who has fast growing &amp; coarse facial hair, but likes to always be clean shaven.  </li>
            <li>Nice to see how long I shave for since it counts the minutes, so I can get a feel for how long I can run and how much juice it actually uses.  </li>

            <li>I also have sensitive skin and the &#x27;soft&#x27; setting really prevents the skin irritation that I normally have after shaving.</li>
            <li>This one had no problems with the length, and whether I was going \\&quot;with the grain\\&quot; or against it, it got things smooth faster and easier than any other electric</li>
            <li>This one had no problems with the length, and whether I was going \\&quot;with the grain\\&quot; or against it, it got things smooth faster and easier than any other electric</li>
            <li>but not least, for the ladies, I read a few reviews of women using this shaver for themselves so encouraged my wife to try it since I&#x27;ve been so pleased with my results so far.</li>
            <li>, my shaves were taking 10 minutes instead of the 8 minutes I got when the shaver was new.    </li>
            <li>However the cost of the new blades does not justify the quality of shave - they just don&#x27;t cut-it anymore.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it was time he got a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Obsessive with the Braun took 12 to 15 minutes, even with new blades.</li>
            <li>I changed from a Norelco elctric because I was not getting the shave I used to get, even with new blades.  </li>
            <li>I decided I needed a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>It was time for a new one...</li>
            <li>My new Panasonic:    </li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t buy the new ES-LA63-S model)  4.</li>
            <li>I needed a new shaver</li>
            <li>Ordered it New Years eve and received in Jan 4.  </li>
            <li>I also avoid immersing the new razor to keep the insides</li>
            <li>I just received my new piece of technology this year for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I could not be happier and want to urge all of you out there looking for a new shave.  </li>
            <li>The HydraClean system works well and keeps the shaver looking brand new.</li>
            <li>I was determined to find one that was CLOSE to the quality of a new razor shave.  </li>
            <li>and I would chop my face up with whatever new 3,4, or 5 blade metal razor was out at the time.  </li>
            <li>will give away my braun with the new foil!!&lt;br /&gt;A++++ seller&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use a brand new one because it would still wear into my skin.</li>
            <li>The shave was quick and smoother than with any other razor I have ever had thanks to the rpm of the motor.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning solution is hard to find, but if you order it from Amazon or Walmart, it is cheap and worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>and I have almost no qualms with it, aside from not working quite as fast on a lower battery, but the charger that plugs into the wall makes a very, very high pitched squeal if it&#x27;s plugged into the wall which forces me to only have it plugged in when I&#x27;m charging or cleaning the thing.</li>
            <li>The Panasonics always seemed to get great reviews where the others (other than the obvious fan boys who have obviously never tried anything else) were mixed.  </li>
            <li>And the interesting thing about it was that my face didn&#x27;t feel all raw,</li>
            <li>This razor easily out performs any of my previous razors when they were new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the military and have to be clean shaven all the time.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that the cleaning system cartridges are only available online.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system is of no much use, but just several dollars more than 8243.   </li>
            <li>Good for cutting the easy open areas.  </li>
            <li>The old razor was missing so many hairs on my neck</li>
            <li>The display is very clear, just no complaints at all.     </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s got very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This one was rated high for sensitive skin and for the wet/dry capability.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely very surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin around my neck...</li>
            <li>It is very loud during the process.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found every electric shaver I&#x27;ve liked ever trying them on and off of a long time, some where more expensive than this one, but I&#x27;ve never found one that performed nearly as well a bladed safety razor in closeness and Comfort.</li>
            <li>i can now shave everyday if i wish and feel as clean as a using a blade!</li>
            <li>Always a tradeoff between pressing harder, removing (most) hairs and getting redness/ bumps OR going over lightly leaving many hairs behind and looking like a dork...     Panasonic, back to the drawing board - and please stop sponsoring reviews, it will come back to haunt you.</li>
            <li>It has a self-cleaning that is easy to use, and the blades last a long time.</li>
            <li>I still believe that Panasonic wet/dry electric shavers are the best solution for me, I am somewhat disappointed in the quality and warranty for the price we have</li>
            <li>I still believe that Panasonic wet/dry electric shavers are the best solution for me, I am somewhat disappointed in the quality and warranty for the price we have to pay.</li>
            <li>*Update 04/03/2010: I had to update my original review due to the blades already needing to be replaced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other high-med end razors (mostly tripleheads) that don&#x27;t perform.  </li>
            <li>I do have to go over the neck and under my jaw a second time, but everything else is taken care on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Noise-wise, it&#x27;s about the same loundess as the Braun, but at a higher pitch.  </li>
            <li>previous shavers, I&#x27;ve received decent shaves but if I wanted a really smooth shave, I&#x27;d have to grab the old razor and gel.</li>
            <li>I do not like to shave, and generally don&#x27;t shave on my days off unless I absolutely have to.</li>
            <li>Cleaning station is kinda pointless since you can use hand soap which in my opinion does a better job.</li>
            <li>Amazon had this one for not much more, and after research it seemed like a better buy for me.  </li>
            <li>Well, first of all, I can say that I&#x27;ve tried several different versions of Norelco up to the Quattro, and I even payed $180 for the first Braun with a cleaning station (though I can&#x27;t even remember what it was called at this point.)  </li>
            <li>Over the past 20 years I&#x27;ve always used top of the line Braun shavers.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of this type of shaver because the first one got stepped on by mistake.  </li>
            <li>This model is pretty quiet, compared to the cheaper razors I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li>In conclusion, buy it if it is cheap or on sale, don&#x27;t buy it if it&#x27;s over $100 because it&#x27;s just not worth it at that price.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is LOUD!  </li>
            <li>The battery lasted fine, but after two years, I think the battery lasts less time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it for the first time, I was simply AMAZED.</li>
            <li>So finding the sweet spot on the shaver alone was rough.</li>
            <li>, wet is awesome {use a very thin gel, water it down &amp; use a light coating).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I can shave with it dry very quickly, or if I use my shaving lotion and take a couple extra minutes, I can shave my beard just about as close as blades can.  </li>
            <li>Though it doesn&#x27;t appear necessary to clean daily.      </li>
            <li>I did this dance for about 6 months (with razor shaving mixed in to clean up as necessary)</li>
            <li>Even though I was switching from a different kind of electric shaver the first few shaves were less than stellar.  </li>
            <li>As I tend to do with Amazon, I lurked around until the price went down to something I was comfortable with</li>
            <li>I also had tried many other electric shavers over the years, with little success.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that takes a little getting used to is that the blades move so fast that they produce a really high pitched buzzing sound, but it&#x27;s not loud, you get used to it quickly, and I might just have really sensitive hearing.  </li>
            <li>I am a user of the old Atra 2 plus as i have never been satisifed with the new technology blade shavers.  </li>
            <li>Shaver is like new now, but still won&#x27;t shave the neck areas properly and takes pretty much the same time (around 6-7 minutes for a close shave</li>
            <li>That is because if you save it up until the end of the week, it still has 7 days of dirty to clean so you might as well let it clean everyday so you can enjoy a clean shave every day.</li>
            <li>I now enjoy the fact that I can shave twice a day if I want without worrying that my skin will be irritated, previously I&#x27;d to make one day break between each shave    </li>
            <li>I will continue to use in the shower but will try to only get the shaving head wet vs. holding the whole thing under the shower to clean.</li>
            <li>Using it wet leaves the skin feeling cool and soft.</li>
            <li>While I had tried a variety of electric shavers in the past, they all had some kind of downside: the shave wasn&#x27;t close enough, they were hard to clean, got too hot, or whatever.</li>
            <li>so I guess it isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not cleaning the way it is supposed to at such a long replacement</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of work to get my neck shaved, but that is true of manual razors as well as any other electric shaver I used.</li>
            <li>The wet dry and the cleaning features are outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Love the flexibility of choice of wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>B004UQ6Q62 Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]] which has been phenomenal.</li>
            <li>the cleaning system is a bit noisy, and the trimmer only adequate but overall 5-stars for this one.</li>
            <li>Not only does it shave quick and close, but it does this quietly.  </li>
            <li>Prior to biting the bullet and making this decision I was a loyal Remington Shaver customer/user but the advances Panasonic have made in the mens shaver arena in the recent years made this decision a no-brainer.</li>
            <li>As I aged and my skin lost its suppleness, Norelco&#x27;s shavers became increasingly  less effective.</li>
            <li>The same item is at least $100 more in the UK!    </li>
            <li>The cleaning/drying/charging component has worked extremely well----it&#x27;s pretty much, &amp;#34;Set</li>
            <li>Also, the huge head makes certain areas hard to shave.</li>
            <li>After that I went the smart route and started reading reviews about different shavers on the web.</li>
            <li>It is a significant improvement over my previous Panasonic 3-blade model.</li>
            <li>It sounds like a combination between a dental drill (it has a very high speed motor) and a bug zapper (you can hear the individual hairs being cut).</li>
            <li>The whole HydraClean system has this cheap, gimmicky feel to it - a total contrast to the actual device, which looks very high class/premium.    </li>
            <li>you will see huge discount every few month on this item , and by the way , the machine is 100% Japan.</li>
            <li>Update on 8/12/10: I&#x27;ve been using the ES8249S for about 3.5 months and so far it&#x27;s been rock solid, a real winner.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one or two less chances that I&#x27;ll drop it while getting it clean under the tap.</li>
            <li>When I disposed of my old razor, I was obliged to extract the Lithium battery for proper disposal and I was amazed at how much gunk had accumulated inside the razor over the years.  </li>
            <li>Vortex keeps the blades clean and less smell.</li>
            <li>Too loud,hurts my ears when I shave near them.</li>
            <li>and it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as my old 3 head shaver.</li>
            <li>but I have yet to do so and it has been 14 months so far</li>
            <li>, just can&#x27;t get a complete shave.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband who was very adimit that electric razors didn&#x27;t give a close enough shave.</li>
            <li>The shaver starting making so much noise that it hurt the ear</li>
            <li>Wow, this was it.  </li>
            <li>It is much faster, quieter, does not miss hairs and provides a shave that is equal to a manual razor.</li>
            <li>B000NPBQB4 King of Shaves For Men Kinexium Shaving Oil, Sensitive Skin .68 fl oz]]</li>
            <li>So blade shaving with my sensitive skin was a 2 or sometimes 3 day per week deal, there was no way I could shave every day.</li>
            <li>Panasonic figures an estimated three minutes per shave, but I seldom get near two minutes.  </li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the foil rapidly deteriorating as some have reported, but I&#x27;ll probably update this review after I use the shaver for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>I opened up the unit to find that the battery was not replaceable since it was connected directly to the circuit board.</li>
            <li>Thanks you for making it easier to select my next razor.</li>
            <li>The larger head is a real plus.  </li>
            <li>If you just need to charge it, then you can do that, but the cord to the charger also fits the shaver directly for charging so you have options.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably just use the old one as my travel</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve dropped it and I shave with it in my car,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shaved with it about 8 times now (every time with Aveeno Sensitive Skin gel) in the shower</li>
            <li>Of all the shavers that I have had, this one beats the others by far.</li>
            <li>The flexible head allows you to get a close shave anywhere on your face, and if you prefer to shave with a stationary shaver, just flip the pivot action button.  </li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>However, the shipping, the return and refund were completely hassle-free.  </li>
            <li>I feel the need to unplug it when it isn&#x27;t in use because you can hear the buzzing from the light flashing on the front every few seconds.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver after my old Braun was not doing the job anymore.</li>
            <li>(so far).</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor for anyone looking to move away from manual blades with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive</li>
            <li>My husband completely loves this razor.  </li>
            <li>The old Remington advertised shaving as close as a blade, but it never came close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had zero issues with razor burn or hair bumps afterward, unlike the old Remington.</li>
            <li>I am replacing a Braun shaver that is nearly 10 years old.</li>
            <li>This is near unacceptable for a $170 shave system that you&#x27;re supposed to leave set up in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>For a year the screen would show how much power is left before needing a charge and it would let me know when I should use the turbo mode and rinse the head off (which I do every day anyway).  </li>
            <li>So far I like the shaver.</li>
            <li>My old Braun:    </li>
            <li>-loud  </li>
            <li>To counter that, i found the shave on my neck wasn&#x27;t quite as close as it was with my old braun.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old one (Braun 7526) and was amazed by the difference.</li>
            <li>Far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>&quot; Then they direct me to their parts site.</li>
            <li>really seems like I got a defective foil if it is supposed to last a year</li>
            <li>The noise it emits is a bit loud</li>
            <li>It seems gentle enough on the skin, although I&#x27;m still adjusting to it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t just let my mustache grow wild and spread out across my face.  </li>
            <li>Also like the option of having the head either fixed or floatng (\\&quot;soft\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give nearly as close a shave as the razor which probably accounts for the reduced irritation</li>
            <li>I didnt even really need the traditional - give it a month</li>
            <li>In fact its so close a shave Id recommend a soothing gel for those with sensitive skin.     </li>
            <li>This shaver completely blows the Brauns out of the water.</li>
            <li>I got This Machine after reading the reviews on it, I was looking for a solution to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna eat you alive</li>
            <li>But it takes nearly 5 minutes to do a complete shave, and it cannot shave as close as a blade.</li>
            <li>Since I found a terrific price for the whole unit ($114)</li>
            <li>did so much research online prior to buying this.  </li>
            <li>WOW is all I can say, the technology has come so far since that floating head Norelco that they STILL sell.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the closet shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The cleaner is similarly loud and runs for well over an hour when cleaning your razor</li>
            <li>He used to break out with his old razor and doesn&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li>WOW, my old Remington needed a charge every three days.</li>
            <li>completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 6 years using the same machine , decided to buy anew one in stead of replacing some parts, since it doesn&#x27;t ads up, so pay for anew one when you can ,thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>I did as much research as possible before I made the decision to purchase an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It cleans the shaver very well, but I usually only do it on the weekend</li>
            <li>However, when shaving chin &amp; goatee hair that&#x27;s longer than about 1 mm, you frequently feel the pain of hair being ripped off.</li>
            <li>Initially it worked very well</li>
            <li>I returned it for repair and they required me to ship the whole package back and charged a $46 fee.  </li>
            <li>This razor is loud.  </li>
            <li>probably because the old one was out of production now.</li>
            <li>would have had to send whole unit back for warranty.  </li>
            <li>What not recommend it because of having to send whole unit back.</li>
            <li>I have been using for 45 days, my beard grows back much quicker mid-day</li>
            <li>I still prefer a blade -- but this is a very close second.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IF, however, you&#x27;re like me and have extremely sensitive skin, this shaver has been a blessing.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how sensitive my skin is.</li>
            <li>That Sunday I got aggressive and shaved early in the morning and</li>
            <li>People at work noticed the difference because I&#x27;d be smooth and red one day, then fuzzy and red the next with my old bladed shaver.</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised I&#x27;ve had this for five years</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised I&#x27;ve had this for five years</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my uncle because he has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I always run it over soaped up skin and rinse it frequently during use...</li>
            <li>display is nice, having numbers rather than my old one just using a couple green LED lights and a yellow one when it got low.  </li>
            <li>display is nice, having numbers rather than my old one just using a couple green LED lights and a yellow one when it got low.  </li>
            <li>Waded through a lot of extra words in the instruction book to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing anything.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say I have some good growth going when it&#x27;s time to go to work again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m willing to give Panasonic another try, but am hoping to find something a little less high-tech and hopefully more reliable.</li>
            <li>Although I have only used my new Panasonic 3 times thus far, to this point it is much better than my past Brauns, giving me a quicker shave, and a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>My beard orientation is going somehow from left to right especially on the neck.</li>
            <li>I compared this against the other Panasonic shavers, and the 8249 gave the best bang for the buck (a couple extra bells and whistles, without getting off-the-charts expensive).  </li>
            <li>I could easily unplug the stand, but I&#x27;d rather keep it plugged in so that I know that it is fully charged every morning (even though it only takes me 2 minutes to shave, so I never run down the battery).  </li>
            <li>I have found that customer feedback has been EXTREMELY accurate time and time again, and it is my duty to finally review this and other items for others.  </li>
            <li>First, he noticed the blades feel hotter when using it in the shower than when he uses it dry.</li>
            <li>I had owned a Braun 8595 Activator for the past 7 years and this Panasonic easily surpasses it on all areas.    </li>
            <li>I purchased this from another retailer due to free shaving mirror included in that purchase (same price).  </li>
            <li>I typically rinse the head in the sink and then run it through a full cleaning cycle once a week</li>
            <li>hoping I get a new one that actually does work, or live with it in a semi-broken state</li>
            <li>It cleans out all of the little hairs in the razor and leaves it smelling... clean.  </li>
            <li>I think it is the fast motor which makes it a little more audible that the my previous shavers but not too loud.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement shaver for my older Panasonic one which I purchased in 2007, but developed a short in the cleaning cradle after 5 years.  </li>
            <li>To make it quick I am knocking this down a point for the cleaning system.</li>
            <li>Second time, not near as smooth, ended up using a regular razor to finish up the shave.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave very well and the products for clean are expensive and the second thing is that gets hot so fast</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive neck with problems shaving around my adam&#x27;s apple even with newer disposable razors or cartridge razors, and after my last infection my doctor told me that I would either have to blow dry my razors clean to reuse them or only use them once.  </li>
            <li>For the money at the special price I bought at , a little over 100 bucks</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste time or money on the hydro cleaner, just use liquid soap and water to clean.</li>
            <li>I switched to a Remington MS680CS for the past year and it was fine.</li>
            <li>I subsequently have to shave on my first day back on duty with a blade razor, as no electric is going to tackle 1/4 inch of course growth.</li>
            <li>I subsequently shave with a Gillette Mach 3 Turbo on the first day back on duty.</li>
            <li>A quick close shave with none of the burn associated with typical electric razors .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve invested some extra money into decent pre and after-shaves.  </li>
            <li>provides a decent shave for daily usage.  </li>
            <li>your significant other would notice if the door is open.  </li>
            <li>What I ended up with were piles of plastic junk in my shower, because the razors don&#x27;t give a good quality shave after only a few uses; plus, I have a really sensitive face and no matter how slowly or carefully I shaved, I would ALWAYS cut or nick my face, then later would have ingrown hairs or something.</li>
            <li>Ok, if you can shave dry with a month old rusty Bic disposable razor, this shaver is still probably for you, but don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to try this one, mainly because it was an amazon daily deal for $88 (can&#x27;t beat that)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was well packaged, easy to set up and charge (I love that it can be charged in the base or just with the cable), and I was ready to give it</li>
            <li>and wow... major difference...</li>
            <li>a high end Norelco that is a close second.</li>
            <li>I had gone from using whatever electrics my dad had during high school to using a blade to using a Braun Activator for the last 4 years.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor or the blue panasonic razor!  </li>
            <li>overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>matter how good the shave, no one wants to replace such an expensive item after only 15 months.</li>
            <li>I decided last Friday after my boss jokingly said \\&quot;wow your letting your beard come in huh\\&quot; that it was time to try something new.  </li>
            <li>I had anticipated it to be at least as good as my previous shavers</li>
            <li>unlike the Brawn that near required ear plugs so your ears wouldn&#x27;t be subjected to noise approaching that of a jet engine while trying to shave the side of your face, the buzz is low and very tolerable.  </li>
            <li>Second, I find the higher-pitched whine of the Panasonic is much easier on my ears than the lower buzz of the Braun  Third and unexpected: when I was using the Braun my beard stank.  </li>
            <li>My first electric shaver but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>The only downfall is that it woke up my wife because the cleaning cycle is pretty loud, but as long as I set it for after she leaves there is no problem.  </li>
            <li>I used to suffer from skin irritations and normally if I shave and find only one or two spot with blood</li>
            <li>I normally shave my head in the warmer months, and that will be my next venture with this razor.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a nicer travel bag than its lower model the 8109, but that to be expected given the higher price point.</li>
            <li>charging base works much better, is more programmable, and does not waste cleaner  </li>
            <li>The shaver provides an adequately close shave, with little effort.</li>
            <li>and I think this product gives me a smooth face and it only takes up a little bit of space.</li>
            <li>These types of products are tough to consider as we each have our own facial issues and desires.  </li>
            <li>This one is even better than all the previous ones, including Braun, Philips, and other Panasonic models.</li>
            <li>It is better than almost all other shavers I have previously owned.  </li>
            <li>at the end of day you have a lot more stubble coming back where as the panasonic still hardly anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and didn&#x27;t know if I needed the new features or the big difference between the $50 and $300 shaver.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping that I won&#x27;t have a similar issue with the new foil, but I will keep you updated.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that I won&#x27;t have a similar issue with the new foil, but I will keep you updated.</li>
            <li>I have been using this new shaver for several weeks now.  </li>
            <li>The Braun refills are around 10-12 dollars locally where I live.  </li>
            <li>That way I would get a new years supply ordered next year.  </li>
            <li>After about 3 months I received a brand new one of the current model.  </li>
            <li>Gives a clean shave wet or dry with no problems.</li>
            <li>This is a great product however when cutting neck hair it doesn&#x27;t seem to get close enough to hit everything.</li>
            <li>It shaves closest when used with shaving cream (or soap or gel or what-have-you), but it does shave very close and comfortably dry as well.  </li>
            <li>One blade has a wider opening to handle my coarse African American graying beard hairs, two regular blades handle the bulk of the shave, while a fourth finishing blade leaves your face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d estimate that it is probably better to replace the blades on the order of 6 to 8 months of daily shaving (at least for me).   </li>
            <li>I owned Norelco shavers up until about 2003, when I decided standing over the sink for a half hour going over and over one spot wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>With ten year old blades the older one still give a closer shave and has a larger trimmer.</li>
            <li>No matter what combination, my dang irritated neck would not be ready for the next shave any sooner than the 3rd day after.</li>
            <li>Actually, my husband likes it so much that we bought his dad one for a birthday present.</li>
            <li>only gripe i have is that it can not get the hair on my neck at all, i&#x27;m stuck using a regular razor for that, but i cant really blame that on the shaver since i&#x27;ve never had an electric that could do my neck</li>
            <li>The LCD communication is a good addition too, although the constant flashing seems a bit exaggerated.</li>
            <li>it was slow and required many strokes over the same area...</li>
            <li>I had always used rotary shavers, but my research suggested that foil shavers were best for people that shave everyday and don&#x27;t let their beard get especially thick.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a low end Remmington for $60 bucks, it was very loud.</li>
            <li>The shave is really close and a single shave for me is around 10% of charge(around 5-6 minutes).  </li>
            <li>Very fast charge and can last for 10 days for me on a single charge.</li>
            <li>Major improvement in coverage and closeness of shave.  </li>
            <li>Also, where my braun took me about 7 minutes to shave because I had to go over areas several times, I have only gone past 5 minutes once with the panasonic and most shaves</li>
            <li>Cuts the hair on my neck like no other.</li>
            <li>NO other electric shaver did the job.</li>
            <li>I tried it the first day dry and the second day with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I can now have a full shave in less than 3 minutes while with the Norelco I had to go over the same area over an over again</li>
            <li>I like the cleaning feature since I am too lazy to clean it otherwise.</li>
            <li>There was a slightly better shave with the wet gel, but only slightly.  </li>
            <li>I have a heavy beard growth and while they were usually OK on the cheeks, they missed a lot of hairs on the neck and other areas.</li>
            <li>cleaning unit is larger overall than my old one, though not as tall - mine was shallower with a tall piece that could be extended up to fit the razor, and then collapsed back down after you were done.  </li>
            <li>I looked at several, but finally settled on the Panasonic ES8248S Arc IV, based on the sheer volume of positive reviews for this shaver.</li>
            <li>One little nitpick I have is that the lights on the razor illuminate roughly once a minute when it is fully charged and in its stand -- this tells you that it is at 100%, but given the nature of my bathroom, it is a little distracting when that bright LED blinks.  </li>
            <li>It was a little pricey, but if it lasts, then it will have been worth it.  </li>
            <li>dry mode is obviously less comfortable</li>
            <li>like I had several small cuts all over, in fact it felt just fine.  </li>
            <li>I have small, fine, blonde hairs on my ears and this thing took all of that off.</li>
            <li>The Charger/Cleaning unit charges quick, doing its job quietly and quicker than any previous model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The told me I could send the unit back to them at my own expense and if they found that the unit was indeed no good, they would replace it with a re-built unit!</li>
            <li>- The head is a little too big to fit in my upper lip region.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at the beginning as I had a Norelco which gave me a lot of irritation but the Panasonic is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>The display on the shaver tells you how much charge is left and how long it was used.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t think it will last as long.  </li>
            <li>Things I like: percentage of battery charge left displayed, can charge in the cleaner (while cleaning) or charge with the cord, wet or dry use, can clean while in the shower.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how long the foil, blades, and cleaning solution last, it may no be much of a savings.</li>
            <li>The cleaning refills are also pretty expensive, and there is no substitute available.</li>
            <li>or you will need to grow a beard before you have it fixed back to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this razor after seeing reviews in which the reviewers said it shaves nearly as close as a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>Even with frequent foil/blade replacements, the shave was only \\&quot;so - so\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about replacing your blades or old shavers, this is definitely the model you want to look into and purchase.</li>
            <li>But, my sensitive skin would turn red when I shaved with a blade.  </li>
            <li>but it appears I can only do so directly from Panasonic,</li>
            <li>wet should be a real</li>
            <li>wet should be a real treat.      </li>
            <li>My last Braun 8000 series shaver, over 7 years old, still works but the cleaning system died.</li>
            <li>Where the product really shines, however, is when used as a wet shaver in the shower.</li>
            <li>, only cleaning is giving me an error), and the manual is completely unclear about what the problem is and how to resolve it.</li>
            <li>The cleaning station works similar to my old braun&#x27;s, and i have no complaints.    </li>
            <li>I used a Braun shaver for about 7 years, and even though I replaced all the vital parts, it never shaved the mustache area properly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unbearably loud, but you can hear it if you&#x27;re in the next room over.</li>
            <li>The self cleaner buzzes loud enough that you should do the self cleaning when you&#x27;re not home.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic cleaning cartridges are supposed to last 30 days whether you use them or not, and I&#x27;ve also read that people that don&#x27;t use them daily can make them last much longer.  </li>
            <li>I had read reviews where people talked about how loud this was, but I find it to be very quiet compared to the Brauns and Norelcos</li>
            <li>when my 5 yr old braun NEVER ripped out my facial hair).    </li>
            <li>On my old rotary head shavers, the only thing you&#x27;d have to replace is the rotary head blades.</li>
            <li>On my old rotary head shavers, the only thing you&#x27;d have to replace is the rotary head blades.</li>
            <li>It is really quiet compared to my old Braun 7000.  </li>
            <li>then my ten year old Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t terribly loud, but you definitely notice it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>After trying five different electric shavers and returning them all I was nearly defeated in my search.  </li>
            <li>The cartridges have to be exchanged frequently, and it&#x27;s not only the money aspect, it&#x27;s the effort/maintenance that&#x27;s required.  </li>
            <li>It worked well, but pinched me too much and gave me cuts (I now know this was because I was using it wet).</li>
            <li>Shave not as close as traditional razor, but not too far off.</li>
            <li>In this facet the Panasonic barely outperforms the Braun.  </li>
            <li>I cannot stress enough how sensitive my face is...</li>
            <li>If it was too old it would do the same thing.</li>
            <li>It cleans easier than washing a wine glass; it shaves as close as a gillette razor blade without the harsh \\&quot;after-feeling\\&quot; and is simply worth every penny of the cost.</li>
            <li>Same drill, slow and requiring many trips over the same area...</li>
            <li>After perusing several sites dedicated to electric razor reviews (and I do mean several), I came up with the conclusion that I might indeed be able to get a close shave with the convenience of an electric.</li>
            <li>Second, his facial hair grows in all different directions and he has more trouble using this flat type to get to all the hairs than he did with the 3-circle shaver.  </li>
            <li>I live in the UK but got this item delivered to a local US address and collected the item later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting for the new unit now (Panasonic won&#x27;t repair personal products, only replacement if under warranty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally I do not use electric razors, they are so slow and leave even worse irritation than blades, but this shaver is fast, shaves close and leaves skin great without any cuts or bumps.  </li>
            <li>It took less than 3 weeks for the whole return process, I sent the old one on Apr 18th and I received a replacement on May 6th.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean in the shower, I did put the cleaner in the base but have yet to use it.</li>
            <li>The charger cleaner was dead in the water right out of the Box.</li>
            <li>Even though all of the reviews highly rated this shaver, and a few highly praised the unit, I never expected the results that I have.  </li>
            <li>He said that the ONLY thing that is difficult is shaving his neck (all the curves are a bit hard to get), but I am sure he will get more used to it in time.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver for guys especially who have different types of facial and neck hair.</li>
            <li>So far all shaves have been done every other day, with the first two being dry.     </li>
            <li>It could be due to the fact that my face is still getting used to the shaver, but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between this shaver and my 20-something-year-old 3-head Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I will not be upgrading  to any other electric shaver I have since picked up straight blade shaving</li>
            <li>I have used a few electric shavers in the past and this is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>By no means does the Panasonic make me want to shave, but the morning &#x27;little tiny hair&#x27; removal drill is now quick and relatively noiseless.    </li>
            <li>Also, this is not a single pass shaver, but I spend 3 minutes between shaving and cleaning shaving, during my shower.    </li>
            <li>purchased a few of these, so far so good, a little bit expensive for me, but worth it.</li>
            <li>If I had to say anything negative about this shaver, It is that their tech support people really don&#x27;t know much about the product.  </li>
            <li>The panasonic is loud and that is the only draw back would say.</li>
            <li>For the last 7 years I&#x27;ve been using a Gillette Mach 3 razor, with regular old shaving gel...</li>
            <li>Makes it larger and deeper, which annoys me as far as cleaning goes, because whereas my last one I could pull out in two sections, the metal foil itself, and then the plastic housing, this all comes as one piece.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the cost for a set of replacement blades and microscreen, which I would consider to be worth much less than 10% of the shaver, actually costs 35% of the total purchase price.  </li>
            <li>This was the last one I would try and I was and still am blown away nearly six months later.    </li>
            <li>My first reaction was to contact customer support and see if they would replace this because it was a little over 2 months</li>
            <li>I have been a long time Norelco user, but recently was dissappointed after trying a new Arcitec model.</li>
            <li>Even with \\&quot;Electric shaver liquid\\&quot; it is better than dry but not good.</li>
            <li>is so smooth and so easy, its sad to think of all the money and time I have wasted over the years on traditional shaving products.  </li>
            <li>I hardly use the cleaner though, only when I need to charge every two to three weeks, the rest of the time I just clean it under water with liquid soap, which works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is supposed to have 4 blades, but there are only 2 apparent.  </li>
            <li>Length of time for complete cleaning and charging cycle is quite long.  </li>
            <li>I was hopeful that a shave like this was possible for me, but i never expected it.</li>
            <li>It does miss a few hairs on the first pass</li>
            <li>It took several days to get the grain of my beard growth down, but after that my shaves&#x27;s are better than any I have had in the past.    </li>
            <li>A couple times in between I tried a few norelcos, but always took them right back as I was irritated and the ingrown hairs were back again.  </li>
            <li>Shortly after buying the second, the first one started blinking oddly and then quit.</li>
            <li>Even does a decent job on the neck which my other electrics never did.</li>
            <li>Probably the only thing I don&#x27;t like about the Arc IV is its pop-up razor, as it feels a little flimsy and easily pops back down while I am using it.</li>
            <li>With a classic shaver I couldn&#x27;t shave the right part of my neck without irritating it.   </li>
            <li>The shave I get when I use it dry is nearly as close as a blade.</li>
            <li>the fan it uses to dry the razor after a cleaning is almost obnoxiously loud.</li>
            <li>I never really liked using an electric, but I&#x27;m a pretty busy stay-at-home dad and there are days I just don&#x27;t have time to shave.  </li>
            <li>Didnt bother me too much until I went back and realized what I paid for this with its fancy cleaning system, yikes, not worth it, dont know what i was thinking.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a shave that is uneven, it leaves small hairs all over your face that it cant seem to shave off, no matter how many times you go over it.</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive about taking advantage of the \\&quot;wet shave\\&quot; feature, but after trying it only twice, I am now a true convert.  </li>
            <li>It is a little narrower than the braun, but works just as well and the large head does not hamper me from using it at all.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the fact that I can use a wet shaving cream, At this point I am not sure of the shave results vs regular blade, however the instructions say to wait 30 days for your beard to adjust.</li>
            <li>it never fails - smells like a dead dog or old wet towel, take your pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I purchased a new cartridge, read the instructions (again) carefully and started the next cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t dread shaving (although I do skip the weekends usually, but this baby picks right up on Sunday when I attack my muzzle...</li>
            <li>It works very well and causes little to no irritation.</li>
            <li>You can really hear all of the little hairs being cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little empathy toward a customer would have been appreciated.</li>
            <li>particularly my neck; it requiring up and down and side-way strokes to eventually rid my neck of hair.    </li>
            <li>The shaver&#x27;s head is large and shaped such that I have some trouble shaving up to my sideburns and under my nose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My first try of the razor was a dry run, I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the wet shave in the shower, if it worked as well as it did dry...</li>
            <li>My first try of the razor was a dry run, I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the wet shave in the shower, if it worked as well as it did dry...</li>
            <li>The charging/cleaning base has given me an error red light twice while cleaning (charging &amp; drying have been fine</li>
            <li>It charges fine from both the base and just direct from the power cord and a charge sees me through a weeks worth of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some good, some bad.  </li>

            <li> Does a very good job.  </li>
            <li> which is very good.    </li>
            <li> Very good shaver.</li>
            <li> Battery life is very good between charges.</li>
            <li> but it still gets incredibly close.</li>
            <li> Got a great deal on this razor for 90 bucks, best investment I ever made!  </li>
            <li> Simply incredible.  </li>
            <li> When you use this with shaving cream it&#x27;s a gret shave - as good as any razor without the nicks and cuts!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good bit faster!</li>
            <li> Literally, I had never had as good or as close of a shave, even with a razor!</li>
            <li> This shaver has been ahuge hit for me, I can now shave my head and face every day without suffering from rash/burn/acne, the quality of the shave is very good, and the convenience of the cleaning system is welcome.    </li>
            <li> The price is incredible given the great job it does.</li>
            <li> After this post, I got a call from Panasonic&#x27;s Rebate vendor company and they have found my paperwork in good order, check&#x27;s in the mail, and to edit my comments to reflect excellent service.</li>
            <li> Depending on the price it becomes a very good buy or a not so good buy.  </li>
            <li> It is self-cleaning which is a great bonus, and it hums instead of growls.  </li>
            <li> Shaves great dispite the inability to adjust the shave depth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this, its a great product and the price is a steal.</li>
            <li> My husband being this happy -</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is great.</li>
            <li> Great shave in 4 minutes that lasts thru the evening vs. 10 minutes on others that get you to 5:00 without the closeness.  </li>
            <li> This is a great electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Great Design?</li>
            <li> The heating/fan mechanism does a great job of drying the razor.  </li>
            <li> This is a great razor.  </li>
            <li> We are happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: A great shavor at a great price.</li>
            <li> I know this one works and does a great job.</li>
            <li> A great item.</li>
            <li> but I am incredibly happy that I stumbled upon it.</li>
            <li> SO FREAKING HAPPY</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> I used the blade in my youth, but the sensitivity of my skin was too great.</li>
            <li> maybe that indicates that it is working.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Now that I have had this for two years I want to say that it still works great.</li>
            <li> I switched to Panasonic this time because of the great deal I got with Amazon.com, and because of the reputation and reliability of Panasonic&#x27;s electronic products.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> ~just buy it as a birthday gift  for my father,he is so happy when receive it</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> when you compare the price this one also does a great job.</li>
            <li> but after finding all the great reviews on these Panasonic ES series razors I decided to pull the trigger on one.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with that and neither was my wife.    </li>
            <li> but i just want anyone who reads this to know what a great product this is.</li>
            <li> When he heard all of the great compliments about the Braun (from hubby), he wanted one too.</li>
            <li> the self cleaning works great.  </li>
            <li> The wet/dry feature is great in case you want to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> So I stumbled upon the Panasonic on amazon with great reviews, so</li>
            <li> The 8109 got particularly great reviews</li>
            <li> I get a great shave and the product is quality throughout.</li>
            <li> I also shave my head and the shaver does a great job on it as well.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Great price.  </li>
            <li> Great shipping time and processing.</li>
            <li> Closest to a blade I have ever experienced in an electric razor and</li>
            <li> The charging/cleaning system does a great job cleaning and DRYING the razor head.  </li>
            <li> All told, I&#x27;ve never been as happy with a razor as I am with this one.</li>
            <li> It also does a great job on my head which i like to shave periodically.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> then that&#x27;s a great day  </li>
            <li> and I was quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great price for a really great shaver.</li>
            <li> it is great.  </li>

            <li> I have another Panasonic trimmer which also does a great job.</li>
            <li> I think Panasonic makes a great quality shavers &amp; trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product works great.</li>
            <li> and I am getting as close a shave as I experienced with blades</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over four years and it still works great.</li>
            <li> AND HE SEEMS HAPPY WITH IT.  </li>
            <li> this &#x3D; win.    </li>
            <li> - Pop up trimmer not so great.  </li>
            <li> but after seeing what a great job it did there I&#x27;ve started using it on my face too.  </li>
            <li> Summary of pros:  Shaves great on a greasy or sweaty face.  </li>

            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> This electric razor gives a great close shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li> and this did a great job of doing so.  </li>
            <li> I always use it with shaving gel and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ved owned this for 2+ years and still works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Charged up the Panasonic ES8249 which is a very nice size and feels great in the hand.</li>
            <li> I measured the sound at 92db!!!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a very nice shave.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic is very nicely made.  </li>
            <li> A very very nice shaver</li>
            <li> This is very nice for travel.  </li>
            <li> Best razor I have owned and look forward to many years of great shaving with it.</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> I like to thank Amazon; Amazon has the excellent price (drop price for one day) along with top notch customer service.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t Panasonic just make something that&#x27;s going to be the best for more than two years?    </li>
            <li> Loving it!</li>
            <li> But the price was excellent and I ordered and I am glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> top it off, the cleaning station is a very welcome addition.  </li>
            <li> To top it off, the cleaning station is a very welcome addition.  </li>
            <li> It is a remarkable razor.  </li>
            <li> After using it for more than a month now I have to say say that this shaver is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I can do a good job in about 3.5 minutes with the Panasonic and a great job in about 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> and Im sure it works awesome,</li>
            <li> Shaving the sideburns and the jawline is a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> It is easily the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is an excellent razor, and I&#x27;d easily suggest this to my friends.</li>
            <li> This one was a very suitable replacement in all regards.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it and look forward to many more years of close shaves!</li>
            <li> Blades still do a better job around the neck, but this Panasonic does a very good job.  </li>
            <li> Good luck to all on the never ending search for the perfect (and therefore comfortable) shave.</li>
            <li> This razor works perfectly, and is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li> After reading good reviews on this razor</li>
            <li> Battery is good; day after day shaving (every time around 5 minutes) need to charge every 10 days.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for christmas to replace my Mach 3 manual shaver as this product has received good reviews.</li>
            <li> Had Norelco&#x27;s over the years, but they did not give a good shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it and look forward to many more years of close shaves!does a great job.</li>
            <li> and the percent charged is a nice feature to have when you gotta fly out</li>
            <li> In fact this razor is so good</li>
            <li> But, as I said, it&#x27;s just as good as a Gillette Fusion or Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always use the cleaning system, but when I do it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Bought an ES8239 - and it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> The charger, modes, cleaning, sound, and grip are totally excellent.</li>
            <li> If you just want an inexpensive shaver that is really good - get Panasonic ES8243A for $80.  </li>
            <li> and I am delighted with it.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is a good name.</li>
            <li> and you get a good, QUALITY shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so good that I recommended it to my father...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the cheapest, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good shave, this is the one I would suggest.</li>
            <li> Shaver is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my dads braun 8995 for 4 years this is not as good as it is.</li>
            <li> After some research I found the 8249 to be a good balance of price and quality.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good for 12 hours.</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t giving me a good shave and missed alot of hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li> That was Christmas of 09&#x27; and my shaver is still as good as the day i bought it.</li>
            <li> but the price was not as good as the deal I had gotten when I purchased hubby&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> then what good is the product.</li>
            <li> then what good is the product.</li>
            <li> I would say Panasonic 8249 or 8243 shaver is the best cost-performance shaver available in the market.</li>
            <li> Good but not a close shave as razor, I like how you can use it while taking a shower</li>
            <li> Also, on the package for the cleaning cartridge, it says that the detergent will stay good for 6 months after opening</li>
            <li> Nothing beats a blade, no matter how good anyone claims it is.  </li>
            <li> Four years ago I picked up the Panasonic ES8077S system, and I&#x27;ve loved it.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d have a good test when I got it.  </li>
            <li> I have a good 5 o&#x27;clock shadow every day and often, I let my face grow for two maybe three days before I shave.</li>
            <li> surprisingly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They did a good job</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t shave good,</li>
            <li> so I take that as a sign of the good work that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No hassle, just drop it off at the end end of the week and your good</li>
            <li> ; if this model is this good, is the five blade model even better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I looked through the reviews to find what might fit me best.    </li>
            <li> I get a wonderfully close and smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do a good job of manually cleaning/washing my shaver</li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li> It did do a good job, but not as good as a razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as a blade, but almost so</li>
            <li> I would recommend this shaver, it is a good unit for the money.</li>
            <li> The reviews on the Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers were good, so I thought I would give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with the ES-LA93 model.</li>
            <li> and you are good to go).  </li>
            <li> The battery life is good</li>
            <li> it shaves good and doesnt leave me with any irratation.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job without pulling but does not get a close shave everywhere.</li>
            <li> in all a good purchase, and i would not hesitate to purchase another.</li>
            <li> The cleaning kit is awesome, you just shave and put it in the cleaning kit; it&#x27;ll clean &amp; charge it for you.    </li>
            <li> and so I went back to manual shaving with the best of the best in a manual shave:</li>
            <li> Quick review, this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> He loves the good shave that he gets with it, and he loves the self-cleaning even more!</li>
            <li> It has the great advantage that I can use it in the shower, it feels very comfortable in my hand, and cleaning is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver; smooth shave</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Panasonic ES8249S Arc IV Nanotech Vortex razor.</li>
            <li> Having used a rechargable Remmington for years was reluctant to take a chance, I am very pleased that I did.  </li>
            <li> so I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> It does not miss very many hairs, and it takes me about 3-4 minutes to shave thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased by the shave and performance.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my decision to change to Panasonic.</li>
            <li> He has told me he loves this product, and is very satisfied with the closeness of shave.</li>
            <li> I bought the ES 8249 over 2 years ago &amp; have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> ;  I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great update for the guy who has everything :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this razor.  </li>
            <li> After a month of use, I am very pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase and the shaver&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with how close the shave is.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Also, he is very pleased with how close of a shave he gets from this razor.</li>
            <li> On the plus side this shaver is very safe.    </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.the shower and cleaned before I use it because it has replaced her Venus bladed shaver.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I also got the best price right here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I love it!    </li>
            <li> Phenomenal!</li>
            <li> The shaver is outstanding!</li>
            <li> They say it takes a while for your face to adjust but my first shave was the best shave I have had in years.</li>
            <li> And I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> This is my first Panasonic and it&#x27;s the best of the 3 shavers.  </li>
            <li> My husband has had many razors over the years, but this one was a hit!</li>
            <li> NOT ANY MORE!  </li>
            <li> But my point is that I LOVE this razor!</li>
            <li> in my opinion, this shaver gives a shave that is BETTER THAN A BLADE!</li>
            <li> It works well after my face adjusted to the razor and it works even better in the shower!</li>
            <li> is still going strong and giving great</li>
            <li> It has a great self cleaning module and easily travels.</li>
            <li> In addition, using this with a good ol&#x27; fashioned shaving brush and shaving soap will give a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Certainly even the best made products can be sent out defective.</li>
            <li> With regards to the product, well, it is certainly the best shaver I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is very effective in providing a close shave, and it is easy to use and maintain with the included automatic cleaner.</li>
            <li> In both cases it was amazing.  </li>
            <li> SIMPLY AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> For that money this is an amazing buy.</li>
            <li> It provides an amazing shave that feels amazingly close to as if I had shaved with a razor.  </li>
            <li> the included cleaning station is a huge bonus and does a great job of cleaning the shaver head.</li>
            <li> Its so comfortable to use and works great on my neck region as well.</li>
            <li> and I was given a Braun Series 7 which was amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The speed of the razor is amazing.  </li>
            <li> the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with, it seemed to be taking more time and more passes.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner machine is kind of neat, although I wish there was a way to use it without having to keep buying the soap cartridge.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I really liked the ES88043.  </li>
            <li> Nearly as good as Norelco on my neck and better than Braun on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked that brand though for TV and audio electronics.</li>
            <li> what kind of shaver I was getting when I bought this Arc IV</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.</li>
            <li> It cleans nicely and the cleaning solution lasts between 30-40 days.</li>
            <li> He is so happy with this shaver and constantly says it is the very best he has ever had</li>
            <li> The self-cleaning feature is nice and seems to work well.</li>
            <li> -LCD display is nice to have  </li>
            <li> To be honest,  I was hesitant to buy a Panasonic shaver since I was always under the impression that \\&quot;You gotta get a Norelco or Braun\\&quot; to get a quality shave.  </li>
            <li> And the cleaning capability works great, much better than the more expense system that Braun uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost regretful that I didn&#x27;t step up to the $200 version on Amazon for the 14,000 rpm over the 13,000 rpm for this one, but it was an $87 difference, and I wasn&#x27;t even sure if this kind of razor would work good for me at the time.  </li>
            <li> Nice shaver.  </li>
            <li> So if your considering this as a gift, or you want a razor that holds a charge and honestly works as well as shaving cream and a safety razor,</li>
            <li> But honestly buy it</li>
            <li> You dont HAVE to use it and it make a handy holder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with this shaver.</li>
            <li> the pricing at Amazon is really the best.</li>
            <li> The shave is nice looking.</li>
            <li> I really liked this shaver, until it quit.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver.  </li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s Panasonic, and yes I am 100% happy with mine, the most comfortable shave ever!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled with my choice.</li>
            <li> Nice shave.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a battery charge indicator also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never shaved with an electric razor I liked until now.</li>
            <li> can honestly recommend this shaver whole-heartedly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives a really nice close shave and irritation</li>
            <li> Was very nice and smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast service is very good.</li>
            <li> works very good like it very much</li>
            <li> , this is an awesome razor and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works great and is very easy to maintain and keep clean</li>
            <li> Just decided to try something new and was really impressed with this Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Works great in the shower to the point that my wife can use it on sensitive areas with great results.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great: This is best wet electric shaver I&#x27;ve found.    </li>
            <li> and it does a great job and a quick one too.</li>
            <li> His hair grows quickly, so he does it every morning and looks great.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> We both love it! :)</li>
            <li> For me it works perfectly, even better than a classic shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor i&#x27;ve ever had as far as closeness shaving.</li>
            <li> This thing is excellent so far....</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor so far, but the jury is still out regarding the neck hair shaving.</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best shaver I have ever owned!!</li>
            <li> The price at Amazon was by far the best!</li>
            <li> and I found the foil-type razor to work much better than the rotary, but it was still not as effective as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> Amazon delivered it two days early which is awesome.</li>
            <li> decided to trust all the strangers out there who were extremely pleased with their purchases and buy my own.  </li>
            <li> The unit is really light and feels good in the hands.  </li>
            <li> So far, it has performed flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> The skin feels smooth and the finish is good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still far and away the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Still far and away the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, it&#x27;s smooth and easy to use, but there is a problem with the readout screen.  </li>
            <li> Easily 5 stars!  </li>
            <li> a few days ago, very good price [...], and very good expirience / quality.    </li>
            <li> Otherwise cleans great, smooth &amp; comfortable</li>
            <li> The shave, particularly with a pre-shave oil like \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; is brilliant.</li>
            <li> Norelco was better at getting the hairs on my neck, but Braun seemed better on my face and came with a nice cleaning unit.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is great, and the shaver is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is good if you need it for clean shave.</li>
            <li> This is a very great price, better than many of the razors available at even higher prices.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an electric razor that I can use in the shower, that doesn&#x27;t require any special shaving cream/oil/lotion, and gives a good, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A great electric shaver at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> While I have been pretty happy with results, I just have to add some thoughts.  </li>
            <li> It provided a very smooth and close shave.  </li>
            <li> My face is very smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The shave is also a very comfortable one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic handles it well and provides a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Using it in the shower is like shaving without a blade: very smooth and close.</li>
            <li> Recieved the product as described, Read instructions (nicely set out and easy to follow).</li>
            <li> the automatic cleaner is a nice, easy feature.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I chose the Panasonic, and I have been delighted from the very first shave.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth, close, easy to maintain, and does a really good job.  </li>
            <li> Better around neck and very smooth.</li>
            <li> This is very nice and convenient and makes the razor perform like new and smell nice.</li>
            <li> A very nice touch making the shaver actually feel pleasant going across your face.</li>
            <li> Doing so leaves a kind of rusty smell for the next shave, but the shave is still very good.     </li>
            <li> The shave is top notch and build quality is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but this one does a better job in this area than any I have used before.</li>
            <li> I still love the razor and cleaning/charging unit</li>
            <li> comfortable foil head which is flexible and the self-cleaning charging station makes this just an amazing package.  </li>
            <li> At the same time I went a looking for a replacement of the Arcitec and ran across this razor which had many impressive reviews.   </li>
            <li> and I was blown away by how close it was able to shave.  </li>
            <li> If you have a defective unit better hope it breaks within your 30 day return period</li>
            <li> As stated above, this is a excellent shaver.  </li>
            <li> The auto cleaner is Ok but overkill</li>
            <li> I also think it is a better value.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is truly outstanding.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver for myself for xmas in 2010 and have to say that I absolutely love the thing.</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> Surely the technology has improved.  </li>
            <li> however I decided to try Panasonic one more time.</li>
            <li> This fantastic shaver eliminates that possibility!  </li>
            <li> My hubby is very happy with his Christmas present!  </li>
            <li> but this one is even better.</li>
            <li> but Panasonic is clearly better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d have to say it shaves slightly better than the Norelco did.  </li>
            <li> In a month, perhaps there will be better news.    </li>
            <li> Also, I ran out of Mach 3 blades as well, so I looked for a replacement that would not need the touching</li>
            <li> If you drive a Corvette, expect to pay more for the tires when it&#x27;s time to replace them than those for a Camry.    </li>
            <li> Remington razors have always been my favorite razors until I bought this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Well I will let the detailed reviews stand on their own.  </li>
            <li> and I would have paid more for it.</li>
            <li> After a year of daily usage, I can say this is the best unit I&#x27;ve purchased in the 10+ years of Panasonic wet/dry units.  </li>
            <li> Used Norelco for years, then switched to the latest Braun a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li> The panasonic is the better shave and that&#x27;s what I was paying/looking for.</li>
            <li> I had which was 80 dollars more when I bought it.    </li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews and showing him the top picks, he chose this one.</li>
            <li> He mostly uses that one.</li>
            <li> One more thing to take care of.</li>
            <li> Like with most electrics I had to go over and over it until I got results (except for a Braun I owned years ago).  </li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be just as satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is what I do most days for work, etc.</li>
            <li> I gotta say everything from the packaging to the build quality of the razor are top notch.  </li>
            <li> Now for the 5 star - what a close and smooth shave!</li>
            <li> but I would imagine just how my face feels this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I have had most brands of shavers in my 50 years but never Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The latest model, the Panasonic ES-LA93-K Men&#x27;s Shaver, is a 14,000 rpm motor.     </li>
            <li> I ended up getting this razor at Target on vacation after my Norelco died (after many years of valiant service).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for many years, and was always looking for an alternative to alleviate skin problems.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver overall, and</li>
            <li> I love the wet/dry feature and cleaning</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am able to shave in about 4 minutes while the shower is warming up as opposed to closer to 10 minutes with the razor.</li>
            <li> Absolutely outstanding product.</li>
            <li> I have had it for two months and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several electric shavers since the 1950&#x27;s as well as shaving manually for many years, and I can now say that the Panasonic ES8249S gives me the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I challenge anyone to tell the difference between the results of this electric shaver and a manual shave.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is the best out of the last five I have owned.</li>
            <li> Way better than the Norelco</li>
            <li> I like the cleaning system better than my Braun.  </li>
            <li> Much more convenient,</li>
            <li> I love Amazon. :)</li>
            <li> I researched, read many reviews, and the lot fell on this Panasonic Arc IV.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the shaver and only hope it continues to perform as it does now.</li>
            <li> And, love the shaver.</li>
            <li> good thing!!!!!!!!very useful</li>
            <li> Much better than the Norelco I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Once I got home I decided I better read some reviews before I opened the box, since I&#x27;d bought a $165.00 razor on impulse.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is outstanding.</li>
            <li> The reason for my 4 rating has nothing to do with the shaver itself, which I rate as outstanding.</li>
            <li> I believe i coud have found a better price if I would have shopped around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve allready seen some simalar razors for a better price ,even a braun.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> so they could \\&quot;find out more info\\&quot; by asking their co-workers, (or whatever tech support people do when they put you on hold.)</li>
            <li> I thought it would be OK.</li>
            <li> I expect better quality.</li>
            <li> Next to his car and our cats, it&#x27;s the best thing that ever happened to him...</li>
            <li> Quite simply this is one of the best shaving instruments i have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I also wanted something that could be used on the underarms as most womens razors pull the hair or pinch the skin in this area.      </li>
            <li> Better than most shaves</li>
            <li> -Safe</li>
            <li> While using the braun, shaving was okay.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic provides such a great shave that I never have to worry about a mini-mustache, even after working a 12 hour day!    </li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many, many shavers.  </li>
            <li> I have now discarded all my blades as this shaver does a better job than even my razors.  </li>
            <li> I was going to buy the top of the line Norelco this time but a friend said i should try the Braun models.</li>
            <li> I bought the top of the line Braun and used it for a week after which time i returned it.</li>
            <li> Most people said that going from a Rotary type shaver to a Foil, it would take my face a while to get used to the shaver.</li>
            <li> Love all of my deals buying through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric shaver for many many years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for many years.</li>
            <li> Have used the Norelco for the last 10 years and have been very happy.  </li>
            <li> It gives him a better, closer shave than a razor.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on many different razors it sounded like the best deal for the money.</li>
            <li> I never tried Braun, but the price of Braun is $30-50 more than Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel I can gain a lot the by spending 30-50% more.     </li>
            <li> (better use it with shaving gel or foam)  2.</li>
            <li> I owned a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver many, many years ago</li>
            <li> maybe more.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it and having purchased it on sale for $93 with a $20 rebate, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve gotten a good value.</li>
            <li> I love Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li> It does a much better job than my Norelco at shaving my face.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and came up with the Panasonic as my top choice</li>
            <li> I really love this razor.  </li>
            <li> All i have to compare it to is a norelco shaver, but this thing works so much better.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to use a razor without ingrown hairs and redness/ itchiness.  </li>
            <li> The shaver gets more of the hairs around my neck and nose than the braun ever did</li>
            <li> works better than the braun activator / series 5  </li>
            <li> I love the cleaner, but dislike that i have to replace the filter every month.</li>
            <li> Also, I invested in some Proraso cream after-shave balm; $16 with free shipping if you have Amazon prime, but so far one of the best after-shaves I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I know what I&#x27;ll be replacing this one with in a couple years, though. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I read many reviews regarding Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers before deciding to purchase this model.  </li>
            <li> I have owned this for about five weeks and am thoroughly pleased with it&#x27;s performance and close shaving comfort.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But when it comes to shaving, it was clearly a better unit than the ES8077S</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ll be able to better judge that, since nobody likes getting part way into shaving their heads and have the razor run out of juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Flimsy as most are, and a lot of tugging and pain  when used.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ll be able to better judge that, since nobody likes getting part way into shaving their heads and have the razor run out of juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Flimsy as most are, and a lot of tugging and pain  when used.  </li>
            <li> I was not even in the market for a shaver but could not pass this bargain up. :)</li>
            <li> what the hey. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> However I do like the fastersmoother shave or the Norelco better</li>
            <li> over all could not be more satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Therefore, after researching numerous reviews for Braun, Remington, Phillips, and Panasonic, I was impressed with the reviews of the Panasonic ES8249S ArcIV and made a decision to purchase one via Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it and am more than satisfied with this model and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It took too many passes to get anything off from under my chin, to the point where I&#x27;d end up with razor burn (and some patches that, once missed for a day, I&#x27;d have to use the popup trimmer on).  </li>
            <li> This thing just does a much better job for me.</li>
            <li> It shaves with ease and makes shaving more enjoyable...</li>
            <li> It is much better than the Braun series7 and 5 and also the Norelco which irritated my face  </li>
            <li> I will tell more after 30 days.</li>
            <li> Love the brand and the self-cleaning part.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> And the blades are excellent quality; I haven&#x27;t replaced them in two years and still give me a deep shave.  </li>
            <li> and it was taking more than 5 minutes every time to get an acceptable shave.</li>
            <li> I have had many electric razars and been dissapointed with all of them.  </li>
            <li> I paid top dollar for this shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a Christmas gift for my son and he states that it gives a nice, close, nick free shave.</li>
            <li> Contrary to many reviews</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of money, and spending $150 on something I wasn&#x27;t sure would even work for me was risky.</li>
            <li> I did it though, and I will tell ya what. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many electric shavers over the years</li>
            <li> I love this electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an absolute joy</li>
            <li> Yes, I do need to do more then one pass to get rid of the hair.  </li>
            <li> I have not used the self cleaning mode, but I will be able to try it out after my trip in March.  </li>
            <li> I like the cleaning system better than the braun, which uses an alcohol based solvent for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The self cleaning cycle is also many times quieter than the braun&#x27;s system.  </li>
            <li> The shaver does switch on and off, but it&#x27;s volume is more than tolerable (sounds a bit like a mobile phone ringing while set on &#x27;vibrate&#x27;).  </li>
            <li> Love being able to shave in the shower with shave cream too.  </li>
            <li> Before finding this, I tried the best of Braun and Phillips Norelco - both three-headed monsters and the same style as this one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also able to do my head a lot faster with the Panasonic shaver than my Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> you also want to do something in return...:)    </li>
            <li> hope it gets better after each shave.    </li>
            <li> Love this Shaver.    </li>
            <li> He loves it more than his Braun electric.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you made the decision to switch.</li>
            <li> have continued to love my shaver until now.</li>
            <li> Shaving results with the Panasonic are much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mostly in the latter case, so shaving time goes from 5 to 10 minutes if I want everything perfect.</li>
            <li> I had an electric more than 10 years ago</li>
            <li> I have only used the shaver for about a month but at this point in time I am very impressed with the shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been satisfied with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> It is excellent all around, BUT the actual shave.  </li>
            <li> That was OK...</li>
            <li> Noisy, but OK.</li>
            <li> many times before it felt like I was fully shaved.</li>
            <li> This is Ultimately the best shaver on the market..</li>
            <li> $80 sure.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems like more rpms and cuts better, no stubble.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is okay.</li>
            <li> I am not a 100% satisfied with the finish and the time it takes, but there are no cuts, bruises etc.</li>
            <li> They sent me the latest [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> He now heads to work looking handsome and well-groomed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am SO satisfied with this razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am SO satisfied with this razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I feel like my Norelco from 2005</li>
            <li> does a better job still at shaving.  </li>
            <li> He is in love with this shaver.</li>
            <li> More than once this thing has run out of batteries on me mid-shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaved again the next day and still perfect.</li>
            <li> I now have to make sure I get it out of the shower and cleaned before I use it because it has replaced her Venus bladed</li>
            <li> and I am beginning to like it more.</li>
            <li> Already the battery charge is better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK electric shaver, does the work.</li>
            <li> It is an ok product.</li>
            <li> Great shave every day with a very close/clean shave and no razer</li>
            <li> and I researched that this type of shaver is best for such skin types.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to thoroughly clean it while on vacation when one doesn&#x27;t have the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far so good!</li>
            <li> Where the Braun did a pretty good job, the Panasonic produced a fantastically smooth skin surface (I&#x27;m seconding his opinion!)</li>
            <li> The base/charger also has a nice option to clean the razor as well.</li>
            <li> The Braun did clean well, but the solution would evaporate quickly in warm weather, and did make the bathroom smell a bit.  </li>
            <li> Where the Braun did a pretty good job, the Panasonic produced a fantastically smooth skin surface (I&#x27;m seconding his opinion!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s REALLY nice to not even have to clean your shaver yourself.</li>
            <li> Even though the price was good the shaver is too noisy and it does not shave very fast .</li>
            <li> The razor looks very high tech (a must for a tech geek like myself) and the led screen is a nice touch!  </li>
            <li> (though I am sure the new models work great too).  </li>
            <li> I use an electric shaver because my skin isn&#x27;t very smooth, so I get cuts and irritation easily with a razor.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic es8249s wet/dry shaver is the best shaver i have ever used, Its quiet, Fits good in my hand and shaves really close in about 6 minutes.</li>
            <li> My skin has really cleared up since I have been using this because my face has been able to heal from the trauma of using a Mach 3 razor every day (even though a Mach 3 Fusion is awesome, after shaving 5 days straight my skin gets traumatized).</li>
            <li> This shaver was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The Arcitec did a pretty good job</li>
            <li> I used to buy the best I could find, been using the Mach3 Turbo for a long time... and some others...</li>
            <li> I have used it for almost 2 years now and feel that I have a pretty good handle on what I like and don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> While it was working it did a pretty good job although I have one of those kinds of beards that don&#x27;t do well with electric razors.  </li>
            <li> good and first to use gadget in the morning&#x27; &#x27;better shape and holds easy&#x27; &#x27;</li>
            <li> It works great on upper and lower legs and works amazingly on underarms.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good machine and a good buy.</li>
            <li> This does a fairly good job, not as good as the earlier Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Shaving with the Arc IV is ridiculously quick; I can get a pretty good shave in 2.5 minutes (no joke), and a pretty great shave in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, smooth shaving, easy cleaning and charging.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean (run it through some water) and</li>
            <li> Quick, clean shave, easy clean up, great battery life</li>
            <li> , i felt as clean as using a blade!     </li>
            <li> Like most other reviews, I&#x27;ve been extremely impressed with the Panasonic ES8249 wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, extremely satisfied, great razor!!</li>
            <li> I looked on the net and found that Panasonic razors were getting very good reveiws.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great shaver, fast quiet motor, looks great, feels good in your hand, charges quick, easy to clean...</li>
            <li> this razor does an incredible job in short time with no burn and no stubble.</li>
            <li> Gives a closer shave than my triple head blade razor and is great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gives close shave&lt;br /&gt;Works great with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Arc IV does an outstanding job of getting my face smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to use than my ES8078; the shaver is more comfortable to hold and easier to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> This is my first amazon review and I&#x27;m writing this because I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Norelco has perhaps been the most comfortable electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Two of the most important things about shaving: speed and closeness.</li>
            <li> It cuts the best, is quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> A wet shave means a great shave and so far this is the best, easist on my face shave ever.</li>
            <li> Great razor so far.</li>
            <li> So far, great shaver.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin  3.</li>
            <li> This shaver replaced my Braun 5 series shaver and has so far been great.    </li>
            <li> This thing is light years better than the Norelco and its also ranked #2 in the Consumer Reports</li>
            <li> I also had a 14 year old Panasonic which offered a great cut and like all electric razors......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make it short and sweet: This is the best electric shaver I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I will tell you that it does give a close shave and it more comfortable than the Braun.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Assuming the thing is reasonably durable, this is full of win.  </li>
            <li> bought this to use primarily on my head and it&#x27;s done a fantastic job!  </li>
            <li> I do not use it in the shower, but the WET/DRY capability makes clean up so easy - just remove the top and put both the top and the head of the razor under running water.</li>
            <li> With this Panasonic, smooth and healthy looking every day.</li>
            <li> The norelco is quiet which is real nice but</li>
            <li> I had to keep a spare cutter block/foil pair handy because I want every shave to be as good as possible and never got more than 6 months out of one without performance suffering.    </li>
            <li> Features on it are nice and worth 3 or 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Face looks good after getting this and is gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> The Norelco with its fair cut sent me running for a blade and would use the electric for a fast shave.    </li>
            <li> The cleaning system is hands down better and the shaver is excellent (read the reviews).  </li>
            <li> It is quiet, smooth, and on top of it, does a perfect job from the very first use.</li>
            <li> Also the charger - cleaning system is a plus, less work for you and great maintenance for your new best friend.</li>
            <li> I had a perfect shave the very first time with no pain or red bumps.</li>
            <li> Shave is amazingly close and amazingly comfortable, the shaver is easy to hold, and the lithium-ion battery charges quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a true baby-hiny-smooth shave!     </li>
            <li> This would probably be four out of five stars if the email department had handled the problem originally without directing me to take three more steps before someone handled the problem.</li>
            <li> This would probably be four out of five stars if the email department had handled the problem originally without directing me to take three more steps before someone handled the problem.</li>
            <li> Tried the ES8249S and Panasonic is totally correct, its as good as a blade!  </li>
            <li> My first electric shaver and I love it!</li>
            <li> easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Self</li>
            <li> It cleans easily with liquid soap lathered up by turning it on.  </li>
            <li> that gets the job done very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It also falls off somewhat easily</li>
            <li> but the ES8249 easily outperforms them.</li>
            <li> However, though I would like a closer shave, I also care more about my shave looking clean than feeling close.</li>
            <li> Close shave easy on the neck (and cleans up the neck hairs without razor burn.)</li>
            <li> It will run a couple of weeks between charges, but when it&#x27;s so easy to charge in the cradle, why wait?</li>
            <li> Cleaning under the tap was easy, but then I had to leave the parts separate</li>
            <li> Easy to use with no problems.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver a while ago and liked it so much, that bought one more as a gift for my friend.</li>
            <li> The fact that you can also clean with liquid soap and water more than makes up for this flaw.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is extremely easy and convenient  5.</li>
            <li> Cleanup is exceptionally easy</li>
            <li> Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves close and easy to take care of.</li>
            <li> An easy five stars.</li>
            <li> love that you can just rinse the \\&quot;blades\\&quot; under the faucet to clean the razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and easy to manipulate around my face.</li>
            <li> Fortunately for me, I was enjoying a fantastic shave within 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The razor also can be cleaned easily by taking off the foil and running water through it while on turbo mode (see instructions).</li>
            <li> Having used a shaver for many years with fair results I was surprised at the quality of the work that this shaver accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She says it is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> There is a pouch also which makes it easy to carry</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and to work.  </li>
            <li> So it was an easy buy.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> - Incredibly close shave, much better than I expected from an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a Gold Deal and found that it is a good razor for my replacement of another older Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I bought it on a special pricing and don&#x27;t think that I could have gotten any better at any price.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is an amazing razor!  </li>
            <li> However I just had my first shave with this one and trust me guys its amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked the shaver at first and it still does work well however after 3 years the cleaning system gave out and began leaking.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I prefer shaving with a blade, but if I had a really great electric that didn&#x27;t take just as long to give me a good shave, I would opt for that.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is pretty nice</li>
            <li> So the self-cleaning and drying feature is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> This was on sale for $89 and decided it was a good deal, considering the reviews and the normal price in stores.  </li>
            <li> The shaver works pretty nice.</li>
            <li> The screens warm up while shaving, making for a soft warm comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This was the best shave that i had ever had in my life, hands down.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Cleans quick and effectively  Shaves quick and close    Summary of cons:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say invest in a good electric pre-shave and an after shave balm that is good for your skin (takes some experimenting to find the right stuff, but I&#x27;ve seen good stuff about Trumper&#x27;s Coral Skin Food, Proraso cream after-shave balm, and if you want to go a little cheaper even OTC Nivea Extra-Soothing After Shave Balm, right now I&#x27;m still using some 2 year old after shave balm an aunt got me for Christmas from Bathand Body Works, but they don&#x27;t carry that line any more,) but this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> and now the shaver is as good as new.</li>
            <li> So, I researched and agonized over switching to a new brand as my research suggested, thinking Brawn was superior.</li>
            <li> I am using the manual cleaning proces and it works just fine, no need for the automatic system and cost.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t give the Norelco enough time to adjust but the Panasonic worked perfectly from the first day; didn&#x27;t need any time to adjust.    </li>
            <li> You can wash the razor off under the tap just fine, and you don&#x27;t have to pay for cleaning solution packs to do it.    </li>
            <li> I have previously had two of the highly-hyped (and up-to-now best electric shavers on the market)</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t charge it in your bedroom when you are trying to sleep and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> The cleaning cycle works fine.   </li>
            <li> This is a fine shaver and does a creditable job.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li> I think the more potent motor from the higher end model should be adopted by all Panasonic foil shavers.    </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been very happy with this razor and would recommend this product to anyone looking for a new electric razor.  </li>
            <li> No pain, easy, fast, and a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In closing, it is a great shaver, and will last a very long time before blades need eventual replacement, otherwise is ideal just as it is out of the box.</li>
            <li> As far as the shaver performance goes it is the best I have ever had, it shaves close like a razor and has a swiveling head with spring action for easy shaving.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable, easy to use, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This little bugger is unequivocally the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It shaves quickly and very cleanly.</li>
            <li> He used it dry and absolutely LOVED it!  </li>
            <li> the head looked huge...</li>
            <li> It is really a smooth shaver; easy to use and easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a fantastic baby smooth, irritation free shave in around five minutes.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is smooth and painless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the convenience of the electric razor while I&#x27;ve appreciated the closer shave that you can get with the manual razor.  </li>
            <li> My legs are so smooth, you&#x27;d think I had used a razor blade.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean without it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon price and free shipping with Amazon prime truly made this an affordable gift.  </li>
            <li> and I think you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> My last shaver was a panasonic ES8043 which was great</li>
            <li> How does one walk about town or go to work with a bizarre, patchy look?  </li>
            <li> This shaver has had numerous great reviews on all the sites I looked at when researching it</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth after a shave and not irritated at all.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much in fact, that I bought each of my two son-in-laws one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> , either i grow titanium hair follicles or this shaver is simply not that great.  </li>
            <li> so razor burn has always been the primary reason for trying electric shavers.</li>
            <li> This gives me just as smooth of a shave as I can get with a razor but with no irritation.</li>
            <li> but the shaver is so smooth there is no irritation.  </li>
            <li> This is the very best at shaving my heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting for the next generation because Panasonic cannot be trusted to sell me a product that will be great for five years and keeps making obsolete its $300 shavers every two years.      </li>
            <li> Before I got this shaver, my wife had no idea my face could be so smooth.</li>
            <li> I wished it cuts closer to leave the skin smooth but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If not, I have to result to using a blade razor to make it smooth.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face as smooth as if I had shaved both with and then against the grain with a razor.</li>
            <li> Was going to buy one again, but Amazon had a fantastic price on this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly comfortable to hold</li>
            <li> Let me tell you this model is as smooth as it gets i have been using for a month now</li>
            <li> The ES8246S shaves my face as smooth as a babies bottom....  </li>
            <li> The razor is fantastic.</li>
            <li> then anything I have ever found available to women.  </li>
            <li> Does a great close shave on his face and neck in a very short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Although the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t sound like you have entered a jet engine test cell when it&#x27;s doing the cleaning....</li>
            <li> well worth it for the many years</li>
            <li> In 2.5 minutes, my face is smooth.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having problems getting a smooth shave, try the old-fashioned electric pre-shave stuff.</li>
            <li> if I have an important meeting in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> It is a fabulous razor.  </li>
            <li> However, Amazon does have them available for around $8-11 for a 3-pack.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how close and smooth the shave was.</li>
            <li> Overall, the shaver works well and is a great value.  </li>
            <li> Overall it works great.</li>
            <li> It works great unless you move it in a way that causes the trimmer to try and fold back to the stored position.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face smooth and does not hurt, even when I go four days without shaving.  </li>
            <li> It was working great until the self-cleaner stopped draining the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> the price and thought it was quite cheap in comparison to what I paid for the Braun, and clicked to buy.    </li>
            <li> I thought it felt cheap and</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> I bought it with cheap price in Amazon.</li>
            <li> Easy use , clean up and never make me hurt in using .</li>
            <li> so you can use it in shower  easy to clean under running water  </li>
            <li> I can do a really great shave including the back of my neck in about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li> Its so close and smooth</li>
            <li> that even my wife can&#x27;t tell that I didn&#x27;t use a blade razor, and for that I can&#x27;t be happy enough.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your face as \\&quot;smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I replaced the blades only once, about a year or so ago, and it&#x27;s still working great and still holding a charge.  </li>
            <li> My skin is as smooth as after I shave with a razor.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is simple, this shaver works great.</li>
            <li> The wet shave is even closer and brilliant in the shower</li>
            <li> Simply put shaving cream on your face and this razor cuts great.</li>
            <li> told, I&#x27;ve never been as happy with a razor as I am with this one.e, which means I no longer have razor burn mixed with missed whiskers.    </li>
            <li> It feels great in your hand and it&#x27;s designed to get to different contours of your face and neck.</li>
            <li> All the reviews I read praising this device were justified.  </li>
            <li> Shaves close, charges quickly, easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am extremely happy with this shaver from Panasonic and</li>
            <li> However, it was so smooth and pain free.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver, fantastic value.</li>
            <li> The shave is so close, so smooth, as smooth as a blade.  </li>
            <li> My face is amazingly smooth in under five minutes.  </li>
            <li> I also have a light beard</li>
            <li> amazing piece of technology that really delivers what men want</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, even without the cleaning unit.  </li>
            <li> I think it helps in such a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday and his face is always smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the overall performance of this shaver!</li>
            <li> but they were either hand me downs or cheap models.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly light growth, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite a smooth as a razor blade, but I&#x27;ve never cut myself with the ES8249S</li>
            <li> and it get&#x27;s me about 99% as smooth.  </li>
            <li> - my primary purpose was my dome -</li>
            <li> The razor delivers a close smooth shave with its \\&quot;4 Blade Technology\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Before cleaning it in the support I brush away the cut hair from inside - I think this way I can renew the cleaning liquid more rarely.  </li>
            <li> The shaver head glides smoothly over the contours of my neck and jaw.  </li>
            <li> charge life and easy to clean even with out the station.</li>
            <li> Provides comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be redundant and go on about how great a shaver this product is, but I would like to stress that the cleaning cartridge while not necessary to cleaning the shaver does an excellent job at cleaning and maintaining the blades.</li>
            <li> I used it becuase of the noise, and sound does not travel well in my house.  </li>
            <li> which is  primarily why I got this shaver.</li>
            <li> and I ordered a cheap electric shaver, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> A perfectly smooth face, and my neck didn&#x27;t feel like hamburger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing is ever perfect, and I do have a few quibbles.</li>
            <li> It gives a good shave, but takes longer than my old Norelco&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> These were only slightly better, but, (to be fair)</li>
            <li> but the dry/wet versitility of this shaver makes it far superior to the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I tried the wet shave feature yesterday and my lady rubbed my face and said \\&quot;nice; and that is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Has a nice cleaning system built into the charger, which is nice, but have found it to be entirely unecessary.</li>
            <li> Takes some space, but charger can be connected directly to shaver without it (good for travel).  </li>
            <li> and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> on old skin like mine under neck just fair.</li>
            <li> I even shaved Kim Kardashian&#x27;s kitty for her and made it nice and smooth, she shows it off as much as she can</li>
            <li> good shaving, very clean, and quiet.    </li>
            <li> So happy I bought this - thank you to all the other masses that have put this on top of the pack for me.</li>
            <li> I had read the great reviews weeks ago, but when my older Panasonic died two days ago I was in a pickle and had to act fast.  </li>
            <li> It cleans up easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li> After reading several reviews before my purchase, I do agree with people who stated that cleaning system is not that impressive and takes 4 times longer than my previous shaver and doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job.</li>
            <li> Quick &amp; Easy review here...</li>
            <li> Makes shaving quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy and quick..</li>
            <li> The BJ Hydroplane shave cream provides a remarkably smooth shave,and if it begins to dry out before finishing, I can just add more water and it is good to go again.</li>
            <li> I may just need a new head, but instead of spending up to $40 on a new head, I decided to check out the latest and greatest in new shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Immediately, i noticed very little to no irritation on my neck, which was awesome.</li>
            <li> I originally had the three blade version (ES8103S)</li>
            <li> I have to shave over and over to get a close shave as when originally purchased.</li>
            <li> , close shaves even though I&#x27;m still using the original foil and cutters.</li>
            <li> But the price was originally $299</li>
            <li> i am very pleased and surprised at the performance of this shaver.</li>
            <li> It shaves pretty well, even under the neck (make sure to do it when the skin is dry)&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: If you are willing to spend $70 more - buy Braun series 7 electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Summary I am happy with the price/performance of this product but not surprised with it.</li>
            <li> It works great and has a long battery life.</li>
            <li> So far I am very satisfied with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> He was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it to help shave my head with a razor to do the follow-up work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the WET shave once with this razor and it was really good almost as good as a real razor.  </li>
            <li> It shaves extremely close and it&#x27;s honestly the next best thing to using a blade.</li>
            <li> This is BETTER than any other shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, shaves as close as the fusion blades (nearly to 99%), but that is PERFECT for me.</li>
            <li> I got it real cheap on the deal of the day and needed a new one anyway.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have around, but you could live without it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give it a glowing review right out of the box because it seems I always have a great first impression of something new.  </li>
            <li> Every once in a while, the cleaning system isn&#x27;t completely clean.</li>
            <li> Even more amazing it was done with relatively low effort.  </li>
            <li> Now I just clean the shaver manually and I doubt whether I&#x27;ll buy any shaver with a cleaning system.</li>
            <li> you can just run the razor under running water to clean it.</li>
            <li> The ability to clean with soap and water is convenient.  </li>
            <li> The screen tells you when to clean the shaver.</li>
            <li> and I have a clean razor.  </li>
            <li> You can also just clean the shaver with water and put it on dry/charge.</li>
            <li> I might give up on the cleaning system and clean by hand</li>
            <li> It does take a while to clean (perhaps about an hour), but I just set it and forget it while I am on my way out the door in the morning.    </li>
            <li> It cuts closer and is easier to use as well as to clean.</li>
            <li> Clener takes an hour to clean.</li>
            <li> Its clean shave is satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the dry shaves, but not blown away.</li>
            <li> I went out and bought the Norelco 1280X/42 3D with the Jet Clean System.</li>
            <li> It would be 5 out of 5 stars if I did not have to use a toothpick to clean the cleaner every two times I use it.</li>
            <li> It would be 5 out of 5 stars if I did not have to use a toothpick to clean the cleaner every two times I use it.</li>
            <li> I usually clean it by removing the shaving head cover, running that under water, then switching the shaver on to the cleaning mode and running it under the shower water for about 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> it selfs clean while charging.</li>
            <li> You just pop off the shield, clean it under running water, and then hold the power button for two seconds to take it up to supersonic speeds to clean the blades.  </li>
            <li> Damn clean shave.....      </li>
            <li> The head of this razor is relatively huge with its 4 blades, which is why the shave is so quick.    </li>
            <li> recurring \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; was \\&quot;it&#x27;s noisy when in clean mode...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it holds the charge as long as stated but shaves very nicely</li>
            <li> Stop reading the (enormously positive, and accurate) reviews and just buy it already!</li>
            <li> Very smooth, he thought it could be the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The F5790 is an excellent razor that is fast with extreme close shave</li>
            <li> and then I got a special email from Amazon than made my mind up for me.  </li>
            <li> but when it came on special for $89.99, baddabing baddaboom....</li>
            <li> It was on a Gold Box special for $89</li>
            <li> (if you are a shower shaver do yourself a favor and order some right now!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;A very good shaver with a few caveats.  </li>
            <li> This shaver gave me the closest shave I have ever experienced with absolutely no irritation or burn.  </li>
            <li> I had never had a wet shave with an electric shaver and it felt GREAT.    </li>
            <li> And the Fusion gave me a great shave with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> Also, I legitimately think it shaves better when my face is greasy or wet, with or without gel, so I&#x27;m very pleased.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to get the absolute closest shave the first week you own it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many electric razors over the years, but none really worked with my situation.  </li>
            <li> The full combo is to clean/dry/charge.</li>
            <li> , the orange glow of the screen was kinda cool looking</li>
            <li> Shaving was a chore and took over ten minutes to get fairly close.</li>
            <li> (love the wet mode), and my skin looks much better already, and the process is much more pleasurable than with Gillette blades.</li>
            <li> After a full charge, I used my razor.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll add one more star to say, thanks.</li>
            <li> It also has a solid feel and a good battery</li>
            <li> The overall shaving effect is almost as good as that using razor.</li>
            <li> I try different brands and styles before, but none of them will give me a good shave like this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> and I cannot say enough good things about it -</li>
            <li> No matter how many passes I make, the shave REMAINS gentle.  </li>
            <li> I am officially blown away by this product, as the shave is as good/better and is much more gentle on my face.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually better at shaving a head than a face, but I have a very tricky patch on my neck that always seems to need a blade to get</li>
            <li> It would take me about 7 or 8 minutes to do a full head shave with a blade (taking care not to cut myself).  </li>
            <li> gives you such a good result..</li>
            <li> thanks:)</li>
            <li> The ability to charge the shaver with the cord connected directly to the shaver instead of the use of the cleaning system is a nice option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is true.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately this was a gold box deal and its good enough to keep without returning.</li>
            <li> it was SUCH a good deal, so I just had to buy this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it now for 4 days and still has a full charge.</li>
            <li> feel like you&#x27;d be better off buying just the razor instead of the cleaning system because lets be real here, its a wet/dry razor.</li>
            <li> The sellers warranty was only good for 90 days.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> Still not a bad shaver if you use these types.  </li>
            <li> I asked what am I supposed to use in the mean time, and was told basically that is not their problem, this is their warranty procedure and even after 30 days with a defective unit that is the best they can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No mess of any kind.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have owned with a battery meter, it is very nice and a must have in the future for me.</li>
            <li> For this price well worth it, but at full price, I think I&#x27;d stick with the standalone razor and just use the liquid soap to clean it</li>
            <li> For this price well worth it, but at full price, I think I&#x27;d stick with the standalone razor and just use the liquid soap to clean it</li>
            <li> After my first shave, my face was so smooth and clean...</li>
            <li> THIS LAST SUMMER, STILL GOING STRONG!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, my husband is happy with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Anyways, other than the cleaning system cartlidges, this for the price is great.</li>
            <li> Long story short, this thing is incredible and is much better than the Braun.</li>
            <li> It did a nice smooth and complete job beginning with the first use.</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re looking to switch to a good electric razor or maybe just looking to save some money in the long run but don&#x27;t mind putting up a good bit of money to start out, I would definitely recommend this razor to you.  </li>
            <li> Took a quick try with it right out of the box (there was enough charge in it) and was happy with the first impression, so I decided to keep it and give it a full whirl in the morning.    </li>
            <li> has the best price along with top notch customer service, but I bought mine down the street at my local Target for 6 dollars</li>
            <li> has the best price along with top notch customer service, but I bought mine down the street at my local Target for 6 dollars</li>
            <li> and I use it after every three shaves and it does keep my shaver clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Gives more options than my older Braun charger and cleaner did.</li>
            <li> Luckily, putting this on Amazon&#x27;s subscription service also saves you 15% on the price.    </li>
            <li> The trick is not moving too quickly.</li>
            <li> Also, since it shaves quickly the razor can go 7-10 days between charging.</li>
            <li> seemed similar to the last electric razor i tried 10 years ago; not too impressed.</li>
            <li> It provides a quick and close shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> -cleaning solution can be picked up on Amazon for 3 pack for around $12  -quick</li>
            <li> The self-cleaning feature is super convenient.</li>
            <li> I just recieved the razor and took it for a quick spin .</li>
            <li> This model charges quickly.</li>
            <li> It can be cleaned quickly under a stream of water or with handsoap.  </li>
            <li> Shaver charges quickly I was using a Remington</li>
            <li> A quiet, comfortable shave, nice and close with no razor burn either.  </li>
            <li> I do really like the cleaner units because they do such a great job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I do really like the cleaner units because they do such a great job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Quick recharge.  </li>
            <li> Two minutes is all that&#x27;s needed for a quick shave&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> a quick rinse under the tap does just as well.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was amazingly quick (even over the holidays).  </li>
            <li> I quickly became a believer.</li>
            <li> I immediately turned it on for a quick shave test.</li>
            <li> I use a gel shaving cream with a quick renise after use then just a stand cleaning about once every 1-2 weeks you don&#x27;t need to buy cleaning detergent refills for each month.</li>
            <li> and I have the luxury of a quick afternoon/evening shave</li>
            <li> it works slightly better than my Norelco 8240XL (which is now my travel shaver), and the cleaning system is decent.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, have been using it daily for last four or five years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient for a quick shave, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> its his most favorite birthday present</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been high on Braun products, and I will say I was satisfied.  </li>
            <li> So if you are buying a shaver for your spouse, I recommend this one highly since you will definitely be enjoying the benefits of it.</li>
            <li> So if you are buying a shaver for your spouse, I recommend this one highly since you will definitely be enjoying the benefits of it.</li>
            <li> I got a close shave quickly on the very first usage, i.e. no break in time.</li>
            <li> - can clean it right in the shower or sink, or place it in the self cleaner.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, ergonomic, leaves skin smooth like never before, and a clear 5 stars in my book.</li>
            <li> and this is the first electric shaver that has ever gotten my head completely smooth.  </li>
            <li> These are great shavers but they have to be able to last for SEVERAL years before needing service.</li>
            <li> Having had Brauns until about 9 years ago, I was very pleased with the last Panasonic shaver I had.  </li>
            <li> I have never expected an electric razor to match the closeness of a safety razor, but this one comes the closest of any model I have ever used (including Braun and Norelco) -- and I am thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the first week, I installed the cleaning cartridge and filled the cleaning reservoir with tap water.  </li>
            <li> and you have a nice, clean shaver waiting for you the next day.</li>
            <li> charging clean is great, cleaning doesn&#x27;t need to happen everyday.</li>
            <li> Was a great investment and hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> the little cleaning station cant do more than you can easily do by just throwing some antibacterial soap on it and turning it on while dunked in a sink full of water, its more of a gimmic if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a lifetime customer of the Norelco rotary razor having practically one of every new model including up to the latest [[ASIN:B000PKKAGO</li>
            <li> That tells me Panasonic is going to roll out a new model again and it will be better.     </li>
            <li> Previously, I had a Braun electric that i was happy with, until the child tried to shave the Maltese puppy, which irritated both me and the dog.  </li>
            <li> It is very lite and the flexibility of the head made it so easy to get around the contours of the jaw line.  </li>
            <li> i think it takes me this long as i&#x27;m figuring out all the best angles to get the different grain directions of my hair.</li>
            <li> There is nothing better than a hot lather shave with this razor, and the self-cleaner makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li> but I have found that the shave is very close and the easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am someone who is willing to spend a little bit more for a quality product and good customer service.</li>
            <li> I am someone who is willing to spend a little bit more for a quality product and good customer service.</li>
            <li> It easily shaves the hard to get areas on my neck and the self cleaning feature is great.</li>
            <li> At first this missed an ingrown hair or two, but after a week or two of using it, I always walk away with a clean shave.      </li>
            <li> I agree with many of the other people in that it&#x27;s probably best to just rinse the shaver using water and a little bit of liquid soap under turbo-mode and following up using the cleaning system with &#x27;dry-only&#x27; cycle to keep the blades nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I am agreed with all review regarding its cleaning system; after I tried it one time, I prefer to clean it manually    cleaning system takes long time and not 100% effective.   </li>
            <li> He said he will be shaving much more often and is certain that he has found a real keeper in this electric</li>
            <li> In fact, I don&#x27;t really see the need for the large cleaning, charging device, as you can clean it under the tap with body wash, and could just as easily plug it in to charge it.</li>
            <li> That, combined with background noise and distorted sound, was a real challenge.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and use, but from a straight razor to an electric one takes adjustment.  </li>
            <li> It was smooth and fast and did the job with no muss or fuss.  </li>
            <li> The Braun had trouble coping with the neck area whereas the Panasonic did a great job there.</li>
            <li> An amazingly smooth and fast shaver.</li>
            <li> I was so astounded at how smooth my skin felt that I just kept shaving till my whole face and neck was shaved.</li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy this shaver as much as he does.</li>
            <li> Conclusion: A fantastic razor at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The Braun had trouble coping with the neck area whereas the Panasonic did a great job there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value when you think of how much money you save and give a great shave without any cutting or niks.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ok, just send it in and get it fixed.  </li>
            <li> I have more professional trimmers, so I will not use the one that is a part of this one.    </li>
            <li> This was worth the money</li>
            <li> so I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> The shaver can be used directly in the shower which is where he loves to use it the most.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently my buddy bought a Braun Series 3 shaver, but never really said much about it...certainly never bragged about how great it was.  </li>
            <li> My older Braun shavers lasted 5-6 years easy.</li>
            <li> but again the Panasonic wins again.</li>
            <li> So, Mr. Panasonic, I&#x27;m not buying your latest model, the almost two-year old Panasonic ES-LA93-K.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s rarely any razor burn (sometimes around the adam&#x27;s apple</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and have not shaved two days in a row for probably 10 years or more.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this shaver a try after reading multiple reviews and performing some research on my own.</li>
            <li> Better than my old Braun</li>
            <li> Shaves closer than my admitted old Panasonic and captures longer hairs better than any electric shaver I&#x27;ve used (30+ years).  </li>
            <li> I was glad it arrived in only 3 days, even using the \\&quot;Supersaver\\&quot; free shipping.    </li>
            <li> I am also pleased that it uses a Lithium-Ion battery, as opposed to the NiCads of old.    </li>
            <li> I tried changing cartridges more frequently (every three weeks), I am cleaning it every day, but...</li>
            <li> but so far the shave and the battery are both top notch.</li>
            <li> My last shaver (same $50 Braun for 3 years) was excellent for my skin, but this Panasonic is much closer--</li>
            <li> nearly razor close--at the cost of significantly more irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better now than I was with my old shaver with regards to cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Also, I am VERY pleased with the exceptionally long battery life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m off to the post office to ship this to Panasonic&#x27;s exchange center, making good use of the 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> Wet shave using gel/cream is good.</li>
            <li> I would only use it once a week if I did and since the manual says the cleaning pad is only good for a month no matter how many times you use it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money I paid ($100).</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Completely worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> with most electric razors, the flip out trimmer in back is more of a nod towards convention than something really usable.  </li>
            <li> with most electric razors, the flip out trimmer in back is more of a nod towards convention than something really usable.  </li>
            <li> Overall, after reading many reviews from various sources, this shaver is rated in the top three from many of these sources and I can attest</li>
            <li> its also good for touch ups after a wet shave.  </li>
            <li> I already own one of these shavers for the last two years, but I lost the charger and to replace it, it was going to cost me about $30 dollars.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system is also pretty cool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different electric razors over the years, and have never found one that I&#x27;ve liked or that did a comparable job to blades.  </li>
            <li> I had not used an electric shaver in many years and was pleasantly surprised at the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised to find that the top model on every website I found was this one, by Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> ; a fast, smooth, irritation free, very close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 years old, so I&#x27;ve tried many of them.</li>
            <li> From all the different brands available, Panasonic is the one I like the most.</li>
            <li> The independent 4 blade system is a nice design.  </li>
            <li> Beauty Encounter send the product on time (early) and over both of us are pleased.</li>
            <li> I tried the soft position but the locked one gives better results for me.</li>
            <li> The old one was outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Most electric shavers just shorten the stuble, but this one actually shaves it off leaving your face smooth.  </li>
            <li> So I still keep a razor handy and run it through those areas where there is still left over hair.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station regularly gets clogged with hair, and it just did not seem to do anything spectacular</li>
            <li> I love everything about this shaver except how terribly loud it is when it&#x27;s going through its self-cleaning.</li>
            <li> - You can get the cartridges right here on amazon, they aren&#x27;t very much - the shaver doesn&#x27;t need the full cleaning cycle each time...</li>
            <li> So while the reviews here were very positive, I wasn&#x27;t overly optimistic about the ES8249S.</li>
            <li> The cleaning/recharging station is great for keeping the shaver clean and ready to go although the cleaning cartridges are a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> My blades are still as sharp as they were when I got over a year ago... and the cleaning system works great - - I would rather spend about $10 for 3-4 months of cartridges vs. spending alot more for razors and replacing the blades and especially cleaning it by hand....</li>
            <li> It was worth waiting for the right price .  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, and I only use the stand to clean it once a month.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried Norelco about 3 years ago, with better, but similar result (significant irritation).</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t take you from a beard to clean shaven, but it will certainly keep 1-day of stuble in check.  </li>
            <li> I think having a warm, wet head helps the ES8249S give a closer shave, and it certainly makes keeping the sink area clean since there are no hair clippings to clean up.</li>
            <li> and because I rinse off the shaver before I put it in the cleaning solution I&#x27;m able to extend the cleaner to last 4-6 months without having to replace it and the shaver feels and smells clean.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you buy this razor don&#x27;t waste your money on the cleaning/charging unit, you can clean the shaver just as good and charge it with the power cord.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to take as many passes to cleanly shave my face, which means I no longer have razor burn mixed with missed whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it does a perfectly adequate job for an electric, I find that there are razors for $40 less that do just as good a job.  </li>
            <li> The facts that you can use the shaver in the shower and always have it spotlessly clean and ready by using the accompanying self-cleaning recharger makes this electric shaver ideal for any man who wants a consistently clean shave in least amount of time and effort.</li>
            <li> Very clean shave, no irritation on neck area compared to old one.</li>
            <li> - I have what some would call a babyface and I experienced little to no irritation after first use.  </li>
            <li> the shaver is pretty good, a little loud i think, but it is very smooth and quick.  </li>
            <li> , it goes right thru it.</li>
            <li> RIGHT OFF!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had packed it in my suitcase for my drive home from vacation, it worked right when I packed it</li>
            <li> The size is about right for travel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll treat that kitty right.</li>
            <li> and I can shave my neck, right along the beard, without it yanking any hairs at all.</li>
            <li> The charging/washing unit thing doesn&#x27;t wash it right anymore, but it still charges and dries it well.</li>
            <li> The shaver is very LIGHT - I would think good for those who are arthritic  The ultra thin foil shaves COMFORTABLY and GENTLY.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close, comfortable shave without grabbing or yanking the hairs like some of my older razors did.  </li>
            <li> I sparingly use the clean cyle as I feel the \\&quot;required\\&quot; frequency to use it is too much.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t even courteous enough to give me the exact part number that I would need.</li>
            <li> First shave out of the box, I knew it was something far better than anything I&#x27;d ever used - three minutes</li>
            <li> Clean shaves, worked very well.  </li>
            <li> The razor is really high class with its look and the grip is extremely comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and not necessary to buy a ton of the cleaning cartridges - I get far more cleans out of them than they say one should.    </li>
            <li> Smooth, incredible close shave wet or dry!</li>
            <li> Read reviews and most people advised that it takes some time for your skin to adjust to new shaving mechanism and you need to use this shaver for 2-3 weeks before you can really feel it.    </li>
            <li> It was worth spending a little extra to get the best.</li>
            <li> It has good shave time and easy to read screen and one charge lasts at least for 14-18 shaves.</li>
            <li> I think this electric is definitely worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> It would still be worth it even at the higher price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced in the past with electric Razors.</li>
            <li> Before the Arc IV, I used an electric Braun shaver (don&#x27;t remember the model, I bought it from costco), which shaved alright under most conditions, but was absolutely useless when my face was greasy or sweaty, and ended up causing me more pain than I&#x27;d have liked.</li>
            <li> There are no bad things to really say about this shaver</li>
            <li> and it works great for a quick shave, when I don&#x27;t want to reshave for the night.. or go out for a few minutes.. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> in all a super high tech unit with the bast wash system have used by far being more cost effective and even has a fan and heater to dry the razar.</li>
            <li> this shaver admittedly shaves the face well, but does not work well on the neck/under chin area - in fact, its pretty disappointing in light of the overwhelming number of great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Face still feels shaved after 8 hours (this is very strange, but nice).</li>
            <li> Clear, easy to read display,</li>
            <li> I still think that this is the best performance shaver out there however a blade life that lasts only a few months is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> after decades of using various electric shavers on an intermittant basis, i have finally found one that works just great.  </li>
            <li> Powerful battery&#x27;&#x27;Love the package&#x27;if send as present&#x27;</li>
            <li> Review indicated that it was almost as good as an equivalet Braun and half the price.  </li>
            <li> However, even the good ones (i.e. high-end Philip Norelcos and Brauns) gave my sensitive facial skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a big deal because it can be taken in the shower and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> If I wanted to look smooth longer (no five o&#x27;clock shadow) I&#x27;d use a razor, but I enjoy the convenience of an electric, especially when traveling.    </li>
            <li> My wife and I both love that she can use it in the shower, clean it under the water, and put it on dry when she gets out so</li>
            <li> Only concern is, this shaver doesn&#x27;t work great unless the hair is VERY short.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system does a much better job keeping the head clean (and dry).  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much, I bought a second identical shaver to keep in my office.</li>
            <li> I got this for less than ninety bucks, so probably was a good deal.</li>
            <li> being someone that has to shave every single day for work, Its nice to have this electric shaver</li>
            <li> There is a turbo mode with an extremely high vibration rate to clean the blades under running water.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on Amazon and other sites, and studying the specifications, I decided to give it a chance, and I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li> within 24 hours of my first electric wet shave i tried electric wet shaving again; guess what, it was perfect!</li>
            <li> I switched to blades to get a closer shave and was pretty satisfied with the results and figured the smoother face was worth the extra hassle.    </li>
            <li> Completely unecessary to be quite honest, but nice for the lazy folks.  </li>
            <li> Simplle, quiet, and a close shave out of the box make this a purchase seem to be a great deal, especially with the great Amazon price, at least $40 below any price I could find.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the charger cleaner and don&#x27;t know that I will very much since its costly</li>
            <li> I like this very much.  </li>
            <li> It shaved closer than other models, was smoother and more comfortable on my face, and you could wash the heads.</li>
            <li> There is also a pop-out trimmer that seems to work fine, but doesn&#x27;t trim nearly as close as the shaver head cuts (of course, it&#x27;s not designed to).      </li>
            <li> It is a bit louder than my old Panasonic shaver but works fine.  </li>
            <li> but an older man with \\&quot;scruff\\&quot; just isn&#x27;t cool.</li>
            <li> One thing that was nice about it was that it actually seemed to do better in wet conditions or right after a shower.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy the razor with the cleaning system--but I am delighted with the charging/cleaning station.  </li>
            <li> The spot was completely smooth and clean, I continued, my neck, jaw, and even the stragglers on my upper cheek were cut off, and my face felt like it did when I was 8!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is a nice product overall; I mainly got it because I wanted an electric shaver with a charging stand.</li>
            <li> and I find that another good sign that they will last much longer, giving me the chance to either just rinse the razor after use or use hand soap to clean and just use the drying and charging functions on the station; though I tend to only charge the battery when I get to 10% to preserve the battery.  </li>
            <li> The first week there was some minor irritation and a little bit of a learning period as I figured out how best to maximize the efficiency of the razor.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good or better than any electric I&#x27;ve ever used, especially with a little soap or cream to lubricate the skin.</li>
            <li> I clean it in the stand 4 times/week, which keeps the shaver looking new every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I replaced my first one with a 3-blade ES8092 6 years ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this model because it was only about $25 more than the ES8243 model without the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> so I am not going to change my rating on this razor, just making you aware of the companies policies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same blades since I got the shaver and while I was still able to get the close shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is if you are lucky enough to receive a working unit, most likely you will be fine.</li>
            <li> husband used the razor yesterday (26 Dec) for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I owned a Panasonic electric shaver before and it did a mediocre job at best</li>
            <li> I have read numerous review on this model that it is supposed to be better than the three blade version.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t believe any electric can), it get&#x27;s pretty darn close, and the cleaning system is about as dummyproof as you can get.</li>
            <li> Without question, I gave this shaver 5 stars because it has met or exceeded all of my expectations, and it shaves close enough that most people would never know that I used an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I always found it somewhat funny that the instructions always said something to the effect of, \\&quot;use for 30 days, as skin may take time to adapt to electric razor use.\\</li>
            <li> My first self-cleaning electric razor was a Braun, bought 2.5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I will tell you the same results can be achieved with both razors, however, it takes more time and (in my case) irritation with the Braun.  </li>
            <li> Stays charged a long time, is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> To that end, I&#x27;d be willing to do away with the automatic cleaning feature.</li>
            <li> ordered with overnight Saturday delivery, and tore the shaver out of the box first thing.  </li>
            <li> thanks Panasonic!    </li>
            <li> it used to bother me having two days and more stubble going to meetings and such, but now i need not worry.    </li>
            <li> After the first shave he got rid of the one he had.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as solid either, but I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li> He was amazed the first time he used the razor.</li>
            <li> but I personally wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $120 for it.  </li>
            <li> Since this is the first electric razor I have used, I was amazed at how well it seems to shave.</li>
            <li> This is my first Panasonic electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> This shaver does its job very well!  </li>
            <li> My first Panasonic was the 8109s.  </li>
            <li> ok, I bought a second one for him and he loves it too!!!  </li>
            <li> The first time I shaved with the Arc IV was after 2 days of not shaving, and I just wanted to see how it would cut.</li>
            <li> It is waterproof, so afyer using, simply pop the top and run under the faucet...</li>
            <li> Looked pretty good for a day or two (once the blood dried)...</li>
            <li> Actually better at neck areas but still can pick a hair after 20 times passing the same area.</li>
            <li> -pretty</li>
            <li> One charge a week is more than enough.</li>
            <li> which was my first experience with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Always make that my first shopping place.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband about six months ago and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> This is my first upgrade in shaving since 2001</li>
            <li> My husband has a thick beard and Panasonic ES82594 Arc IV works great for him.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased it, I was concerned that cleaning it would always require the cleaning stand with solution, etc.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted me 10+ years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of foil shavers but I bought this shaver for my head based on some recommendations and it does an outstanding job.  </li>
            <li> This is my first linear razor.  </li>
            <li> Until I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still more than enough for a week&#x27;s vacation without having to worry about taking the cord.     </li>
            <li> Very close to a blade and never a nick!</li>
            <li> -The cleaning station consistently gets clogged.  </li>
            <li> At first I had the activator.  </li>
            <li> It has a higher pitched sound but is still not quite as loud if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li> For the first week I had it</li>
            <li> You do not have to go over the same area as many times.  </li>
            <li> Have yet to try the cleaning system but from my first impressions the shaver itself has exceeded my expectation and would throughly recommend.</li>
            <li> better than I get with some blades actually.  </li>
            <li> This one just bulks more overall.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had before I got my first Panasonic in 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First, keep in mind</li>
            <li> , I understand why it&#x27;s a top rated shaver, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The first shave removed hairs that had been dodging the blade on every morning shave for months.  </li>
            <li> first one was a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I use a trimmer first and then this.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY ZERO!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go for a cheaper model electric razor that will lift hair before it cuts, this will most likely cause skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> This razor amazed me on the first use.  </li>
            <li> First, I do NOT find this to be a &#x27;one pass&#x27; shaver.</li>
            <li> It is FAST!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was astounded after my first shave.  </li>
            <li> I had used a Norelco rotary product before, and it destroyed my skin on the first use.</li>
            <li> My most recent electric shaver was on</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s just not difficult to rinse off just the blades and foil, and not soak the rest of the unit.  </li>
            <li> I used to use electric razors when I first started shaving</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product and am glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying this is my first electric razor.  </li>
            <li> (that built-in timer is pretty handy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using any electric Shaver</li>
            <li> First, it shaves closer than my Braun.  </li>
            <li> Shaves ok and if I work at it can get a relatively close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not whisper quiet, but I sure don&#x27;t find it</li>
            <li> Pretty neat.</li>
            <li> This shaver is outstanding, quiet, non-pulling, thorough and pricier than the one I returned for repair.  </li>
            <li> I first got a Panasonic ES8077S.</li>
            <li> My wife woke up the first morning</li>
            <li> I primarily purchased this to replace a 2 Blade Braun shaver that was close to 10 years old.  </li>
            <li> the first was a three blade model which I used for about a year before getting this one on Hot Deals.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the quality and performance of the first two and on Amazon&#x27;s rating.  </li>
            <li> The system isn&#x27;t worth much, though.</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I shaved with it I decided to go on a Friday night to give my face the weekend to recover.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a four blade shaver, it has four independently floating shave screens that sit on top of two blades.</li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer seems pretty flimsy to me and doesn&#x27;t exactly glide well for straightening around moustaches or goatees, so i still have need of my bladed shaver for trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i know it will only get better with time.</li>
            <li> so I was able to send it back to Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I used the self cleaner for the first year or so</li>
            <li> Is still doing exactly what it is designed to do 2 years on.</li>
            <li> All in all, a good razor and I would recommend you try it if you are thinking of changing your current brand or just ready to replace your old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Need to use a blade every few days to get a good trim line for sideburns and goatee.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close shave and although it has a few \\&quot;nits\\&quot;, it was a good buy.on&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave and although it has a few \\&quot;nits\\&quot;, it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> considered trying something new rather than getting the same shaver since my old one is actually still working perfectly.</li>
            <li> But, most importantly, it shaves closer, with less time and effort, and it is more quiet, both shaving and during cleaning.    </li>
            <li> If you only shave short stubbles then you will have a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> i expect this time to come down as i get more familiar with the style of shaving.      </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;d never used a \\&quot;foil\\&quot; shaver, the reviews seemed pretty positive, so I decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li> I eventually had to replace the case as well, due to the on/off switch malfunction that is popular with them.</li>
            <li> and I always developed significant rashes and skin reactions to them.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and needed a shaver that would accommodate and this one has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it dry once or twice when needs must, and the results were good, just a little more irritation.</li>
            <li> At first I just used it dry as a normal electric shaver and loved it more than any other shaver I had.</li>
            <li> The only time I was able to get a truly good shave was the one time each week that I used a regular razor (more than once a week was too hard on my skin).  </li>
            <li> While your mileage may vary, my face didn&#x27;t need any adjustment time with this shaver, as I typically have when switching to a new shaver, which was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall a very good product I highly recommend it, especially for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Seriously though, this is a great razor.  </li>
            <li> but my wife liked me to have at least a semi smooth face when I didn&#x27;t feel like using my Mach3.  </li>
            <li> It shaves really close to my face, and I&#x27;ve never been able to use electric shavers because they don&#x27;t get close enough for my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> Arc IV never skipped a beat, never pulled or tugged a hair, and left my face feeling fresh and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several high-end shavers over the years with only fair results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plenty good enough for my daily needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Arc IV is wonderful to clean; because it&#x27;s waterproof, you just put a little ordinary liquid soap and water on the head, operate the turbo mode, then take it apart and rinse the pieces off under a faucet.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the quick charge time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, specially useful for the neck area.</li>
            <li> All of the positive comments about it convinced me to try it.  </li>
            <li> Was looking at Braun and Norelco but came across research and all the positive feedback from Panasonic owners and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> This product works well and provides a decent shave (not as clean as a razor, but better than all other electrics I have tried).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve very impressed, I even payed alot less than my other one!</li>
            <li> no matter how long, what direction or how many passes I made on my neck -- even after replacing the blades).   </li>
            <li> My husband really likes it, and this is his first electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It also took way too long to shave, requiring too many repeated swaths.</li>
            <li> I still have many questions - when do you replace the blades, how long will this battery hold up, etc.</li>
            <li> After using the Panasonic for 5 shaves in just over a week, something i don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been able to do in who knows how long, I am ecstatic.</li>
            <li> The other thing I like is how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself has done pretty well and gives me a reasonable shave.</li>
            <li> And based on the users&#x27; review, Panasonic&#x27;s rating is as good as Braun&#x27;s if not better.  </li>
            <li> past experiences were not so good.</li>
            <li> I explained the problem and even though they had stated that their warranty would not cover the issue, they replaced the foil (I am guessing because it is uncommon for the foil to fail a little after 2 months, they are actually trying to keep a customer happy or both!).</li>
            <li> I explained the problem and even though they had stated that their warranty would not cover the issue, they replaced the foil (I am guessing because it is uncommon for the foil to fail a little after 2 months, they are actually trying to keep a customer happy or both!).</li>
            <li> Ive always wanted the category to perform better and it appears that someone has finally made a decent one.</li>
            <li> It recharges very fast and its quite easy to clean with water and a little bit of soap.  </li>
            <li> It is truly amazing compared to the Braun and my previous razors.</li>
            <li> The shave is completely atraumatic and quick.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Norelco shaver for almost 30 years, but this Panasonic is shaves me quickly, and completely.  </li>
            <li> Since first using it I have been very pleased and blown away by the self-cleaning tool that takes no more than 1 hour.</li>
            <li> Granted, I don&#x27;t shave dry often, most of the time I shave in the shower with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> and/or with shaving lotion, but for me it is a much better shave dry with a moist towel-off afterwards in all reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I feel like it&#x27;s better when using it dry.  </li>
            <li> but when I need a quick, close shave, I reach for my old blade.</li>
            <li> The cleaning cartridges, since they are dry, CAN not spill and are more compact to STORE.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has traveled with me to several countries now, and the charge easily lasts for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I had tried electric razors previously but never found them effective</li>
            <li> The quality of the shave with the shave gel versus shaving dry is much better.</li>
            <li> This gest just as close, looks just as nice, and takes much less time.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a shaver strong enough to shave my head as well as my face</li>
            <li> This shaver really does a much better job on those trouble spots than other electric shavers - but not as good as a blade.  </li>
            <li> The head is different than I&#x27;m used to from the other Panasonic, the whole top floats, rather than just the foils floating inside a more stationary plastic cover.  </li>
            <li> It shaves MORE closely in a single pass.  </li>
            <li> It provides MANY shaves from a single charge.</li>
            <li> I doubt I&#x27;d buy this again, and I certainly recommend that anyone looking for a shaver take a pass on this one.</li>
            <li> This year, instead of replacing the blades on my aging Norelco Smart Touch XL, I purchased this Panasonic ES8249S.</li>
            <li> But technology advances, and this shaver certainly reflects that.      </li>
            <li> B00008DQJQ Factory Reconditioned Braun 7526 Syncro Smart Logic Shaver]] purchased from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> , I take Panasonic trimmer and get rid of all the large areas.</li>
            <li> and it certainly does</li>
            <li> I hesitated at the large price tag but took the leap</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried wet shaving yet, but the dry shaving performance is great.  </li>
            <li> It works great wet or dry without any razor burns.</li>
            <li> It cuts the hair quickly and smoothly with minimal irritation.  </li>
            <li> Works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li> it gives a great shave both wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It is fast and easy and preferable to a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> All in all this is a good, clean cutting razor that is very simple and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The length of the shave time is probably a good half minute shorter than with the old Remington as well, and I don&#x27;t have to contort my skin in every direction like with the Remington.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for over 2 weeks now, and the dry cleaning cartridge seems to work much better than Braun&#x27;s series cartidges; not to mention they are much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it just might be something I need to get used to, I still need to use the trimmer more than I did with my other razors&lt;</li>
            <li> This shaver has a very high build quality.  </li>
            <li> I own a less than 2-year-old top-of-the-line Norelco, and I constantly need to touch up my sessions with a real razor, in order to get a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really liked the ergonomics of this little guy</li>
            <li> and it even comes with a nice little cleaning/charging station.  </li>
            <li> Really nice little shaver esp.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done anything special as far as upkeep, just using the cleaning system and occasionally using some soap and alchol to clean the blades and foil.</li>
            <li> From the first time I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve had a clean shave equal to the shave I get from a Gillette Fusion or Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> I recognized that the Panasonic ES8249S was consistently rated highly by just about every reviewer.   </li>
            <li> cleaning base is great, and since you can pick clean, charge, or dry, it&#x27;s nice to be able to clean it myself and then drop it in to dry properly, or just drop it in once a week for a full cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> It still doesn&#x27;t give a very good neck shave and the size of the head makes it difficult to navigate into nooks and crannies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is really easy to clean using a little shampoo and water.</li>
            <li> It is nice looking, relatively small, gives a comfortable, close shave that will make your significant other want to make-out more and not worry about looking like a sand-paper attack victim.</li>
            <li> On those rare occasions that I am on leave and allow my facial hair to grow a little this shaver is still able to cut smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It vibrates fast and smooth, instead of clunky like my last one.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, light weight, and shaves very close.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t clean, dumps water everywhere, and leaves the cleaning part where the razor sits half filled with water at the end of the cycle.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t clean, dumps water everywhere, and leaves the cleaning part where the razor sits half filled with water at the end of the cycle.  </li>
            <li> I have a very course beard.</li>
            <li> Nowadays, I travel a lot and because of the restrictions on liquids for carry on, electric razors are just so much easier.    </li>
            <li> Much easier (and cheaper)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Panasonic ES8249S!</li>
            <li> To both of our shock it gave him a very close shave</li>
            <li> After much searching and being led around in circles, I found a page that said enter zip code and click.  </li>
            <li> He HATES to shave- absolutely dreads it.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver</li>
            <li> Neither beats a shave with a real razor, of course.  </li>
            <li> My skin has reacted with raised patches, dryer skin, and unshaved portions that needed touch-ups with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> Besides, if you want to make some patterns by your beard, it cannot help so much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Fast shave.  </li>
            <li> straight razor kicks its ass any day of the week, and i regret spending the cash on this model.</li>
            <li> I have a very assymetrical hair growth on my neck, and I found that this shaver wasn&#x27;t very efficient there.  </li>
            <li> and at a cost of over $100 with shipping, it makes no sense not to just replace the whole thing here.</li>
            <li> I must say my faith in electric shavers has been restored, after years of using a straight edge...</li>
            <li> thanks Panasonic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how it used to be, you either had a close shave or a fast one.</li>
            <li> I can shave reasonably well in about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to miss as much stubble as the Braun did.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system uses a soapy module and water in its cleaning system and is much quieter than the Braun, which always scared my wife when it would start up again after a pause.    </li>
            <li> My husband said nothing could shave like a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> but so much easier.</li>
            <li> Acceptable shave, but found it took as much as 8 to 9 minutes to get one.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> It is absolutely as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> Also handles neck hairs very well, which the Arcitec would not cut.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t get longer hairs very well.  </li>
            <li> I bought a ES-RT31S because it was very well priced.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t think that would really matter.  </li>
            <li> Battery seems to not have lost much capacity.</li>
            <li> He would really to have one that would work well for him.  </li>
            <li> All in all - This is a very well designed unit.</li>
            <li> It is much faster to just wash off under the faucet than it is to put it through the process of cleaning it automatically.</li>
            <li> The dock is also very noisy for me when it isn&#x27;t doing anything.</li>
            <li> It shows how much time you spend shaving and what percentage of battery remains (after two 2.5 minute shaves it shows 90%</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very noisy.</li>
            <li> I really like it now.  </li>
            <li> - Shaves the neck very well  - quieter cleaning system  </li>
            <li> I can only fit one side of the shaving foil in there.  </li>
            <li> Be careful and make sure to look at what the shaver is compatible with.  </li>
            <li> The price, at around $150, was a bit too much for me to justify</li>
            <li> It was the closest thing to a straight razor shave that I have ever had with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t really consider this a problem.</li>
            <li> It also is much quicker</li>
            <li> and he loves it just as much.  </li>
            <li> Very close, no irritation.</li>
            <li> (I am now 64 years old) that I rarely shave on the weekends.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m on a blood thinner now, I really didn&#x27;t want to continue nicking my face when I shaved.</li>
            <li> Quiet and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I really like this one.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I am a guy with fast growing beard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had to use a blade for my primary shave as my beard is very coarse and grows  rapidly.  </li>
            <li> (And believe me, this guy has high standards!)</li>
            <li> He shaves his whole head and his face with it, and loves how close if gets and</li>
            <li> how much faster it is since he can now shave without water or soap.     </li>
            <li> real problem started just two months after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Very close to skin.</li>
            <li> Build-in quality is great; the design is not fancy, but simple and low key.      </li>
            <li> It gets a much closer shave and doesnt irritate the skin nearly as much.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and quiet.</li>
            <li> but they all do, it gives a very close shave between 4 - 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Now, add that you can use this in the shower or bath and this thing really shines.  </li>
            <li> it is ready for me.  </li>
            <li> I find the system to work real well.</li>
            <li> At that point I started to buy the cheapest disposables I could find (which turn out to be Wilkinson&#x27;s Sword at Walmart; an 8 pack costs just under $6 with the Personna version being 10 cents cheaper but of much lower quality.)</li>
            <li> Handy for the times when I&#x27;ve got a low battery and don&#x27;t know if I really have enough of a charge to do a shave that morning or not.  </li>
            <li> in all a fantastic unit, especially if you can find a deal on</li>
            <li> Handy for the times when I&#x27;ve got a low battery and don&#x27;t know if I really have enough of a charge to do a shave that morning or not.  </li>
            <li> in all a fantastic unit, especially if you can find a deal on</li>
            <li> Very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave both ways (as close as my blade).  </li>
            <li> Also, it charges amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> However, neither of the razors I&#x27;ve owned before this Panasonic really did the job all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I actually had a truly smoothly shaved face.  </li>
            <li> It really handles everything.</li>
            <li> Dont pay much for the upgrade.</li>
            <li> The shave is much closer (equivalent to a blade) and you are done much faster.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s intended use, but I&#x27;m not going to use a straight razor for that</li>
            <li> I like how the cleaning cycle is much quieter than the Braun</li>
            <li> ; it took appproximately a week for it to keep gray beard on chin cut real low; now it maintains a smooth shave</li>
            <li> It shaves fast and efficiently.</li>
            <li> an aside, the second razor, which then became my primary shaver has also now quit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Signed,&lt;br /&gt;Someone who buys a whole lot of stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who shaves my whole head too.  </li>
            <li> This seems to work very well</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t think it even needs that.  </li>
            <li> Very over rated.  </li>
            <li> I am very please with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It is quieter, with a monotone hum at precisely A below Middle C.  </li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer also works very well for shaping sideburns etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for a month now and find it to give me a much better/closer shave than the  Braun shaver it has replaced.  </li>
            <li> No irritation, and a really close shave.</li>
            <li> According to the manufacturer&#x27;s specs, they should last about a month, but I get the \\&quot;status\\&quot; light telling me to change my cartridge after two weeks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> what I do have is very wiry.    </li>
            <li> but when a product where you put so much bucks...</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t unusual for me to go 30</li>
            <li> I suppose the Braun&#x27;s alcohol-based rinse cleaning system is much inferior to the foaming detergent system of the Panasonic and that accounts for the difference.</li>
            <li> There is too much documentation.</li>
            <li> I also shave against the grain for a very close shave.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver performs very well, so I&#x27;ve been told.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> however that doesn&#x27;t really matter much to me.  </li>
            <li> much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went straight away to using it in the shower, since I&#x27;ve never had an electric razor with this capability.</li>
            <li> This thing is on a whole &#x27;nother level.hit the button, and it cleans, dries, and charges your razor for you.</li>
            <li> This thing is on a whole &#x27;nother level.</li>
            <li> Shaver cuts very close without irritation, could be because its in the shower.</li>
            <li> That method is much simpler and cheaper than the fancy system.</li>
            <li> (All is well now, thanks.)  </li>
            <li> Gave me a real close shave.  </li>
            <li> Cleaned very well with the cleaning</li>
            <li> I used a sensitive skin preshave, a sensitive skin shave gel, a sensitive skin after shave and face emollients along with the popular five blade sensitive skin shaver.</li>
            <li> Not even so much as any redness or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holds charge very well, and doesn&#x27;t require any additional accessories.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> He reports that it gives him a very close shave without any irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, shaves better, faster and closer than my old Braun.</li>
            <li> This razor has a 13,000 rpm motor,but doesn&#x27;t really shave any better than my old panasonic with a standard motor.</li>
            <li> I anticipate it will provide quiet, effective shavingwhile preparing for the next shave by self cleaning.    </li>
            <li> he, being a lifelong Norelco guy, was totally amazed at how good the shave was.</li>
            <li> I think razor blades such as the mach 5 do a far better job than any electric shaver.</li>
            <li> As mentioned above, the clean-up is so simple and effective.</li>
            <li> Firstly, after two and half months, it still shaves closer than I am able to with a razor.  </li>
            <li> Braun can&#x27;t find any hair after 6 or 8 times passing the same area and it becomes like a razor shaving with a little harsh on your skin but does an excellent job for special days.</li>
            <li> but this is the first NEW one that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I used my new Panasonic in the shower the first time and used shaving gel after reading this worked well with the shaver.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a good value due to the features, performance and should last for years.    </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this one is that it is VERY loud.</li>
            <li> Terrific price here on Amazon, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> When using this shaver as a \\&quot;wet shaver\\&quot; with shaving cream etc., this Panasonic is literally as good as shaving with a normal razor only with all the speed and convenience of an electric!  </li>
            <li> It may due to the fact that it deliver more force at shaving.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than the 3 rotating heads found on other types.</li>
            <li> Just bought this the other day to replace a $100 subpar Norelco and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that it really does live up to what others have been praising it for!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like a whole new world!  </li>
            <li> and when he did need a clean close shave he would break out in rashes using a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much smoother than my older Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> about the same time it took to prep, shave, and clean up using a blade.    </li>
            <li> If you use the shaver daily, then you get 1 month from a cartridge no matter how often you clean it.</li>
            <li> I even used it a while back when I was shaving my whole head and, done in the shower, it was quick, painless and very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always despised shaving, but, at least for this first month, I&#x27;ve kind of been looking forward to it.</li>
            <li> He loves the close shave, quickness of shaving, holds a charge a long time, the travel case, and the fact that it gets cleaned really well, and is comfortable in his hand.</li>
            <li> Charged it up before I left, put it in the included pouch, packed it in the luggage, and got a close, clean shave every day.</li>
            <li> This shaver cost more than I usually spend for a shaver, but I think it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty confident that if I went over my beard with this thing, it would shave it off with a few passes without any hair-pulling.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my wife immediately commented on how much louder it was than my old shaver.</li>
            <li> Like the idea of the cleaning station, will probably just clean it whenever the battery runs low</li>
            <li> You have to clean it after every 2-3 strokes to work properly.</li>
            <li> If I had to choose a negative aspect of this shaver, it would be that the stand cleaner operates somewhat loudly so it would be best if you let it run during the day or if your bathroom is far enough away from your bedrooms.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because of the High speed motor and paid to much money.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this and it has changed my perception about the viability of electric razors in the modern age.    </li>
            <li> the cleaning unit is not worth the extra expense,I seem to get it just as clean or even better by just rinsing it under water.</li>
            <li> &quot; (being a bit large when comparing to my old shaver) cannot fit around my ears to shave the side-of-the-head areas just above them.</li>
            <li> The clean cycle is not that clean, and it&#x27;s designed to re-use water a few times before changing it.</li>
            <li> Out of several previous electric shavers, this one is superior.  </li>
            <li> I get a nice (dry) face shave using facesaver, HOWEVER, the NECK remains a big problem!!</li>
            <li> so you can forget that option (unless you enjoy an hour long shave that goes nowhere...).  </li>
            <li> I should mention that i have long used Norelco triple headers, but have also tried and returned Braun and Remington shavers within their free return periods).</li>
            <li> I usually shave in my truck and it takes about 5 minutes to get a nice close shave that is ALMOST as a blade.</li>
            <li> Being that I shave my entire head each day, taking between 8 and 10 minutes, and considering that most people only shave the face, I use my shaver about 3 to 4 times as much as a once-per-day face shaver does.</li>
            <li> However, I knew after my first shave with the Panasonic that it was a keeper and far out performed my Braun products.  </li>
            <li> The newer high-end model looks really cool with the extra motor in the head</li>
            <li> Tried the top of the line Braun, seemed to take too long to shave, and had to go over the same area 5 times to get a close shave (also VERY noisy)!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it was a great investment and my husband will never go back to a traditional straight edge or even a cheaper brand of electric shavers.    </li>
            <li> As far as the shaving, it gets pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li> Nice small carrying pouch.  </li>
            <li> I found it full of really gross liquid.</li>
            <li> I have been stuck with my Gillette Fusion for years now since most electric shavers I have tried only irritated my skin and left much stubble on my face.</li>
            <li> The added cleaning feature is nice to have though I&#x27;m not sure it is a necessity for everyone.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I have used Gillette Mach/Fusion so far.</li>
            <li> One can also clean normally with just regular liquid soap.  </li>
            <li> You may want more cartridges down the line for cleaning, but all self cleaning razors are like that.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided that the technology of these shavers has gotten to a point where it would be worth trying to make the switch, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that I was right.    </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and had to try my new purchase, I removed it from the recharger and pressed the chrome button...with a nice little hum the new shaver came to life.  </li>
            <li> Guys if you need a new shaver do not even hesitate to pick this Panasonic up!</li>
            <li> if you need a new shaver do not even hesitate to pick this Panasonic up!er years of using a straight edge...</li>
            <li> Works very well when new.</li>
            <li> About an hour later the razor is clean like new, and charged.  </li>
            <li> So while a head shaving guy like me will need to replace the blades once every 4 months or so, a face shaver should be able to get away with replacing the blades once a year or less.    </li>
            <li> From previous purchases, Panasonic does not honor most rebates so you have been duly advised.    </li>
            <li> Using it 5 times a week in the shower for 3+ minutes at a time  I am able to get about a week and a half out of one charge.</li>
            <li> I have used my Panasonic for over a month now and like it better than all of my previous electric razors.</li>
            <li> While it comes with the holder that will charge, clean, and dry the shaver, you actually have a lot of choices about how you clean it after using it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, on a couple of short vacations, the charge has been more than adequate for wet shaving and rinsing the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my shaving habits were less strenuous and I was able to put up with the neck and face irritation I got by reducing shaving or growing a beard for months on end.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to hold on to, even when it is wet.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different razors over the last 30 years, and this tops them all.  </li>
            <li> but if I were to buy another one I would save a few bucks and go without the cleaning station as it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything better than the soap and water trick that they suggest in the manual.</li>
            <li> I read some better reviews of the Panasonic than the more expensive Braun and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, the ES8249S has so far proven to be a different breed of electric.</li>
            <li> In only two shaves it is has already shown tremendous improvement over the norelco</li>
            <li> It produces a decent shave in about 4 minutes for me.  </li>
            <li> Super silent, and self cleaning and charge holds for what seems like forever.  </li>
            <li> - Cleaning system seems better, no big fluid cartridges, uses tap water and powder.  </li>
            <li> Though it takes close to a month for the shaver to get used to your face and give a decent shave, and that has improved, I am lowering my rating from 3 stars to 2.</li>
            <li> I have not used the cleaning station yet because a quick rinse is enough.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend getting them with Subscribe &amp; Save here, though unfortunately Amazon doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;once every four month\\&quot; option which would be perfect.    </li>
            <li> After some initial confusion completely related to the ineptitude of the USPS, I received my shaver and am completely satisfied with the vendor and product.</li>
            <li> I had an older, cheaper panasonic</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone looking for a decent neck shave though.  </li>
            <li> This has happened to me too many times and has finally driven me back to Norelco which I used for years before the two Panasonic.</li>
            <li> If you like the way an older model worked, you should like this model too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Often you have to go over the same spot many times and from different directions.</li>
            <li> and after so much rashing and sensitive shaving (that hurt!)</li>
            <li> and I loved it - it was small, gave a very close shave, was waterproof, and only cost me about $35.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;d endure from the first shave from a new blade on my old \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Panasonic&#x27;s Arc IV 4-blade shavers.  </li>
            <li> Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] which I reviewed and gave high marks to.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend that bald guys give this electric a try.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Then I tried a Phillips mid-level rotary since my brother in law thinks highly of them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can shave in or out of the shower (highly convenient) with this</li>
            <li> I would never pay this high of a price ( $133.00 ) for an electri razor again or get the cleaning unit.&lt;br /&gt;other</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand and model.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The high speed 4 blade system gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> Got a smokin deal on the high quality shaver.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li> With the initial cost of the unit, the price for the replacement cutting head/foil, and the always-evaporating cleaner solution I really wasn&#x27;t sold on this being any cheaper or better than a good shaving cream and Gillette.     </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product, and it was $92 and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8249S Arc IV Wet/Dry shaver is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t shaved twice in a day since high school.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone who likes to get a 90% close shave in 20% of the time without having to worry about water or shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver head is very large and covers a lot of face, which likely accounts for much of the speed.</li>
            <li> I have heard complaints about how long it takes to clean and how noisy it is.</li>
            <li> The braun was a pain in the ass thatin that it decided when and for how long it would clean.  </li>
            <li> feature I find most useful is the ability to use it wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Now, after about a year and one new cartridge and one new blade set I&#x27;m ready to toss this into the landfill.</li>
            <li> -Cleans very easily with water and handsoap, takes 3 minutes and can be air dried in the docking station!</li>
            <li> The razor works ok after a little over a month, no complaints regarding that.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, WOW!!</li>
            <li> used this razor for a little more than a year.</li>
            <li> The price point was a little better once I look around.  </li>
            <li> I opted for the most bang for my buck and a model that was wet dry, you can actually use shaving cream with this model, which helps to nearly eliminate the break in irritation of most razors.  </li>
            <li> Cut decently, though never great, and never did that good of a job under the chin.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent razor, it delivers an OK shave but has trouble on the neck.  </li>
            <li> Rarely am I disapointed with a highly customer rated amazon product, but this one fell short for me.  </li>
            <li> It takes over an hour to clean and dry.</li>
            <li> It also provides a very close shave and is completely self cleaning.  </li>
            <li> but I was surprised to feel a much closer shave than I&#x27;d remember getting from the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t shave every day with those either, too much irritation to my sensitive skin..</li>
            <li> However, it takes me 8 to 10 minutes to get a reasonable shave versus 4 to 5 minutes with my old Braun( Model Pulsonic 9595)    </li>
            <li> Much, much, much faster than my old Norelco foil shaver I got when I turned 16.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 1-1.5 hr to clean dry and charge the shaver.  </li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin on my neck and it doesnt sem to irriatate it too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few electric razors, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for nearly two months now, and I really don&#x27;t have much to complain about so far.    </li>
            <li> This is frustrating as the shaver performs beautifully but does not last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the same shaver, just has no cleaning system.</li>
            <li> You are better off cleaning in tap everyday using turbo mode and do the 1 hour cleaning once a week.  </li>
            <li> Overall for the price of $90 I paid, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I had seen a few reviews stating something along the lines of: if you like braun, you&#x27;ll love panasonic.</li>
            <li> since i&#x27;ve only had it a month, but this product is well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> If I skip shaving all weekend, Monday morning I spend about 30 to 60 seconds longer (according to the timer) than my normal three-minute shave.  </li>
            <li> The price at Amazon was only about $105, which I figure would be about a years worth of manual shaving supplies.</li>
            <li> It is so powerful that it literally makes facial hair disappear as if it is being &#x27;erased&#x27; from your face as you shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wet/dry razor, so I took it in the shower like I normally do with the blade.</li>
            <li> The last thing I hated about my Braun is the time it took to shave: 5-7 minutes for a good shave, 7-10 for a great shave.</li>
            <li> Normally, I believe its priced $130 which I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy at that price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is normal for hair trimming to fall on your clothes / body if you are shaving.</li>
            <li> I did however purchase another shaver that, though not quite as good as the panasonic, does have a company that stands behind their product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been getting closer to 40-45 days out of each one, and that&#x27;s with a clean after every single shave.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been getting closer to 40-45 days out of each one, and that&#x27;s with a clean after every single shave.  </li>
            <li> It also goes weeks on a single charge and the docking station that clean</li>
            <li> I got lucky because I was looking to replace my old Norelco (which constantly irritates my skin) at the time and had seen this up on amazon&#x27;s gold box deal of the day.</li>
            <li> Even the dry shave was better than my standard razor.  </li>
            <li> This gives my a nice close shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This shaver will only cut hairs growing in the right direction.  </li>
            <li> The on button seems to me to be too big and the ergonomics put it right</li>
            <li> Plus the next few shaves got even better!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband, who has fast growing &amp; coarse facial hair, but likes to always be clean shaven.  </li>
            <li> Nice to see how long I shave for since it counts the minutes, so I can get a feel for how long I can run and how much juice it actually uses.  </li>

            <li> I also have sensitive skin and the &#x27;soft&#x27; setting really prevents the skin irritation that I normally have after shaving.</li>
            <li> This one had no problems with the length, and whether I was going \\&quot;with the grain\\&quot; or against it, it got things smooth faster and easier than any other electric</li>
            <li> This one had no problems with the length, and whether I was going \\&quot;with the grain\\&quot; or against it, it got things smooth faster and easier than any other electric</li>
            <li> but not least, for the ladies, I read a few reviews of women using this shaver for themselves so encouraged my wife to try it since I&#x27;ve been so pleased with my results so far.</li>
            <li> , my shaves were taking 10 minutes instead of the 8 minutes I got when the shaver was new.    </li>
            <li> However the cost of the new blades does not justify the quality of shave - they just don&#x27;t cut-it anymore.  </li>
            <li> so I thought it was time he got a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Obsessive with the Braun took 12 to 15 minutes, even with new blades.</li>
            <li> I changed from a Norelco elctric because I was not getting the shave I used to get, even with new blades.  </li>
            <li> I decided I needed a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> It was time for a new one...</li>
            <li> My new Panasonic:    </li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t buy the new ES-LA63-S model)  4.</li>
            <li> I needed a new shaver</li>
            <li> Ordered it New Years eve and received in Jan 4.  </li>
            <li> I also avoid immersing the new razor to keep the insides</li>
            <li> I just received my new piece of technology this year for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I could not be happier and want to urge all of you out there looking for a new shave.  </li>
            <li> The HydraClean system works well and keeps the shaver looking brand new.</li>
            <li> I was determined to find one that was CLOSE to the quality of a new razor shave.  </li>
            <li> and I would chop my face up with whatever new 3,4, or 5 blade metal razor was out at the time.  </li>
            <li> will give away my braun with the new foil!!&lt;br /&gt;A++++ seller&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use a brand new one because it would still wear into my skin.</li>
            <li> The shave was quick and smoother than with any other razor I have ever had thanks to the rpm of the motor.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning solution is hard to find, but if you order it from Amazon or Walmart, it is cheap and worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> and I have almost no qualms with it, aside from not working quite as fast on a lower battery, but the charger that plugs into the wall makes a very, very high pitched squeal if it&#x27;s plugged into the wall which forces me to only have it plugged in when I&#x27;m charging or cleaning the thing.</li>
            <li> The Panasonics always seemed to get great reviews where the others (other than the obvious fan boys who have obviously never tried anything else) were mixed.  </li>
            <li> And the interesting thing about it was that my face didn&#x27;t feel all raw,</li>
            <li> This razor easily out performs any of my previous razors when they were new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military and have to be clean shaven all the time.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that the cleaning system cartridges are only available online.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system is of no much use, but just several dollars more than 8243.   </li>
            <li> Good for cutting the easy open areas.  </li>
            <li> The old razor was missing so many hairs on my neck</li>
            <li> The display is very clear, just no complaints at all.     </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s got very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This one was rated high for sensitive skin and for the wet/dry capability.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely very surprised.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin around my neck...</li>
            <li> It is very loud during the process.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found every electric shaver I&#x27;ve liked ever trying them on and off of a long time, some where more expensive than this one, but I&#x27;ve never found one that performed nearly as well a bladed safety razor in closeness and Comfort.</li>
            <li> i can now shave everyday if i wish and feel as clean as a using a blade!</li>
            <li> Always a tradeoff between pressing harder, removing (most) hairs and getting redness/ bumps OR going over lightly leaving many hairs behind and looking like a dork...     Panasonic, back to the drawing board - and please stop sponsoring reviews, it will come back to haunt you.</li>
            <li> It has a self-cleaning that is easy to use, and the blades last a long time.</li>
            <li> I still believe that Panasonic wet/dry electric shavers are the best solution for me, I am somewhat disappointed in the quality and warranty for the price we have</li>
            <li> I still believe that Panasonic wet/dry electric shavers are the best solution for me, I am somewhat disappointed in the quality and warranty for the price we have to pay.</li>
            <li> *Update 04/03/2010: I had to update my original review due to the blades already needing to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other high-med end razors (mostly tripleheads) that don&#x27;t perform.  </li>
            <li> I do have to go over the neck and under my jaw a second time, but everything else is taken care on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Noise-wise, it&#x27;s about the same loundess as the Braun, but at a higher pitch.  </li>
            <li> previous shavers, I&#x27;ve received decent shaves but if I wanted a really smooth shave, I&#x27;d have to grab the old razor and gel.</li>
            <li> I do not like to shave, and generally don&#x27;t shave on my days off unless I absolutely have to.</li>
            <li> Cleaning station is kinda pointless since you can use hand soap which in my opinion does a better job.</li>
            <li> Amazon had this one for not much more, and after research it seemed like a better buy for me.  </li>
            <li> Well, first of all, I can say that I&#x27;ve tried several different versions of Norelco up to the Quattro, and I even payed $180 for the first Braun with a cleaning station (though I can&#x27;t even remember what it was called at this point.)  </li>
            <li> Over the past 20 years I&#x27;ve always used top of the line Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this type of shaver because the first one got stepped on by mistake.  </li>
            <li> This model is pretty quiet, compared to the cheaper razors I&#x27;ve tried before.  </li>
            <li> In conclusion, buy it if it is cheap or on sale, don&#x27;t buy it if it&#x27;s over $100 because it&#x27;s just not worth it at that price.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is LOUD!  </li>
            <li> The battery lasted fine, but after two years, I think the battery lasts less time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it for the first time, I was simply AMAZED.</li>
            <li> So finding the sweet spot on the shaver alone was rough.</li>
            <li> , wet is awesome {use a very thin gel, water it down &amp; use a light coating).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I can shave with it dry very quickly, or if I use my shaving lotion and take a couple extra minutes, I can shave my beard just about as close as blades can.  </li>
            <li> Though it doesn&#x27;t appear necessary to clean daily.      </li>
            <li> I did this dance for about 6 months (with razor shaving mixed in to clean up as necessary)</li>
            <li> Even though I was switching from a different kind of electric shaver the first few shaves were less than stellar.  </li>
            <li> As I tend to do with Amazon, I lurked around until the price went down to something I was comfortable with</li>
            <li> I also had tried many other electric shavers over the years, with little success.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that takes a little getting used to is that the blades move so fast that they produce a really high pitched buzzing sound, but it&#x27;s not loud, you get used to it quickly, and I might just have really sensitive hearing.  </li>
            <li> I am a user of the old Atra 2 plus as i have never been satisifed with the new technology blade shavers.  </li>
            <li> Shaver is like new now, but still won&#x27;t shave the neck areas properly and takes pretty much the same time (around 6-7 minutes for a close shave</li>
            <li> That is because if you save it up until the end of the week, it still has 7 days of dirty to clean so you might as well let it clean everyday so you can enjoy a clean shave every day.</li>
            <li> I now enjoy the fact that I can shave twice a day if I want without worrying that my skin will be irritated, previously I&#x27;d to make one day break between each shave    </li>
            <li> I will continue to use in the shower but will try to only get the shaving head wet vs. holding the whole thing under the shower to clean.</li>
            <li> Using it wet leaves the skin feeling cool and soft.</li>
            <li> While I had tried a variety of electric shavers in the past, they all had some kind of downside: the shave wasn&#x27;t close enough, they were hard to clean, got too hot, or whatever.</li>
            <li> so I guess it isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not cleaning the way it is supposed to at such a long replacement</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of work to get my neck shaved, but that is true of manual razors as well as any other electric shaver I used.</li>
            <li> The wet dry and the cleaning features are outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Love the flexibility of choice of wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> B004UQ6Q62 Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]] which has been phenomenal.</li>
            <li> the cleaning system is a bit noisy, and the trimmer only adequate but overall 5-stars for this one.</li>
            <li> Not only does it shave quick and close, but it does this quietly.  </li>
            <li> Prior to biting the bullet and making this decision I was a loyal Remington Shaver customer/user but the advances Panasonic have made in the mens shaver arena in the recent years made this decision a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> As I aged and my skin lost its suppleness, Norelco&#x27;s shavers became increasingly  less effective.</li>
            <li> The same item is at least $100 more in the UK!    </li>
            <li> The cleaning/drying/charging component has worked extremely well----it&#x27;s pretty much, &amp;#34;Set</li>
            <li> Also, the huge head makes certain areas hard to shave.</li>
            <li> After that I went the smart route and started reading reviews about different shavers on the web.</li>
            <li> It is a significant improvement over my previous Panasonic 3-blade model.</li>
            <li> It sounds like a combination between a dental drill (it has a very high speed motor) and a bug zapper (you can hear the individual hairs being cut).</li>
            <li> The whole HydraClean system has this cheap, gimmicky feel to it - a total contrast to the actual device, which looks very high class/premium.    </li>
            <li> you will see huge discount every few month on this item , and by the way , the machine is 100% Japan.</li>
            <li> Update on 8/12/10: I&#x27;ve been using the ES8249S for about 3.5 months and so far it&#x27;s been rock solid, a real winner.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s one or two less chances that I&#x27;ll drop it while getting it clean under the tap.</li>
            <li> When I disposed of my old razor, I was obliged to extract the Lithium battery for proper disposal and I was amazed at how much gunk had accumulated inside the razor over the years.  </li>
            <li> Vortex keeps the blades clean and less smell.</li>
            <li> Too loud,hurts my ears when I shave near them.</li>
            <li> and it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as my old 3 head shaver.</li>
            <li> but I have yet to do so and it has been 14 months so far</li>
            <li> , just can&#x27;t get a complete shave.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who was very adimit that electric razors didn&#x27;t give a close enough shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver starting making so much noise that it hurt the ear</li>
            <li> Wow, this was it.  </li>
            <li> It is much faster, quieter, does not miss hairs and provides a shave that is equal to a manual razor.</li>
            <li> B000NPBQB4 King of Shaves For Men Kinexium Shaving Oil, Sensitive Skin .68 fl oz]]</li>
            <li> So blade shaving with my sensitive skin was a 2 or sometimes 3 day per week deal, there was no way I could shave every day.</li>
            <li> Panasonic figures an estimated three minutes per shave, but I seldom get near two minutes.  </li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the foil rapidly deteriorating as some have reported, but I&#x27;ll probably update this review after I use the shaver for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> I opened up the unit to find that the battery was not replaceable since it was connected directly to the circuit board.</li>
            <li> Thanks you for making it easier to select my next razor.</li>
            <li> The larger head is a real plus.  </li>
            <li> If you just need to charge it, then you can do that, but the cord to the charger also fits the shaver directly for charging so you have options.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably just use the old one as my travel</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve dropped it and I shave with it in my car,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with it about 8 times now (every time with Aveeno Sensitive Skin gel) in the shower</li>
            <li> Of all the shavers that I have had, this one beats the others by far.</li>
            <li> The flexible head allows you to get a close shave anywhere on your face, and if you prefer to shave with a stationary shaver, just flip the pivot action button.  </li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> However, the shipping, the return and refund were completely hassle-free.  </li>
            <li> I feel the need to unplug it when it isn&#x27;t in use because you can hear the buzzing from the light flashing on the front every few seconds.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after my old Braun was not doing the job anymore.</li>
            <li> (so far).</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor for anyone looking to move away from manual blades with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive</li>
            <li> My husband completely loves this razor.  </li>
            <li> The old Remington advertised shaving as close as a blade, but it never came close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had zero issues with razor burn or hair bumps afterward, unlike the old Remington.</li>
            <li> I am replacing a Braun shaver that is nearly 10 years old.</li>
            <li> This is near unacceptable for a $170 shave system that you&#x27;re supposed to leave set up in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> For a year the screen would show how much power is left before needing a charge and it would let me know when I should use the turbo mode and rinse the head off (which I do every day anyway).  </li>
            <li> So far I like the shaver.</li>
            <li> My old Braun:    </li>
            <li> -loud  </li>
            <li> To counter that, i found the shave on my neck wasn&#x27;t quite as close as it was with my old braun.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old one (Braun 7526) and was amazed by the difference.</li>
            <li> Far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> &quot; Then they direct me to their parts site.</li>
            <li> really seems like I got a defective foil if it is supposed to last a year</li>
            <li> The noise it emits is a bit loud</li>
            <li> It seems gentle enough on the skin, although I&#x27;m still adjusting to it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t just let my mustache grow wild and spread out across my face.  </li>
            <li> Also like the option of having the head either fixed or floatng (\\&quot;soft\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give nearly as close a shave as the razor which probably accounts for the reduced irritation</li>
            <li> I didnt even really need the traditional - give it a month</li>
            <li> In fact its so close a shave Id recommend a soothing gel for those with sensitive skin.     </li>
            <li> This shaver completely blows the Brauns out of the water.</li>
            <li> I got This Machine after reading the reviews on it, I was looking for a solution to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna eat you alive</li>
            <li> But it takes nearly 5 minutes to do a complete shave, and it cannot shave as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> Since I found a terrific price for the whole unit ($114)</li>
            <li> did so much research online prior to buying this.  </li>
            <li> WOW is all I can say, the technology has come so far since that floating head Norelco that they STILL sell.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the closet shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The cleaner is similarly loud and runs for well over an hour when cleaning your razor</li>
            <li> He used to break out with his old razor and doesn&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li> WOW, my old Remington needed a charge every three days.</li>
            <li> completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 6 years using the same machine , decided to buy anew one in stead of replacing some parts, since it doesn&#x27;t ads up, so pay for anew one when you can ,thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> I did as much research as possible before I made the decision to purchase an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It cleans the shaver very well, but I usually only do it on the weekend</li>
            <li> However, when shaving chin &amp; goatee hair that&#x27;s longer than about 1 mm, you frequently feel the pain of hair being ripped off.</li>
            <li> Initially it worked very well</li>
            <li> I returned it for repair and they required me to ship the whole package back and charged a $46 fee.  </li>
            <li> This razor is loud.  </li>
            <li> probably because the old one was out of production now.</li>
            <li> would have had to send whole unit back for warranty.  </li>
            <li> What not recommend it because of having to send whole unit back.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 45 days, my beard grows back much quicker mid-day</li>
            <li> I still prefer a blade -- but this is a very close second.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IF, however, you&#x27;re like me and have extremely sensitive skin, this shaver has been a blessing.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how sensitive my skin is.</li>
            <li> That Sunday I got aggressive and shaved early in the morning and</li>
            <li> People at work noticed the difference because I&#x27;d be smooth and red one day, then fuzzy and red the next with my old bladed shaver.</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised I&#x27;ve had this for five years</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised I&#x27;ve had this for five years</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my uncle because he has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I always run it over soaped up skin and rinse it frequently during use...</li>
            <li> display is nice, having numbers rather than my old one just using a couple green LED lights and a yellow one when it got low.  </li>
            <li> display is nice, having numbers rather than my old one just using a couple green LED lights and a yellow one when it got low.  </li>
            <li> Waded through a lot of extra words in the instruction book to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing anything.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I have some good growth going when it&#x27;s time to go to work again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m willing to give Panasonic another try, but am hoping to find something a little less high-tech and hopefully more reliable.</li>
            <li> Although I have only used my new Panasonic 3 times thus far, to this point it is much better than my past Brauns, giving me a quicker shave, and a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> My beard orientation is going somehow from left to right especially on the neck.</li>
            <li> I compared this against the other Panasonic shavers, and the 8249 gave the best bang for the buck (a couple extra bells and whistles, without getting off-the-charts expensive).  </li>
            <li> I could easily unplug the stand, but I&#x27;d rather keep it plugged in so that I know that it is fully charged every morning (even though it only takes me 2 minutes to shave, so I never run down the battery).  </li>
            <li> I have found that customer feedback has been EXTREMELY accurate time and time again, and it is my duty to finally review this and other items for others.  </li>
            <li> First, he noticed the blades feel hotter when using it in the shower than when he uses it dry.</li>
            <li> I had owned a Braun 8595 Activator for the past 7 years and this Panasonic easily surpasses it on all areas.    </li>
            <li> I purchased this from another retailer due to free shaving mirror included in that purchase (same price).  </li>
            <li> I typically rinse the head in the sink and then run it through a full cleaning cycle once a week</li>
            <li> hoping I get a new one that actually does work, or live with it in a semi-broken state</li>
            <li> It cleans out all of the little hairs in the razor and leaves it smelling... clean.  </li>
            <li> I think it is the fast motor which makes it a little more audible that the my previous shavers but not too loud.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement shaver for my older Panasonic one which I purchased in 2007, but developed a short in the cleaning cradle after 5 years.  </li>
            <li> To make it quick I am knocking this down a point for the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Second time, not near as smooth, ended up using a regular razor to finish up the shave.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave very well and the products for clean are expensive and the second thing is that gets hot so fast</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive neck with problems shaving around my adam&#x27;s apple even with newer disposable razors or cartridge razors, and after my last infection my doctor told me that I would either have to blow dry my razors clean to reuse them or only use them once.  </li>
            <li> For the money at the special price I bought at , a little over 100 bucks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time or money on the hydro cleaner, just use liquid soap and water to clean.</li>
            <li> I switched to a Remington MS680CS for the past year and it was fine.</li>
            <li> I subsequently have to shave on my first day back on duty with a blade razor, as no electric is going to tackle 1/4 inch of course growth.</li>
            <li> I subsequently shave with a Gillette Mach 3 Turbo on the first day back on duty.</li>
            <li> A quick close shave with none of the burn associated with typical electric razors .  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve invested some extra money into decent pre and after-shaves.  </li>
            <li> provides a decent shave for daily usage.  </li>
            <li> your significant other would notice if the door is open.  </li>
            <li> What I ended up with were piles of plastic junk in my shower, because the razors don&#x27;t give a good quality shave after only a few uses; plus, I have a really sensitive face and no matter how slowly or carefully I shaved, I would ALWAYS cut or nick my face, then later would have ingrown hairs or something.</li>
            <li> Ok, if you can shave dry with a month old rusty Bic disposable razor, this shaver is still probably for you, but don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one, mainly because it was an amazon daily deal for $88 (can&#x27;t beat that)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was well packaged, easy to set up and charge (I love that it can be charged in the base or just with the cable), and I was ready to give it</li>
            <li> and wow... major difference...</li>
            <li> a high end Norelco that is a close second.</li>
            <li> I had gone from using whatever electrics my dad had during high school to using a blade to using a Braun Activator for the last 4 years.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor or the blue panasonic razor!  </li>
            <li> overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> matter how good the shave, no one wants to replace such an expensive item after only 15 months.</li>
            <li> I decided last Friday after my boss jokingly said \\&quot;wow your letting your beard come in huh\\&quot; that it was time to try something new.  </li>
            <li> I had anticipated it to be at least as good as my previous shavers</li>
            <li> unlike the Brawn that near required ear plugs so your ears wouldn&#x27;t be subjected to noise approaching that of a jet engine while trying to shave the side of your face, the buzz is low and very tolerable.  </li>
            <li> Second, I find the higher-pitched whine of the Panasonic is much easier on my ears than the lower buzz of the Braun  Third and unexpected: when I was using the Braun my beard stank.  </li>
            <li> My first electric shaver but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it woke up my wife because the cleaning cycle is pretty loud, but as long as I set it for after she leaves there is no problem.  </li>
            <li> I used to suffer from skin irritations and normally if I shave and find only one or two spot with blood</li>
            <li> I normally shave my head in the warmer months, and that will be my next venture with this razor.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a nicer travel bag than its lower model the 8109, but that to be expected given the higher price point.</li>
            <li> charging base works much better, is more programmable, and does not waste cleaner  </li>
            <li> The shaver provides an adequately close shave, with little effort.</li>
            <li> and I think this product gives me a smooth face and it only takes up a little bit of space.</li>
            <li> These types of products are tough to consider as we each have our own facial issues and desires.  </li>
            <li> This one is even better than all the previous ones, including Braun, Philips, and other Panasonic models.</li>
            <li> It is better than almost all other shavers I have previously owned.  </li>
            <li> at the end of day you have a lot more stubble coming back where as the panasonic still hardly anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and didn&#x27;t know if I needed the new features or the big difference between the $50 and $300 shaver.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping that I won&#x27;t have a similar issue with the new foil, but I will keep you updated.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that I won&#x27;t have a similar issue with the new foil, but I will keep you updated.</li>
            <li> I have been using this new shaver for several weeks now.  </li>
            <li> The Braun refills are around 10-12 dollars locally where I live.  </li>
            <li> That way I would get a new years supply ordered next year.  </li>
            <li> After about 3 months I received a brand new one of the current model.  </li>
            <li> Gives a clean shave wet or dry with no problems.</li>
            <li> This is a great product however when cutting neck hair it doesn&#x27;t seem to get close enough to hit everything.</li>
            <li> It shaves closest when used with shaving cream (or soap or gel or what-have-you), but it does shave very close and comfortably dry as well.  </li>
            <li> One blade has a wider opening to handle my coarse African American graying beard hairs, two regular blades handle the bulk of the shave, while a fourth finishing blade leaves your face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d estimate that it is probably better to replace the blades on the order of 6 to 8 months of daily shaving (at least for me).   </li>
            <li> I owned Norelco shavers up until about 2003, when I decided standing over the sink for a half hour going over and over one spot wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> With ten year old blades the older one still give a closer shave and has a larger trimmer.</li>
            <li> No matter what combination, my dang irritated neck would not be ready for the next shave any sooner than the 3rd day after.</li>
            <li> Actually, my husband likes it so much that we bought his dad one for a birthday present.</li>
            <li> only gripe i have is that it can not get the hair on my neck at all, i&#x27;m stuck using a regular razor for that, but i cant really blame that on the shaver since i&#x27;ve never had an electric that could do my neck</li>
            <li> The LCD communication is a good addition too, although the constant flashing seems a bit exaggerated.</li>
            <li> it was slow and required many strokes over the same area...</li>
            <li> I had always used rotary shavers, but my research suggested that foil shavers were best for people that shave everyday and don&#x27;t let their beard get especially thick.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a low end Remmington for $60 bucks, it was very loud.</li>
            <li> The shave is really close and a single shave for me is around 10% of charge(around 5-6 minutes).  </li>
            <li> Very fast charge and can last for 10 days for me on a single charge.</li>
            <li> Major improvement in coverage and closeness of shave.  </li>
            <li> Also, where my braun took me about 7 minutes to shave because I had to go over areas several times, I have only gone past 5 minutes once with the panasonic and most shaves</li>
            <li> Cuts the hair on my neck like no other.</li>
            <li> NO other electric shaver did the job.</li>
            <li> I tried it the first day dry and the second day with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I can now have a full shave in less than 3 minutes while with the Norelco I had to go over the same area over an over again</li>
            <li> I like the cleaning feature since I am too lazy to clean it otherwise.</li>
            <li> There was a slightly better shave with the wet gel, but only slightly.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard growth and while they were usually OK on the cheeks, they missed a lot of hairs on the neck and other areas.</li>
            <li> cleaning unit is larger overall than my old one, though not as tall - mine was shallower with a tall piece that could be extended up to fit the razor, and then collapsed back down after you were done.  </li>
            <li> I looked at several, but finally settled on the Panasonic ES8248S Arc IV, based on the sheer volume of positive reviews for this shaver.</li>
            <li> One little nitpick I have is that the lights on the razor illuminate roughly once a minute when it is fully charged and in its stand -- this tells you that it is at 100%, but given the nature of my bathroom, it is a little distracting when that bright LED blinks.  </li>
            <li> It was a little pricey, but if it lasts, then it will have been worth it.  </li>
            <li> dry mode is obviously less comfortable</li>
            <li> like I had several small cuts all over, in fact it felt just fine.  </li>
            <li> I have small, fine, blonde hairs on my ears and this thing took all of that off.</li>
            <li> The Charger/Cleaning unit charges quick, doing its job quietly and quicker than any previous model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The told me I could send the unit back to them at my own expense and if they found that the unit was indeed no good, they would replace it with a re-built unit!</li>
            <li> - The head is a little too big to fit in my upper lip region.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at the beginning as I had a Norelco which gave me a lot of irritation but the Panasonic is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> The display on the shaver tells you how much charge is left and how long it was used.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t think it will last as long.  </li>
            <li> Things I like: percentage of battery charge left displayed, can charge in the cleaner (while cleaning) or charge with the cord, wet or dry use, can clean while in the shower.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long the foil, blades, and cleaning solution last, it may no be much of a savings.</li>
            <li> The cleaning refills are also pretty expensive, and there is no substitute available.</li>
            <li> or you will need to grow a beard before you have it fixed back to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after seeing reviews in which the reviewers said it shaves nearly as close as a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> Even with frequent foil/blade replacements, the shave was only \\&quot;so - so\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about replacing your blades or old shavers, this is definitely the model you want to look into and purchase.</li>
            <li> But, my sensitive skin would turn red when I shaved with a blade.  </li>
            <li> but it appears I can only do so directly from Panasonic,</li>
            <li> wet should be a real</li>
            <li> wet should be a real treat.      </li>
            <li> My last Braun 8000 series shaver, over 7 years old, still works but the cleaning system died.</li>
            <li> Where the product really shines, however, is when used as a wet shaver in the shower.</li>
            <li> , only cleaning is giving me an error), and the manual is completely unclear about what the problem is and how to resolve it.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station works similar to my old braun&#x27;s, and i have no complaints.    </li>
            <li> I used a Braun shaver for about 7 years, and even though I replaced all the vital parts, it never shaved the mustache area properly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unbearably loud, but you can hear it if you&#x27;re in the next room over.</li>
            <li> The self cleaner buzzes loud enough that you should do the self cleaning when you&#x27;re not home.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic cleaning cartridges are supposed to last 30 days whether you use them or not, and I&#x27;ve also read that people that don&#x27;t use them daily can make them last much longer.  </li>
            <li> I had read reviews where people talked about how loud this was, but I find it to be very quiet compared to the Brauns and Norelcos</li>
            <li> when my 5 yr old braun NEVER ripped out my facial hair).    </li>
            <li> On my old rotary head shavers, the only thing you&#x27;d have to replace is the rotary head blades.</li>
            <li> On my old rotary head shavers, the only thing you&#x27;d have to replace is the rotary head blades.</li>
            <li> It is really quiet compared to my old Braun 7000.  </li>
            <li> then my ten year old Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t terribly loud, but you definitely notice it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li> After trying five different electric shavers and returning them all I was nearly defeated in my search.  </li>
            <li> The cartridges have to be exchanged frequently, and it&#x27;s not only the money aspect, it&#x27;s the effort/maintenance that&#x27;s required.  </li>
            <li> It worked well, but pinched me too much and gave me cuts (I now know this was because I was using it wet).</li>
            <li> Shave not as close as traditional razor, but not too far off.</li>
            <li> In this facet the Panasonic barely outperforms the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough how sensitive my face is...</li>
            <li> If it was too old it would do the same thing.</li>
            <li> It cleans easier than washing a wine glass; it shaves as close as a gillette razor blade without the harsh \\&quot;after-feeling\\&quot; and is simply worth every penny of the cost.</li>
            <li> Same drill, slow and requiring many trips over the same area...</li>
            <li> After perusing several sites dedicated to electric razor reviews (and I do mean several), I came up with the conclusion that I might indeed be able to get a close shave with the convenience of an electric.</li>
            <li> Second, his facial hair grows in all different directions and he has more trouble using this flat type to get to all the hairs than he did with the 3-circle shaver.  </li>
            <li> I live in the UK but got this item delivered to a local US address and collected the item later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting for the new unit now (Panasonic won&#x27;t repair personal products, only replacement if under warranty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally I do not use electric razors, they are so slow and leave even worse irritation than blades, but this shaver is fast, shaves close and leaves skin great without any cuts or bumps.  </li>
            <li> It took less than 3 weeks for the whole return process, I sent the old one on Apr 18th and I received a replacement on May 6th.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean in the shower, I did put the cleaner in the base but have yet to use it.</li>
            <li> The charger cleaner was dead in the water right out of the Box.</li>
            <li> Even though all of the reviews highly rated this shaver, and a few highly praised the unit, I never expected the results that I have.  </li>
            <li> He said that the ONLY thing that is difficult is shaving his neck (all the curves are a bit hard to get), but I am sure he will get more used to it in time.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver for guys especially who have different types of facial and neck hair.</li>
            <li> So far all shaves have been done every other day, with the first two being dry.     </li>
            <li> It could be due to the fact that my face is still getting used to the shaver, but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between this shaver and my 20-something-year-old 3-head Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I will not be upgrading  to any other electric shaver I have since picked up straight blade shaving</li>
            <li> I have used a few electric shavers in the past and this is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> By no means does the Panasonic make me want to shave, but the morning &#x27;little tiny hair&#x27; removal drill is now quick and relatively noiseless.    </li>
            <li> Also, this is not a single pass shaver, but I spend 3 minutes between shaving and cleaning shaving, during my shower.    </li>
            <li> purchased a few of these, so far so good, a little bit expensive for me, but worth it.</li>
            <li> If I had to say anything negative about this shaver, It is that their tech support people really don&#x27;t know much about the product.  </li>
            <li> The panasonic is loud and that is the only draw back would say.</li>
            <li> For the last 7 years I&#x27;ve been using a Gillette Mach 3 razor, with regular old shaving gel...</li>
            <li> Makes it larger and deeper, which annoys me as far as cleaning goes, because whereas my last one I could pull out in two sections, the metal foil itself, and then the plastic housing, this all comes as one piece.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the cost for a set of replacement blades and microscreen, which I would consider to be worth much less than 10% of the shaver, actually costs 35% of the total purchase price.  </li>
            <li> This was the last one I would try and I was and still am blown away nearly six months later.    </li>
            <li> My first reaction was to contact customer support and see if they would replace this because it was a little over 2 months</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Norelco user, but recently was dissappointed after trying a new Arcitec model.</li>
            <li> Even with \\&quot;Electric shaver liquid\\&quot; it is better than dry but not good.</li>
            <li> is so smooth and so easy, its sad to think of all the money and time I have wasted over the years on traditional shaving products.  </li>
            <li> I hardly use the cleaner though, only when I need to charge every two to three weeks, the rest of the time I just clean it under water with liquid soap, which works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is supposed to have 4 blades, but there are only 2 apparent.  </li>
            <li> Length of time for complete cleaning and charging cycle is quite long.  </li>
            <li> I was hopeful that a shave like this was possible for me, but i never expected it.</li>
            <li> It does miss a few hairs on the first pass</li>
            <li> It took several days to get the grain of my beard growth down, but after that my shaves&#x27;s are better than any I have had in the past.    </li>
            <li> A couple times in between I tried a few norelcos, but always took them right back as I was irritated and the ingrown hairs were back again.  </li>
            <li> Shortly after buying the second, the first one started blinking oddly and then quit.</li>
            <li> Even does a decent job on the neck which my other electrics never did.</li>
            <li> Probably the only thing I don&#x27;t like about the Arc IV is its pop-up razor, as it feels a little flimsy and easily pops back down while I am using it.</li>
            <li> With a classic shaver I couldn&#x27;t shave the right part of my neck without irritating it.   </li>
            <li> The shave I get when I use it dry is nearly as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> the fan it uses to dry the razor after a cleaning is almost obnoxiously loud.</li>
            <li> I never really liked using an electric, but I&#x27;m a pretty busy stay-at-home dad and there are days I just don&#x27;t have time to shave.  </li>
            <li> Didnt bother me too much until I went back and realized what I paid for this with its fancy cleaning system, yikes, not worth it, dont know what i was thinking.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a shave that is uneven, it leaves small hairs all over your face that it cant seem to shave off, no matter how many times you go over it.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about taking advantage of the \\&quot;wet shave\\&quot; feature, but after trying it only twice, I am now a true convert.  </li>
            <li> It is a little narrower than the braun, but works just as well and the large head does not hamper me from using it at all.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the fact that I can use a wet shaving cream, At this point I am not sure of the shave results vs regular blade, however the instructions say to wait 30 days for your beard to adjust.</li>
            <li> it never fails - smells like a dead dog or old wet towel, take your pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I purchased a new cartridge, read the instructions (again) carefully and started the next cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t dread shaving (although I do skip the weekends usually, but this baby picks right up on Sunday when I attack my muzzle...</li>
            <li> It works very well and causes little to no irritation.</li>
            <li> You can really hear all of the little hairs being cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little empathy toward a customer would have been appreciated.</li>
            <li> particularly my neck; it requiring up and down and side-way strokes to eventually rid my neck of hair.    </li>
            <li> The shaver&#x27;s head is large and shaped such that I have some trouble shaving up to my sideburns and under my nose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My first try of the razor was a dry run, I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the wet shave in the shower, if it worked as well as it did dry...</li>
            <li> My first try of the razor was a dry run, I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the wet shave in the shower, if it worked as well as it did dry...</li>
            <li> The charging/cleaning base has given me an error red light twice while cleaning (charging &amp; drying have been fine</li>
            <li> It charges fine from both the base and just direct from the power cord and a charge sees me through a weeks worth of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some good, some bad.  </li>
            <li> But I think the whine, due to a vibration technology, cuts through long and short beard differently than the older styles.</li>
            <li> The past few electric razors I have owned lasted two weeks or more on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> i first used it dry on a few days growth.</li>
            <li> Even with my new blades, the other Panasonic took longer to get my head smooth, especially when I was lazy and hadn&#x27;t shaved it for a few days and it was getting longer.  </li>
            <li> Even with my new blades, the other Panasonic took longer to get my head smooth, especially when I was lazy and hadn&#x27;t shaved it for a few days and it was getting longer.  </li>
            <li> At least this one cuts right away</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver and the two other items listed under the \\&quot;Frequently bought together\\&quot; section.  </li>
            <li> The only couple of problems I can see is that the cleaning process is pretty loud and as I have a pretty thick beard, I have trouble getting a few stray neck hairs here and there.  </li>
            <li> Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Black]], the new Wet/Dry Shaver with Ultra-thin Vibrating Outer Foil and Nanotech(tm) Blades.  </li>
            <li> I have small asian hair and it works really well around the cheeks and mouth.</li>
            <li> This has worked well for the first year, but now \\&quot;loses its mind\\&quot; occasionally to the point where the display produces gibberish.  </li>
            <li> As others wrote, I thought that paying the higher price for this shaver would bring me quality that would last at least 3 years.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t get it to shave close enough, and it takes me twice as long to get the same shave I had with my Braun.</li>
            <li> I like the timer and the estimated time/battery left, although if I go by that it looks like the battery won&#x27;t last as long as the Braun would.</li>
            <li> I am the type of customer that usually does a thorough analysis on certain purchases I make.</li>
            <li> You do have to make several passes to get a close shave, but owing to the wet/dry feature my skin is smoother and un-irritated as it would be with a blade or dry only electric.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my beard grows quickly and my neck is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> It usually takes me 4 minutes for a very close shave.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding razor that provides a terrific close and comfortable shave, with or without the base!</li>
            <li> Just need to see how long it last.</li>
            <li> Ni Cads can last a really long time if taken care of.  </li>
            <li> This is just a minor nuisance in my book; just pointing it out to others since that&#x27;s the only drawback I&#x27;ve seen with this shaver.    </li>
            <li> I have been a long time consumer of Norelco and have had 3 or 4 different models.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to go through the cartridge.</li>
            <li> Long story short, they basically told me that the amazon purchase receipt was not a receipt.</li>
            <li> The cleaning cartridges don&#x27;t last as long as they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave electrics flat</li>
            <li> We will see how long the heads and cutters last.</li>
            <li> I will not risk being stuck with another defective product they will not stand behind with any level of true customer service.products from going forward, and a company I will never trust or buy anything from again, is how that company deals with these situations.</li>
            <li> I will not risk being stuck with another defective product they will not stand behind with any level of true customer service.</li>
            <li> Having to replace the blades 2-3 times per year makes this a very expensive razor to own.</li>
            <li> I was a little upset to hear that they had the policy of replacing new defective parts with re-built units.</li>
            <li> I keep the unit out of the base until it is ready for a recharge and then do a full clean cycle when that happens (usually lasts for about 2 weeks of charge with 5 minutes shaving 5-6 days a week).  </li>
            <li> The dry shave doesn&#x27;t really work for me, so I lather it up using foam or even just plain water</li>
            <li> (will the cleaning cycle function break down completely soon as the heating unit did?).</li>
            <li> I got my father&#x27;s old Norelco hand me down,</li>
            <li> Pulling the skin away from the direction it grows (e.g. pull up on your skin near your cheek since your hair points down) helps the shaver get closer.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong its fast enough for what I want it to do, I just think since you have another blade you should have a bit faster motor to move the other additional blade right?  </li>
            <li> I bought extra soap cartridges based on input from other reviews, I now have a stockpile because a little liquid soap and water also cleans it very well between charges.</li>
            <li> The only con is the \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; is a little on the loud side.</li>
            <li> Use as recommend by Panasonic 30 days straight, I know its hard to do especially if you don&#x27;t work or shave on the weekends but trust me it helps your face get used to it.</li>
            <li> What I learned from this purchase is Higher vibration rate doesnt mean faster or closer shave.</li>
            <li> B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Silver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was skeptical after using several other electrics over the years (mostly Braun)</li>
            <li> that comes with buying a new razor so it should stop in a few days.</li>
            <li> They say to give your skin a few weeks to adjust to the new electric shaver</li>
            <li> I have been using the dry shave method daily since purchasing the razor.  </li>
            <li> -only dry shaves    </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 31 Aug 2013 - less than 2 years old, and the cleaning unit went belly up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 31 Aug 2013 - less than 2 years old, and the cleaning unit went belly up.  </li>
            <li> Now I am trying to run the cleaning and dry cycle only 2 times per week, mixing in a razor cut 1 tme a week to reuce the usage and try to prolong the life.</li>
            <li> Zero irritation and that is only using it dry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the irritation, and if I use it dry, I get a terrific shave!</li>
            <li> The entire cleaning process takes a mere minute from start to finish, and leaves it perfectly clean for the next shave.</li>
            <li> I called up Panasonic and since I had 2 months left on the two year warranty they asked me to ship the entire unit with accessories to their Texas service center.</li>
            <li> -Shaves 90% of hair on the first swipe, with very thick and coarse facial hair  </li>
            <li> My Phillips, even after 4 years, could hold a single charge for almost an entire month.</li>
            <li> (I was skeptical since just about every other brand uses alcohol for cleaning) and for my super sensitive skin  the shaver doesn&#x27;t need rinsed prior to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> Not very professional, but this is the way it was for me for 20+ years.    </li>
            <li> The Braun was LOUD, the base station wouldn&#x27;t clean it unless I taped it down because the vibrations would unseat it from the contacts, and the shave was never as close as I had hoped, often having to go over spots several times until the head got hot.</li>
            <li> The included cleaner works well but is slow (about an hour and a half to clean and dry).  </li>
            <li> shaver was working fine, but then it stopped charging randomly.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the low quality available in women&#x27;s razors and wanted something that provided a close shave in less time.  </li>
            <li> My other one had the cleaning cartridge in the front, this one in the back, but they use the same one</li>
            <li> It is a little loud so not something you would start before bed time.</li>
            <li> The cleaning mode is a LITTLE loud, but no louder than the razor itself.</li>
            <li> Noise level is less than my other one as well, without sacrificing any of the high speed.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like for this particular model is that the motor is a bit slow.</li>
            <li> This one was very highly rated on consumer reports and it works well with a few passes and a little trimming up with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> It shaves very close in all parts of the face as well as the hard to get areas under your chin.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t logo before the blades seem to get dull and it took much longer to shave.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic requires a little container on the back replenished with tap water and a tiny cleaning fluid cartridge placed under the unit.   </li>
            <li> The doctor recommended that I avoid shaving with a sharp blade -- at least for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Since I did not want to grow a beard, I looked for an electric that could be easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and hard facial hair, and that resulted in \\&quot;tired\\&quot; skin with occasional rashes and redness when using Gillette&#x27;s blades.</li>
            <li> The only downside as far as I could see is that it&#x27;s hard to find the replacement cleaning cartridges in the local Target or Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> It does take a long time for the cleaning cycle and it is a bit noisy, so don&#x27;t do it before going  to bed if it&#x27;s close by.</li>
            <li> long years I am using it.   </li>
            <li> A small cut from a normal razor can cause a lot of bleeding.  </li>
            <li> It works brilliantly as a wet shave too with a standard shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Minor downsides:</li>
            <li> Even, after two times shaving there are some long hair on my face or some areas not shaved.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is long.  </li>
            <li> The trimmmer attachment is kinda crappy, not very secures and tends to snap back with even slightest amount of pressure</li>
            <li> -took a long time  </li>
            <li> For my third shave, i decided to pick up some Aveeno shaving gel and take a shot at a wet shave.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much different the Panasonic is when shaving wet.</li>
            <li> I know this was quite a long post,</li>
            <li> The past five years I had been using a normal razor and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Gives close shave that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Been using the shaver for a few months now and so far no problem.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of electric razors for a long time now, ever since I had a dorm room without a sink - buying</li>
            <li> Owned Brauns for as long as I can remember...</li>
            <li> At around 10% charge on it, took a couple passes which is expected at that low of a battery.</li>
            <li> The cleaning is not loud and doesn&#x27;t take an hour.</li>
            <li> and my face was smoother than I can remember in a long time.    </li>
            <li> As long as you wash/dry the razor</li>
            <li> You only use a drop of the shave gel per shave so the cost is minimal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on this shaver 100% and plan on keeping it for as long as it</li>
            <li> I only shave wet in the shower with nivea gel.</li>
            <li> If you are anything like me and have sensitive skin and coarse, thick facial hair, then this razor is what you have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Also got tired of trying to cram the small can of shaving cream in the ziploc bag at airport security and having it take up most of the bag.  </li>
            <li> good price as the top-line panasonic shaver with charging / cleaning base.</li>
            <li> Then I discovered the Panasonic series, and found this model at a good price point, and it included a cleaning base.    </li>
            <li> The cleaning base works good</li>
            <li> I previously owned a more expensive Braun shaver, but this shaver gives a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> Have not tried it wet, but irritation level is low shaving dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the lower model Panasonic 8109 and it only has three blades, so having an extra blade cuts it closer for me and in less passes.</li>
            <li> I have previously had several brands of shavers including earlier versions of Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Shaving dry is about 85% as close as using a razor and no cuts, and wet is about 92% as close as using a razor with some occasional cuts.  </li>
            <li> The base may be useful if you really do not have 5 min to clean it under the tap every day.</li>
            <li> The blades are extra sharp.</li>
            <li> The key between a company I will buy other products from going forward, and a company I will never trust or buy anything from again, is how that company deals with these situations.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be widespread since I can&#x27;t find any other reviews with the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself</li>
            <li> An added bonus is; since it&#x27;s such a close shave I don&#x27;t get the five &#x60;clock shadow I did with the other two brands.</li>
            <li> It was OK but buying the foils, cutter blocks, cleaner, and other expensive maintenance items seemed endless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco as well as other electric razors.  </li>
            <li> As long as you shave every day, this shaver will not disappoint!</li>
            <li> If you want a CLOSE shave, like any other shaver it will take time, stretching the skin and multiple passes.</li>
            <li> I gave up on them a long time ago and had shaved with blades and foam exclusively from around my early twenties until my mid to late thirties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> I looked at the different options and ended up choosing the Panasonic due to the wet/dry shave ability.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare it with any other recent one.</li>
            <li> Look for other versions of the same razor which don&#x27;t include the system.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have noted, the cleaning cycle is noisy and the shaver itself turns on and off numerous times during the cycle, so I tend to run it when I&#x27;m planning on leaving.</li>
            <li> The shave I get with the Braun is a little better than the Panasonic (sorry).  </li>
            <li> My reason for purchasing it was because my 4 year old Phillips Norelco was starting to get dull</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts very long, charged it three weeks ago</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive throat skin and a very heavy beard  </li>
            <li> It takes a very long time to process.  </li>
            <li> Also the battery does not keep its charge very long when not in use.</li>
            <li> I prefer to sleep in as late as I can in the morning, and for a long time a plain old razor shave at night before bed was enough to get me through the next day, but it required a shower or lengthy facial wash (or a lot of pain).  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic is bone dry.</li>
            <li> With the ES8249, I can dry shave and get close to what I can achieve with a razor.</li>
            <li> I tested using it in the shower and dry and did not see the difference.</li>
            <li> The Braun was a dry shaver</li>
            <li> This one works perfectly, dry.  </li>
            <li> so it could dry.</li>
            <li> The dry shave with this unit is inferior to the dry</li>
            <li> After using the razor dry, I found I still had an unacceptable amount of hair around my neck, and started researching pre-electric lotions.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of days I started to use an electric shave lotion with it, so it&#x27;s an almost dry shave.</li>
            <li> It is ofter difficult to get the shaver into &#x27;clean&#x27; mode.  </li>
            <li> with a shaver v/s blade was a bit of a transition, but after you&#x27;ve used it for a while dry shaving is \\&quot;OK\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Shave (dry) was about 70% as close as using a razor.  </li>
            <li> Shave (dry) was about 55% as close as using a razor.  </li>
            <li> Shake off and let dry.</li>
            <li> I am after the dry shave.  </li>
            <li> it sounded unusual for this part to break, but refused to send me the replacement unit before I send back the broken one.</li>
            <li> to preface this - I&#x27;ve ordered multiple things on amazon over the last few years, based on customer feedback.</li>
            <li> shave is close but you may miss a few hairs and occasionally have to go back over areas on your face.  </li>
            <li> For those reviewers that say it&#x27;s not needed - - Well yes, it&#x27;s not needed, but it works for the shaver -- meaning, it&#x27;s cleaned and dried properly so the blades last longer...</li>
            <li> I used this for over 2 years of active duty and never heard a word about my shave not being close enough.</li>
            <li> FOR YEARS, THIS BLOWS THAT TOTALLY AWAY!!!&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE THICK OLD BEARD,</li>
            <li> For some reason, either the blades don&#x27;t vibrate fast enough or you&#x27;re supposed to go REALLY slow over 3-4 days growth...because it literally rips the odd hair out of your face.  </li>
            <li> I would wholeheartedly recommend this product to those who have sensitive skin with thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try something different and the cleaning base was a nice enticement.  </li>
            <li> As a serious sufferer of skin irritation I gave this shaver a try based on Amazon&#x27;s reviews, and wow!!!</li>
            <li> The charge basin clogs up very easily and can result in a dirty mess (hair+detergent+dirty water goo).   </li>
            <li> I get about 8-9 days of shaving with one single charge.   </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a single hair pull at any length (up to 2-3 mm) with the Panasonic.     </li>
            <li> I always used conventional razors, albeit finally thought</li>
            <li> The only shortcoming I find with the razor is the pop out trimmer which is a little disappointing, glad I have a hand trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is short but dark.  </li>
            <li> A victim of fashion.  </li>
            <li> So I pretty much gave up shaving for a while, cutting it down to once a week.</li>
            <li> Shower takes care of any loose clippings.</li>
            <li> Also, I had spent approx 5-8 minutes shaving (dry) with the Remington and now spend approx 2-3 minutes (dry) with the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> He loves it and we will never go back to any other razor!</li>
            <li> the head didn&#x27;t get hot, and I didn&#x27;t have to push hard in some trouble areas like I would with the Braun.</li>
            <li> feels better in my hand  less expensive to maintain with the cleaning stuff  HALF THE PRICE OF BRAUN    Con:  </li>
            <li> and I could do it dry!</li>
            <li> The one bought last summer for me as a gift seems to have noticeably less power already.  </li>
            <li> Both wet &amp; dry</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES8249S from Amazon.com at almost half the price found in local stores.</li>
            <li> Wet, dry, longer or shorter hair, etc.  </li>
            <li> I tested both dry since the Braun will not shave a wet face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both wet and dry and this shaver works well in both environments.</li>
            <li> I usually shave every day, but I have noticed that if I miss a few days the shave is still fast and the quality is not diminished.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair short and usually shave about 3/8\\&quot; above my ears.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor on a daily deal from amazon for less than $100.</li>
            <li> Even after a blade shave and   multiple passes, I would still end up with a slightly scratchy stubble my wife would complain about.  </li>
            <li> When I got it and started using it, it was definitely a closer shave than my three previous Norelco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t shaved for a week hair rather long, but not a problem the shaver cut with ease cut closer than expected and gave me minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> The only thing that seems odd to me is that when the shaver is done charging, it continuously flashes the display every two seconds - it never goes into standby mode.</li>
            <li> You can use this wet or dry.</li>
            <li> almost feels like I am in my back in my 16-17 when you used to have less or even no beard at all...</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is WET and DRY</li>
            <li> In comes the Braun 380s wet or dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal; I just generally have to be slow and careful when using it.    </li>
            <li> Just for context, I am a picky shaver (one who shaves) with sensitive skin and a round, slightly chubby face.</li>
            <li> I do really like the base as it helps keep the the blades both clean and sharp (by virtue of cleanliness).</li>
            <li> - I wish it was a little larger.  </li>
            <li> I have always been an opponent for an electric razor for a number of reasons, biggest one is that I have sensitive skin and without pressing really hard on my face, never seemed to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> And by extremely sensitive, I mean I get razor burn 2-3 times per week only because I was down to shaving every other day to try to keep my skin under control.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the cleaner does clog up now and then, but a simple rinse takes care of that.  </li>
            <li> So I contact them back asking if 2 months is a common amount of time for this foil to last.</li>
            <li> The second one that this is replacing, only because I dropped it, had lasted at least 15 years and always a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how long they really last yet.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have found is that I cannot find the refill blades or cleaning cartridges locally.  </li>
            <li> Some have complained about water damage, but I don&#x27;t believe the unit is meant to be used in the shower or to be completely rinsed.  </li>
            <li> He cannot wait to use it wet.  </li>
            <li> I have a somewhat narrow face, without much extra flesh on it.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that with my narrower/oval face that I the head would be too wide for me to use well.  </li>
            <li> My second one which was only 1 1/2 years old had the battery fail.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the Panasonic wet yet.</li>
            <li> I use the Neutrogena shave lotion that comes in a tube when I use the razor wet.</li>
            <li> I do not really see a need for the self cleaning station but</li>
            <li> The cleaning/recharge station still functions as expected.</li>
            <li> Like, I drowned out my neighbor&#x27;s weed eater while shaving.</li>
            <li> Not really a con, but</li>
            <li> I have found that under the jaw line wrapping onto my neck, I still have some rough stubble after shaving with the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> When used wet with gel</li>
            <li> -wet</li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t shave every day, shaving might become harder, because it doesn&#x27;t always cut longer hairs.</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews I bought this Panasonic a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing like the feel of a wet close shave.</li>
            <li> I believe the cleaning base was partially a culprit in this, and I will most likely be doing</li>
            <li> I believe the cleaning base was partially a culprit in this, and I will most likely be doing self cleaning form hear on out.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try a wet shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military and need to shave every day...</li>
            <li> Though, in all honesty, it does take a bit longer on the head than it does using a razor, but not much</li>
            <li> that I always shave &#x27;wet&#x27; with a gel.  </li>
            <li> have groomed Nicki Minaj&#x27;s Calico and dyed her hair pink with platinum to give it that bling.</li>
            <li> The quality of the shaver feels solid, not cheap.</li>
            <li> Minus:    </li>
            <li> I use it roughly every three to four days and can finish shaving in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have only used an electric razor a few times before purchasing this one.</li>
            <li> Probably not if door is closed.    </li>
            <li> Since the Arc IV can be used with shaving gel or on a wet face, it solves the problem.</li>
            <li> However , it doesn&#x27;t work very well with my neck hair, being that they&#x27;re really thin.   </li>
            <li> I used to be in the military</li>
            <li> I do occasionally use a razor blade to remove a few whiskers under my chin.</li>
            <li> I use it as a wet razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It will last a few shaves, but will not work while plugged into the wall.</li>
            <li> Every wet shave electric</li>
            <li> The display is also wearing out, the center section isn&#x27;t readable at all</li>
            <li> The display is also wearing out, the center section isn&#x27;t readable at all</li>
            <li> No real complaints.</li>
            <li> spent the money I spent because I trusted Panasonic quality, and was under the false belief they offered reasonable customer service.</li>
            <li> I sent my old razor into forced retirement and ordered this razor as a replacement.  </li>
            <li> sure enough I hate all electric razors.</li>
            <li> Slow in the sense that the same 3 Blade Razor (8109) uses the same motor.</li>
            <li> everytime you use it, it should be as nice as using the charging base.  </li>
            <li> I have been a long time Brawn user, the last one failed to improve in performance even with a new cutter block and foil.</li>
            <li> I was a long time Braun user, my Braun Pulsonic had a broken trimmer and it was time to get a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> Before I purchased this shaver I noticed that other people had similar problems but their posts were old enough that I thought these had been resolved, guess I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> The only problem (hardly a problem) with cleaning it this way is that you have to lay all of the parts out to dry for a couple of hours; even drying the pieces off with a towel, you cannot immediately recombine the parts because they won&#x27;t dry correctly.</li>
            <li> It has problems with stiff course facial hair</li>
            <li> year and a half out, I can further add that the solution to the shaver falling over is to place it handle side down into the cleaner.  </li>
            <li> -cleaner/charger spring that held the razor down broke forcing me to tape it down to clean  -expensive cleaning solution  </li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and a wet shave avoids the razor burns of other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like the low charge warning where the razor actually starts to slow down without stopping.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, I have very delicate skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually just ordered my second one from Amazon today because after over a year and a half, my old charging/cleaning base has developed a leak and it&#x27;s not completely drying the shaver either.</li>
            <li> If the gel I apply starts to dry on a part of my face, (when completing side A and moving to side B) I simply wet my hand, splash on just a little water, and finish up without any problem.</li>
            <li> Just gives you a little idea of how long I&#x27;ve been using electrics and exclusively for that matter.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking to replace an existing one or leave the razor behind.</li>
            <li> They say it takes about 30 days for your face to get used to a new style of shave, which is unfortunate because the return policy only lasts 30 days.  </li>
            <li> and after reading reviews that looked like there were at least a few people in the same boat as I am (of course all the other high end shavers have similar reviews, but the price here was tough to walk away</li>
            <li> I have always used Braun shavers but thought I would give this one a try due to reviews and recomendation from a friend.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This is probably due to it&#x27;s floating T shaped head...</li>
            <li> It definately shaves closer than the other electrics that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars due to cleaning system  5.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for any other competitor electric shavers as I haven&#x27;t used them, but I can tell you that this product is garbage and buyers</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews on this shaver I figured I had nothing to lose-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be buying another one for my other house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple different Norelco&#x27;s and have tried a Braun shaver in the past.</li>
            <li> Gets closer than any other electric I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have replaced the blades and screen twice (but am not sure that is was necessary</li>
            <li> this shaver makes all the other electric shavers out there seem like \\&quot;rotary telephones.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but this shaves closer and quicker than any other I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need the razor - the Panasonic cuts extremely close.  </li>
            <li> It even gets the small wiskers next to the nostrils.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s louder comparing with my other brands.  </li>
            <li> So this year the braun starting not holding a charge and seeming \\&quot;weaker\\&quot; than usual.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews talk about it being noisy, but I dont see it as a problem.</li>
            <li> Yes, as other reviewers have stated, it is somewhat noisy during it&#x27;s cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li> this one or one of the other Panasonic shavers is for you.</li>
            <li> (my beard was too long to be shaved in one round) , and it gave me a skin irritation</li>
            <li> At first I thought something was wrong, but the manual says this is what it does when the unit is done charging.</li>
            <li> - The location of the on/off switch relative to how I hold the shaver ... the way it fits my hand, I usually end up accidentally turning the shaver off twice a week while shaving.     </li>
            <li> I think people were just naggin in other reviews.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaver I have owned that shaves all parts of my face and neck without having to use an accessory for the difficult places.</li>
            <li> This shaver cuts closer than any other electric I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Replacement blades are comparable in price to other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaning system cartridges are pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li> Noise is in between the other two.</li>
            <li> to hear what the other compliants had said.</li>
            <li> I used to shave every other day while using a razor, but used to get cuts every now and then.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers, however, that the cleaning system included with this version of the razor</li>
            <li> i was getting lazy about shaving daily.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough, white beard and very soft skin.  </li>
            <li> After letting it dry thoroughly and scraping/brushing away the corroded areas (including a little damage on the circuit board)</li>
            <li> an electric meant I could shave without hoping whether the bathroom down the hall was empty or not.  </li>
            <li> And it still works fine, but the charging/cleaning base (which I used daily) no longer works.</li>
            <li> is very minimal.</li>
            <li> For a week I shaved half of my face and chest dry with the Panasonic and the other half in the   shower with Nivea Gel.  </li>
            <li> Then I got tired of the level of stubble I had at night and decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just gotten harder every so slightly over time.   </li>
            <li> the readout screen stopped giving me accurate information, all it gives now is total time used and the power bar is totally worthless, it never gives out the correct power remaining level.  </li>
            <li> Being in the military, I typically shave 5x a week.  </li>
            <li> and it not very good quality overall.</li>
            <li> other reviewer said that the cleaning station is not worth it.</li>
            <li> First, the model ES8249 was less expensive now than the Braun was 2.5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> The removable foil and cover seems a little flimsy - handle carefully.</li>
            <li> While i acknowledge that skin and beard types vary, for my combo of tough beard and sensitive skin, I prefer a Norelco shave to that of the Panasonic when using an electric.    </li>
            <li> The base shows no indication it is receiving electrical current: the lights don&#x27;t come on, the shaver won&#x27;t recharge, and the cleaning system won&#x27;t clean.</li>
            <li> According to him, it shaves closer than any other razor he has ever used and it takes less time to do it.  </li>
            <li> Probably the biggest drawback is the size of the shaving head, which makes it hard to shave around and above my mustache.  </li>
            <li> I have a skinny face and protruding adams apple, which made it hard for me to shave around my jawline/neck without nicking myself with a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to tell how the blade technology is different from anything that came before it.  </li>
            <li> This poor little girl in Tanzania, was on her second week of learning English.  </li>
            <li> He only voiced two minor complaints, but neither was bad enough for him to send it back.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic was at least on a par with the Fusion and totally blew away the Arcitec.  </li>
            <li> The shave was not much better than my 2 year old Norelco for my beard, and the cleaning procedure sounded too complex.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> The only negative with this unit is the hair trimmer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT a fresh lemony smell my Braun 360 used to have after cleaning.  </li>
            <li> However, the only thing I would say could be viewed as a negative is the amount of noise it makes when it&#x27;s self-cleaning.</li>
            <li> but if you dont at least put it on \\&quot;dry\\&quot; (or \\&quot;clean\\&quot;) it gets gross.</li>
            <li> Give this one a try, you absolutely will not be sorry.  </li>
            <li> My beard is not overly heavy, so I&#x27;m not sure why it doesn&#x27;t last closer to a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beard is not overly heavy, so I&#x27;m not sure why it doesn&#x27;t last closer to a month.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product since December 2010 and have used it on average 3 times a week</li>
            <li> I have avoided electric shavers for years because of my sensitive skin and poor quality of electric shaves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do have to make a few passes and for me 5-7 minutes is not unusual at all.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> My beard hair tends to be thick, grow in every which direction possible, and be a bit oily.  </li>
            <li> , even my trouble spots (behind the back of the jaw and next to my adam&#x27;s apple).</li>
            <li> The only negative so far is that the shaver gives off an extrely loud, high pitch hum that is very annoying around the ears and downright painful if you use it to keep the ear lobes free of unwanted hairs.</li>
            <li> To put it in perspective, when I shave with the Fusion razor, I shave both with and against the grain (e.g. down and then up on the sides of my face)</li>
            <li> I have use the Norelco rotary shavers that have been hand me downs as well as a hand me down foil razor</li>
            <li> When the battery (which I treated well) on it was down to about 3-4 days use</li>
            <li> and i used it maybe 5 times before it ran down to 10% power</li>
            <li> Take it on a camping trip down the Colorado river and you won&#x27;t worry about breaking it.</li>
            <li> So here is the break down of the pros and cons:    </li>
            <li> One of the reasons I wanted to try this and see if it worked like alot of reviewers say was to cut down on shaving time</li>
            <li> The price difference is over $150 compared to buying it in the store or other online shops!</li>
            <li> I have always been skeptical about electronic shavers since they tend to be a little too rough on the skin, with that said i have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Shorter than it takes me to shave with the Fusion (and much less messier) and way, way shorter than with the Arcitec (about 1/4 of the time).  </li>
            <li> No signs of skin irritation on my neck (typical with the Arcitec) or my face.    </li>
            <li> closer, faster shave with much less pressure and work.  </li>
            <li> I get 5 or so shaves per charge, and charging time is much less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Previous to using the Panasonic, I used Mach3 blades.</li>
            <li> My skin is slightly oily, so I do not need the lubrication.  </li>
            <li> For those who do not care about the Vortex cleaner, I recommend the ES8243 for less money.  </li>
            <li> Shaves closer than the Braun and less irritation than either of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I give the Braun a slight edge for self-cleaning and sideburn trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Shop around for something that&#x27;s less money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After about a half hour</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Panasonic wet/dry model to fail within its respective warranty period.</li>
            <li> It makes an annoying, high-pitched whine, but wow, does it shave close and fast.</li>
            <li> I had previously.</li>
            <li> Previously had owned a Braun.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner costs less and lasts a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> Just as close as a blade shave but much less irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a timer on it, and it shaves my head and face in less than 10 minutes, without tearing them up</li>
            <li> With previous shavers, I had to use pre-shave gel to avoid irritation.  </li>
            <li> My face was already used to this type of electric shaver as I had previously been using a low-end model Braun--</li>
            <li> For about half the price, it does twice the job.   </li>
            <li> - Getting the last 10% of the hair can be difficult if your hair grows in different directions  -</li>
            <li> I previously owned Norelco and Braun.</li>
            <li> I can literally shave in the morning and be done in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> It does not take the typical 3-4 weeks for your skin to adjust.  </li>
            <li> -Shaves closer than my Braun shaver with less irritation  </li>
            <li> Still, I got it all for less than the model below it, which comes without the cleaning apparatus, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Years ago I tried Braun and Remington, and they were at that time less satisfactory than the Norelco, which leads me to the conclusion that this Panasonic model</li>
            <li> Unlike my previous razors, this one doesn&#x27;t penalize you for skipping a day.  </li>
            <li> Previously I used a Mach 3 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slight irritation but</li>
            <li> This shaver cuts closer than any of my previous rotary razors.</li>
            <li> Pop-up razor is slightly flimsy    </li>
            <li> The construction seems sturdy and I expect that the shaver will outlast all my previous shavers.  </li>
            <li> My previous electric razor was a Braun 7526, which I was happier with compared to previous Norelco and Braun electric razors that I have owned over the years.  </li>
            <li> I used to shave with a razor, but got tired of cutting myself. :-)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a year and a half now</li>
            <li> could care less about the cleaning system if I can just use soap and water</li>
            <li> The fans get noisy and if the razor is accidentally bumped after placed in charger not only does it fail to charge, it actually discharges the razor to 0  </li>
            <li> Bought this from Amazon for less than 1/2 of what retailers are asking in Canada ($300).  </li>
            <li> I had an older model that after a year, the cleaning system just failed</li>
            <li> Worked well for a few years (other than I had to pluck a little around the neck that it just would not get).  </li>
            <li> Having shaved with all the conventional razors for years (including a few electrical)</li>
            <li> just use the attached trimmer to shave the little beard down a bit</li>
            <li> waited a couple of days and tried using it &#x27;wet&#x27; using my usual shaving cream.</li>
            <li> but I do like the fact I can store my razor there instead in a drawer where all the shaving come out and create a mess.  </li>
            <li> If I let it go over the weekend or something, I still have to use my Fusion since the hair is so thick and long at that point.</li>
            <li> Difficult and somewhat frustrating to clean the inside of the cleaning chamber.</li>
            <li> That said pulling it tight in one direction does still help the shaver get closer, but that is the norm for every electric I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> From all indications, it seems to run a tight race with the Braun&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful in the shower as it can be a little  slick with the soap.  </li>
            <li> It was an expensive shave when new and</li>
            <li> The cleaning cartridges for the Braun can get expensive and don&#x27;t last as long as the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> - it hasn&#x27;t been around long enough to fail yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also the type of person that will have at least 20 nicks or just abrasion all over after shaving usually, and by using this razor properly I can get a close shave without any of that.  </li>
            <li> I used a small, thin layer of shaving cream and WOW.</li>
            <li> and I will buy one every few years for the rest of my life as it pays for itself in less than one year.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic RC9-07 Shaver Hydro cleaner charger I purchased in December does not clean anymore.  </li>
            <li> The rotary blade setup is also very complex and tedious to clean properly, and in my case, prone to mechanical failures too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about three years of shaving with it, I got tired of dealing with it and replaced it with a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> it takes at least 20% of a charge on a single shave.      </li>
            <li> Like shaving tree stumps and would sometimes get a little razor burn but not with this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a little over a month</li>
            <li> Just put a little liquid soap on it and run it for a minute or so then rinse</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going out or otherwise want a super-smooth shave, I just carry it in the shower and use a little lather.</li>
            <li> I therefore used a disposable blade razor, just to do those 2 little areas.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system uses soap from Panasonic cartridge and you have to change water in a little attachment cup every time you change the soap cartridge (monthly)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little \\&quot;sticky\\</li>
            <li> In fact, it might just even be a little nitpicky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy, but I can put up with that.  </li>
            <li> one cartridge slides into its little place under the shaving unit takes care of the reload.  </li>
            <li> My suggestion is to use this with a little gel.</li>
            <li> A little noisy  2.</li>
            <li> After shave with the Aramis Lab Series pre-shave, I wash my face and put on a little of the Proraso just to moisturize and heal my skin, and its like I never even shaved at times.  </li>
            <li> So I usually use my other trimmer then use the Panassonic shaver to finish off.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions for removing the battery and in the process of taking it apart, noted that water was inside the rubber seal and there was a little bit of rust and corrosion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now, and what little discomfort that occurred after shaving has now gone away.</li>
            <li> The panasonic cleaning system uses a little detergent cake and water.  </li>
            <li> I was a little put off by the cost</li>
            <li> I decided to use a little shaving cream for a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shave to help break my face in.  </li>
            <li> A little moisturizer afterwards</li>
            <li> No significant cons, except the head foils will detach when the plastic cover is removed sometimes.  </li>
            <li> the trimmer for days when I don&#x27;t mind a little stubble.</li>
            <li> I am grateful of this little thing.</li>
            <li> The owners manual describes cleaning the razor with a little dish soap applied to the blades, then turning it on and letting the soap permeate the head.</li>
            <li> It can be a little tricky to get as close a shave around the jaw and neck area, but it is with all shavers</li>
            <li> The base will always charge but typically will not cycle at all or bails out part way through leaving the razor head filled with soapy water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still have a little trouble along the chin area, always have with electric razors</li>
            <li> This razor has them both down to a well oiled machine!</li>
            <li> I let the battery run down each week before charging, clean it every day with soap and water after shaving and once a week in the base station.</li>
            <li> After a while I started noticing the smell (like a dirty old wet towel - another way to describe it).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The cleaning system that comes with this model is a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> since I purchased this shaver, it&#x27;s dead.  </li>
            <li> since I purchased this shaver, it&#x27;s dead.  </li>
            <li> It took a few days to get used to the way that it worked on my skin</li>
            <li> Not really a great big deal</li>
            <li> I had to re-charge overnight ervery few days.  </li>
            <li> Because of a few quality issues.     </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe reports that say a foil shaver doesn&#x27;t do well on a few days growth either.</li>
            <li> It gives a bit of irritation (just sensitivity but not redness) but it goes away after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I do the no base cleaning and one base cleaning a week.  </li>
            <li> well, it smells like a dead dog.  </li>
            <li> The vortex combo replacement listed does not fit the ES8249S.  </li>
            <li> Just a few passes and it gets all the hair.  </li>
            <li> A few techniques help.  </li>
            <li> There is also a $15 rebate on Panasonic&#x27;s website for this razor and a few others.  </li>
            <li> I have medium to heavy beard</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, this shaver does seem to provide a closer shave.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t care about a few stubbles on my neck I could get away with it</li>
            <li> I was tired of getting the razor burn every time I shave, so I looked into different electrics.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of bumps and such on my face, so I switched to electric shavers as I got tired of the weekly \\&quot;bleeding\\</li>
            <li> After a few months use, below are my pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This knowledge helped narrow my focus.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and it handles it well, without razor burn.</li>
            <li> I pulled the plug, dried the counter and shaver parts.  </li>
            <li> It was VERY quiet, but the shave was worse.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for few years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for a few months now</li>
            <li> If I am going through all the trouble of lathering up I would rather use a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to Panasonic for standing firm on their 2 year warranty policy.</li>
            <li> Have trouble with unit in the charger in &amp;#34;Wash&amp;#34; cycle.</li>
            <li> There is a battery life indicator so you never get caught with a dead battery</li>
            <li> Furthermore, he always indicated that he would love to use an electric razor (faster, easier) but the ones he used before yanked at his hair and was very painful to him.  </li>
            <li> provides a close shave with very little discomfort--much less than razor blades--</li>
            <li> My previous razor was worn out--the long hair catcher was broken.  </li>
            <li> Dry shave is not good.</li>
            <li> From day 1 this shaver outperforned all previous wet/dry Panasonics I have used in the past, 15 years.</li>
            <li> I think, given hindsight, I would pay extra to not have HydraClean (seriously!).</li>
            <li> I am a woman who likes to use an electric razor in the winter months when shaving with a regular razor is difficult due to goosebumps.</li>
            <li> I touched the cutting foils to my cheek and couldn&#x27;t believe how it removed the coarse, long hairs.  </li>
            <li> so you can shave in the shower, use shaving cream, or clean it by washing it with liquid soap and running under the faucet, or you can use the self cleaning/charging base that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to clean it, then I just drop it in the base and select \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; + \\&quot;Dry\\&quot; + \\&quot;Charge.\\&quot;      </li>
            <li> if you want that tame looking kitty to look like it will rip your head off... just send it to me.</li>
            <li> This one at least wouldn&#x27;t penalize me with ripping my face if I skipped a day, but it did mean I would have to spend twice as long working on my shave</li>
            <li> Previous generations of these Panasonic shaver--I always buy the top-of-the-line models being offered--also  failed the same way.</li>
            <li> There is a model that is less expensive without it, and my understanding is that it is the same razor.    </li>
            <li> I usually use it as a wet shaver with shaving cream and couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
            <li> so not sure if it&#x27;s messy to change the water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun the past 10 years and didn&#x27;t know what I was missing when I got this Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about ordering this product after reading several of the reviews.</li>
            <li> The packaging is a little short of mediocre.</li>
            <li> I could never go 30 days, as my neck would be nearly raw.    </li>
            <li> The Braun series 5 got nearly universal blah to bad reviews, so I took it back for a refund without even opening it.    </li>
            <li> (it can take you &gt;5min to get a proper shave if you don&#x27;t just have a stubble), but nowhere is the inefficiency as bad as on the facial hair below the chin (on the frontal throat).</li>
            <li> Only problem I see is that if you wait a few days in between shaving it can be difficult to shave around the neck line.</li>
            <li> About 25% of the time it will charge fully, but typically only charges enough for two days (about 8.5 minutes) of shaving - leaving me frustrated and with stubble on day three.  </li>
            <li> Late in the day and the growth is probably less than when using the blade.  </li>
            <li> However, they are slow and I was tired of going over and over the same area to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> but after that I just rinse it thoroughly and let it dry as I live away from home a lot and don&#x27;t want to transport the base unit around.</li>
            <li> I could never shave two consecutive days with a razor and was always left with a raw face and neck - NO MORE!!!!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I read the reviews, but i was tired of always having to shave with a Mach 3 Fusion Power razor all the time just to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> I found Aramis Lab Series pre-electric shave on Amazon, and granted it is rather expensive when compared to Afta or Lectric-Shave, but a little goes a long way, and since I started using it</li>
            <li> I tried started out bad, improved a little and then after a month wasn&#x27;t cutting hair efficiently, requiring more passes over my beard and resulting in razor burn....</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t think of anything bad about it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when it pulled that hair up, it sometimes pinches and the second blade cuts off some raised skin.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system died before the 1 year warranty was up, but I was not able to provide proof of purchase.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system died before the 1 year warranty was up, but I was not able to provide proof of purchase.  </li>
            <li> It gives an unbelievably close shave.</li>
            <li> I prefer it over the Braun and Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> in the past every electric i tried both burned and did a crappy job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Philishaves, Brauns in the past</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric shaver for the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Having used Braun products for the past 20 years I was a bit nervous to switch brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is</li>
            <li> Not sure how to confirm that there are indeed 4 blades, but I&#x27;ll trust that there are.</li>
            <li> Way past the effort I would want to expend.    </li>
            <li> This is now my fifth upgrade of a Panasonic razor over the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I have owned 7 electric shavers over the past 25 years and this shaver gives me the closest shave of them all.</li>
            <li> So for the past 35 years, I have been using electric shavers.</li>
            <li> No more shaving cream and razors for me...</li>
            <li> I have always had Braun electric shavers in the past.  </li>
            <li> The Arc IV doesn&#x27;t brag about being as close as a blade, but it should, as it takes off stubble my Mach 3 Turbo is missing!    </li>
            <li> becuase I was using razor past 6 months to rehabilitate my skin.   </li>
            <li> For the last 1 1/2 years I&#x27;ve used an expensive Braun 7-series.</li>
            <li> Have owned phillips rotory shavers in the past otherwise used gillette or schik razors, but have had skin irritations.</li>
            <li> So not impressed with the longevity of the system.unit than the ES8077S I&#x27;d been using the last four years.  </li>
            <li> A few Days ago Amazon had this shaver on sale for $89.00!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend getting them with Subscribe &amp; Save here, though unfortunately Amazon doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;once every four month\\&quot; option which would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just keep a manual razor on hand just in case to fix any small issues that this poses.</li>
            <li> I am an amateur pet groomer.</li>
            <li> - No more costly shavers every time I go to the store...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted an electric razor, ever since that time, I&#x27;m not sure why.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to shave in the shower like I usually do and no more foam, rash, cuts etc.</li>
            <li> the way it fits my hand, I usually end up accidentally turning the shaver off twice a week</li>
            <li> In comparison, the Braun sounded like a small power tool going on and off for 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more razor nicks around jawline/adams apple.    </li>
            <li> It may help extend the lifespan of the foil/blades, but I am not sure.    </li>
            <li> I usually user Mac 3.</li>
            <li> hoping the combination would help me save face and avoid the skin reactions I had in the past.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d buy one, but finally did when razor blades became SO EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> It is not better....</li>
            <li> I returned this shaver due mainly to its annoying high-pitched whining noise.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic appears to cut only in one direction - with the direction of hair growth, which is odd because cutting against the direction of hair growth is what gives a close shave.    </li>
            <li> Has a subtle little hum.  </li>
            <li> His dad was skeptical at first since he has tried other shavers in the past (only to be brutally disappointed), but he loves this one!     </li>
            <li> I am in the unfortunate position of having to shave every day, with a beard that is tough and skin that is sensitive.  </li>
            <li> however I found that it was slow and left patches of uncut hair.</li>
            <li> I tried the base&#x27;s washing cycle once, it&#x27;s a bit loud and goes on for 2+ hours, however it is not really an issue.</li>
            <li> It comes with one cartridge for the self cleaning, and I plan to make that one cartridge last the next year or so by cleaning the shaver myself by running under the faucet and periodically using the self cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning base is just a gimmick imo or marketing to pull you to buy something more expensive.</li>
            <li> I would like to attribute this to my consistent cleaning with the base and replacing the cartridge every 3 months</li>
            <li> but I always was the arc 4 under water first before I put it in the cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> This may not be a big deal for some guys, but imo spending $150 for something to fail within 1 - 2 years is not a good purchase.</li>
            <li> With Panasonic; you do not need to press hard to the face to get it to shave close.   </li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a couple of months now however the blades are already dull.</li>
            <li> With the norelco I felt as if I had to press it hard against my skin to get an almost acceptable result.  </li>
            <li> but I understand the batteries are hard to get and they have to be soldered in.</li>
            <li> No tugging, no chance of hurting myself, blades don&#x27;t get dull forever.</li>
            <li> I like not having to press it hard to my face, to get it to shave close</li>
            <li> He had used other Electric Razors in the past, but was not impressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to not miss spots when you do not use a circular pattern like with a norelco.</li>
            <li> cause I pressed it so hard on my skin (which what would happen with any shaver electrical or none),  </li>
            <li> It does not get under my nose no matter how hard I try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little irritating in the night when the orange led display is flashing in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I do not have a extremely tough beard, but I do have my trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had similar foil-style Brauns (but never a wet shaver before) and a gold box deal convinced me to try this Panasonic, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed!  </li>
            <li> This shaver never pulls, whereas pulling was my biggest complaint with all Norelco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> the battery life on this unit also surprisingly sucks.  </li>
            <li> I never much liked rotary systems</li>
            <li> I can usually go at least 7 days without plugging the shaver into anything for charging purposes.</li>
            <li> Now, it is late June 2012.</li>
            <li> some have complained about the trimmer part.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be not nearly as good as the Norleco type electric shavers I have used for the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> It was infuriating and led me to simply trim my face with hair clippers... not the cleanest</li>
            <li> biggest complaint</li>
            <li> I have had to change the foil and cutters twice, cause they were starting to bite my face and pulling instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> Cleaning base is a very convenient thing.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, the base alone is not available for purchase.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with other shavers cutting my skin around my throat.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to change it then, but you can&#x27;t use the cleaning unit to clean your shaver until you do, which is annoying (and expensive).</li>
            <li> have to change it then, but you can&#x27;t use the cleaning unit to clean your shaver until you do, which is annoying (and expensive).</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re as lazy as I am in the morning, this might be the razor for you!</li>
            <li> I mean where it can catch a hair</li>
            <li> No more razor burn either!</li>
            <li> I tend to shy away from 5 star reviews due to principle</li>
            <li> The Braun units were expensive, and had the cleaning solution based on rubbing alcohol, which evaporated and caused other concerns.  </li>
            <li> The directions are a little confusing, but once you use the base, it&#x27;s really very simple.</li>
            <li> I grew tired of replacing the expensive cleaning cartridges that would dry up after a couple weeks, so I switched to a razor.</li>
            <li> Several weeks ago the LCD screen failed, and then about 2 weeks ago it failed altogether.</li>
            <li> Previously I have owned one Remington and two Norelcos (including the expensive Arcitec series).</li>
            <li> You could seriously shave over 10min</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but since all four heads need to pass over the hair to get it, this shaver is terrible for trimming around sideburns or facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three other shavers within the past nine months, only to be very disappointed by there performance.</li>
            <li> I am sad to report that my husband&#x27;s cleaning base has ceased working 15 months after purchase and right after I bought another 6 months supply of cleaning cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, and a little nervous.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the only way to get closer with a razor is to shave against the grain which we all know is a bad idea.    </li>
            <li> The person I spoke with was rude with poor customer service skills, then put me on hold for 20 minutes when I asked to speak to her manager (she told me she was a supervisor).</li>
            <li> Have tried Norelcos triple-blade, no good.</li>
            <li> really sucks is that I was liking the razor, but if you don&#x27;t have a company that will stand behind it&#x27;s product</li>
            <li> What really sucks is that I was liking the razor, but if you don&#x27;t have a company that will stand behind it&#x27;s product</li>
            <li> - Cleaning/drying cycle on base station is a bit loud.  </li>
            <li> The plugin cord still works on the shaver ~ it can be recharged by plugging it directly to the base of the shaver itself.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical because whenever I&#x27;ve tried a foil shaver in the past I&#x27;ve been seriously unimpressed with the performance.    </li>
            <li> The cleaner, on the other hand, stinks.  </li>
            <li> and i was tired of missing spots when i was in a hurry to get somewhere and the replacement blades were terribly expensive.     </li>
            <li> It smelled bad, never really cleaned the shaver thoroughly (left behind clipped hair residue) and promptly died as soon as the warranty ended and started leaking (very expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for quite a number of years, but have been disappointed at their quality in the last two models I bought.  </li>
            <li> con: the base is pretty big and ugly, and the charging plug in the base is not easy to connect</li>
            <li> I deal with odd hair in awkward corners with a razor blade.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the long whisker trimmer does hurt when cutting even 2 mm stubble.</li>
            <li> The shaves were close and it cut my tough hair like a beast without any hesitation.</li>
            <li> they would give razor burn in the tough to shave areas.  </li>
            <li> I have a quite tough beard.</li>
            <li> My husband would never shave before because he has very thick hair on his face.</li>
            <li> I also have to say that I find the self cleaning system unnecessary...</li>
            <li> They refused to just take back the base leaving me the razor.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is unnecessary....</li>
            <li> The shaver motor would cavitate with a high-pitched motor whine unless I \\&quot;inched it\\&quot; into uncut beard areas slowly.     </li>
            <li> I like the shaver overall; however, it has some rather annoying cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, for nearly all 10 years i&#x27;ve been shaving, i&#x27;ve hated it.</li>
            <li> This razor, to my disgust, was a worse shave than the Braun.</li>
            <li> Poor service from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I know that the foils have a tendency to break or wear thin on these, but I wouldn&#x27;t even mind paying for a foil every six months</li>
            <li> shave my head, and was a couple days behind when I placed this order, so I let it grow just</li>
            <li> The cleaning apparatus is unnecessary though, since one just washes it in water.</li>
            <li> Got tired of paying $30+ for replacement blades and thought I should consider an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Using a safety razor on my throat ALWAYS leaves it covered with a thin sheet of blood.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this shaver with manual cleaning til it gets tired, then replace it.</li>
            <li> The cleaning base only works well about 30% of the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get maybe 4-5 shaves out of a shaver after it was broken in before I&#x27;d have to toss it and start</li>
            <li> Completely unnecessary as this Shaver pulled it off.</li>
            <li> The cleaning base finally died about a month ago, a year or so ago the lights stopped working but the unit itself would work.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning base finally died about a month ago, a year or so ago the lights stopped working but the unit itself would work.  </li>
            <li> and it tells you when you need to pop it back into the base for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Seriously, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.  </li>
            <li> Considering the money I spent for this I am hugely disappointed in both Panasonic&#x27;s quality - which I could forgive - and their extremely poor customer service - which I cannot.</li>
            <li> I have tried using safety razors in the past, but for whatever reason it always leaves my face raw with nicks and bloody spots.  </li>
            <li> I have a medium beard and should shave once a day to look less bad.     </li>
            <li> That is something my previous electric shaver couldn&#x27;t have dreamed of and would have been somewhat painful with my non-electric razor blades.  </li>
            <li> If I skipped a cleaning and just dusted the hairs out, the grease on the shaver would make the next shave infuriating and painful.</li>
            <li> The blades do not seem to cut through hair well and leave a very ridiculous looking spotty hair face when you are done shaving your face 5 or 6 times to try and make the thing work.</li>
            <li> Sadly I have to update this review, as it will not charge in or outside of he base unit.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely awful compared to my old Phillips.</li>
            <li> I forgot to mention that I do have a thick beard and this shaver has no problem cutting my beard.  </li>
            <li> My husband needs to have a close shave for work, and hated having to get up earlier just to blade-shave.</li>
            <li> I have been much disappointed with ladies electric razors for not shaving close and for seeming to \\&quot;run out of steam\\&quot; after less than a year.  </li>
            <li> But I decided to give it a shot since I was unhappy with the fact that my Arcitec had died (and I had grown a little unhappy with how the Arcitec never seemed to get my neck shaven all that well</li>
            <li> Ultimately I would recommend this razor with gusto regardless of the gimmicky base, and if you can find this unit as a stand alone without the base and without the extra cost of the base, jump on it!</li>
            <li> Another thing I hated about my Braun was its cleaning stations: it was expensive ($5 a month) and absolutely necessary.</li>
            <li> This takes VERY little force and you can hear the cutter drive mechanism disengage making really ugly mechanical noises.  </li>
            <li> I had previously owned a Braun foil shaver with the self cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> -The beard trimmer is very weak compared to the braun.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t look seriously at the offerings from Norelco and Braun as I have been disappointed the performance of both those models and poor durability with Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable and abrasive.  </li>
            <li> Despite the fact this is an expensive razor that broke, they want me to mail it into them before they replace it.</li>
            <li> Panasonic has failed and therefore has lost me forever as a customer for any of their product lines.</li>
            <li> Panasonic has failed and therefore has lost me forever as a customer for any of their product lines.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver in &#x27;09 to replace a ES8043SC which had failed after 3 years of use.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning station even failed to function after 1 1/2 years of use.  </li>
            <li> he was skeptical but he tried it.</li>
            <li> This makes shaving along the jaw line difficult.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I read the reviews on how expensive the cleaning cartridges are.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product won&#x27;t convince me to make the switch.  </li>
            <li> The unit fails to turn on when the start button is pressed</li>
            <li> but it has failed just like the others.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it displays random characters.</li>
            <li> The head is all one piece now and expensive to replace.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on electric razors, even though my husband skeptical.</li>
            <li> It was worse than my Braun!</li>
            <li> The LED status lights on the base do not light up and it no longer dries the shaver after cleaning.</li>
            <li> basically irrelevant.    </li>
            <li> I felt like it was too expensive for the amount of use I would get out of it(I travel a lot).</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that the razor does not ship to Canada.</li>
            <li> but once you see how close it shaves, the noise is irrelevant.    </li>
            <li> The replacement foil is expensive (</li>
            <li> I like the look of the base station compared to the ugly white braun one.</li>
            <li> So not impressed with the longevity of the system.</li>
            <li> Give it a try you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the refurb</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to start.  </li>
            <li> I am used to getting razor bumps after every shave and it&#x27;s difficult to wear collared shirts because of the irritation.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of skin irritation and you looking for comfort this is the razor for you!</li>
            <li> the noise isn&#x27;t disturbing.</li>
            <li> Needless to say,</li>
            <li> and they are so expensive..</li>
            <li> and there would still be neck, chin, and random spots of face hair</li>
            <li> The HydraClean feature fails at every aspect I can think of:  1.</li>
            <li> The cartriges are expensive.  </li>
            <li> Must change foil and blades yearly to have it shave well for you which can get expensive.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is useless, but I use it as a charger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are three gripes: 1-After three 10-minute shaves, shaver battery goes to 50%; 2-Soap/Water replacement instructions are baffling; 3-My shaver&#x27;s LCD panel became useless after a drop in the shower...</li>
            <li> He even loves all the bells and whistles too, which weren&#x27;t so complicated as to discourage use.</li>
            <li> However, since the outer foil is very thin and can be damaged if not used correctly, we advise that you check that the foil is not damaged before using the shaver.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve got about $150 into this very poorly designed razor.</li>
            <li> The base is small and it&#x27;s not stable when standing upright - it falls over all the time.</li>
            <li> I had long fantasized about owning a Panasonic but the price always seemed outrageous.  </li>
            <li> I usually rinse the razor after shaving and then run it through a cleaning cycle on the base.</li>
            <li> so i was getting sick and tired of using a blade every day, have irritation, bumps, acne ect....</li>
            <li> Worst of all, if you missed a day, it would penalize you in a big way by ripping and tugging at my stubble-turned-whiskers; painful.  </li>
            <li> As I was afraid that this shaver is not like Philips shaver    </li>
            <li> but having to purchase the detergent packs is slightly inconvenient.</li>
            <li> The Braun&#x27;s does not, so I will have to keep it around for cutting the longer whiskers after not shaving for a while.</li>
            <li> After my shave I splash cold water on my face and then put some Nivea after shave balm on.</li>
            <li> This is a disappointment coming from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I got the ES7249S Arc IV on sale for a crazy price on Amazon through J&amp;R (under $100).  </li>
            <li> After 40 years of blade shaving, I decided blades weren&#x27;t cutting it any longer.</li>
            <li> After the process, the shaver stinks with a foul odor.  </li>
            <li> They were expensive but I was sick of the razor burn..</li>
            <li> This razor has proven me wrong about my feelings of electric razors all together!  </li>
            <li> For the price I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong!  </li>
            <li> The cleaning base is completely useless (well, it kinda looks neat).</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical when it comes to electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to even find an electric razor for women.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s bad: The led battery life display is unreliable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a disservice to consumers and bad for the Panasonic brand.</li>
            <li> So bad was my experience with electric shavers since I started shaving</li>
            <li> Have nothing bad to say about this item.</li>
            <li> I tried using a manual, but got really bad shaving rash on my neck</li>
            <li> Even the vaunted Braun 7 series resulted in bad experience after bad experience so that after 3 weeks I took one back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The noise is so bad, I have to shut the bathroom door.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Working with Panasonic customer service has been painful.</li>
            <li> i was shocked when it was done after 2 cleanings.   </li>
            <li> I was shocked when I found how close the Panasonic razor shaved.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I am sick of buying disposable razors to shave my face and head with, and it has NOT disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never thought I would be an electric razor man, but I was sick of buying $30 cartridges every two weeks -</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Again, try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews talking about issues with the cleaning base, and I might have been an unlucky one to get one of the bad bases.</li>
            <li> and I have not been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> However the base died just after the month return policy where it no longer dries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just place the shaver in the base unit and hit the button</li>
            <li> I have not tried the charging base or the cleaning solution, just don&#x27;t want the clutter on my counter.      </li>
            <li> I wanted to replace just the base</li>
            <li> The shaver washes well in the shower, and once in a while I will wash it using the base.</li>
            <li> Frankly I consider the cleaning base a gimmick anyway.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do the job, and irritated the crap out of my face.</li>
            <li> I then (after my shower) drop it into the charging base, select the \\&quot;Dry\\&quot; and \\&quot;Charge\\&quot; modes by toggling through the selections, and let the charging base do the rest.  </li>
            <li> After a move, I could not find where the base station/charger was and the Braun was about out of steam.</li>
            <li> -Can be cleaned with hand soap, no need for a cleaning base station    </li>
            <li> I started taking it out of the charging base before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> After 16 months, the cleaning/charging base has quit.</li>
            <li> So the cord is not the problem: it is the base.</li>
            <li> I had been using varyingly fusion and quattro disposable razors, but the obscene profit margin on replacement cartridges appalled me.</li>
            <li> JUST HATED TO SHAVE, NOT ANYMORE!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switched to this razor from a terrible Norelco, which couldn&#x27;t even handle my peachfuzz-like beard.  </li>
            <li> THINK YOU&#x27;LL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!</li>
            <li> Using the Panasonic my nasty beard smell is gone.  </li>
            <li> This was an intermittent problem though, but still very annoying.</li>

            <li> It works very well and causes little to no irritation. Every once in a while, the cleaning system isn&#x27;t completely clean. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> After using electric and cordless shaver models from Norelco, Remington and Braun, I settled on the wet/dry features of the Panasonic models. I replaced my first one with a 3-blade ES8092 6 years ago. It shaved closer than other models, was smoother and more comfortable on my face, and you could wash the heads. It no longers works well.  I may just need a new head, but instead of spending up to $40 on a new head, I decided to check out the latest and greatest in new shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t look seriously at the offerings from Norelco and Braun as I have been disappointed the performance of both those models and poor durability with Braun shavers. I was astonished to see that the Panasonic models have lower prices than both the Norelco and the Braun.  I settled on the Nanotech Vortex 4 blade models.  The blades are extra sharp. One blade has a wider opening to handle my coarse African American graying beard hairs, two regular blades handle the bulk of the shave, while a fourth finishing blade leaves your face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I recall how the Norelco rotary had a blade system that lifts the hair while a second blade cut if off. Unfortunately, when it pulled that hair up, it sometimes pinches and the second blade cuts off some raised skin.  It was uncomfortable and abrasive.  This Panasonic is smooth and painless.  There is a turbo mode with an extremely high vibration rate to clean the blades under running water. It is a significant improvement over my previous Panasonic 3-blade model. I highly recommend Panasonic&#x27;s Arc IV 4-blade shavers.  The shave is top notch and build quality is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system that comes with this model is a waste of money and time. I bought this model because it was only about $25 more than the ES8243 model without the cleaning system.  What a waste. It takes over an hour to clean and dry. It&#x27;s noisy. It uses costly proprietary detergent cartridges that must be replaced monthly. It is a gift that keeps on taking your money and you don&#x27;t need it anyway. It&#x27;s just a gimmick folks.  Don&#x27;t fall for it. You will be happier with the cheaper model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best price along with top notch customer service, but I bought mine down the street at my local Target for 6 dollars more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now 3 years since I purchased this shaver, it&#x27;s dead.  The cleaning system died before the 1 year warranty was up, but I was not able to provide proof of purchase.  I still believe that Panasonic wet/dry electric shavers are the best solution for me, I am somewhat disappointed in the quality and warranty for the price we have to pay.on taking your money and you don&#x27;t need it anyway.

            <li> I got this razor for Christmas and I love it. I have always used Braun shavers but thought I would give this one a try due to reviews and recomendation from a friend. I love it. It&#x27;s quiet, shaves better, faster and closer than my old Braun. I have a very course beard. Like shaving tree stumps and would sometimes get a little razor burn but not with this razor. I still have a little trouble along the chin area, always have with electric razors but this one does a better job in this area than any I have used before. I like the charger and cleaner to. Gives more options than my older Braun charger and cleaner did. All in all, a good razor and I would recommend you try it if you are thinking of changing your current brand or just ready to replace your old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a revision to my above review. A couple of months after I purchased this item I had a problem with the cleaning system not working, it just quit working during a cleaning cycle. I called the Panasonic service dept. and told them the shaver was still under warrantee and that the cleaning unit had quit working. The told me I could send the unit back to them at my own expense and if they found that the unit was indeed no good, they would replace it with a re-built unit! I was a little upset to hear that they had the policy of replacing new defective parts with re-built units. I don&#x27;t think that is a very good practice for any business, just my opinion! Luckally, my cleaning unit started working again and I have not had this problem again but I thought I should make Panasonics replacement policies known to all in case they are thinking of purchasing one of their products. I still love the razor and cleaning/charging unit so I am not going to change my rating on this razor, just making you aware of the companies policies.</li>
            <li> I have used many different razors over the last 30 years, and this tops them all.  It gives a close, comfortable shave without grabbing or yanking the hairs like some of my older razors did.  It is self-cleaning which is a great bonus, and it hums instead of growls.  I also got the best price right here on Amazon.  The only thing I wish was different is that the trimming attachment were wider.  Other than that, this is an awesome razor and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco for years decided to change after having problems with my last one.  Wish I changed years ago.  When you use this with shaving cream it&#x27;s a gret shave - as good as any razor without the nicks and cuts!  TRY IT YOU WILL LIKE IT!</li>
            <li> I switched to this razor from a terrible Norelco, which couldn&#x27;t even handle my peachfuzz-like beard.  This razor ROCKS!  Clear, easy to read display, comfortable foil head which is flexible and the self-cleaning charging station makes this just an amazing package.  I would give this product the maximum amount of stars, be it five or 5,000 for any review anywhere!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back/forth between using electric and manual razors several times in my life.  I&#x27;ve always liked the convenience of the electric razor while I&#x27;ve appreciated the closer shave that you can get with the manual razor.  Nowadays, I travel a lot and because of the restrictions on liquids for carry on, electric razors are just so much easier.    I&#x27;ve been a lifetime customer of the Norelco rotary razor having practically one of every new model including up to the latest [[ASIN:B000PKKAGO Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] which I reviewed and gave high marks to.    Recently my arcitec stopped charging and so I went back to manual shaving with the best of the best in a manual shave: [[ASIN:B000MLNVU8 Gillette Fusion Power Razor, Phantom, 1 Razor]].   At the same time I went a looking for a replacement of the Arcitec and ran across this razor which had many impressive reviews.   I was a bit skeptical because whenever I&#x27;ve tried a foil shaver in the past I&#x27;ve been seriously unimpressed with the performance.    But I decided to give it a shot since I was unhappy with the fact that my Arcitec had died (and I had grown a little unhappy with how the Arcitec never seemed to get my neck shaven all that well no matter how long, what direction or how many passes I made on my neck -- even after replacing the blades).   Ordered it Friday and it came Saturday.  Took a quick try with it right out of the box (there was enough charge in it) and was happy with the first impression, so I decided to keep it and give it a full whirl in the morning.    Shaved with it the next day and I was blown away by how close it was able to shave.  To put it in perspective, when I shave with the Fusion razor, I shave both with and against the grain (e.g. down and then up on the sides of my face) so I can get the closest shave.   The Panasonic was at least on a par with the Fusion and totally blew away the Arcitec.  Even more amazing it was done with relatively low effort.  Shorter than it takes me to shave with the Fusion (and much less messier) and way, way shorter than with the Arcitec (about 1/4 of the time).  No signs of skin irritation on my neck (typical with the Arcitec) or my face.    Very, very happy!    Update (1/21/11):  I&#x27;ve been using the same blades since I got the shaver and while I was still able to get the close shave I&#x27;m happy with, it seemed to be taking more time and more passes.  So I decided to replace the blades ([[ASIN:B001J6O0HI Panasonic WES9020PC Combo Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set]]) and wow... major difference... closer, faster shave with much less pressure and work.  I&#x27;m guessing that this is just how it was when I got the shaver and it&#x27;s just gotten harder every so slightly over time.   I&#x27;d estimate that it is probably better to replace the blades on the order of 6 to 8 months of daily shaving (at least for me).   Luckily, putting this on Amazon&#x27;s subscription service also saves you 15% on the price.    I also have to say that I find the self cleaning system unnecessary... Much easier (and cheaper) to just rinse the head in the sink.</li>
            <li> I liked the shaver at first and it still does work well however after 3 years the cleaning system gave out and began leaking. Now I just clean the shaver manually and I doubt whether I&#x27;ll buy any shaver with a cleaning system.</li>
            <li> The razor works ok after a little over a month, no complaints regarding that. However the base died just after the month return policy where it no longer dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working with Panasonic customer service has been painful. Despite the fact this is an expensive razor that broke, they want me to mail it into them before they replace it. I asked what am I supposed to use in the mean time, and was told basically that is not their problem, this is their warranty procedure and even after 30 days with a defective unit that is the best they can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They even admitted to me over the phone it sounded unusual for this part to break, but refused to send me the replacement unit before I send back the broken one. They refused to just take back the base leaving me the razor. The person I spoke with was rude with poor customer service skills, then put me on hold for 20 minutes when I asked to speak to her manager (she told me she was a supervisor). Being at work, I had to finally hang up since I cannot stay on the phone all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is if you are lucky enough to receive a working unit, most likely you will be fine. If you have a defective unit better hope it breaks within your 30 day return period or you will need to grow a beard before you have it fixed back to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent the money I spent because I trusted Panasonic quality, and was under the false belief they offered reasonable customer service. Now I either have to give up the razor for a month (ship to them, wait for processing, wait for them to ship back) hoping I get a new one that actually does work, or live with it in a semi-broken state (will the cleaning cycle function break down completely soon as the heating unit did?). Considering the money I spent for this I am hugely disappointed in both Panasonic&#x27;s quality - which I could forgive - and their extremely poor customer service - which I cannot. Certainly even the best made products can be sent out defective. The key between a company I will buy other products from going forward, and a company I will never trust or buy anything from again, is how that company deals with these situations. Panasonic has failed and therefore has lost me forever as a customer for any of their product lines. I will not risk being stuck with another defective product they will not stand behind with any level of true customer service.products from going forward, and a company I will never trust or buy anything from again, is how that company deals with these situations.

            <li> As stated above, this is a excellent shaver.  Amazon process my order thru Target.  The item was receive in a timely order.  \\&quot;EXCELLENT\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after seeing reviews in which the reviewers said it shaves nearly as close as a regular razor.  I am a woman who likes to use an electric razor in the winter months when shaving with a regular razor is difficult due to goosebumps. I have been much disappointed with ladies electric razors for not shaving close and for seeming to \\&quot;run out of steam\\&quot; after less than a year.  It is nearly impossible to even find an electric razor for women. The one bought last summer for me as a gift seems to have noticeably less power already.  I am very pleased with the Panasonic ES8249S Arc IV Nanotech Vortex razor. I have been using the dry shave method daily since purchasing the razor.  It gives an unbelievably close shave. My legs are so smooth, you&#x27;d think I had used a razor blade.  It was a little pricey, but if it lasts, then it will have been worth it.  I recommend it to all my women friends. I can&#x27;t speak for the guys. The cleaner machine is kind of neat, although I wish there was a way to use it without having to keep buying the soap cartridge.</li>
            <li> Tried both Braun and Panasonic. Panasonic closer to blade shave. Better around neck and very smooth.</li>
            <li> Having used a rechargable Remmington for years was reluctant to take a chance, I am very pleased that I did.  Simplle, quiet, and a close shave out of the box make this a purchase seem to be a great deal, especially with the great Amazon price, at least $40 below any price I could find.  Short term recomendation is a can&#x27;t miss. Just need to see how long it last.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Shaves great dispite the inability to adjust the shave depth. The auto cleaner is Ok but overkill and it&#x27;s easy to clean without it. The only negative so far is that the shaver gives off an extrely loud, high pitch hum that is very annoying around the ears and downright painful if you use it to keep the ear lobes free of unwanted hairs. This is probably due to it&#x27;s floating T shaped head... but it&#x27;s still a very nice shave.  Now after using this shaver for a year I&#x27;ve downgraded it to 3 stars. Too loud,hurts my ears when I shave near them. You can&#x27;t adjust razor depth and it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as my old 3 head shaver.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for about two years.  It continues to work well.  I prefer it over the Braun and Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  It definately shaves closer than the other electrics that I&#x27;ve used.  I also think it is a better value.  The cleaning cartridges for the Braun can get expensive and don&#x27;t last as long as the Panasonic.  I did prefer the scent of the Braun cartridges over the Panasonic.  It does take a long time for the cleaning cycle and it is a bit noisy, so don&#x27;t do it before going  to bed if it&#x27;s close by.</li>
            <li> I have been a Baldie by Choice for 15 years. All of that time I have been a HeadBlade manual shaver.....in the past every electric i tried both burned and did a crappy job. After reading good reviews on this razor I thought I would give it a chance. All I can say is, WOW!! Both wet &amp; dry this razor does an incredible job in short time with no burn and no stubble. The trick is not moving too quickly. The price is incredible given the great job it does. The cleaning system is unnecessary....you can just run the razor under running water to clean it. Takes 5 seconds. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this, its a great product and the price is a steal.</li>
            <li> I have avoided electric shavers for years because of my sensitive skin and poor quality of electric shaves. I searched online for the best electric shavers and the Panasonic ES8249S showed up as one of the best.    I purchased the Panasonic ES8249S from Amazon.com at almost half the price found in local stores. This shaver is truly outstanding. Gives a closer shave than my triple head blade razor and is great on my sensitive skin. I highly recommend this Panasonic ES8249S! Don&#x27;t waste time or money on the hydro cleaner, just use liquid soap and water to clean.</li>
            <li> This is the best razar have used. Bought a 220.00 Braun just to have the micro screen break up in 2 months. They wanted 60.00 to replace like that was going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;Have a high end Norelco that is a close second. The panasonic is loud and that is the only draw back would say. It gives you a shave that is the longest lasting by the end of day. The norelco is quiet which is real nice but at the end of day you have a lot more stubble coming back where as the panasonic still hardly anything.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to make a few passes and for me 5-7 minutes is not unusual at all.&lt;br /&gt;All in all a super high tech unit with the bast wash system have used by far being more cost effective and even has a fan and heater to dry the razar.</li>
            <li> 1. Panasonic shaver is excellent and exceed my expectation. As I was afraid that this shaver is not like Philips shaver    long years I am using it.   2. With Panasonic; you do not need to press hard to the face to get it to shave close.   3. Battery is good; day after day shaving (every time around 5 minutes) need to charge every 10 days.  4. I am agreed with all review regarding its cleaning system; after I tried it one time, I prefer to clean it manually    cleaning system takes long time and not 100% effective.   5. I gave it 4 stars due to cleaning system  5. I like to thank Amazon; Amazon has the excellent price (drop price for one day) along with top notch customer service.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver in &#x27;09 to replace a ES8043SC which had failed after 3 years of use.  I really liked the ES88043.  It provided a very smooth and close shave.  I wish I could say the same about the 8249.  Even with frequent foil/blade replacements, the shave was only \\&quot;so - so\\&quot;.  The cleaning station even failed to function after 1 1/2 years of use.  I recently replaced this shaver with a Braun 7-790.  I wish I would have done that years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few electric razors, but this one is my favorite. I got it real cheap on the deal of the day and needed a new one anyway. It vibrates fast and smooth, instead of clunky like my last one. The auto cleaning is wonderful. I&#x27;ve very impressed, I even payed alot less than my other one!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for christmas to replace my Mach 3 manual shaver as this product has received good reviews. I am here to tell you, that if you are used to a close manual shave that comes from a multiple blade replaceable razor like a Mach 3 that you should look elsewhere. This shaver gives a shave that is uneven, it leaves small hairs all over your face that it cant seem to shave off, no matter how many times you go over it. The blades do not seem to cut through hair well and leave a very ridiculous looking spotty hair face when you are done shaving your face 5 or 6 times to try and make the thing work. I can&#x27;t speak for any other competitor electric shavers as I haven&#x27;t used them, but I can tell you that this product is garbage and buyers beware that you will end up reshaving your face with a blade razor after trying to shave your face for 30 minutes with this piece of landfill trash.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver for myself for xmas in 2010 and have to say that I absolutely love the thing. I have use the Norelco rotary shavers that have been hand me downs as well as a hand me down foil razor but this is the first NEW one that I have ever owned. It took a few days to get used to the way that it worked on my skin but once my skin grew accustomed to it then smoothing irritation ceased and it became a breeze. I usually shave in my truck and it takes about 5 minutes to get a nice close shave that is ALMOST as a blade. If I spend that same 5 minutes at home it IS as close as a blade so I am very pleased. It is suggested that you change the blades once every 6 months or so I believe but I have yet to do so and it has been 14 months so far, I have ordered a replacement set though to see if that makes any difference. I would and DO recommend this product fully but if I were to buy another one I would save a few bucks and go without the cleaning station as it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything better than the soap and water trick that they suggest in the manual. Happy shaving!!</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver but not what I expected.  Still have to finish with a blade.  Always leaves whiskers on jaw line, under chin &amp; neck.  Otherwise cleans great, smooth &amp; comfortable, just can&#x27;t get a complete shave.  Takes alot longer than a blade too, but no cuts.  I&#x27;d like to try a rotary to compare the difference.  May end up using one in addition to this foil shaver to get a thorough shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who was very adimit that electric razors didn&#x27;t give a close enough shave. He&#x27;s got very sensitive skin and when he did need a clean close shave he would break out in rashes using a traditional razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this for him he was skeptical but he tried it. To both of our shock it gave him a very close shave and he didn&#x27;t break out in a rash!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Gives close shave&lt;br /&gt;Works great with sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Self cleans&lt;br /&gt;Blades have stayed very.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Not a very big Con but having to purchase the detergent packs is slightly inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Update:  The shaver starting making so much noise that it hurt the ear I was shaving next to.  I measured the sound at 92db!!!  Ok, just send it in and get it fixed.  What an adventure.  Panasonic has the web site from hell.  After much searching and being led around in circles, I found a page that said enter zip code and click.  Wow, this was it.  Only one problem, the click leads to an error message.  But, there was a phone number, got human immediately!!  This poor little girl in Tanzania, was on her second week of learning English.  That, combined with background noise and distorted sound, was a real challenge.  After 5 or so repeated attempts, I think I got the correct address.  We&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very good shaver with a few caveats.  After using Norelco for may years, I was totally dissatisfied with the one I bought. I returned it.  This Panasonic is very nicely made.  It gives a good shave, but takes longer than my old Norelco&#x27;s.  This shaver will only cut hairs growing in the right direction.  This makes shaving along the jaw line difficult.  The trimmer is very good, and I use it to pick off stubborn hairs.  This shaver never pulls, whereas pulling was my biggest complaint with all Norelco&#x27;s. The ability to clean with soap and water is convenient.  I have never used the cleaning system.  I don&#x27;t see the point.  It cleans with soap and water, why fool with a \\&quot;Vortex Cleaning System\\&quot;?  I get 5 or so shaves per charge, and charging time is much less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s Christmas present.  He HATES to shave- absolutely dreads it. Furthermore, he always indicated that he would love to use an electric razor (faster, easier) but the ones he used before yanked at his hair and was very painful to him.  After reading the other reviews on this shaver I figured I had nothing to lose- why not try it??!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband used the razor yesterday (26 Dec) for the first time.  He used it dry and absolutely LOVED it!  No pain, easy, fast, and a nice close shave.  He cannot wait to use it wet.  He said he will be shaving much more often and is certain that he has found a real keeper in this electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon price and free shipping with Amazon prime truly made this an affordable gift.  My husband being this happy - well, that is priceless!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of electric shavers.  I prefer to use a Mach3.  I owned a Panasonic electric shaver before and it did a mediocre job at best but my wife liked me to have at least a semi smooth face when I didn&#x27;t feel like using my Mach3.  The Panasonic lasted me 7 years so I thought what the hey.  Surely the technology has improved.  Man has it ever.  The Panasonic Arc IV does an outstanding job of getting my face smooth.  Much smoother than my older Panasonic.  I keep my head shaved and this is the first electric shaver that has ever gotten my head completely smooth.  This will definitely save me some money on the way overpriced Mach3 razors.  Give this shaver 30 days and I think you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I originally had the three blade version (ES8103S) however I found that it was slow and left patches of uncut hair. I replaced it with a Remington F5790 which is an excellent razor however it is bulky and not well built. The F5790 is an excellent razor that is fast with extreme close shave however I decided to try Panasonic one more time. I have read numerous review on this model that it is supposed to be better than the three blade version. This model makes up for the faults of the 8103. It is much faster, quieter, does not miss hairs and provides a shave that is equal to a manual razor. It is built like a tank. For the price, this is a good value due to the features, performance and should last for years.    *Update 04/03/2010: I had to update my original review due to the blades already needing to be replaced. I have had this shaver for a couple of months now however the blades are already dull. I have to shave over and over to get a close shave as when originally purchased. I still think that this is the best performance shaver out there however a blade life that lasts only a few months is unacceptable. The cost of the blades vary from $30-$45 depending where you find them. Having to replace the blades 2-3 times per year makes this a very expensive razor to own. I really like this shaver however the cost of ownership will make me switch back to manual razor instead.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this for my husband.  I had read another review by a man who was also on blood thinning medication as is my husband.  A small cut from a normal razor can cause a lot of bleeding.  This fantastic shaver eliminates that possibility!  It also provides a very close shave and is completely self cleaning.  My hubby is very happy with his Christmas present!  It was worth spending a little extra to get the best.</li>
            <li> I have tried many electric razors over the years, but none really worked with my situation.  I have a very tough, white beard and very soft skin.  This razor is everything that Panasonic claims it is.  I get a closer shave than with my Gillette razor and no razor burn.  All of the positive comments about it convinced me to try it.  After only two weeks I can say I will keep it.  I am using the manual cleaning proces and it works just fine, no need for the automatic system and cost.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Excellent service from Amazon - thank you. Excellent price too. I live in the UK but got this item delivered to a local US address and collected the item later. The same item is at least $100 more in the UK!    With regards to the product, well, it is certainly the best shaver I&#x27;ve had. My last shaver was a panasonic ES8043 which was great but this one is even better. The shave, particularly with a pre-shave oil like \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; is brilliant. [[ASIN:B000NPBQB4 King of Shaves For Men Kinexium Shaving Oil, Sensitive Skin .68 fl oz]] It works brilliantly as a wet shave too with a standard shaving cream. It usually takes me 4 minutes for a very close shave. I deal with odd hair in awkward corners with a razor blade. The shave is completely atraumatic and quick. The cleaning system is great. I don&#x27;t understand how it gets rid of the hair with the foil still attached but it does! The screen tells you when to clean the shaver. I get about 8-9 days of shaving with one single charge.   I&#x27;ve used Philishaves, Brauns in the past but Panasonic is clearly better. I think it is the fast motor which makes it a little more audible that the my previous shavers but not too loud.</li>
            <li> Great shave in 4 minutes that lasts thru the evening vs. 10 minutes on others that get you to 5:00 without the closeness.  I&#x27;ve tried several other high-med end razors (mostly tripleheads) that don&#x27;t perform.  Minor downsides: the cleaning system is a bit noisy, and the trimmer only adequate but overall 5-stars for this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a little over a month and it does seem to be working well.  I got it to replace a Norelco that was no longer holding a charge (and was frankly falling apart).  I thought I&#x27;d try something different and the cleaning base was a nice enticement.  I read some better reviews of the Panasonic than the more expensive Braun and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  The warning that you need to try it for a month before judging it is no joke, however.  Even though I was switching from a different kind of electric shaver the first few shaves were less than stellar.  I stuck with it and I&#x27;d have to say it shaves slightly better than the Norelco did.  Neither beats a shave with a real razor, of course.  But if you&#x27;re as lazy as I am in the morning, this might be the razor for you!</li>
            <li> Up front note: I shave my entire head, so if you&#x27;re looking for a head shaver&#x27;s view, this is it.    I received the Panasonic ES8249S about two weeks ago and have been using it each day since then. Previous to using the Panasonic, I used Mach3 blades. When using blades, even the good ones like the Mach3, my neck would break out with painful razor burn/bumps, I&#x27;d get acne around my chin and mouth, and sometimes I&#x27;d break out in a rash on the back of my neck. So blade shaving with my sensitive skin was a 2 or sometimes 3 day per week deal, there was no way I could shave every day. The days in between I&#x27;d be running around with a day or two of growth on my head and face. Not very professional, but this is the way it was for me for 20+ years.    Not anymore.    While I had tried a variety of electric shavers in the past, they all had some kind of downside: the shave wasn&#x27;t close enough, they were hard to clean, got too hot, or whatever. Always something. So while the reviews here were very positive, I wasn&#x27;t overly optimistic about the ES8249S. Fortunately, the ES8249S has so far proven to be a different breed of electric. While it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as a blade (I don&#x27;t believe any electric can), it get&#x27;s pretty darn close, and the cleaning system is about as dummyproof as you can get. Just place the shaver in the base unit and hit the button and you have a nice, clean shaver waiting for you the next day. Simple.    But I think the biggest upside for the ES8249S is that I can use it in the shower. I think having a warm, wet head helps the ES8249S give a closer shave, and it certainly makes keeping the sink area clean since there are no hair clippings to clean up. I use HeadSlick shaving cream by HeadBlade, just rub it all over my head and face, and shave up. It takes me between 7.5 and 9 minutes to shave my head, neck and face to the level of closeness I desire - about the same time it took to prep, shave, and clean up using a blade.    This shaver has been ahuge hit for me, I can now shave my head and face every day without suffering from rash/burn/acne, the quality of the shave is very good, and the convenience of the cleaning system is welcome.    I highly recommend that bald guys give this electric a try. I love it!    Update on 8/12/10: I&#x27;ve been using the ES8249S for about 3.5 months and so far it&#x27;s been rock solid, a real winner. I did notice, though, that the shave quality was degrading a bit, where it would take additional passes and time to get a close shave. Not really a great big deal, my shaves were taking 10 minutes instead of the 8 minutes I got when the shaver was new.    So I purchased the blade replacement kit (not the foil, just the blades) for 16 bucks and now the shaver is as good as new. Being that I shave my entire head each day, taking between 8 and 10 minutes, and considering that most people only shave the face, I use my shaver about 3 to 4 times as much as a once-per-day face shaver does. So while a head shaving guy like me will need to replace the blades once every 4 months or so, a face shaver should be able to get away with replacing the blades once a year or less.    Great shaver!</li>
            <li> This is a great electric shaver.  It shaves really close to my face, and I&#x27;ve never been able to use electric shavers because they don&#x27;t get close enough for my satisfaction.  I finally decided that the technology of these shavers has gotten to a point where it would be worth trying to make the switch, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that I was right.    This shaver has a very high build quality.  It operates at a moderate noise level.  It is easy to clean, and I only use the stand to clean it once a month.  I haven&#x27;t tried wet shaving yet, but the dry shaving performance is great.  It does not miss very many hairs, and it takes me about 3-4 minutes to shave thoroughly.  I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for nearly two months now, and I really don&#x27;t have much to complain about so far.    If I had to choose a negative aspect of this shaver, it would be that the stand cleaner operates somewhat loudly so it would be best if you let it run during the day or if your bathroom is far enough away from your bedrooms.  If not, you&#x27;ll be hearing it hum while you&#x27;re trying to sleep at night.    Without question, I gave this shaver 5 stars because it has met or exceeded all of my expectations, and it shaves close enough that most people would never know that I used an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I did some extensive research on which electric shaver to purchase.  This one was rated high for sensitive skin and for the wet/dry capability.  It is comfortable to hold and use, but from a straight razor to an electric one takes adjustment.  I am still trying to figure out the best way to use it.  Wet, dry, longer or shorter hair, etc.  My beard hair tends to be thick, grow in every which direction possible, and be a bit oily.  My skin has reacted with raised patches, dryer skin, and unshaved portions that needed touch-ups with a straight razor.  The booklet says to give it a month.  How does one walk about town or go to work with a bizarre, patchy look?  Is this the look for fall 2010?  In a month, perhaps there will be better news.    It cleans easily with liquid soap lathered up by turning it on.  This is for the in between official cleanings with the cartridges.    A lot of dedicated counter space is required for the cleaning/charging unit.    The timer and battery life display are helpful.    I have more professional trimmers, so I will not use the one that is a part of this one.    These types of products are tough to consider as we each have our own facial issues and desires.  Good luck to all on the never ending search for the perfect (and therefore comfortable) shave.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic es8249s wet/dry shaver is the best shaver i have ever used, Its quiet, Fits good in my hand and shaves really close in about 6 minutes. I bought this for myself for Christmas but im going to buy another one for my dad, Im very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for decades.  I bought a panasonic ES8078 shaver three years ago and was very happy using it.  It was smooth and fast and did the job with no muss or fuss.  I also used a Gillette Mach 3 to touch up.  The battery was almost gone on the ES8078, and so it was time to replace it.  I had to re-charge overnight ervery few days.  Also, I ran out of Mach 3 blades as well, so I looked for a replacement that would not need the touching up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for my shaving needs.  I shave every day.  If I am going out at night, I have to shave again.  I get a definite 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  It is short but dark.  I shave in front of the sink without any gel or cremes.  My skin is slightly oily, so I do not need the lubrication.  I have a somewhat narrow face, without much extra flesh on it. The angle under my jaw is pronounced, so I have requirements in shaving needs for a narrower face.  After shaving I rinse the shaver and shaver head in running water with the shaver running in turbo mode, as Panasonic recommends.  It cleans up easily and quickly.  I have not used the vortex cleaner unit yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Panasonic ES8249 for over a week and I am very pleased with my purchase.  It is easier to use than my ES8078; the shaver is more comfortable to hold and easier to maneuver.  It cuts all of my facial hair quite well.  I do have to go over the neck and under my jaw a second time, but everything else is taken care on the first pass.  My face is very smooth afterwards.  Panasonic figures an estimated three minutes per shave, but I seldom get near two minutes.  I was concerned that with my narrower/oval face that I the head would be too wide for me to use well.  That is not the case at all.  My concerns were unfounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fully recommend this shaver to everyone.  For those who do not care about the Vortex cleaner, I recommend the ES8243 for less money.  It is the same razor without the Vortex or its cost.  They can be found with a bit of looking.</li>
            <li> The product shaves very good where it works. I mean where it can catch a hair it cut it as close to your skin as possible but it kills me to make it catch some hair on my face. Even, after two times shaving there are some long hair on my face or some areas not shaved.  Besides, if you want to make some patterns by your beard, it cannot help so much.</li>
            <li> This is my first amazon review and I&#x27;m writing this because I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this shaver. I got lucky because I was looking to replace my old Norelco (which constantly irritates my skin) at the time and had seen this up on amazon&#x27;s gold box deal of the day. This shaver has had numerous great reviews on all the sites I looked at when researching it and I have to say that it really does live up to what others have been praising it for! It shaves extremely close and it&#x27;s honestly the next best thing to using a blade. My skin feels smooth after a shave and not irritated at all. I agree with many of the other people in that it&#x27;s probably best to just rinse the shaver using water and a little bit of liquid soap under turbo-mode and following up using the cleaning system with &#x27;dry-only&#x27; cycle to keep the blades nice and clean. By doing so, you could save money by not having to buy those proprietary soap cartridges. So far, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the foil rapidly deteriorating as some have reported, but I&#x27;ll probably update this review after I use the shaver for a longer period of time. If you&#x27;re thinking about replacing your blades or old shavers, this is definitely the model you want to look into and purchase. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two Norelco shavers and both ended up in failures. My second one which was only 1 1/2 years old had the battery fail. I opened up the unit to find that the battery was not replaceable since it was connected directly to the circuit board. Great Design? NOT ! - Now it&#x27;s time to follow the leader and get this Panasonic based on all the geat reviews. Thanks you for making it easier to select my next razor. Choco Bill</li>
            <li> Like most other reviews, I&#x27;ve been extremely impressed with the Panasonic ES8249 wet/dry shaver.  I also had tried many other electric shavers over the years, with little success.  I always found it somewhat funny that the instructions always said something to the effect of, \\&quot;use for 30 days, as skin may take time to adapt to electric razor use.\\&quot;  I could never go 30 days, as my neck would be nearly raw.    My first self-cleaning electric razor was a Braun, bought 2.5 years ago.  I&#x27;ve always been high on Braun products, and I will say I was satisfied.  The motor \\&quot;died\\&quot; recently, and I&#x27;d been reading the reviews on the Panasonic models, and thought I&#x27;d give one a try.  Best decision I ever made.  First, the model ES8249 was less expensive now than the Braun was 2.5 years ago.  But, most importantly, it shaves closer, with less time and effort, and it is more quiet, both shaving and during cleaning.    Yes, I read the reviews on how expensive the cleaning cartridges are.  I just chalk that up to part of the ownership experience of a self-cleaning shaver.  If you drive a Corvette, expect to pay more for the tires when it&#x27;s time to replace them than those for a Camry.    Seriously, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric razor all my life. Remington razors have always been my favorite razors until I bought this Panasonic. This Panasonic, undoubtly, is the best razor yet.</li>
            <li> Shaver does what it advertises.  Have to return the cleaning unit.  It did not work.</li>
            <li> Well I will let the detailed reviews stand on their own.  I like to shave is the shower, and I prefer blades.  However the cost of the new blades does not justify the quality of shave - they just don&#x27;t cut-it anymore.  Rechargeable electric  in the shower saves a bit of time, and cost.  I can shave with soap or body wash and get satisfactory results.  I do not have a extremely tough beard, but I do have my trouble spots.  This shaver really does a much better job on those trouble spots than other electric shavers - but not as good as a blade.  Also, this is not a single pass shaver, but I spend 3 minutes between shaving and cleaning shaving, during my shower.    I have not tried the charging base or the cleaning solution, just don&#x27;t want the clutter on my counter.      Very happy and would buy again.</li>
            <li> the shaver is pretty good, a little loud i think, but it is very smooth and quick.  It recharges very fast and its quite easy to clean with water and a little bit of soap.  Highly recommend, specially useful for the neck area.</li>
            <li> I had read the great reviews weeks ago, but when my older Panasonic died two days ago I was in a pickle and had to act fast.  I ordered this next day air and charged it the moment it arrived.  I had about two days of growth by now and this razor was absolutely terrific.  It is very lite and the flexibility of the head made it so easy to get around the contours of the jaw line.  The shave was quick and smoother than with any other razor I have ever had thanks to the rpm of the motor.  The cleaning station did its job as there wasn&#x27;t any debris left over.  This was worth the money and I would have paid more for it.</li>
            <li> After a year of daily usage, I can say this is the best unit I&#x27;ve purchased in the 10+ years of Panasonic wet/dry units.  Not only does it shave quick and close, but it does this quietly.  The larger head is a real plus.  The Charger/Cleaning unit charges quick, doing its job quietly and quicker than any previous model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Used Norelco for years, then switched to the latest Braun a couple of years ago.  Norelco was better at getting the hairs on my neck, but Braun seemed better on my face and came with a nice cleaning unit.  The Panasonic combines the best of both.  Nearly as good as Norelco on my neck and better than Braun on my face.  Shaves closer than the Braun and less irritation than either of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise-wise, it&#x27;s about the same loundess as the Braun, but at a higher pitch.  The noise level of the cleaner is about the same as Brauns.  If you&#x27;re looking for quiet operation, go with Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this cleaning unit over Brauns.  The heating/fan mechanism does a great job of drying the razor.  With the Braun, there was always a dampness to the razor in the morning.  The Panasonic is bone dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased both this razor and the Braun 5 series to compare head to head.  I tested both dry since the Braun will not shave a wet face.  I preferred the Panasonic shave to the Braun period.  I will tell you the same results can be achieved with both razors, however, it takes more time and (in my case) irritation with the Braun.  I give the Braun a slight edge for self-cleaning and sideburn trimmer.  These were only slightly better, but, (to be fair) they were.  The panasonic is the better shave and that&#x27;s what I was paying/looking for.</li>
            <li> My husband has had the opportunity to test the difference between the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic shaver and this Panasonic 8249. The Braun had trouble coping with the neck area whereas the Panasonic did a great job there. Where the Braun did a pretty good job, the Panasonic produced a fantastically smooth skin surface (I&#x27;m seconding his opinion!) That is why I&#x27;m writing this glowing review. I can truly appreciate the difference in the quality shave that this Panasonic gives. So if you are buying a shaver for your spouse, I recommend this one highly since you will definitely be enjoying the benefits of it. It gets five solid stars from me.</li>
            <li> Norelco has perhaps been the most comfortable electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.  However, they are slow and I was tired of going over and over the same area to get a close shave.  After reading reviews I chose the Panasonic, and I have been delighted from the very first shave.  No razor burn.  Fast shave.  Battery lasts for well over a week.  And a very pleasant surprise was the cleaning system that comes with it.  Just drop in the razor and turn it on.  About an hour later the razor is clean like new, and charged.  For travel, the compact travel cord can be packed without the bulky cleaning unit.  I&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it!</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.  My husband really likes it, and this is his first electric razor.  He said that the ONLY thing that is difficult is shaving his neck (all the curves are a bit hard to get), but I am sure he will get more used to it in time.  We are happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric shaver for the past 20 years.  I have had remington, braun, norelco and now this one.  This shaver gave me the closest shave I have ever experienced with absolutely no irritation or burn.  In only two shaves it is has already shown tremendous improvement over the norelco I had which was 80 dollars more when I bought it.    I have tried it with both pre shave electric ointment and with shaving cream.  In both cases it was amazing.  I had never had a wet shave with an electric shaver and it felt GREAT.    I highly recommend it, I have very delicate skin and this is already making a difference for me.  With the norelco I felt as if I had to press it hard against my skin to get an almost acceptable result.  Not the case with this Panasonic.    Buy it with confidence you won&#x27;t go wrong.  And yes, the cleaning tank is NOT needed, the shaver cleans perfectly with liquid soap and water. IF YOU CAN FIND IT WITHOUT THE CLEANING TANK I WOULD BY IT WITHOUT IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors over the years and have never been fond of them. But, my sensitive skin would turn red when I shaved with a blade.  After reading lots of reviews I ordered this about a year ago and have never been happier.  It is smooth, close, easy to maintain, and does a really good job.  The only complaint is that the cleaner does clog up now and then, but a simple rinse takes care of that.  I liked it so much in fact, that I bought each of my two son-in-laws one for Christmas.  Neither of them thought they would like an electric either, but I told them to try it for a month and then see.  After about a week, they said they would never go back to a blade.  The cleaning solution is hard to find, but if you order it from Amazon or Walmart, it is cheap and worth the investment.  A big thumbs up on this one.</li>
            <li> I had tried a few electric razors years ago and decided to see if the technology had really improved.  I bought the razor based on reviews that I had read online.  It cost me a net of $52 after all rebates so I thought it was worth a try.  It produces a decent shave in about 4 minutes for me.  It is still not equivalent to a blade shave, but passable.  Stays charged a long time, is easy to use and clean.  Only used the cleaning tank once.  Just put a little liquid soap on it and run it for a minute or so then rinse and I have a clean razor.  I do that about every three uses.  Need to use a blade every few days to get a good trim line for sideburns and goatee.  Overall a good machine and a good buy.</li>
            <li> Having used Braun products for the past 20 years I was a bit nervous to switch brands.  However, I knew after my first shave with the Panasonic that it was a keeper and far out performed my Braun products.  The unit provides the closest razor-like shave that I have ever had.  Battery life is long.  I sparingly use the clean cyle as I feel the \\&quot;required\\&quot; frequency to use it is too much.  Also, by following the prescribed cleaning cycles and time intervals for replacing the filter/soap cartridge would become somewhat pricey.  Bottom line: A great shavor at a great price.</li>
            <li> I returned this shaver due mainly to its annoying high-pitched whining noise.  The shave was not much better than my 2 year old Norelco for my beard, and the cleaning procedure sounded too complex.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He was using the same 3-circle shaver for over 10 years so I thought it was time he got a new shaver. After reading all the reviews and showing him the top picks, he chose this one. The shaver can be used directly in the shower which is where he loves to use it the most. He only voiced two minor complaints, but neither was bad enough for him to send it back. First, he noticed the blades feel hotter when using it in the shower than when he uses it dry. Second, his facial hair grows in all different directions and he has more trouble using this flat type to get to all the hairs than he did with the 3-circle shaver.  He likes the swivel head, it has a lot of flexibility. He likes the 4 blade/3 type combination. He loves the cleaning machine. It is a little loud so not something you would start before bed time. The cleaning/charging station can be programmed for different combos. The full combo is to clean/dry/charge. He mostly uses that one. You can also just clean the shaver with water and put it on dry/charge. If you just need to charge it, then you can do that, but the cord to the charger also fits the shaver directly for charging so you have options. The display on the shaver tells you how much charge is left and how long it was used. The cleaning fluid is priced low enough that I don&#x27;t mind buying the replacements. If you use the shaver daily, then you get 1 month from a cartridge no matter how often you clean it. That is because if you save it up until the end of the week, it still has 7 days of dirty to clean so you might as well let it clean everyday so you can enjoy a clean shave every day.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy an electric razor with the type of head featured with this model, but I&#x27;m very happy with the results. It shaves quickly and very cleanly. I also like the low charge warning where the razor actually starts to slow down without stopping.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have ever had.  Had Norelco&#x27;s over the years, but they did not give a good shave.  The Panasonic provides a reasonalbly close shave (dry)without any irritation.</li>
            <li> this shaver admittedly shaves the face well, but does not work well on the neck/under chin area - in fact, its pretty disappointing in light of the overwhelming number of great reviews.  although the shaver is technically wet/dry, it basically doesn&#x27;t work if you use it with shaving cream so you can forget that option (unless you enjoy an hour long shave that goes nowhere...).  dry mode is obviously less comfortable but it gets the job done.  the battery life on this unit also surprisingly sucks.  it takes at least 20% of a charge on a single shave.      bottom line, either i grow titanium hair follicles or this shaver is simply not that great.  straight razor kicks its ass any day of the week, and i regret spending the cash on this model.</li>
            <li> An amazingly smooth and fast shaver. I just wish the cleaning/charging unit was smaller. To that end, I&#x27;d be willing to do away with the automatic cleaning feature. It&#x27;s not worth it. One more thing to take care of.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I prefer shaving with a blade, but if I had a really great electric that didn&#x27;t take just as long to give me a good shave, I would opt for that. Unfortunately, this product won&#x27;t convince me to make the switch.  While it does a perfectly adequate job for an electric, I find that there are razors for $40 less that do just as good a job.  One thing that was nice about it was that it actually seemed to do better in wet conditions or right after a shower.  I have a very assymetrical hair growth on my neck, and I found that this shaver wasn&#x27;t very efficient there.  Like with most electrics I had to go over and over it until I got results (except for a Braun I owned years ago).  Shop around for something that&#x27;s less money.  I think you&#x27;ll be just as satisfied.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a number of different types and brands of electric shavers and this one exceeds them all. I&#x27;ve actually just ordered my second one from Amazon today because after over a year and a half, my old charging/cleaning base has developed a leak and it&#x27;s not completely drying the shaver either. I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be widespread since I can&#x27;t find any other reviews with the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is still going strong and giving great, close shaves even though I&#x27;m still using the original foil and cutters. I wanted to replace just the base but it appears I can only do so directly from Panasonic, and at a cost of over $100 with shipping, it makes no sense not to just replace the whole thing here. I assume I&#x27;ll need to replace the cutters and foil at some point anyway and I&#x27;m saving money ordering this kit. I do really like the base as it helps keep the the blades both clean and sharp (by virtue of cleanliness). I&#x27;ll probably just use the old one as my travel shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With previous shavers, I&#x27;ve received decent shaves but if I wanted a really smooth shave, I&#x27;d have to grab the old razor and gel. I have sensitive skin so razor burn has always been the primary reason for trying electric shavers. With the ES8249, I can dry shave and get close to what I can achieve with a razor. This is what I do most days for work, etc. If I&#x27;m going out or otherwise want a super-smooth shave, I just carry it in the shower and use a little lather. This gives me just as smooth of a shave as I can get with a razor but with no irritation. I even used it a while back when I was shaving my whole head and, done in the shower, it was quick, painless and very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered trying something new rather than getting the same shaver since my old one is actually still working perfectly. The newer high-end model looks really cool with the extra motor in the head but I just can&#x27;t justify the extra $$. I know this one works and does a great job. I&#x27;m very happy with it and look forward to many more years of close shaves!does a great job. I&#x27;m very happy with it and look forward to many more years of close shaves!</li>
            <li> It could be due to the fact that my face is still getting used to the shaver, but I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between this shaver and my 20-something-year-old 3-head Norelco.  Tried it a couple times in the shower with a gel, and found that I had to go over it again after I got out of the shower.  This is supposed to have 4 blades, but there are only 2 apparent.  Not sure how to confirm that there are indeed 4 blades, but I&#x27;ll trust that there are.</li>
            <li> I owned Norelco shavers up until about 2003, when I decided standing over the sink for a half hour going over and over one spot wasn&#x27;t worth it.  I tried the wet/dry model, and even the one that \\&quot;shot\\&quot; out the Nivea shaving gel. For the last 7 years I&#x27;ve been using a Gillette Mach 3 razor, with regular old shaving gel...however I found myself letting the beard grow longer between shaves because of the amount of time it took to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently my buddy bought a Braun Series 3 shaver, but never really said much about it...certainly never bragged about how great it was.  I decided last Friday after my boss jokingly said \\&quot;wow your letting your beard come in huh\\&quot; that it was time to try something new.  After searching and reading reviews for every men&#x27;s shaver manufactured I decided to order the Panasonic ES8249S Arc IV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered with overnight Saturday delivery, and tore the shaver out of the box first thing.  I gotta say everything from the packaging to the build quality of the razor are top notch.  The razor looks very high tech (a must for a tech geek like myself) and the led screen is a nice touch!  I set the recharger up in my bathroom, and immediately started to charge the shaver, the orange glow of the screen was kinda cool looking and the percent charged is a nice feature to have when you gotta fly out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a half hour I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and had to try my new purchase, I removed it from the recharger and pressed the chrome button...with a nice little hum the new shaver came to life.  I touched the cutting foils to my cheek and couldn&#x27;t believe how it removed the coarse, long hairs.  The spot was completely smooth and clean, I continued, my neck, jaw, and even the stragglers on my upper cheek were cut off, and my face felt like it did when I was 8!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arc IV never skipped a beat, never pulled or tugged a hair, and left my face feeling fresh and smooth.  I must say my faith in electric shavers has been restored, after years of using a straight edge...I finally found an electric shaver that gives me the same effect without having to change blades or have my skin feel irritated afterward...thanks Panasonic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first try of the razor was a dry run, I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the wet shave in the shower, if it worked as well as it did dry...wet should be a real treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys if you need a new shaver do not even hesitate to pick this Panasonic up!er years of using a straight edge...I finally found an electric shaver that gives me the same effect without having to change blades or have my skin feel irritated afterward...thanks Panasonic!    My first try of the razor was a dry run, I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the wet shave in the shower, if it worked as well as it did dry...wet should be a real treat.      Guys if you need a new shaver do not even hesitate to pick this Panasonic up!</li>
            <li> Why a 3 star rating and not 5?    Shaving Performance &#x3D; 5 stars  Battery/Electrical Stamina &#x3D; 1 star    Panasonic has a big problem with their batteries in the wet/dry models. Yes, models. This is my 3rd Panasonic wet/dry model to fail within its respective warranty period. After 8 - 15 months of use (5-6 days per week - @ 3 minutes per day) an \\&quot;888\\&quot; appears on the screen. The unit fails to turn on when the start button is pressed BUT it may turn on by itself, go into \\&quot;hyper\\&quot; mode for 15 seconds, then turn off. Then off to the repair facility it goes not to return for 30 days.    This may not be a big deal for some guys, but imo spending $150 for something to fail within 1 - 2 years is not a good purchase. My older Braun shavers lasted 5-6 years easy. I had hoped they would improve performance with the newer models (ES8249 was the newest at the time) but it has failed just like the others. I take very good care of the shaver. I let the battery run down each week before charging, clean it every day with soap and water after shaving and once a week in the base station. It has never been dropped or misused. If I could change the batteries myself and reseal the unit - nbd- but I understand the batteries are hard to get and they have to be soldered in. Way past the effort I would want to expend.    Now for the 5 star - what a close and smooth shave! I use Proraso shave cream in the shower (if you are a shower shaver do yourself a favor and order some right now!) and I could not ask for a closer shave. I need to go over the neck area several times to achieve this but the shaver is so smooth there is no irritation.  Now that I have had to go back to the manual razor I am unsatisfied.    This is frustrating as the shaver performs beautifully but does not last. I do not want to spend  $200 for the newest model http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ES-LA93-K-Mens-Shaver/dp/B002N5MHLK/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_pb_t - it hasn&#x27;t been around long enough to fail yet so the jury is still out.    Panasonic - please address this issue. These are great shavers but they have to be able to last for SEVERAL years before needing service.</li>
            <li> In two words folks, BUY IT! I&#x27;ve been using electrics since I was thirteen; I&#x27;m now forty-nine. Just gives you a little idea of how long I&#x27;ve been using electrics and exclusively for that matter. For the last 20-25 years I&#x27;ve used nothing but the highest-end Norelco&#x27;s and Braun&#x27;s. After using this Panasonic I won&#x27;t be going back, ever! In fact this razor is so good I&#x27;m going to be buying another one for my other house. I&#x27;m going to be buying the ES-LA93-K, again couldn&#x27;t be happier!    Two of the most important things about shaving: speed and closeness. This razor has them both down to a well oiled machine! I&#x27;ve never shaved with a blade but I would imagine just how my face feels this is the next best thing. An added bonus is; since it&#x27;s such a close shave I don&#x27;t get the five &#x60;clock shadow I did with the other two brands. Sometimes I can even go two days between shaves! I used to think that the Norelco was the fastest shave but again the Panasonic wins again. That&#x27;s how it used to be, you either had a close shave or a fast one. At one time I even had one Braun and one Norelco to cover both bases, not anymore!     I didn&#x27;t write this review for six months just to see if the speed and the closeness held up and it has. Also, since it shaves quickly the razor can go 7-10 days between charging. One last thing, rugged! So far I&#x27;ve dropped it and I shave with it in my car, so it gets bounced around. No problems!      Again, try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Phenomenal!</li>
            <li> This is now my fifth upgrade of a Panasonic razor over the past 10 years. This is the very best at shaving my heavy beard. A great item. Very fast charge and can last for 10 days for me on a single charge.</li>
            <li> I have had most brands of shavers in my 50 years but never Panasonic. I&#x27;ve always liked that brand though for TV and audio electronics. My last Braun 8000 series shaver, over 7 years old, still works but the cleaning system died. Shaving was a chore and took over ten minutes to get fairly close. The reviews of the Panasonic sold me and I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now.     It is truly amazing compared to the Braun and my previous razors. It makes an annoying, high-pitched whine, but wow, does it shave close and fast. I can shave reasonably well in about 4 minutes. When I get obsessive, it takes 6. Obsessive with the Braun took 12 to 15 minutes, even with new blades. I&#x27;d keep finding rough spots and would always give up before I got anywhere near as close a shave as the Panasonic ARC IV Nanotech does.    The Panasonic shaver head is very large and covers a lot of face, which likely accounts for much of the speed. But I think the whine, due to a vibration technology, cuts through long and short beard differently than the older styles. It doesn&#x27;t seem to miss as much stubble as the Braun did. And it can cut longer stubble without pulling the hairs. The Braun hurts at close to 1 mm length and I haven&#x27;t had a single hair pull at any length (up to 2-3 mm) with the Panasonic.     Unfortunately, the long whisker trimmer does hurt when cutting even 2 mm stubble. The Braun&#x27;s does not, so I will have to keep it around for cutting the longer whiskers after not shaving for a while. I have not tried the Panasonic wet yet. The cleaning system uses a soapy module and water in its cleaning system and is much quieter than the Braun, which always scared my wife when it would start up again after a pause.    I always despised shaving, but, at least for this first month, I&#x27;ve kind of been looking forward to it.</li>
            <li> Why the but? Because of a few quality issues.     Some background: I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic wet/dry electrics for about a decade. The 8249 is my third generation shaver.     I use this shaver in shower with [[ASIN:B0017OZYN6 Lab Series: Skincare for Men: Maximum Comfort Shave Cream 8 oz]].  I have a medium beard and should shave once a day to look less bad.     What&#x27;s great: This is best wet electric shaver I&#x27;ve found.    What&#x27;s bad: The led battery life display is unreliable. Sometimes it displays random characters. Previous generations of these Panasonic shaver--I always buy the top-of-the-line models being offered--also  failed the same way. I also resent the way Panasonic \\&quot;improves\\&quot; the product every two years.     The 8249 is a 13,000 rpm motor. The latest model, the Panasonic ES-LA93-K Men&#x27;s Shaver, is a 14,000 rpm motor.     Why can&#x27;t Panasonic just make something that&#x27;s going to be the best for more than two years?    I&#x27;m now considering the [[ASIN:B002N5MHLK Panasonic ES-LA93-K  Men&#x27;s Shaver]]. But the price was originally $299 and now it is selling for $169. That tells me Panasonic is going to roll out a new model again and it will be better.     So, Mr. Panasonic, I&#x27;m not buying your latest model, the almost two-year old Panasonic ES-LA93-K. I&#x27;m waiting for the next generation because Panasonic cannot be trusted to sell me a product that will be great for five years and keeps making obsolete its $300 shavers every two years.      But please know that I resent that. It&#x27;s a disservice to consumers and bad for the Panasonic brand.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best that I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve had a couple different Norelco&#x27;s and have tried a Braun shaver in the past. None of them did as well on all lengths of hair and got as close as this shaver. I use this shaver on my face and head. I&#x27;ve tried both wet and dry and this shaver works well in both environments. Before I got this shaver, my wife had no idea my face could be so smooth. There&#x27;s rarely any razor burn (sometimes around the adam&#x27;s apple, that&#x27;s it) but it still gets incredibly close. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I ended up getting this razor at Target on vacation after my Norelco died (after many years of valiant service). I had no idea what kind of shaver I was getting when I bought this Arc IV but I am incredibly happy that I stumbled upon it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and hard facial hair, and that resulted in \\&quot;tired\\&quot; skin with occasional rashes and redness when using Gillette&#x27;s blades. I&#x27;ve used them for many years, and was always looking for an alternative to alleviate skin problems. I tried a Remington&#x27;s electric shaver about 8 years ago, yet didn&#x27;t like it and returned it. Then I tried Norelco about 3 years ago, with better, but similar result (significant irritation). Recently I decided to give electrics another try, since technology keeps improving, and found this shaver. After reading reviews on Amazon and other sites, and studying the specifications, I decided to give it a chance, and I am very glad I did. I&#x27;ve shaved with it about 8 times now (every time with Aveeno Sensitive Skin gel) in the shower (love the wet mode), and my skin looks much better already, and the process is much more pleasurable than with Gillette blades. I tried the base&#x27;s washing cycle once, it&#x27;s a bit loud and goes on for 2+ hours, however it is not really an issue. The shaver washes well in the shower, and once in a while I will wash it using the base. Excellent shaver overall, and it didn&#x27;t even take the 3 weeks \\&quot;adjusting time\\&quot; to prove it.</li>
            <li> i got this a couple of weeks ago. i first used it dry on a few days growth. seemed similar to the last electric razor i tried 10 years ago; not too impressed. waited a couple of days and tried using it &#x27;wet&#x27; using my usual shaving cream. it took longer than my blade but i was really impressed, i felt as clean as using a blade!     i have sensitive skin and have not shaved two days in a row for probably 10 years or more. within 24 hours of my first electric wet shave i tried electric wet shaving again; guess what, it was perfect! i can now shave everyday if i wish and feel as clean as a using a blade! it used to bother me having two days and more stubble going to meetings and such, but now i need not worry.    it takes me longer than using a blade, probably around 9 - 10 minutes. i think it takes me this long as i&#x27;m figuring out all the best angles to get the different grain directions of my hair. i expect this time to come down as i get more familiar with the style of shaving.      i definitely recommend this both for the price and the shaving results.</li>
            <li> My husband said nothing could shave like a straight razor.  I bought him the Panasonic for Christmas. He loves it. He  said it is just like a razor but so much easier. Would   tell everyone to purchase one.</li>
            <li> The razor arrived in excellent condition.  After a full charge, I used my razor.  It took several days to get the grain of my beard growth down, but after that my shaves&#x27;s are better than any I have had in the past.    I will buy this razor again if necessary.    Swiss watch nut.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver 2 years ago, after reading glowing reviews. (There were some questions of authenticity of reviews, but i decided to buy anyway). I should mention that i have long used Norelco triple headers, but have also tried and returned Braun and Remington shavers within their free return periods). I occasionally also use a blade in the shower.  The word was that the Panasonic offered a shave as close as a blade.     Pros:  Acceptable shave, but found it took as much as 8 to 9 minutes to get one.    Cons:  1. Even at 8 to 9 minutes, quality not even close to that of a a blade, nor for that matter even a Norelco.  2. Cleaning system, being water-based, has to be changed according to time passed since cartridge touches the water, not the number of times the razor is cleaned. Otherwise, mold starts to grow.  3. Length of time for complete cleaning and charging cycle is quite long.  4. Difficult and somewhat frustrating to clean the inside of the cleaning chamber. Need Q tips, etc.    Final word: While i acknowledge that skin and beard types vary, for my combo of tough beard and sensitive skin, I prefer a Norelco shave to that of the Panasonic when using an electric.    (See review for the shaver i have replaced the Panasonic with, the Norelco 1290, separately)</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd electric razor I have purchased and it does it&#x27;s job for the last three months. I wished it cuts closer to leave the skin smooth but it doesn&#x27;t. It has problems with stiff course facial hair and I have to go over the problem spots around my jaw line multiple times to get it close enough. If not, I have to result to using a blade razor to make it smooth.  I tested using it in the shower and dry and did not see the difference. The Cleaning system is a gimmick. Shower takes care of any loose clippings. I removed one star since they \\&quot;lost\\&quot; my rebate. They told me to send a copy to them only to have it rejected since it was a copy. From previous purchases, Panasonic does not honor most rebates so you have been duly advised.    --UPDATE --  After this post, I got a call from Panasonic&#x27;s Rebate vendor company and they have found my paperwork in good order, check&#x27;s in the mail, and to edit my comments to reflect excellent service. Check arrived so I&#x27;ll add one more star to say, thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought my razor about a month-and-a-half ago.  I never really liked using an electric, but I&#x27;m a pretty busy stay-at-home dad and there are days I just don&#x27;t have time to shave.  This razor has proven me wrong about my feelings of electric razors all together!  From the first time I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve had a clean shave equal to the shave I get from a Gillette Fusion or Mach 3.  I love the wet/dry feature and cleaning is a snap with the charger/cleaner.  The only couple of problems I can see is that the cleaning process is pretty loud and as I have a pretty thick beard, I have trouble getting a few stray neck hairs here and there.  But, as I said, it&#x27;s just as good as a Gillette Fusion or Mach 3.  The price tag is manageable and it&#x27;s been an awesome value for the dollar.  I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> I used an electric shaver several years ago and my face never did adjust to it. I grew tired of replacing the expensive cleaning cartridges that would dry up after a couple weeks, so I switched to a razor. This still irritated my face, so I decided to give a newer shaver a try and went with this product. I had a perfect shave the very first time with no pain or red bumps. I have been using it for about a week and I love it. I am able to shave in about 4 minutes while the shower is warming up as opposed to closer to 10 minutes with the razor. I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking to replace an existing one or leave the razor behind.</li>
            <li> Absolutely outstanding product. I have never been a fan of electric razors and had not used one in over a decade. My last electric razor was a rotary style. I decided to give this shaver a try after reading multiple reviews and performing some research on my own. I have had it for two months and absolutely love it. The shave I get when I use it dry is nearly as close as a blade. It is fast and easy and preferable to a traditional razor. Where the product really shines, however, is when used as a wet shaver in the shower. It is absolutely as close as a blade. It leaves my face as smooth as if I had shaved both with and then against the grain with a razor. Don&#x27;t believe reports that say a foil shaver doesn&#x27;t do well on a few days growth either. I usually shave every day, but I have noticed that if I miss a few days the shave is still fast and the quality is not diminished. Just for an FYI I use the Neutrogena shave lotion that comes in a tube when I use the razor wet. Wonderful shave.</li>
            <li> Of all the shavers that I have had, this one beats the others by far. I highly recommend this shaver for guys especially who have different types of facial and neck hair. I have a very rough growth pattern on my chin, and a very sensitive skin type on my throat. It shaves both area without a problem and has given me no razor burn. Love it.</li>
            <li> after decades of using various electric shavers on an intermittant basis, i have finally found one that works just great.  provides a close shave with very little discomfort--much less than razor blades--that gets the job done very quickly.  i am very pleased and surprised at the performance of this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several electric shavers since the 1950&#x27;s as well as shaving manually for many years, and I can now say that the Panasonic ES8249S gives me the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I challenge anyone to tell the difference between the results of this electric shaver and a manual shave.  The facts that you can use the shaver in the shower and always have it spotlessly clean and ready by using the accompanying self-cleaning recharger makes this electric shaver ideal for any man who wants a consistently clean shave in least amount of time and effort. The flexible head allows you to get a close shave anywhere on your face, and if you prefer to shave with a stationary shaver, just flip the pivot action button.  The only negative with this unit is the hair trimmer - I wish it was a little larger.  Bottom-line:  A great electric shaver at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best out of the last five I have owned. It cuts the best, is quiet and easy to clean. I would recommend it to everyone who uses an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> to preface this - I&#x27;ve ordered multiple things on amazon over the last few years, based on customer feedback. I have found that customer feedback has been EXTREMELY accurate time and time again, and it is my duty to finally review this and other items for others.  So happy I bought this - thank you to all the other masses that have put this on top of the pack for me. SIMPLY AMAZING. As close as the regular blade shave in only 3 minutes. No tugging, no chance of hurting myself, blades don&#x27;t get dull forever. Super silent, and self cleaning and charge holds for what seems like forever.  SO FREAKING HAPPY I GOT THIS. I&#x27;ve had BRAUN, SAMSUNG, PHILLIPS shavers before, and have been using Fusion and Fusion power blades for the last year or so. This is BETTER than any other shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, shaves as close as the fusion blades (nearly to 99%), but that is PERFECT for me. I never wanted my SKIN to be shaved off with fusion blades, so I look like a baby. I want that .01% of stuble that you can \\&quot;sort of\\&quot; feel.   Perfect</li>
            <li> I have owned 7 electric shavers over the past 25 years and this shaver gives me the closest shave of them all. I also have sensitive skin and the &#x27;soft&#x27; setting really prevents the skin irritation that I normally have after shaving. After reading several reviews before my purchase, I do agree with people who stated that cleaning system is not that impressive and takes 4 times longer than my previous shaver and doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job. However, I like everything else about it.</li>
            <li> Awesome electric razor. Gets closer than any other electric I&#x27;ve tried. Way better than the Norelco I had previously.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Norelco user, but recently was dissappointed after trying a new Arcitec model. Got this one to replace it and I am very pleased. I got a close shave quickly on the very first usage, i.e. no break in time. The trimmer is great, and the shaver is easy to clean. In fact, I don&#x27;t really see the need for the large cleaning, charging device, as you can clean it under the tap with body wash, and could just as easily plug it in to charge it. Also handles neck hairs very well, which the Arcitec would not cut. Have not tried it wet, but irritation level is low shaving dry.</li>
            <li> Previously had owned a Braun.  Was going to buy one again, but Amazon had a fantastic price on this.  Was considering this one also.  Obviously the price made the decision.  Works great.  Better than my old Braun (though I am sure the new models work great too).  No razor burn.  Does a very good job.  I like the cleaning system better than my Braun.  The cleaner costs less and lasts a lot longer.  Nice close shave.</li>
            <li> The razor was received on time, and is living up to my expectations.  I changed from a Norelco elctric because I was not getting the shave I used to get, even with new blades.  I have been using a Norelco shaver for almost 30 years, but this Panasonic is shaves me quickly, and completely.  I don&#x27;t always use the cleaning system, but when I do it does a good job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. Just as close as a blade shave but much less irritation. I was skeptical at the beginning as I had a Norelco which gave me a lot of irritation but the Panasonic is absolutely amazing. Maybe I didn&#x27;t give the Norelco enough time to adjust but the Panasonic worked perfectly from the first day; didn&#x27;t need any time to adjust.    It gives a bit of irritation (just sensitivity but not redness) but it goes away after a few hours. You just need some practice and figure out in which direction to shave.  The base may be useful if you really do not have 5 min to clean it under the tap every day. I do the no base cleaning and one base cleaning a week.  No complaints so far. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> As a serious sufferer of skin irritation I gave this shaver a try based on Amazon&#x27;s reviews, and wow!!! this thing rocks.  Normally I do not use electric razors, they are so slow and leave even worse irritation than blades, but this shaver is fast, shaves close and leaves skin great without any cuts or bumps.  Also the charger - cleaning system is a plus, less work for you and great maintenance for your new best friend.</li>
            <li> I was given this shaver as a gift about one month ago, and have been using it since.  The shaver is outstanding! I previously owned a more expensive Braun shaver, but this shaver gives a closer shave.  It works great wet or dry without any razor burns. THE PANASONIC ES8429 IS THE BEST SHAVER I HAVE OWNED.  I will not go back to shaving with the more expensive shaver.  Highly recommend it!  [[ASIN:B0021AG0Z6 Panasonic ES8249S Arc IV Nanotech Vortex Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Silver]]</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. After the first shave he got rid of the one he had.  He loves the close shave, quickness of shaving, holds a charge a long time, the travel case, and the fact that it gets cleaned really well, and is comfortable in his hand. He hasn&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet.  Terrific price here on Amazon, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Having had Brauns until about 9 years ago, I was very pleased with the last Panasonic shaver I had.  It&#x27;s last 9 years! The only problems with it were it was frankly quite noisy and it didn&#x27;t get longer hairs very well.  If I went several days or if I missed some, the longer hairs required me to use the trimmer.  When the battery (which I treated well) on it was down to about 3-4 days use I decided I needed a new shaver.  I bought a ES-RT31S because it was very well priced.  Slower speed but I didn&#x27;t think that would really matter.  It does.  I returned it.  Then I tried a Phillips mid-level rotary since my brother in law thinks highly of them.  It basically doesn&#x27;t shave closely.  Quiet though.  Bought an ES8239 - and it&#x27;s good.  Shaves closer than my admitted old Panasonic and captures longer hairs better than any electric shaver I&#x27;ve used (30+ years).  What I don&#x27;t think it will do though is last 9 years because it has a Li-Ion battery.  Ni Cads can last a really long time if taken care of.  Li Ion batteries have a life span measured in years even if not used.  Much more convenient, but I really don&#x27;t think it will last as long.  It&#x27;s not as solid either, but I&#x27;m pleased.  I don&#x27;t use the cleaner - haven&#x27;t even popped open the capsule.  Problems include:  The base is small and it&#x27;s not stable when standing upright - it falls over all the time. A victim of fashion.  The head is all one piece now and expensive to replace.  It also falls off somewhat easily (remember it falls over a lot).  A definite recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year and a half out, I can further add that the solution to the shaver falling over is to place it handle side down into the cleaner.  Battery seems to not have lost much capacity.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on electric razors, even though my husband skeptical. He was amazed the first time he used the razor. Very smooth, he thought it could be the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot;.  Second time, not near as smooth, ended up using a regular razor to finish up the shave.  He gave a third shot, no go.  It was bummer.  He would really to have one that would work well for him.  **However, the shipping, the return and refund were completely hassle-free.  I love Amazon. :)</li>
            <li> I used the blade in my youth, but the sensitivity of my skin was too great. So for the past 35 years, I have been using electric shavers. I started with Norelco, but then went Braun - and have stayed with them until now. I was using the Activator 8550 series for the last 5 years. It was OK but buying the foils, cutter blocks, cleaner, and other expensive maintenance items seemed endless. I eventually had to replace the case as well, due to the on/off switch malfunction that is popular with them. I had to keep a spare cutter block/foil pair handy because I want every shave to be as good as possible and never got more than 6 months out of one without performance suffering.    It finally got to where it just wouldn&#x27;t shave close no matter what I did. It also took way too long to shave, requiring too many repeated swaths. The shaver motor would cavitate with a high-pitched motor whine unless I \\&quot;inched it\\&quot; into uncut beard areas slowly.     It was an expensive shave when new and I dreaded replacing it. However, it had to be done. I researched, read many reviews, and the lot fell on this Panasonic Arc IV. I was glad it arrived in only 3 days, even using the \\&quot;Supersaver\\&quot; free shipping.    I wanted to try it out using a shaving gel, so I got some \\&quot;Gillette fusion Hydra\\&quot; stuff at the local drugstore. Man what a shave. This thing shaves as close as I remember a blade ever being, AND faster. If the gel I apply starts to dry on a part of my face, (when completing side A and moving to side B) I simply wet my hand, splash on just a little water, and finish up without any problem. No nicks, bumps, or redness. I am very happy with the shaver and only hope it continues to perform as it does now. It is a true baby-hiny-smooth shave!     The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; I can think of is that \\&quot;the head\\&quot; (being a bit large when comparing to my old shaver) cannot fit around my ears to shave the side-of-the-head areas just above them. I keep my hair short and usually shave about 3/8\\&quot; above my ears. I therefore used a disposable blade razor, just to do those 2 little areas. It&#x27;s not a big deal and I doubt others will have the issue. But to shave close in those 2 areas afterward - well, I haven&#x27;t quite figured that out as yet. The pop-up trimmer is also excellent for trimming up. The LCD communication is a good addition too, although the constant flashing seems a bit exaggerated. I am also pleased that it uses a Lithium-Ion battery, as opposed to the NiCads of old.    All in all - This is a very well designed unit. The charger, modes, cleaning, sound, and grip are totally excellent.</li>
            <li> This razor works great although the cleaning base station has issues when drying after cleaning. It doesn&#x27;t work once in awhile.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor on a daily deal from amazon for less than $100. For that money this is an amazing buy. My reason for purchasing it was because my 4 year old Phillips Norelco was starting to get dull and i was tired of missing spots when i was in a hurry to get somewhere and the replacement blades were terribly expensive.     The reason i gave this product 4 stars is because of the impracticality of the cleaning dock. It is much faster to just wash off under the faucet than it is to put it through the process of cleaning it automatically. The dock is also very noisy for me when it isn&#x27;t doing anything. I feel the need to unplug it when it isn&#x27;t in use because you can hear the buzzing from the light flashing on the front every few seconds. The advantage of having a dock is that you have somewhere to put your razor when you aren&#x27;t using it.    The second reason i gave this product only 4 stars is for the battery life. It is absolutely awful compared to my old Phillips. My Phillips, even after 4 years, could hold a single charge for almost an entire month. I&#x27;ve had this one for a week and by looking at the timer on it I use it about 2.5-3 minutes per use and i used it maybe 5 times before it ran down to 10% power and I had to charge it back up.    All in all this is a good, clean cutting razor that is very simple and easy to clean. I would recommend it but I personally wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $120 for it.  11/11/11 update  This is the best razor i&#x27;ve ever had as far as closeness shaving. I still wish it would hold a charge longer though.</li>
            <li> I like the shaver overall; however, it has some rather annoying cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s fairly comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;- It shaves pretty well, even under the neck (make sure to do it when the skin is dry)&lt;br /&gt;- It shows how much time you spend shaving and what percentage of battery remains (after two 2.5 minute shaves it shows 90% left)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning system uses soap from Panasonic cartridge and you have to change water in a little attachment cup every time you change the soap cartridge (monthly)&lt;br /&gt;- The soap the cleaning system uses... well, it smells like a dead dog.  I kid you not.  It&#x27;s NOT a fresh lemony smell my Braun 360 used to have after cleaning.  I didn&#x27;t notice it until I got replacement soap cartridges on Amazon.  After a while I started noticing the smell (like a dirty old wet towel - another way to describe it).  I tried changing cartridges more frequently (every three weeks), I am cleaning it every day, but... it never fails - smells like a dead dog or old wet towel, take your pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: If you are willing to spend $70 more - buy Braun series 7 electric shaver.  The cleaning system is hands down better and the shaver is excellent (read the reviews).  If you just want an inexpensive shaver that is really good - get Panasonic ES8243A for $80.  It&#x27;s pretty much the same shaver, just has no cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Since this is the first electric razor I have used, I was amazed at how well it seems to shave. I have been using it for 3-4 weeks now and I am delighted with it. I still have many questions - when do you replace the blades, how long will this battery hold up, etc. but so far the shave and the battery are both top notch. I have used the self cleaning/recharge station twice now and it works well. I do not really see a need for the self cleaning station but maybe that indicates that it is working.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Now that I have had this for two years I want to say that it still works great. I have replaced the blades and screen twice (but am not sure that is was necessary - just felt it was \\&quot;time\\&quot;) and it continues to please me. The cleaning/recharge station still functions as expected. I will not be replacing this unless a) I find a TERRIFIC deal or b) it stops working. If it stops working I believe I will replace it with another Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after my old Braun was not doing the job anymore. The Braun was a dry shaver and I wanted a wet/dry shaver. I researched plenty of shavers and I got a Norelco three head shaver. It was worse than my Braun! So I looked at the Panasonics. They were expensive but I was sick of the razor burn.. I settled on this unit and even saved about $50 by using amazon!!  It worked great immediately! They say it takes a while for your face to adjust but my first shave was the best shave I have had in years. Plus the next few shaves got even better!  Great shaver, fast quiet motor, looks great, feels good in your hand, charges quick, easy to clean...the best!!  No more razor burn either! I shave with Edge sensitive skin gel with a wet face. After my shave I splash cold water on my face and then put some Nivea after shave balm on. Perfect every time!!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this one is that it is VERY loud. Like, I drowned out my neighbor&#x27;s weed eater while shaving. In all fairness, I didn&#x27;t buy an electric shaver for silence. The cleaning base is completely useless (well, it kinda looks neat). Like another reviewer said, it takes about an hour and it&#x27;s very noisy. Just drop some soap on the foil, turn it on for a bit, open it up and rinse it out. I use an electric shaver because my skin isn&#x27;t very smooth, so I get cuts and irritation easily with a razor. My last shaver (same $50 Braun for 3 years) was excellent for my skin, but this Panasonic is much closer--nearly razor close--at the cost of significantly more irritation. This is why I&#x27;m still keeping the Braun around. It also has a solid feel and a good battery (so far). Also, the huge head makes certain areas hard to shave.</li>
            <li> I have always been skeptical about electronic shavers since they tend to be a little too rough on the skin, with that said i have very sensitive skin. Let me tell you this model is as smooth as it gets i have been using for a month now and it does a great job and a quick one too. No more shaving cream and razors for me... Loving it!</li>
            <li> This is my first Panasonic electric shaver.  I have always had Braun electric shavers in the past.  Although I have only used my new Panasonic 3 times thus far, to this point it is much better than my past Brauns, giving me a quicker shave, and a closer shave.  I switched to Panasonic this time because of the great deal I got with Amazon.com, and because of the reputation and reliability of Panasonic&#x27;s electronic products.</li>
            <li> Got a great deal on this razor for 90 bucks, best investment I ever made!  I wanted to make the shift from manual razors due to sensitive skin and razor bumps, this worked like a charm! There is nothing better than a hot lather shave with this razor, and the self-cleaner makes life so much easier. The only downfall is that it woke up my wife because the cleaning cycle is pretty loud, but as long as I set it for after she leaves there is no problem.  I would recommend this razor for anyone looking to move away from manual blades with sensitive skin. so far so good!</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco guy for 30+ years. This beats every Norelco model I have ever used. A wet shave means a great shave and so far this is the best, easist on my face shave ever. Does not matter if I have not shaved in 2+ days, it goes right thru it. Recommended, assuming this quality holds up over time but no reason it should&#x27;t. Panasonic is a good name.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic for 12 years and thought it was time to upgrade.  Researched a lot on Consumer Reports comparing Braun, Norelco, etc. and didn&#x27;t know if I needed the new features or the big difference between the $50 and $300 shaver.  I was leaning toward the Panasonic since I already had one and then I got a special email from Amazon than made my mind up for me.  $240 shaver for $80, so I got it.  Great product.  Very quiet, light weight, and shaves very close.  I didn&#x27;t know what to think about the cleaner. I didn&#x27;t under stand it.  I didn&#x27;t want to have to buy cleaner every week, month or whenever. Since it wasn&#x27;t something I did before I didn&#x27;t know if I needed/wanted it.  I really like it now.  I believe it it a matter of figuring out a routine.  I put the cleaning/charging station in my closet and keep my shaver in my bathroom drawer.  I clean/charge the unit once a week and because I rinse off the shaver before I put it in the cleaning solution I&#x27;m able to extend the cleaner to last 4-6 months without having to replace it and the shaver feels and smells clean.  I&#x27;m better now than I was with my old shaver with regards to cleaning.  I like the cleaning station now.  And, love the shaver.</li>
            <li> e~good thing!!!!!!!!very useful~just buy it as a birthday gift  for my father,he is so happy when receive it~next time i will buy another one for my brother~</li>
            <li> I was a long time Braun user, my Braun Pulsonic had a broken trimmer and it was time to get a new shaver.  I never much liked rotary systems so I decided to try out a Panasonic for a change.  I&#x27;m impressed.  Pros:  - closer shave than Braun&#x27;s products  - Shaves the neck very well  - quieter cleaning system  - Cleaning system seems better, no big fluid cartridges, uses tap water and powder.  Haven&#x27;t had to refill yet so not sure if it&#x27;s messy to change the water.  Time will tell if it&#x27;s cheaper.  Cons:  - After cleaning (12 hours after), the shaver seems to not glide as well over my face.  It&#x27;s a little \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; it seems.  I might give up on the cleaning system and clean by hand (the instructions provide a method for cleaning use liquid soap).  - The head is a little too big to fit in my upper lip region.  I can only fit one side of the shaving foil in there.  This is my reason for a 4 star rating instead of 5.  Not really a con, but it does feel like it takes longer to shave, I have to move the shaver slower than the Braun.  But, again, it feels like it&#x27;s shaving closer to that may account for the slower speed.</li>
            <li> USED A BRAUN 8585 FOR YEARS, THIS BLOWS THAT TOTALLY AWAY!!!&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE THICK OLD BEARD, JUST ZIPS IT RIGHT OFF!!&lt;br /&gt;I JUST HATED TO SHAVE, NOT ANYMORE!!!&lt;br /&gt;BOUGHT THIS LAST SUMMER, STILL GOING STRONG!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am sick of buying disposable razors to shave my face and head with, and it has NOT disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a timer on it, and it shaves my head and face in less than 10 minutes, without tearing them up (I have sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can shave in or out of the shower (highly convenient) with this and you get a good, QUALITY shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must have if you are shopping for electric razors.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Norelco I had been using.  It provides a quick and close shave with no irritation.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My husband completely loves this razor.  He loves the good shave that he gets with it, and he loves the self-cleaning even more!</li>
            <li> When it came time to replace my aging Remington Microscreen 3, I purchased a Braun Series 5 Shaver on an impulse from the local Target. Once I got home I decided I better read some reviews before I opened the box, since I&#x27;d bought a $165.00 razor on impulse. I&#x27;m very glad I did. The Braun series 5 got nearly universal blah to bad reviews, so I took it back for a refund without even opening it.    After that I went the smart route and started reading reviews about different shavers on the web. I looked at several, but finally settled on the Panasonic ES8248S Arc IV, based on the sheer volume of positive reviews for this shaver. I have to say those who reviewed it before me did well in directing me to this shaver!    The shaver itself is outstanding. I have been very impressed with the closeness of the shave from this razor. I do not like to shave, and generally don&#x27;t shave on my days off unless I absolutely have to. I work 12 hour shifts, so have alternating 3 &amp; 4 day weekends. Needless to say I have some good growth going when it&#x27;s time to go to work again. I subsequently have to shave on my first day back on duty with a blade razor, as no electric is going to tackle 1/4 inch of course growth. I subsequently shave with a Gillette Mach 3 Turbo on the first day back on duty. I have found that under the jaw line wrapping onto my neck, I still have some rough stubble after shaving with the Mach 3. After I bought this razor, I tried cleaning up that last bit of stubble with the Arc IV and was amazed that it shaved closer than the blade did, and took off the last vestiges of stubble. Amazing! The old Remington advertised shaving as close as a blade, but it never came close. The Arc IV doesn&#x27;t brag about being as close as a blade, but it should, as it takes off stubble my Mach 3 Turbo is missing!    The shave is also a very comfortable one. The screens warm up while shaving, making for a soft warm comfortable shave. A very nice touch making the shaver actually feel pleasant going across your face. I&#x27;ve also had zero issues with razor burn or hair bumps afterward, unlike the old Remington. The length of the shave time is probably a good half minute shorter than with the old Remington as well, and I don&#x27;t have to contort my skin in every direction like with the Remington. That said pulling it tight in one direction does still help the shaver get closer, but that is the norm for every electric I&#x27;ve ever used. Ultimately I would rate this razors comfort, closeness of shave and quality at a 5 without question.    The reason for my 4 rating has nothing to do with the shaver itself, which I rate as outstanding. The charging/cleaning base has given me an error red light twice while cleaning (charging &amp; drying have been fine, only cleaning is giving me an error), and the manual is completely unclear about what the problem is and how to resolve it. I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews talking about issues with the cleaning base, and I might have been an unlucky one to get one of the bad bases. Frankly I consider the cleaning base a gimmick anyway. You can wash the razor off under the tap just fine, and you don&#x27;t have to pay for cleaning solution packs to do it.    Ultimately I would recommend this razor with gusto regardless of the gimmicky base, and if you can find this unit as a stand alone without the base and without the extra cost of the base, jump on it! This is an outstanding razor that provides a terrific close and comfortable shave, with or without the base!</li>
            <li> This razor has a 13,000 rpm motor,but doesn&#x27;t really shave any better than my old panasonic with a standard motor.I bought it because of the High speed motor and paid to much money.I believe i coud have found a better price if I would have shopped around.I&#x27;ve allready seen some simalar razors for a better price ,even a braun.&lt;br /&gt;Also the cleaning unit is not worth the extra expense,I seem to get it just as clean or even better by just rinsing it under water.I would never pay this high of a price ( $133.00 ) for an electri razor again or get the cleaning unit.&lt;br /&gt;other than that I still like the razor.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this Panasonic Mens Shaver and could not be happier with my decision. I am the type of customer that usually does a thorough analysis on certain purchases I make. Prior to biting the bullet and making this decision I was a loyal Remington Shaver customer/user but the advances Panasonic have made in the mens shaver arena in the recent years made this decision a no-brainer. Since first using it I have been very pleased and blown away by the self-cleaning tool that takes no more than 1 hour. Also, I am VERY pleased with the exceptionally long battery life. I can usually go at least 7 days without plugging the shaver into anything for charging purposes. This Panasonic shaver is a slam-dunk purchase not just because of the affordable price but all of the brilliant features that come with it! Go ahead and pull the trigger</li>
            <li> This little bugger is unequivocally the best shaver I have ever used. It cleans easier than washing a wine glass; it shaves as close as a gillette razor blade without the harsh \\&quot;after-feeling\\&quot; and is simply worth every penny of the cost. I have previously had two of the highly-hyped (and up-to-now best electric shavers on the market) the Braun Series 7s - but the ES8249 easily outperforms them. At first I just used it dry as a normal electric shaver and loved it more than any other shaver I had. I was a little apprehensive about taking advantage of the \\&quot;wet shave\\&quot; feature, but after trying it only twice, I am now a true convert.  If I had to say anything negative about this shaver, It is that their tech support people really don&#x27;t know much about the product.  I called three or four times to inquire about getting some clarity in the directions/manual and found that, each time, their employees only read the manual along with me, telling me what I already knew; and then continually putting me on hold so they could \\&quot;find out more info\\&quot; by asking their co-workers, (or whatever tech support people do when they put you on hold.) Anyway, forget about the tech support problem- this shaver makes all the other electric shavers out there seem like \\&quot;rotary telephones.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Have tried Norelcos triple-blade, no good. Tried the top of the line Braun, seemed to take too long to shave, and had to go over the same area 5 times to get a close shave (also VERY noisy)! The Panasonic Arc IV is very quiet, I can ACTUALLY HERE the stubble being shaved, and shaving only takes 5 1/2 minutes (I know this, because the shaver has a timer). I clean it in the stand 4 times/week, which keeps the shaver looking new every time I use it. I like not having to press it hard to my face, to get it to shave close (head is spring loaded, to give the correct amount of pressure). I just bought the cleaning cartridges, 3/$12.70 on Amazon subscriber program, and will have them sent every 6 months. Face still feels shaved after 8 hours (this is very strange, but nice).</li>
            <li> bought this item [...] a few days ago, very good price [...], and very good expirience / quality.    pro: good price as the top-line panasonic shaver with charging / cleaning base. good shaving, very clean, and quiet.    con: the base is pretty big and ugly, and the charging plug in the base is not easy to connect</li>
            <li> This shaver does its job very well!  3 days of growth of a coarse beard-- shaved off with no nicks or irritation.  That is something my previous electric shaver couldn&#x27;t have dreamed of and would have been somewhat painful with my non-electric razor blades.  Day to day-- no problem.  Trimming-- no problem.  Out of several previous electric shavers, this one is superior.  With previous shavers, I had to use pre-shave gel to avoid irritation.  This one works perfectly, dry.  It is easy to clean, ergonomic, leaves skin smooth like never before, and a clear 5 stars in my book.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver and the two other items listed under the \\&quot;Frequently bought together\\&quot; section.  Be careful and make sure to look at what the shaver is compatible with.  The vortex combo replacement listed does not fit the ES8249S.  Other than that, my husband is happy with the shaver.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic Shaver and this one does it all!  My first Panasonic was the 8109s.  http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ES8109S-Nanotech-Rechargeable-Electric/dp/B000VKZMHK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1326470090&amp;sr&#x3D;8-5  The ES8246S shaves my face as smooth as a babies bottom....  It is so good that I recommended it to my father...ok, I bought a second one for him and he loves it too!!!  The price, at around $150, was a bit too much for me to justify but when it came on special for $89.99, baddabing baddaboom....it was perfect.  I think this electric is definitely worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> The razor is fantastic. It takes me between 3-4 minutes to shave with it. I took it on a 12 day vacation without the charger and it still had 20% charge when I returned home. It cleans nicely and the cleaning solution lasts between 30-40 days.</li>
            <li> I am replacing a Braun shaver that is nearly 10 years old. My Dad has this shaver, and I used it once, so I thought it would be OK. Features on it are nice and worth 3 or 4 stars. I like the cleaning feature since I am too lazy to clean it otherwise. But I can&#x27;t get it to shave close enough, and it takes me twice as long to get the same shave I had with my Braun. However, though I would like a closer shave, I also care more about my shave looking clean than feeling close. The shave I get is 1 or 2 stars on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I purchased in December 2011. Now, it is late June 2012. The LED status lights on the base do not light up and it no longer dries the shaver after cleaning. Though it takes close to a month for the shaver to get used to your face and give a decent shave, and that has improved, I am lowering my rating from 3 stars to 2. The features get 3 stars, shave gets 2.5 stars, and the quality gets 1 star. I have several Panasonic products that have lasted for years. This is a disappointment coming from Panasonic. I expect better quality. I doubt I&#x27;d buy this again, and I certainly recommend that anyone looking for a shaver take a pass on this one. I&#x27;m starting to wish I had. I&#x27;m off to the post office to ship this to Panasonic&#x27;s exchange center, making good use of the 2 year warranty.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I read the reviews, but i was tired of always having to shave with a Mach 3 Fusion Power razor all the time just to get a decent shave. If you are anything like me and have sensitive skin and coarse, thick facial hair, then this razor is what you have been looking for. The first time I shaved with the Arc IV was after 2 days of not shaving, and I just wanted to see how it would cut. I didn&#x27;t use shave cream or a preshave cause I just wanted to test it out. I was so astounded at how smooth my skin felt that I just kept shaving till my whole face and neck was shaved. And the interesting thing about it was that my face didn&#x27;t feel all raw, like I had several small cuts all over, in fact it felt just fine.  It was the closest thing to a straight razor shave that I have ever had with an electric razor. Granted, I don&#x27;t shave dry often, most of the time I shave in the shower with shaving cream. My skin has really cleared up since I have been using this because my face has been able to heal from the trauma of using a Mach 3 razor every day (even though a Mach 3 Fusion is awesome, after shaving 5 days straight my skin gets traumatized). The charge lasts a very long time. Using it 5 times a week in the shower for 3+ minutes at a time  I am able to get about a week and a half out of one charge. The base/charger also has a nice option to clean the razor as well. This is very nice and convenient and makes the razor perform like new and smell nice. I have heard complaints about how long it takes to clean and how noisy it is. Well, I don&#x27;t really consider this a problem. In fact, it might just even be a little nitpicky. Just don&#x27;t charge it in your bedroom when you are trying to sleep and you will be fine. It does take a while to clean (perhaps about an hour), but I just set it and forget it while I am on my way out the door in the morning.    If you have been considering taking the plunge into the foray of the electric razor world, then look no further thanthis. The wet/dry option is an undeniable advantage in both longevity and rugged survivability. Take it on a camping trip down the Colorado river and you won&#x27;t worry about breaking it. It is nice looking, relatively small, gives a comfortable, close shave that will make your significant other want to make-out more and not worry about looking like a sand-paper attack victim. I would highly recommend this and it has changed my perception about the viability of electric razors in the modern age.    Cheers!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband, who has fast growing &amp; coarse facial hair, but likes to always be clean shaven.  He is so happy with this shaver and constantly says it is the very best he has ever had (and he&#x27;s almost 55)!  According to him, it shaves closer than any other razor he has ever used and it takes less time to do it.  Next to his car and our cats, it&#x27;s the best thing that ever happened to him...besides me, of course!!!</li>
            <li> Quite simply this is one of the best shaving instruments i have ever used.  I am a user of the old Atra 2 plus as i have never been satisifed with the new technology blade shavers.  Previously, I had a Braun electric that i was happy with, until the child tried to shave the Maltese puppy, which irritated both me and the dog.  but the dry/wet versitility of this shaver makes it far superior to the Braun.  I tried the wet shave feature yesterday and my lady rubbed my face and said \\&quot;nice; and that is a good thing.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is pretty nice and I have almost no qualms with it, aside from not working quite as fast on a lower battery, but the charger that plugs into the wall makes a very, very high pitched squeal if it&#x27;s plugged into the wall which forces me to only have it plugged in when I&#x27;m charging or cleaning the thing. This is near unacceptable for a $170 shave system that you&#x27;re supposed to leave set up in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use and I am a female.  I was tired of the low quality available in women&#x27;s razors and wanted something that provided a close shave in less time.  I also wanted something that could be used on the underarms as most womens razors pull the hair or pinch the skin in this area.      This electric razor has gone way beyond my expectations.  It provides an amazing shave that feels amazingly close to as if I had shaved with a razor.  It also is much quicker then anything I have ever found available to women.  Just a few passes and it gets all the hair.  It works great on upper and lower legs and works amazingly on underarms.  It has never pulled or pinched my skin.       My husband has been using it too and he loves it just as much.  Does a great close shave on his face and neck in a very short amount of time.  He loves it and we will never go back to any other razor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several electric razors and finally found a keeper.  It&#x27;s a little noisy, but I can put up with that.  Close shave easy on the neck (and cleans up the neck hairs without razor burn.)</li>
            <li> Quick &amp; Easy review here... This is a terrific shaver system... Very close, no irritation. Holds its charge far longer than expected. Has a nice cleaning system built into the charger, which is nice, but have found it to be entirely unecessary. It is waterproof, so afyer using, simply pop the top and run under the faucet... job done perfectly. I bought a pack of additional cleaning cartridges when making this purchase, and I wish I had waited as I would have saved some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes you can use it in the shower, and/or with shaving lotion, but for me it is a much better shave dry with a moist towel-off afterwards in all reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, it is a great shaver, and will last a very long time before blades need eventual replacement, otherwise is ideal just as it is out of the box.</li>
            <li> I have used my Panasonic for over a month now and like it better than all of my previous electric razors. It cuts closer and is easier to use as well as to clean.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving...I would rather mow the yard than shave my face.  I used the Norelco 985RX for years...it was slow and required many strokes over the same area...then I bought the Brawn 7526 with the automatic cleaner.  Same drill, slow and requiring many trips over the same area...particularly my neck; it requiring up and down and side-way strokes to eventually rid my neck of hair.    So bad was my experience with electric shavers since I started shaving (I am now 64 years old) that I rarely shave on the weekends. On Monday morning I Gillette safety razor it in the shower to rid my weekend hair....because the electric shavers can&#x27;t handle two days growth.    Enter the Panasonic ES8249 into my world.  This week I have been amazed....unlike the Brawn that near required ear plugs so your ears wouldn&#x27;t be subjected to noise approaching that of a jet engine while trying to shave the side of your face, the buzz is low and very tolerable.  The shave is closer than the Brawn or the Norelco and it requires only a second touch-up stroke to make it happen.    By no means does the Panasonic make me want to shave, but the morning &#x27;little tiny hair&#x27; removal drill is now quick and relatively noiseless.    The side burn trimmer is on par with the Norelco and the Brawn.......which is very good.    The self cleaning feature of the Panasonic is on line with the Brawn....which is excellent.  Although the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t sound like you have entered a jet engine test cell when it&#x27;s doing the cleaning....it&#x27;s relatively quite.      The Brawn is easier to recharge the cleaning feature...one cartridge slides into its little place under the shaving unit takes care of the reload.  The Panasonic requires a little container on the back replenished with tap water and a tiny cleaning fluid cartridge placed under the unit.   Two steps instead of one.....basically irrelevant.    I paid $149 through Amazon.....well worth it for the many years I anticipate it will provide quiet, effective shavingwhile preparing for the next shave by self cleaning.    UPDATE:    Didn&#x27;t shave for three days....growth was serious...until the Panasonic I would have had to use my Gillette and foamy that resides in the shower to take it off.   Thought I would try before I showered.  The Panasonic took it off as if it were a one day growth.  I have a fast growing heavy beard.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, it&#x27;s smooth and easy to use, but there is a problem with the readout screen.  For a year the screen would show how much power is left before needing a charge and it would let me know when I should use the turbo mode and rinse the head off (which I do every day anyway).  Almost a year to the day after I started using it the readout screen stopped giving me accurate information, all it gives now is total time used and the power bar is totally worthless, it never gives out the correct power remaining level.  Also, the turbo mode icon and the icon used to tell me when the foil head needs to be replaced can&#x27;t be shut off all of a sudden.  Before I purchased this shaver I noticed that other people had similar problems but their posts were old enough that I thought these had been resolved, guess I was wrong.  My shaver has never been dropped or bumped so I don&#x27;t know what happened.  I had packed it in my suitcase for my drive home from vacation, it worked right when I packed it but when I got home and went to use it the readout was messed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, having said all of this would I recommend this shaver, yes with reservations, it shaves great but the the information display is worthless.  Also, if you buy this razor don&#x27;t waste your money on the cleaning/charging unit, you can clean the shaver just as good and charge it with the power cord.</li>
            <li> The last time I tried an electric shaver was back in the 60s. It didn&#x27;t do the job, and irritated the crap out of my face. Since I&#x27;m on a blood thinner now, I really didn&#x27;t want to continue nicking my face when I shaved. So I pretty much gave up shaving for a while, cutting it down to once a week. Looked pretty good for a day or two (once the blood dried)... but an older man with \\&quot;scruff\\&quot; just isn&#x27;t cool. So when this razor came up on a deal, I went for it. And I am glad I did! In 2.5 minutes, my face is smooth. Better than most shaves I was getting from a blade. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and there are no cuts or nicks. It will run a couple of weeks between charges, but when it&#x27;s so easy to charge in the cradle, why wait? The self-cleaning feature is nice and seems to work well. That&#x27;s one or two less chances that I&#x27;ll drop it while getting it clean under the tap. Just returned from a week-long trip. Charged it up before I left, put it in the included pouch, packed it in the luggage, and got a close, clean shave every day. Cleaning under the tap was easy, but then I had to leave the parts separate so it could dry. So the self-cleaning and drying feature is pretty nice. I would recommend this shaver to anyone. It&#x27;s not the cheapest, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good shave, this is the one I would suggest. If you&#x27;re having problems getting a smooth shave, try the old-fashioned electric pre-shave stuff. Works great</li>
            <li> Shaver is good. Needs time to adjust to your face &amp; beard type. Needs to go over twice in some places. Wet shave using gel/cream is good. Dry shave is not good. Even with \\&quot;Electric shaver liquid\\&quot; it is better than dry but not good. My suggestion is to use this with a little gel. Clener takes an hour to clean. You are better off cleaning in tap everyday using turbo mode and do the 1 hour cleaning once a week.  Overall for the price of $90 I paid, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> good and first to use gadget in the morning&#x27; &#x27;better shape and holds easy&#x27; &#x27;Powerful battery&#x27;&#x27;Love the package&#x27;if send as present&#x27;</li>
            <li> So far I like the shaver. Quiet and comfortable. I don&#x27;t think it holds the charge as long as stated but shaves very nicely</li>
            <li> When using this shaver as a \\&quot;wet shaver\\&quot; with shaving cream etc., this Panasonic is literally as good as shaving with a normal razor only with all the speed and convenience of an electric!  My face was already used to this type of electric shaver as I had previously been using a low-end model Braun--so my face didn&#x27;t need any time for adjustments like the box warns it might.  I&#x27;ve always had similar foil-style Brauns (but never a wet shaver before) and a gold box deal convinced me to try this Panasonic, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed!  This is the best shave with an electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had!  The only thing that takes a little getting used to is that the blades move so fast that they produce a really high pitched buzzing sound, but it&#x27;s not loud, you get used to it quickly, and I might just have really sensitive hearing.  Anyway, solid 5 stars, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this one because I wanted to replace my Philips. I really like this one. Its clean shave is satisfactory. It is good if you need it for clean shave.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a Series 7 Braun razor before trying this, and I found the shave so lacking that I returned it to the store and ordered this razor online instead. For about half the price, it does twice the job.   Pros:   -Shaves 90% of hair on the first swipe, with very thick and coarse facial hair  -Cleans very easily with water and handsoap, takes 3 minutes and can be air dried in the docking station! No need to even bother buying refills for the built in cleaning system.  -Doesn&#x27;t cut or cause rash, never suffered razor burn using this unit.   -Safe for all regions of the body.  Cons:   - Getting the last 10% of the hair can be difficult if your hair grows in different directions  - The trimmmer attachment is kinda crappy, not very secures and tends to snap back with even slightest amount of pressure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my dads braun 8995 for 4 years this is not as good as it is. But it was 190$ and this is cheape. when you compare the price this one also does a great job. Actually better at neck areas but still can pick a hair after 20 times passing the same area. Braun can&#x27;t find any hair after 6 or 8 times passing the same area and it becomes like a razor shaving with a little harsh on your skin but does an excellent job for special days. What I learned from this purchase is Higher vibration rate doesnt mean faster or closer shave. It seems it means only a thinner vibration noise like a bee. I have to take the shaver to the work and shave after the lunch again if I have an important meeting in the afternoon. I have to admit I am a guy with fast growing beard I shouldn&#x27;t blame the product for that but can&#x27;t compare with a razor.   Finally maybe I might have to change this review after my skin gets used to it becuase I was using razor past 6 months to rehabilitate my skin.   Summary I am happy with the price/performance of this product but not surprised with it. It does its work.</li>
            <li> I have been through a number of electric razors over the years, including 2 and 3 head remmingtons, norelcos, wahl, and panasonic.  Note, I have never tried Braun.  After reading reviews and consumer reports, I decided to try the Panasonic ES8249.  Review indicated that it was almost as good as an equivalet Braun and half the price.  I am definitely very surprised.  It is a fabulous razor.  I am getting the best electric shave I have in years.  Best razor I have owned and look forward to many years of great shaving with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Face looks good after getting this and is gentle on my face. Easy to use with no problems.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Silver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was skeptical after using several other electrics over the years (mostly Braun) but this shaves closer and quicker than any other I&#x27;ve used.  When used wet with gel it&#x27;s ALMOST as close as a blade.  Even does a decent job on the neck which my other electrics never did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had and still use my earlier model as often as this one. With ten year old blades the older one still give a closer shave and has a larger trimmer.</li>
            <li> I went for 6 years with my Braun 7 series.  It was time for a new one...but after finding all the great reviews on these Panasonic ES series razors I decided to pull the trigger on one.  I got the ES7249S Arc IV on sale for a crazy price on Amazon through J&amp;R (under $100).  Waited till Christmas to open it.  OMG this razor is wonderful.    My old Braun:    -loud  -cleaner/charger spring that held the razor down broke forcing me to tape it down to clean  -expensive cleaning solution  -took a long time  -only dry shaves    My new Panasonic:    -pretty quiet (not hush quiet, but not as noisy)  -cleaner/charger just needs the razor to sit in it (shouldn&#x27;t break over time)  -cleaning solution can be picked up on Amazon for 3 pack for around $12  -quick shave  -wet shower shave is awesome  -LCD display is nice to have  -cleaner is quiet...compared to the Braun    This thing is excellent so far....I&#x27;d give it 6 stars if I could.  My wife commented on how my face and neck were smoother than she ever remembers even with a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> After some research I found the 8249 to be a good balance of price and quality. I am very pleased by the shave and performance. I do not use the cleaner. I would only use it once a week if I did and since the manual says the cleaning pad is only good for a month no matter how many times you use it. I felt like it was too expensive for the amount of use I would get out of it(I travel a lot). It is really easy to clean using a little shampoo and water.</li>
            <li> I prefer to sleep in as late as I can in the morning, and for a long time a plain old razor shave at night before bed was enough to get me through the next day, but it required a shower or lengthy facial wash (or a lot of pain).  I give my face a 2 minute shave with this razor before bed and I&#x27;m good for 12 hours. It works great and has a long battery life. One charge a week is more than enough. I have not used the cleaning station yet because a quick rinse is enough. Great razor so far. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver a while ago and liked it so much, that bought one more as a gift for my friend. Very easy to use, smooth shaving, easy cleaning and charging. Have nothing bad to say about this item. However, if you don&#x27;t shave every day, shaving might become harder, because it doesn&#x27;t always cut longer hairs.</li>
            <li> Well, for nearly all 10 years i&#x27;ve been shaving, i&#x27;ve hated it. I had gone from using whatever electrics my dad had during high school to using a blade to using a Braun Activator for the last 4 years. Unfortunately, my beard grows quickly and my neck is extremely sensitive. While using the braun, shaving was okay. The shaves were close and it cut my tough hair like a beast without any hesitation. However, I could shave only twice a week as that&#x27;s all my neck could handle. I tried shaving before showers, after, with pre-shave, without, with after-shave lotions and of course without. No matter what combination, my dang irritated neck would not be ready for the next shave any sooner than the 3rd day after. I wasn&#x27;t happy with that and neither was my wife.    Then came the Panasonic es8249s. I had seen a few reviews stating something along the lines of: if you like braun, you&#x27;ll love panasonic. So, i decided I&#x27;d give the panny a shot. After using the Panasonic for 5 shaves in just over a week, something i don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been able to do in who knows how long, I am ecstatic. So far all shaves have been done every other day, with the first two being dry.     I was happy with the dry shaves, but not blown away. Immediately, i noticed very little to no irritation on my neck, which was awesome. To counter that, i found the shave on my neck wasn&#x27;t quite as close as it was with my old braun. For my third shave, i decided to pick up some Aveeno shaving gel and take a shot at a wet shave. I cannot believe how much different the Panasonic is when shaving wet. It cuts faster and closer than anything i&#x27;ve used, all while gliding over my neck and face with no irritation at all. It has made such a big difference that as i&#x27;m typing this, about 24 hrs since the last shave, i could do it again. That is something i would never consider possible even 2 weeks ago. The cleaning station works similar to my old braun&#x27;s, and i have no complaints.    I was hopeful that a shave like this was possible for me, but i never expected it. This Panasonic has totally blown me away.</li>
            <li> I used a Braun shaver for about 7 years, and even though I replaced all the vital parts, it never shaved the mustache area properly.  At work I&#x27;d be ribbed for having a mini-mustache whenever people saw me after lunchtime.  I actually figured that&#x27;s just the way it was, and that after buying this Panasonic that I&#x27;d need to keep my Braun in my desk for a post-lunch fix up.  I was wrong.  The Panasonic provides such a great shave that I never have to worry about a mini-mustache, even after working a 12 hour day!    One little nitpick I have is that the lights on the razor illuminate roughly once a minute when it is fully charged and in its stand -- this tells you that it is at 100%, but given the nature of my bathroom, it is a little distracting when that bright LED blinks.  I could easily unplug the stand, but I&#x27;d rather keep it plugged in so that I know that it is fully charged every morning (even though it only takes me 2 minutes to shave, so I never run down the battery).  This is just a minor nuisance in my book; just pointing it out to others since that&#x27;s the only drawback I&#x27;ve seen with this shaver.    I compared this against the other Panasonic shavers, and the 8249 gave the best bang for the buck (a couple extra bells and whistles, without getting off-the-charts expensive).  I recommend this to everybody... I just wish I had replaced my Braun with this a couple years earlier!</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many, many shavers.  Some good, some bad.  However, even the good ones (i.e. high-end Philip Norelcos and Brauns) gave my sensitive facial skin irritation.  This Panasonic is a winner!  It cuts the hair quickly and smoothly with minimal irritation.  To be honest,  I was hesitant to buy a Panasonic shaver since I was always under the impression that \\&quot;You gotta get a Norelco or Braun\\&quot; to get a quality shave.  But after years of getting red, irritated skin on my face and neck from $200.00+ machines, I decided to give this Panasonic a shot.  And I haven&#x27;t looked back.  The only downside as far as I could see is that it&#x27;s hard to find the replacement cleaning cartridges in the local Target or Wal-Mart.  However, Amazon does have them available for around $8-11 for a 3-pack.  Not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several high-end shavers over the years with only fair results.  I&#x27;ve ended up using them for touch ups.  I&#x27;ve always had to use a blade for my primary shave as my beard is very coarse and grows  rapidly.  After reading multiple reviews I bought this Panasonic a few weeks ago.  I have now discarded all my blades as this shaver does a better job than even my razors.  Even after a blade shave and   multiple passes, I would still end up with a slightly scratchy stubble my wife would complain about.  For a week I shaved half of my face and chest dry with the Panasonic and the other half in the   shower with Nivea Gel.  There was a slightly better shave with the wet gel, but only slightly.  Even the dry shave was better than my standard razor.  My wife has quit complaining (about this anyway)!  I now use this twice a day because of my rapid beard growth.  The included cleaner works well but is slow (about an hour and a half to clean and dry).  I have to be careful in the shower as it can be a little  slick with the soap.  I don&#x27;t know about longevity yet since i&#x27;ve only had it a month, but this product is well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors, exclusively, since i started shaving at the age of 15. I got my father&#x27;s old Norelco hand me down, which was my first experience with an electric shaver. I tried using a manual, but got really bad shaving rash on my neck everytime i used one. I have been a long time consumer of Norelco and have had 3 or 4 different models. My last Norelco died on me after 8 years of use in 2009. I was going to buy the top of the line Norelco this time but a friend said i should try the Braun models. I bought the top of the line Braun and used it for a week after which time i returned it. It just wasn&#x27;t giving me a good shave and missed alot of hairs on my neck. I went out and bought the Norelco 1280X/42 3D with the Jet Clean System. This razor, to my disgust, was a worse shave than the Braun. I looked on the net and found that Panasonic razors were getting very good reveiws. I settled on this model and haven&#x27;t looked back since. Most people said that going from a Rotary type shaver to a Foil, it would take my face a while to get used to the shaver. I used my new Panasonic in the shower the first time and used shaving gel after reading this worked well with the shaver. This was the best shave that i had ever had in my life, hands down. I was amazed at how close and smooth the shave was. That was Christmas of 09&#x27; and my shaver is still as good as the day i bought it. The cleaning system has always worked perfectly and i haven&#x27;t even changed the blades or the foil in these 2 1/2 years. I haven&#x27;t done anything special as far as upkeep, just using the cleaning system and occasionally using some soap and alchol to clean the blades and foil. I know this was quite a long post, but i just want anyone who reads this to know what a great product this is. I let my dad use my razor on a trip we took and he, being a lifelong Norelco guy, was totally amazed at how good the shave was. I am going to buy him this same model for christmas as it is now $75 cheaper than wheni bought it. If you are on the fence on which razor to buy, just try one of these Panasonic&#x27;s. In my opinion, they make the best electric razor out there and for a very good price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a relative. HE LOVES IT! He had wanted the same Electric Shaver that I had gotten my hubby--The Braun 7-790cc, but the price was not as good as the deal I had gotten when I purchased hubby&#x27;s razor. From all indications, it seems to run a tight race with the Braun&#x27;s. He had used other Electric Razors in the past, but was not impressed. When he heard all of the great compliments about the Braun (from hubby), he wanted one too. Hubby would not ever try an Electric razor since earlier ones were a joke. Hubby loves his Braun, and the relative loves his Panasonic.    Love all of my deals buying through Amazon. Always make that my first shopping place.</li>
            <li> Shaves real good except for under the chin. It&#x27;s hard to not miss spots when you do not use a circular pattern like with a norelco.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric shaver for many many years.  I have tried using safety razors in the past, but for whatever reason it always leaves my face raw with nicks and bloody spots.  I have never expected an electric razor to match the closeness of a safety razor, but this one comes the closest of any model I have ever used (including Braun and Norelco) -- and I am thrilled with it.  And the cleaning capability works great, much better than the more expense system that Braun uses. I highly recommend this brand and model.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor so far, but the jury is still out regarding the neck hair shaving. I previously owned Norelco and Braun.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband about six months ago and he absolutely loves it! (And believe me, this guy has high standards!) He shaves his whole head and his face with it, and loves how close if gets and how much faster it is since he can now shave without water or soap.     The self-cleaning feature is super convenient. However, the only thing I would say could be viewed as a negative is the amount of noise it makes when it&#x27;s self-cleaning. It&#x27;s not unbearably loud, but you can hear it if you&#x27;re in the next room over. Other than that, it was a great investment and my husband will never go back to a traditional straight edge or even a cheaper brand of electric shavers.    Actually, my husband likes it so much that we bought his dad one for a birthday present. His dad was skeptical at first since he has tried other shavers in the past (only to be brutally disappointed), but he loves this one!     I highly recommend this product. And if you are even thinking about buying it then don&#x27;t think; just buy!</li>
            <li> This is my first upgrade in shaving since 2001 and I think this product gives me a smooth face and it only takes up a little bit of space.</li>
            <li> I just recieved the razor and took it for a quick spin . I used it with Billy Jealousy pre shave and I was really impressed . A quick close shave with none of the burn associated with typical electric razors .  For the money at the special price I bought at , a little over 100 bucks I think I&#x27;m going to be real happy with this purchase .  It was worth waiting for the right price .  I&#x27;m going to use it in the shower tomorrow and we&#x27;ll see.[[ASIN:B000H9COLC Panasonic WES9161CL Replacement Foil for ES8243A, ES8249S]]</li>
            <li> Overall, the shaver works well and is a great value.  The only problem is that the cleaning system cartridges are only available online.  The fact that you can also clean with liquid soap and water more than makes up for this flaw.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver. I replaced my old one (Braun 7526) and was amazed by the difference. Very clean shave, no irritation on neck area compared to old one. Cleaning base is a very convenient thing. Takes some space, but charger can be connected directly to shaver without it (good for travel).  Well worth the money I paid ($100).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for many years. This year, instead of replacing the blades on my aging Norelco Smart Touch XL, I purchased this Panasonic ES8249S. I had anticipated it to be at least as good as my previous shavers but I was surprised to feel a much closer shave than I&#x27;d remember getting from the Norelco. The wet/dry option is awesome and the self cleaning works great.  So far, I&#x27;ve been very happy with this razor and would recommend this product to anyone looking for a new electric razor.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that the razor does not ship to Canada. The price difference is over $150 compared to buying it in the store or other online shops!</li>
            <li> I think this is a nice product overall; I mainly got it because I wanted an electric shaver with a charging stand. After using it a for a while, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that the only way I can get a shave with this unit that matches what I used to get with my old Remington 3-head rotary shaver, is to shave wet with foam. The dry shave with this unit is inferior to the dry shave the Remington used to give me.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like the feel of a wet close shave. This model charges quickly. The high speed 4 blade system gives a close shave. Using it wet leaves the skin feeling cool and soft. I have psoriasis and a wet shave avoids the razor burns of other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver for years until the battery no longer held a charge. This model uses Lithium Ion technology and should last a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Norelco and Braun shavers, but nothing compared to the Panasonic. It was a deal at $88. The price has since gone up to $139. It would still be worth it even at the higher price.</li>
            <li> I have had the shaver for 1 month.  I was planning to go with a Braun shaver and had a Remington microscreen for years.  This shaver works great!  no stragler hairs.  Also, I had spent approx 5-8 minutes shaving (dry) with the Remington and now spend approx 2-3 minutes (dry) with the Panasonic.  So far, great shaver.</li>
            <li> Have used the Norelco for the last 10 years and have been very happy.  Just decided to try something new and was really impressed with this Panasonic.  The wet dry and the cleaning features are outstanding.  Wish I would have bought this ten years ago.  EXCELLENT!!!! Major improvement in coverage and closeness of shave.  Far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Overall it works great. The only concern is the sideburn trimmer. It works great unless you move it in a way that causes the trimmer to try and fold back to the stored position.  This takes VERY little force and you can hear the cutter drive mechanism disengage making really ugly mechanical noises.  The shaver section and cleaner/charger work flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Got this shaver for Christmas as it was on my Amazon wish list. This is the best shaver I have ever had.  It is wet/dry so you can shave in the shower, use shaving cream, or clean it by washing it with liquid soap and running under the faucet, or you can use the self cleaning/charging base that comes with it.  It comes with one cartridge for the self cleaning, and I plan to make that one cartridge last the next year or so by cleaning the shaver myself by running under the faucet and periodically using the self cleaning base.  As far as the shaver performance goes it is the best I have ever had, it shaves close like a razor and has a swiveling head with spring action for easy shaving.  I can literally shave in the morning and be done in less than 2 minutes. You can use this shaver cordless or even use it with the cord plugged in.  I&#x27;ve been using a Braun the past 10 years and didn&#x27;t know what I was missing when I got this Panasonic shaver.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with Panasonic until something better comes along, which will be difficult to follow.</li>
            <li> My husband has a thick beard and Panasonic ES82594 Arc IV works great for him. It gives him a better, closer shave than a razor. I hope you enjoy this shaver as much as he does.</li>
            <li> To me, this razor does not come close to the closeness and ease of the Norelco and it seems to miss and not handle two-three day beards as well.</li>
            <li> I have always bought rotary head shavers and never quite like them.  The past five years I had been using a normal razor and shaving cream.  My wife bought this for Christmas for me and it is awesome.  It leaves my face smooth and does not hurt, even when I go four days without shaving.  This razor goes for $250 on Panasonic&#x27;s website.  Get it here and you will be very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a December 2010 Christmas gift to myself. After reading the reviews on many different razors it sounded like the best deal for the money. When I got it and started using it, it was definitely a closer shave than my three previous Norelco&#x27;s. It was working great until the self-cleaner stopped draining the second time I used it. The manual has no info on troubleshooting that I could find. It wasn&#x27;t a big deal because it can be taken in the shower and is easy to clean. I also dumped out the self-cleaner, but the problem continued. Customer services response to this is to use a toothpick, but if this is going to happen every two times I use it, then I will stick with washing it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real problem started just two months after I bought it. The foil ripped and nicked me before I realized what happened. Now if the foil was $5, I could see the potential of replacing it every couple months. At $60 (MSRP) this does not seem like an item that should be replaced every 2 months. My first reaction was to contact customer support and see if they would replace this because it was a little over 2 months (And it has a 1 year warranty). Their response -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The blades and outer foil are consumable items. These are items that you have to purchase if needed to be replaced.\\&quot; Then they direct me to their parts site. They aren&#x27;t even courteous enough to give me the exact part number that I would need. So I contact them back asking if 2 months is a common amount of time for this foil to last. Their response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;We recommend to replace the system outer foil once a year. However, since the outer foil is very thin and can be damaged if not used correctly, we advise that you check that the foil is not damaged before using the shaver.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My response to that was \\&quot;It really seems like I got a defective foil if it is supposed to last a year and it only lasted 2 months. Are you telling me that you never have any defective foil, only customers that misuse the product?\\&quot; I am waiting for their canned response to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really sucks is that I was liking the razor, but if you don&#x27;t have a company that will stand behind it&#x27;s product then what good is the product. I am someone who is willing to spend a little bit more for a quality product and good customer service. When you can get both, then that is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/3/11 - After their email department directed me to make a phone call to their phone department I did. I explained the problem and even though they had stated that their warranty would not cover the issue, they replaced the foil (I am guessing because it is uncommon for the foil to fail a little after 2 months, they are actually trying to keep a customer happy or both!). I changed my rating from 1 to 3 stars. I am hoping that I won&#x27;t have a similar issue with the new foil, but I will keep you updated. This would probably be four out of five stars if the email department had handled the problem originally without directing me to take three more steps before someone handled the problem. It would be 5 out of 5 stars if I did not have to use a toothpick to clean the cleaner every two times I use it. It also only get&#x27;s four, because I paid almost the same for one with the cleaner than I would have for one without. I believe the cleaning base was partially a culprit in this, and I will most likely be doing self cleaning form hear on out.?\\&quot; I am waiting for their canned response to this.

            <li> Even though the price was good the shaver is too noisy and it does not shave very fast . if I had bought this in my area I would have returned it by now,Thanks,Alborz</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various electric shavers over the years, including Norelco and Braun.  This is my first Panasonic and it&#x27;s the best of the 3 shavers.  The wet/dry feature is great in case you want to shave in the shower.  The noise it emits is a bit loud but once you see how close it shaves, the noise is irrelevant.    I would recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I had used several Norelcos shavers for 6-7 years and couldn&#x27;t tolerate them anymore.  I did quite a lot research before buying this one.  So far I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I would say Panasonic 8249 or 8243 shaver is the best cost-performance shaver available in the market. I never tried Braun, but the price of Braun is $30-50 more than Panasonic.  And based on the users&#x27; review, Panasonic&#x27;s rating is as good as Braun&#x27;s if not better.  I don&#x27;t feel I can gain a lot the by spending 30-50% more.     Pro:  1. Very close to skin. The overall shaving effect is almost as good as that using razor. (better use it with shaving gel or foam)  2. Great for sensitive skin  3. The size is about right for travel (that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t buy the new ES-LA63-S model)  4. Cleaning is extremely easy and convenient  5. Build-in quality is great; the design is not fancy, but simple and low key.      Con:  1. A little noisy  2. The cleaning system is of no much use, but just several dollars more than 8243.   3. The replacement foil is expensive ($35-40)</li>
            <li> Got a smokin deal on the high quality shaver. Got it for my husband for xmas based on reviews from this site. He was not disappointed. Gives close shave that lasts all day long. We both love it! :)</li>
            <li> I owned a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver many, many years ago and I loved it - it was small, gave a very close shave, was waterproof, and only cost me about $35.  That thing must lasted me about four or five years...maybe more.  Wish I still had that one...it did the job exceedingly well.  But technology advances, and this shaver certainly reflects that.      I&#x27;ve owned this shaver about three weeks and so far, so good.  While it comes with the holder that will charge, clean, and dry the shaver, you actually have a lot of choices about how you clean it after using it.  When I first purchased it, I was concerned that cleaning it would always require the cleaning stand with solution, etc. but that is not the case.  It can be cleaned quickly under a stream of water or with handsoap.  I usually clean it by removing the shaving head cover, running that under water, then switching the shaver on to the cleaning mode and running it under the shower water for about 20 seconds.  I then (after my shower) drop it into the charging base, select the \\&quot;Dry\\&quot; and \\&quot;Charge\\&quot; modes by toggling through the selections, and let the charging base do the rest.  If I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to clean it, then I just drop it in the base and select \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; + \\&quot;Dry\\&quot; + \\&quot;Charge.\\&quot;      As far as the shaving, it gets pretty darn close.  A few techniques help.  I find the closeness of the shave about the same with or without shaving cream.  Pulling the skin away from the direction it grows (e.g. pull up on your skin near your cheek since your hair points down) helps the shaver get closer.  It seems gentle enough on the skin, although I&#x27;m still adjusting to it.  Probably the biggest drawback is the size of the shaving head, which makes it hard to shave around and above my mustache.  I&#x27;ve had to touch up that area with a blade.  I&#x27;m in the Reserves, so I can&#x27;t just let my mustache grow wild and spread out across my face.  If you&#x27;re not in that position, then no problem.  I think one could shave aroundhis beard without any issues.  There is also a pop-out trimmer that seems to work fine, but doesn&#x27;t trim nearly as close as the shaver head cuts (of course, it&#x27;s not designed to).      Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it and having purchased it on sale for $93 with a $20 rebate, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve gotten a good value.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Panasonic shaver I have owned. The first one lasted me 10+ years. The second one that this is replacing, only because I dropped it, had lasted at least 15 years and always a close shave.  This one is by far the best shaver I have ever owned!! Quiet! Smooth, incredible close shave wet or dry! and that it cleans and charges itself. This 4 blade nano is wonderful. I love Panasonic shavers. They are truly the best on the market today! Well worth the money. Buy it because it will last forever!! unless you happen to drop it, LOL!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of foil shavers but I bought this shaver for my head based on some recommendations and it does an outstanding job.  It does a much better job than my Norelco at shaving my face.  The cleaning/recharging station is great for keeping the shaver clean and ready to go although the cleaning cartridges are a little pricey.  The battery capacity is excellent and has plenty of power during a shave.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco as well as other electric razors.  They were rotary not linear razors.  This is my first linear razor.  This is hands down the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  Razor close shave with NO rash or skin irritation.  It does not take the typical 3-4 weeks for your skin to adjust.  Works great in the shower to the point that my wife can use it on sensitive areas with great results.  I highly recommend this razor.  Look for the combo pack with extra blades and soap for the cleaner charger.</li>
            <li> For the last 1 1/2 years I&#x27;ve used an expensive Braun 7-series. With the initial cost of the unit, the price for the replacement cutting head/foil, and the always-evaporating cleaner solution I really wasn&#x27;t sold on this being any cheaper or better than a good shaving cream and Gillette.     The Braun was LOUD, the base station wouldn&#x27;t clean it unless I taped it down because the vibrations would unseat it from the contacts, and the shave was never as close as I had hoped, often having to go over spots several times until the head got hot. If I wanted to look smooth longer (no five o&#x27;clock shadow) I&#x27;d use a razor, but I enjoy the convenience of an electric, especially when traveling.    After a move, I could not find where the base station/charger was and the Braun was about out of steam. The battery did last almost 2 1/2 weeks though which was impressive. So I stumbled upon the Panasonic on amazon with great reviews, so the price and thought it was quite cheap in comparison to what I paid for the Braun, and clicked to buy.    I like the look of the base station compared to the ugly white braun one. I also like that the cleaning cartidge is not alcohol based and seems to be cheaper vs the Braun for not just cleaning solution but replacement foil/blades too, when that time comes.    I was very surprised by the quick charge time. My Braun would take quite a while longer.   I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the lightness and plastic feel to it. I thought it felt cheap and the head looked huge... I started to have doubts about it.     ..Until I used it for the first time. It was QUIET! I could hear the hairs getting cut. the head didn&#x27;t get hot, and I didn&#x27;t have to push hard in some trouble areas like I would with the Braun. The shave itself is the smoothest and closest I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a razor. I like the timer and the estimated time/battery left, although if I go by that it looks like the battery won&#x27;t last as long as the Braun would. It&#x27;s still more than enough for a week&#x27;s vacation without having to worry about taking the cord.     I have yet to try a wet shave but I&#x27;m looking forward to it.</li>
            <li> Good but not a close shave as razor, I like how you can use it while taking a shower but I feel like it&#x27;s better when using it dry.  I also like the cleaning machine, 1 touch and it selfs clean while charging.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and came up with the Panasonic as my top choice and I have not been disappointed yet. I&#x27;ve been working with it for about a month and am very happy.  I originally bought it to help shave my head with a razor to do the follow-up work. I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need the razor - the Panasonic cuts extremely close.  Started to use it on my beard as well and am very happy. It even gets the small wiskers next to the nostrils.  Easy to clean - can clean it right in the shower or sink, or place it in the self cleaner.  The self cleaner buzzes loud enough that you should do the self cleaning when you&#x27;re not home.  Things I like: percentage of battery charge left displayed, can charge in the cleaner (while cleaning) or charge with the cord, wet or dry use, can clean while in the shower.  I&#x27;m in the military and need to shave every day...it passes inspection.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the close shave I get while using shaving cream. I really love this razor.  No muss, no fuss.</li>
            <li> All i have to compare it to is a norelco shaver, but this thing works so much better. It gets a much closer shave and doesnt irritate the skin nearly as much. Completely worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> This is an excelent shaver. It is smooth and quiet. Shipping was very fast service is very good. Shaver charges quickly I was using a Remington but they are not the shaver they used to be. I needed a new shaver this was the best I could find. A very very nice shaver</li>
            <li> It does a slpendid shaving job.  It&#x27;s very comfortable to use.  The charging time is short.  The battery lasts very long, charged it three weeks ago and it&#x27;s still going.  For trips away from home, you have it fully charged and don&#x27;t need to pack the charger with you. Haven&#x27;t tried the cleaning function, yet.    One noticeable thing, it&#x27;s louder comparing with my other brands.  It may due to the fact that it deliver more force at shaving.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Brawn user, the last one failed to improve in performance even with a new cutter block and foil. So, I researched and agonized over switching to a new brand as my research suggested, thinking Brawn was superior. I am very satisfied with my decision to change to Panasonic. This razor easily out performs any of my previous razors when they were new. I bought extra soap cartridges based on input from other reviews, I now have a stockpile because a little liquid soap and water also cleans it very well between charges. It does miss a few hairs on the first pass but they all do, it gives a very close shave between 4 - 5 minutes. Very close to a blade and never a nick! I find the noise comparable to any. The only shortcoming I find with the razor is the pop out trimmer which is a little disappointing, glad I have a hand trimmer. Other than that, extremely satisfied, great razor!!</li>
            <li> This shaver replaced my Braun 5 series shaver and has so far been great.    Pros:   -Shaves closer than my Braun shaver with less irritation  -Takes only 3 minuets to shave compared to 5-10 with the Braun  -Can be used as a wet/dry shaver.  This is very nice for travel.  -Can be cleaned with hand soap, no need for a cleaning base station    Cons:  -The beard trimmer is very weak compared to the braun.  I had to buy a second trimmer for my beard.  -The cleaning station consistently gets clogged.  Cleaning station is kinda pointless since you can use hand soap which in my opinion does a better job.</li>
            <li> I bought it with cheap price in Amazon. It in excellence condition . Easy use , clean up and never make me hurt in using . I will tell my friends.</li>
            <li> I waited until I had this and used it for several weeks before reviewing.  I didn&#x27;t want to give it a glowing review right out of the box because it seems I always have a great first impression of something new.  I have never been able to use a razor without ingrown hairs and redness/ itchiness.  So, for the last 10 years or so I have used the braun electrics.  At first I had the activator.  Worked well for a few years (other than I had to pluck a little around the neck that it just would not get).  When it broke I bought another model, same thing without all the fancy digital displays to save money.  A couple times in between I tried a few norelcos, but always took them right back as I was irritated and the ingrown hairs were back again.  So this year the braun starting not holding a charge and seeming \\&quot;weaker\\&quot; than usual.  As well, the charger/cleaner was continuing to cycle all the time and we had to unplug it to make it stop.         I knew I needed something different, but what?  I googled \\&quot;best electric shaver\\&quot; and proceeded to read reviews and opinions.  The Panasonics always seemed to get great reviews where the others (other than the obvious fan boys who have obviously never tried anything else) were mixed.  The 8109 got particularly great reviews and I almost bought it.  Amazon had this one for not much more, and after research it seemed like a better buy for me.  I figured what do I have to lose and ordered it.         Out of the box, although the head is bigger, it felt lighter.  I really liked the ergonomics of this little guy compare to the candy bar style of the braun.  It has a higher pitched sound but is still not quite as loud if that makes any sense.  Like others have said, you can actually hear the hairs being shaved with this guy.  The shaver gets more of the hairs around my neck and nose than the braun ever did and I LOVE that you can tell the base what you want it to do (charge, dry, clean, or all 3)  The braun was a pain in the ass thatin that it decided when and for how long it would clean.  Plus the evaporating liquid was gone in no time.  I always had to take it out and cover it again to try and save it.  Now, add that you can use this in the shower or bath and this thing really shines.  My wife and I both love that she can use it in the shower, clean it under the water, and put it on dry when she gets out so it is ready for me.  Also, where my braun took me about 7 minutes to shave because I had to go over areas several times, I have only gone past 5 minutes once with the panasonic and most shaves are just under 4 minutes.  So here is the break down of the pros and cons:    PRO:  works better than the braun activator / series 5  waterproof so you can use it in shower  easy to clean under running water  charging base works much better, is more programmable, and does not waste cleaner  feels better in my hand  less expensive to maintain with the cleaning stuff  HALF THE PRICE OF BRAUN    Con:  I didn&#x27;t give this thing a chance years ago.    P.S. some have complained about the trimmer part.  I was worried about this as well.  It is a little narrower than the braun, but works just as well and the large head does not hamper me from using it at all.  At least this one cuts right away and I don&#x27;t have to go over  and over it.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever had. For the first week I had it I couldn&#x27;t wait to shave. Works great wet or dry. Definitely would purchase again!!</li>
            <li> This product works well and provides a decent shave (not as clean as a razor, but better than all other electrics I have tried).  I love the cleaner, but dislike that i have to replace the filter every month.</li>
            <li> This 4 head shaver shaves quicker than the 3 heads that I have had.  You do not have to go over the same area as many times.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Recieved the product as described, Read instructions (nicely set out and easy to follow). Have owned phillips rotory shavers in the past otherwise used gillette or schik razors, but have had skin irritations. Charged up the Panasonic ES8249 which is a very nice size and feels great in the hand. Hadn&#x27;t shaved for a week hair rather long, but not a problem the shaver cut with ease cut closer than expected and gave me minimal irritation. Used the side burn trimmer which also functioned well. Have yet to try the cleaning system but from my first impressions the shaver itself has exceeded my expectation and would throughly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have had my Panasonic ES8249S for about 1 month. It is AWESOME.  It shaves very close in all parts of the face as well as the hard to get areas under your chin. I can do a really great shave including the back of my neck in about 4 minutes. The other thing I like is how easy it is to clean. You can do it manually by just clicking off the head and using water or by using the automatic cleaning system. I find the system to work real well. Other reviews talk about it being noisy, but I dont see it as a problem. This shaver gives THE CLOSEST SHAVE I HAVE EVER HAD WITH AN ELECTRIC SHAVER! I&#x27;ve been shaving with an electric for over 30 years. The price at Amazon was by far the best!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about ordering this product after reading several of the reviews. But the price was excellent and I ordered and I am glad that I did.  This shaver has been excellent. Gives a clean shave wet or dry with no problems. Was very nice and smooth on the skin. I didn&#x27;t experience any  of the problems that some of the reviewer had with this shaver.</li>
            <li> The cleaning unit only lasted 2 months and costs $67 to replace. Poor service from Panasonic. The shaver itself has done pretty well and gives me a reasonable shave.</li>
            <li> Well, first of all, I can say that I&#x27;ve tried several different versions of Norelco up to the Quattro, and I even payed $180 for the first Braun with a cleaning station (though I can&#x27;t even remember what it was called at this point.)  I have a very sensitive neck with problems shaving around my adam&#x27;s apple even with newer disposable razors or cartridge razors, and after my last infection my doctor told me that I would either have to blow dry my razors clean to reuse them or only use them once.  At that point I started to buy the cheapest disposables I could find (which turn out to be Wilkinson&#x27;s Sword at Walmart; an 8 pack costs just under $6 with the Personna version being 10 cents cheaper but of much lower quality.) I also started to look into another electric razor that cleans itself, and after some research of reviews found the Arc IV&#x27;s to be the best rated out there.  I&#x27;ve had the razor for over 2 weeks now, and the dry cleaning cartridge seems to work much better than Braun&#x27;s series cartidges; not to mention they are much cheaper.  Also, whether or not you use the Braun cartridges, the alcohol based cleaner will evaporate within 2 weeks either way.  The Panasonic cleaning cartridges are supposed to last 30 days whether you use them or not, and I&#x27;ve also read that people that don&#x27;t use them daily can make them last much longer.  Also, on the package for the cleaning cartridge, it says that the detergent will stay good for 6 months after opening and I find that another good sign that they will last much longer, giving me the chance to either just rinse the razor after use or use hand soap to clean and just use the drying and charging functions on the station; though I tend to only charge the battery when I get to 10% to preserve the battery.  Enough about specs, let&#x27;s talk about the shave.  I&#x27;ve invested some extra money into decent pre and after-shaves.  After using the razor dry, I found I still had an unacceptable amount of hair around my neck, and started researching pre-electric lotions.  I found Aramis Lab Series pre-electric shave on Amazon, and granted it is rather expensive when compared to Afta or Lectric-Shave, but a little goes a long way, and since I started using it I&#x27;ve had the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor...better than I get with some blades actually.  Its so close and smooth that even my wife can&#x27;t tell that I didn&#x27;t use a blade razor, and for that I can&#x27;t be happy enough.  I know that the foils have a tendency to break or wear thin on these, but I wouldn&#x27;t even mind paying for a foil every six months if it continues to shave this close; I&#x27;m still saving money over disposables.  Also, I invested in some Proraso cream after-shave balm; $16 with free shipping if you have Amazon prime, but so far one of the best after-shaves I&#x27;ve ever used.  After shave with the Aramis Lab Series pre-shave, I wash my face and put on a little of the Proraso just to moisturize and heal my skin, and its like I never even shaved at times.  I&#x27;m also the type of person that will have at least 20 nicks or just abrasion all over after shaving usually, and by using this razor properly I can get a close shave without any of that.  So, if you&#x27;re looking to switch to a good electric razor or maybe just looking to save some money in the long run but don&#x27;t mind putting up a good bit of money to start out, I would definitely recommend this razor to you.  I haven&#x27;t tried the wet shaving yet because I&#x27;ve read that it tends to clog the razor up, and if you think about how it works that completely makes sense.  I&#x27;d say invest in a good electric pre-shave and an after shave balm that is good for your skin (takes some experimenting to find the right stuff, but I&#x27;ve seen good stuff about Trumper&#x27;s Coral Skin Food, Proraso cream after-shave balm, and if you want to go a little cheaper even OTC Nivea Extra-Soothing After Shave Balm, right now I&#x27;m still using some 2 year old after shave balm an aunt got me for Christmas from Bathand Body Works, but they don&#x27;t carry that line any more,) but this is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m almost regretful that I didn&#x27;t step up to the $200 version on Amazon for the 14,000 rpm over the 13,000 rpm for this one, but it was an $87 difference, and I wasn&#x27;t even sure if this kind of razor would work good for me at the time.  I know what I&#x27;ll be replacing this one with in a couple years, though. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I read many reviews regarding Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers before deciding to purchase this model.  I have owned this for about five weeks and am thoroughly pleased with it&#x27;s performance and close shaving comfort.  A quiet, comfortable shave, nice and close with no razor burn either.  I had owned a Braun 8595 Activator for the past 7 years and this Panasonic easily surpasses it on all areas.    Yes, as other reviewers have stated, it is somewhat noisy during it&#x27;s cleaning cycle.  What do expect?  A whisper quiet cleaning?  Come on, it&#x27;s pumping cleaning solution, activating the shaver head and cutters and then blowing heated air through it.      In addition, using this with a good ol&#x27; fashioned shaving brush and shaving soap will give a very smooth shave.  Leaves your face as \\&quot;smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind\\&quot;.  Plus no irritation.    I have had Norelco, Braun, Remington, and various razor brand assortments.  This Panasonic tops them all by leaps and bounds!  The price is excellent too!    You won&#x27;t buying this excellent piece of engineering from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> My Son wanted a wet/dry shaver. After researching all shavers, he chose this one for his birthday gift.  He shaves his face along with his head daily.  He has told me he loves this product, and is very satisfied with the closeness of shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using this new shaver for several weeks now.  It is comfortable, easy to use, and easy to clean. Definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This shaver was pretty good.  I was looking for a replacement to a blade but nothing beats blade shaving.  I returned it in 2 weeks because it left places on my neck unshaven.  Nothing beats a blade, no matter how good anyone claims it is.  Still not a bad shaver if you use these types.  Definitely better than the 3 rotating heads found on other types.</li>
            <li> Four years ago I picked up the Panasonic ES8077S system, and I&#x27;ve loved it.  Must have, I kept it for four years.  I replaced the blades only once, about a year or so ago, and it&#x27;s still working great and still holding a charge.  But when I saw this one on an Amazon gold box deal for double digits, I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning unit is larger overall than my old one, though not as tall - mine was shallower with a tall piece that could be extended up to fit the razor, and then collapsed back down after you were done.  This one just bulks more overall.  My other one had the cleaning cartridge in the front, this one in the back, but they use the same one so I can keep going with the ones I had stored.  I hardly use the cleaner though, only when I need to charge every two to three weeks, the rest of the time I just clean it under water with liquid soap, which works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is about the same weight, but a nicer feel with a rubberized surface that is easier to grip than the plastic for those who use it in the shower.  Noise level is less than my other one as well, without sacrificing any of the high speed.  I had read reviews where people talked about how loud this was, but I find it to be very quiet compared to the Brauns and Norelcos I&#x27;ve had before I got my first Panasonic in 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head, and was a couple days behind when I placed this order, so I let it grow just so I&#x27;d have a good test when I got it.  Unit arrived only 10% charged, but was fully charged to 100% in about 90 minutes. The head is different than I&#x27;m used to from the other Panasonic, the whole top floats, rather than just the foils floating inside a more stationary plastic cover.  Makes it larger and deeper, which annoys me as far as cleaning goes, because whereas my last one I could pull out in two sections, the metal foil itself, and then the plastic housing, this all comes as one piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when it comes to shaving, it was clearly a better unit than the ES8077S I&#x27;d been using the last four years.  Even with my new blades, the other Panasonic took longer to get my head smooth, especially when I was lazy and hadn&#x27;t shaved it for a few days and it was getting longer.  This one had no problems with the length, and whether I was going \\&quot;with the grain\\&quot; or against it, it got things smooth faster and easier than any other electric I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The display is nice, having numbers rather than my old one just using a couple green LED lights and a yellow one when it got low.  Nice to see how long I shave for since it counts the minutes, so I can get a feel for how long I can run and how much juice it actually uses.  Handy for the times when I&#x27;ve got a low battery and don&#x27;t know if I really have enough of a charge to do a shave that morning or not.  Now I&#x27;ll be able to better judge that, since nobody likes getting part way into shaving their heads and have the razor run out of juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the gold box deal, it was a steal.  I do really like the cleaner units because they do such a great job of cleaning.  For this price well worth it, but at full price, I think I&#x27;d stick with the standalone razor and just use the liquid soap to clean it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most electric razors, the flip out trimmer in back is more of a nod towards convention than something really usable.  Flimsy as most are, and a lot of tugging and pain  when used.  Which is why I use a separate trimmer that is ONLY a trimmer.  But since every electric razor I&#x27;ve had was similar, I didn&#x27;t feel it critical enough to deduct a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a fantastic unit, especially if you can find a deal on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 31 Aug 2013 - less than 2 years old, and the cleaning unit went belly up.  Won&#x27;t clean, dumps water everywhere, and leaves the cleaning part where the razor sits half filled with water at the end of the cycle.  So not impressed with the longevity of the system.unit than the ES8077S I&#x27;d been using the last four years.  Even with my new blades, the other Panasonic took longer to get my head smooth, especially when I was lazy and hadn&#x27;t shaved it for a few days and it was getting longer.  This one had no problems with the length, and whether I was going \\&quot;with the grain\\&quot; or against it, it got things smooth faster and easier than any other electric I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The display is nice, having numbers rather than my old one just using a couple green LED lights and a yellow one when it got low.

But since every electric razor I&#x27;ve had was similar, I didn&#x27;t feel it critical enough to deduct a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a fantastic unit, especially if you can find a deal on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 31 Aug 2013 - less than 2 years old, and the cleaning unit went belly up.  Won&#x27;t clean, dumps water everywhere, and leaves the cleaning part where the razor sits half filled with water at the end of the cycle.  So not impressed with the longevity of the system.</li>
            <li> A few Days ago Amazon had this shaver on sale for $89.00! I was not even in the market for a shaver but could not pass this bargain up. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 43 years I&#x27;ve used Philips / Norelco shavers. As I aged and my skin lost its suppleness, Norelco&#x27;s shavers became increasingly  less effective. I own a less than 2-year-old top-of-the-line Norelco, and I constantly need to touch up my sessions with a real razor, in order to get a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does it! My skin is as smooth as after I shave with a razor. It has the great advantage that I can use it in the shower, it feels very comfortable in my hand, and cleaning is a breeze. The cleaning apparatus is unnecessary though, since one just washes it in water. Still, I got it all for less than the model below it, which comes without the cleaning apparatus, so what the hey. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I tried Braun and Remington, and they were at that time less satisfactory than the Norelco, which leads me to the conclusion that this Panasonic model ES8249S is the best shaver I have ever owned. Easily 5 stars!  :)</li>
            <li> I have purchased three other shavers within the past nine months, only to be very disappointed by there performance. My last purchase was this shaver from Panasonic. Finally! I get a great shave and the product is quality throughout. The best price was from Amazon</li>
            <li> First, keep in mind I have never used an electric shaver before this. Therefore, I have nothing to compare with it.  The bottom line is simple, this shaver works great. I have a good 5 o&#x27;clock shadow every day and often, I let my face grow for two maybe three days before I shave. The Panasonic handles it well and provides a very smooth shave. The only drawback... I have a goatee and keep my mustache thinner or trimmed from my nose. The Panasonic can not get into that area to shave. Then again, I don&#x27;t think any electric shaver can.   I also shave my head and the shaver does a great job on it as well. Though, in all honesty, it does take a bit longer on the head than it does using a razor, but not much and I switch back and forth.  Overall, after reading many reviews from various sources, this shaver is rated in the top three from many of these sources and I can attest, I understand why it&#x27;s a top rated shaver, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. I use it on my head, beard and body... On my body it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like a blade would do. Only concern is, this shaver doesn&#x27;t work great unless the hair is VERY short. So I usually use my other trimmer then use the Panassonic shaver to finish off. And the cleaning system cartlidge only LASTS FOR 2-3 CLEANINGS, THAT&#x27;S ALL. i was shocked when it was done after 2 cleanings.   Anyways, other than the cleaning system cartlidges, this for the price is great.</li>
            <li> Noisy, but shaves like a safety razor.  on old skin like mine under neck just fair. otherwise I like it.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver.  Quick recharge.  No mess of any kind.  Very convenient.  Very easy to use. Nice small carrying pouch.  Excellent battery life.</li>
            <li> Quick review, this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  And I&#x27;ve owned and/or tried just about all of them.  Quick, clean shave, easy clean up, great battery life and it even comes with a nice little cleaning/charging station.  For the price I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong!  John C</li>
            <li> provides a decent shave for daily usage.  i like that it holds a charge well.  its also good for touch ups after a wet shave.  my only knock is that when i packed it in my suitcase something pressed the power button and made my suitcase vibrate.  next time i&#x27;ll pack it with my carry on.</li>
            <li> Just bought this the other day to replace a $100 subpar Norelco and I&#x27;m glad I did.  This thing is light years better than the Norelco and its also ranked #2 in the Consumer Reports I looked at.  The motor on the Norelco seems like its going maybe 1/3 as faster as the Panasonic and that seems to make a big difference.  The razor is really high class with its look and the grip is extremely comfortable.  Haven&#x27;t used the charger cleaner and don&#x27;t know that I will very much since its costly but I do like the fact I can store my razor there instead in a drawer where all the shaving come out and create a mess.  There is also a $15 rebate on Panasonic&#x27;s website for this razor and a few others.  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> This does a fairly good job, not as good as the earlier Panasonic. Battery life is very good between charges. However I do like the fastersmoother shave or the Norelco better that I bought out of town on the cheep when I forgot to pack this.</li>
            <li> I just had to chime in on the onslaught of praise for this product.  It is easily the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone. Here&#x27;s my list of highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very close shave on all areas, including the neck (always a trouble spot for me)&lt;br /&gt;- Two minutes is all that&#x27;s needed for a quick shave&lt;br /&gt;- No pulling and no irritation whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;- The wet shave is even closer and brilliant in the shower&lt;br /&gt;- Cleanup is exceptionally easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the slowness of the self-cleaning system, but I rarely use it since a quick rinse under the tap does just as well.  If the razor without the cleaning system  is cheaper, I&#x27;d go with that one.</li>
            <li> In the market again for an electric shaver and wanted to change brands..........    I have used Norelco for years, however I always seem to have stubble later in the day.  I have tried a low end Remmington for $60 bucks, it was very loud. Good for cutting the easy open areas.  I also had a 14 year old Panasonic which offered a great cut and like all electric razors......they would give razor burn in the tough to shave areas.  The Norelco with its fair cut sent me running for a blade and would use the electric for a fast shave.    Tried the ES8249S and Panasonic is totally correct, its as good as a blade!  Simply put shaving cream on your face and this razor cuts great. Face feels just like a blade cut it.    Give it a try you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Got tired of paying $30+ for replacement blades and thought I should consider an electric razor. Also got tired of trying to cram the small can of shaving cream in the ziploc bag at airport security and having it take up most of the bag.  Tried a Norelco about 15 years ago and gave up.  Was looking at Braun and Norelco but came across research and all the positive feedback from Panasonic owners and decided to give it a try.  Awesome.  I tried it the first day dry and the second day with shaving cream.  Very close shave both ways (as close as my blade).  Late in the day and the growth is probably less than when using the blade.  Makes shaving quick and easy.  Love the flexibility of choice of wet or dry.  Also like the option of having the head either fixed or floatng (\\&quot;soft\\&quot;).  Has a subtle little hum.  The deal on Amazon ([...]) was a steal.  About 15% cheaper than I could find it at any of the local electronic box stores or mega retailers.  The shipping was amazingly quick (even over the holidays).  Ordered it New Years eve and received in Jan 4.  Great product.  Great price.  Great shipping time and processing.</li>
            <li> My husband has had many razors over the years, but this one was a hit! He can&#x27;t stop talking about it. An excellent product! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Does wonders for minimizing razor burn/irritation.  Also, it charges amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> Been using the shaver for a few months now and so far no problem.   I had an older model that after a year, the cleaning system just failed and I used it as just a shaver that I cleaned manually.  Now I am trying to run the cleaning and dry cycle only 2 times per week, mixing in a razor cut 1 tme a week to reuce the usage and try to prolong the life. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> in my job i have to shave every day so i was getting sick and tired of using a blade every day, have irritation, bumps, acne ect.... so i made the switch to this beauty. it gives a great shave both wet or dry. almost zero irritation, no cuts, no ingrown hairs. the included cleaning station is a huge bonus and does a great job of cleaning the shaver head. over all could not be more satisfied with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used a blade razor for fifty years and although I had tried an electric razor twice before, they just didn&#x27;t shave well at all.  Now that I have a heart condition and must take blood thinner, I need to avoid any cuts and nicks.  Therefore, after researching numerous reviews for Braun, Remington, Phillips, and Panasonic, I was impressed with the reviews of the Panasonic ES8249S ArcIV and made a decision to purchase one via Amazon.com.  Even though all of the reviews highly rated this shaver, and a few highly praised the unit, I never expected the results that I have.  This electric shaver is terrific and shaves me as close as a blade in just three minutes.  I can&#x27;t believe it and am more than satisfied with this model and would recommend it to anyone.  Contrary to some comments, I needed no time to acustome my face to the shaver.  Just wash your face before and in three minutes you are finished.  It seems to be the best buy on the market.  One comment though, the cost for a set of replacement blades and microscreen, which I would consider to be worth much less than 10% of the shaver, actually costs 35% of the total purchase price.  Seems that they need to get their money from somewhere.  Conclusion: A fantastic razor at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found every electric shaver I&#x27;ve liked ever trying them on and off of a long time, some where more expensive than this one, but I&#x27;ve never found one that performed nearly as well a bladed safety razor in closeness and Comfort. I&#x27;ve been converted... this thing rocks, after over 30 years as a sworn safety razor guy I&#x27;ve found an electric razor that shaves as close and without the pulling and skin rash I&#x27;ve experienced in the past with electric Razors. So if your considering this as a gift, or you want a razor that holds a charge and honestly works as well as shaving cream and a safety razor, this one or one of the other Panasonic shavers is for you. I&#x27;m amazed :). But honestly buy it you&#x27;ll like it.  Sadly I have to update this review, as it will not charge in or outside of he base unit. I tried several wall outlets and no luck. The shaver came with about a 20% charge so I decided to try it out, and it was as described above, but if I can&#x27;t charge it it&#x27;s a $100.00+ paper wieght so...   anyway if yuo bought one and everything works I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I love this razor!!!  My previous razor was worn out--the long hair catcher was broken.  The old razor was missing so many hairs on my neck I was beginning to resemble a Wookie.  I sent my old razor into forced retirement and ordered this razor as a replacement.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!!  The first shave removed hairs that had been dodging the blade on every morning shave for months.  Simply incredible.  Closest to a blade I have ever experienced in an electric razor and surprisingly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I always shave &#x27;wet&#x27; with a gel.  I was a little hesitant to buy the razor with the cleaning system--but I am delighted with the charging/cleaning station.  The charging/cleaning system does a great job cleaning and DRYING the razor head.  My former practice was to simply rinse off the razor after each shave.  When I disposed of my old razor, I was obliged to extract the Lithium battery for proper disposal and I was amazed at how much gunk had accumulated inside the razor over the years.  The cleaning system does a much better job keeping the head clean (and dry).  I also avoid immersing the new razor to keep the insides tidy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your face a favor---use this razor.</li>
            <li> I like this very much.  Been using it for about a year.  Switched to electric to reduce irritation from razor blades and this has worked.  It doesn&#x27;t give nearly as close a shave as the razor which probably accounts for the reduced irritation but I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of electric razors for a long time now, ever since I had a dorm room without a sink - buying an electric meant I could shave without hoping whether the bathroom down the hall was empty or not.  However, neither of the razors I&#x27;ve owned before this Panasonic really did the job all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first one was a [[ASIN:B000PM8UAK Norelco 8825XL Spectra Shaver (factory refurbished)]], though mine wasn&#x27;t a refurb.  Cut decently, though never great, and never did that good of a job under the chin.  Worst of all, if you missed a day, it would penalize you in a big way by ripping and tugging at my stubble-turned-whiskers; painful.  The rotary blade setup is also very complex and tedious to clean properly, and in my case, prone to mechanical failures too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about three years of shaving with it, I got tired of dealing with it and replaced it with a [[ASIN:B00008DQJQ Factory Reconditioned Braun 7526 Syncro Smart Logic Shaver]] purchased from Amazon.  Nothing wrong with the refurb and I found the foil-type razor to work much better than the rotary, but it was still not as effective as I&#x27;d hoped.  It took too many passes to get anything off from under my chin, to the point where I&#x27;d end up with razor burn (and some patches that, once missed for a day, I&#x27;d have to use the popup trimmer on).  This one at least wouldn&#x27;t penalize me with ripping my face if I skipped a day, but it did mean I would have to spend twice as long working on my shave the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fed up with this, my wife bought me this 8249S earlier this year.  First shave out of the box, I knew it was something far better than anything I&#x27;d ever used - three minutes and I actually had a truly smoothly shaved face.  Unlike my previous razors, this one doesn&#x27;t penalize you for skipping a day.  If I skip shaving all weekend, Monday morning I spend about 30 to 60 seconds longer (according to the timer) than my normal three-minute shave.  I don&#x27;t have to take as many passes to cleanly shave my face, which means I no longer have razor burn mixed with missed whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, the cleaning station is a very welcome addition.  The [[ASIN:B000BF1396 Panasonic WES035P Vortex HydraClean Cleaning Cartridge and Filter (3 Cartridges)]] are supposed to last a month but I&#x27;ve been getting closer to 40-45 days out of each one, and that&#x27;s with a clean after every single shave.  I definitely recommend getting them with Subscribe &amp; Save here, though unfortunately Amazon doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;once every four month\\&quot; option which would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, I&#x27;ve never been as happy with a razor as I am with this one.e, which means I no longer have razor burn mixed with missed whiskers.    To top it off, the cleaning station is a very welcome addition.

            <li> I&#x27;ll make it short and sweet: This is the best electric shaver I have ever had. Shave is amazingly close and amazingly comfortable, the shaver is easy to hold, and the lithium-ion battery charges quickly. THIS IS A WINNER!</li>
            <li> To make it quick I am knocking this down a point for the cleaning system. I dont think its necessary. You dont HAVE to use it and it make a handy holder but if you dont at least put it on \\&quot;dry\\&quot; (or \\&quot;clean\\&quot;) it gets gross. It takes a looooong time to run its cycle and its kinda noisy.    The razer itself is just awesome. Im a lifetime norelco/tri-blade guy. This thing just does a much better job for me. I didnt even really need the traditional - give it a month and your face will get used to it. In fact its so close a shave Id recommend a soothing gel for those with sensitive skin.     It also does a great job on my head which i like to shave periodically. I use a trimmer first and then this. It really handles everything. The display is very clear, just no complaints at all.     Do spend a minute comparing the price difference between this model and the one without the cleaner. Dont pay much for the upgrade. otherwise, its a winner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with electrics my entire shaving life because my skin does not like constant shaving with a blade. Over the past 20 years I&#x27;ve always used top of the line Braun shavers. They did a good job but they required alot of going over the same spot and that took a lot of time. This shaver completely blows the Brauns out of the water. The shave is much closer (equivalent to a blade) and you are done much faster. It feels great in your hand and it&#x27;s designed to get to different contours of your face and neck. I&#x27;m thrilled with this shaver. My son has just started shaving and he loves it as well. I would not hesitate to recommend this shaver</li>
            <li> All the reviews I read praising this device were justified.  It is a remarkable razor.  Shaves close, charges quickly, easy to clean and maintain.  Having shaved with all the conventional razors for years (including a few electrical) I was skeptical to start.  I quickly became a believer. Great product!</li>
            <li> Owned Brauns for as long as I can remember...but decided to switch based on the reviews here.  I will tell you that it does give a close shave and it more comfortable than the Braun.  it has drastically reduced my neck rash.  I have medium to heavy beard and I like to let it go for the weekend, even an occasional beard or goatee to \\&quot;switch\\&quot; things up.   For some reason, either the blades don&#x27;t vibrate fast enough or you&#x27;re supposed to go REALLY slow over 3-4 days growth...because it literally rips the odd hair out of your face.  OUCH!  I do agree that it gives a very close shave on an EVERYDAY basis, but I can&#x27;t use it to shave an existing beard (again, I know that this is not it&#x27;s intended use, but I&#x27;m not going to use a straight razor for that when my 5 yr old braun NEVER ripped out my facial hair).    The cleaning cycle works fine.   Haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to go through the cartridge.</li>
            <li> Great product. It shaves with ease and makes shaving more enjoyable...if thats possible. Only problem I see is that if you wait a few days in between shaving it can be difficult to shave around the neck line. Just keep a manual razor on hand just in case to fix any small issues that this poses.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I ever had.  I have had Braun and Norelco shavers before.  This is the best.</li>
            <li> I got This Machine after reading the reviews on it, I was looking for a solution to my sensitive skin and I finally found it.    I used to suffer from skin irritations and normally if I shave and find only one or two spot with blood then that&#x27;s a great day  The first time I used it I thought it&#x27;s a piece of junk cause it didn&#x27;t shave good, (my beard was too long to be shaved in one round) , and it gave me a skin irritation cause I pressed it so hard on my skin (which what would happen with any shaver electrical or none),  then I tried it for a second time and that was it, never stopped using it since then.    I now enjoy the fact that I can shave twice a day if I want without worrying that my skin will be irritated, previously I&#x27;d to make one day break between each shave    The cleaning kit is awesome, you just shave and put it in the cleaning kit; it&#x27;ll clean &amp; charge it for you.    Overall a very good product I highly recommend it, especially for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic for some years.  When it finally quit, I didn&#x27;t hesitate buying anonther Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves close and easy to take care of.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave very well and the products for clean are expensive and the second thing is that gets hot so fast</li>
            <li> It is much better than the Braun series7 and 5 and also the Norelco which irritated my face  I have been using electric shavers for approx 30 years and this one is about the best.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in over 20 years.  Never thought I would either until I tried the Panasonic ES8249S.  I had an infection on my neck and the dermotogolist suggested I switch from a traditional razor.  I was shocked when I found how close the Panasonic razor shaved.  I usually use it as a wet shaver with shaving cream and couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
            <li> I am an amateur pet groomer. I specialize in urban cuts for your pets. What I&#x27;ll do is this, I take Panasonic trimmer and get rid of all the large areas. Then I take their beard trimmer and begin to cut my designs into their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have groomed Nicki Minaj&#x27;s Calico and dyed her hair pink with platinum to give it that bling. I groomed Megan fox&#x27;s cat and gave it that fierce I&#x27;m gonna eat you alive look. I even shaved Kim Kardashian&#x27;s kitty for her and made it nice and smooth, she shows it off as much as she can so I take that as a sign of the good work that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want that tame looking kitty to look like it will rip your head off... just send it to me. I&#x27;ll treat that kitty right.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with razor irritation for years and years.  A buddy of mine talked me into purchasing a panasonic razor.  I waited until it went on sale on Amazon and made my purchase.  After 3 uses with this razor I have not had any irritation on my neck, ABSOLUTELY ZERO!  I am used to getting razor bumps after every shave and it&#x27;s difficult to wear collared shirts because of the irritation. NOT ANY MORE!  Previously I used a Mach 3 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor came with a cleaner which I don&#x27;t necessarily intend to use, there are mixed reviews about this.  My buddy has the blue razor which does not come with the cleaner and he has used his razor for 2 years.  He is still on the same blades.  He paid around $75 for his on sale, that adds up to $3.13 a month and his price per month usage keeps getting cheaper the longer he uses his panasonic shaver!  Cheaper than buying razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is close but you may miss a few hairs and occasionally have to go back over areas on your face.  I have shaved 3 times and still have about 60 or 70% battery life left for additional shaves.  I highly recommend this razor or the blue panasonic razor!  Don&#x27;t go for a cheaper model electric razor that will lift hair before it cuts, this will most likely cause skin irritation.  If you&#x27;re tired of skin irritation and you looking for comfort this is the razor for you!</li>
            <li> I switched from a Braun Series 7 790. After a few weeks of use, this shaver does seem to provide a closer shave. The quality of the shaver feels solid, not cheap. I like how the cleaning cycle is much quieter than the Braun - I can run the cleaning cycle when I am home and the noise isn&#x27;t disturbing. The only thing that seems odd to me is that when the shaver is done charging, it continuously flashes the display every two seconds - it never goes into standby mode. It&#x27;s a little irritating in the night when the orange led display is flashing in your bathroom. At first I thought something was wrong, but the manual says this is what it does when the unit is done charging. I started taking it out of the charging base before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> This is a fine shaver and does a creditable job. But it takes nearly 5 minutes to do a complete shave, and it cannot shave as close as a blade. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied but when I need a quick, close shave, I reach for my old blade.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fact that I can use a wet shaving cream, At this point I am not sure of the shave results vs regular blade, however the instructions say to wait 30 days for your beard to adjust. I will tell more after 30 days.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was just what we ordered.  This is my second purchase of this type of shaver because the first one got stepped on by mistake.  Love the brand and the self-cleaning part.</li>
            <li> I already own one of these shavers for the last two years, but I lost the charger and to replace it, it was going to cost me about $30 dollars.  Since I found a terrific price for the whole unit ($114) I decide to buy it and have two instead of one.   I try different brands and styles before, but none of them will give me a good shave like this Panasonic. I love it. The battery last weeks on one charge,  And the blades are excellent quality; I haven&#x27;t replaced them in two years and still give me a deep shave.  Hope this review helps you to decide what product to buy.</li>
            <li> I bought the ES 8249 over 2 years ago &amp; have been very pleased with it. It takes a bit of work to get my neck shaved, but that is true of manual razors as well as any other electric shaver I used. I used it almost exclusively in the shower with shaving cream. Since I rinsed it after every use, I did not use the cleaning/recharging module except when it needed recharging. Several weeks ago the LCD screen failed, and then about 2 weeks ago it failed altogether. I followed the instructions for removing the battery and in the process of taking it apart, noted that water was inside the rubber seal and there was a little bit of rust and corrosion. After letting it dry thoroughly and scraping/brushing away the corroded areas (including a little damage on the circuit board) I reassembled it and it is working once again, even the LCD screen. I will continue to use in the shower but will try to only get the shaving head wet vs. holding the whole thing under the shower to clean. In the meantime I went ahead and ordered the ES 8243 which is the same model without the recharging/cleaning unit. The price at Amazon was only about $105, which I figure would be about a years worth of manual shaving supplies.</li>
            <li> purchased a few of these, so far so good, a little bit expensive for me, but worth it. will recommend to friends</li>
            <li> This is my 4th electronic shaver. Previously I have owned one Remington and two Norelcos (including the expensive Arcitec series). The Arcitec did a pretty good job and I was quite happy with it. Then one day I saw this Panasonic shaver on a deal for 90 USD and just out of curiosity decided to try it. After using it for more than a month now I have to say say that this shaver is the best I have ever used. Its so comfortable to use and works great on my neck region as well. I can now have a full shave in less than 3 minutes while with the Norelco I had to go over the same area over an over again and it was taking more than 5 minutes every time to get an acceptable shave. The cleaning system is also pretty cool and I use it after every three shaves and it does keep my shaver clean and fresh. Overall I am extremely happy with this shaver from Panasonic and the pricing at Amazon is really the best.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver; smooth shave; it took appproximately a week for it to keep gray beard on chin cut real low; now it maintains a smooth shave</li>
            <li> The shave is nice looking. Besides, I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s noisy. It shaves fast and efficiently. It&#x27;s the best shaver that I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Purchased this around a week ago. Amazon delivered it two days early which is awesome. I immediately turned it on for a quick shave test. At around 10% charge on it, took a couple passes which is expected at that low of a battery. However, it was so smooth and pain free. No pulling and it got everything, even my trouble spots (behind the back of the jaw and next to my adam&#x27;s apple). Slight irritation but that comes with buying a new razor so it should stop in a few days. Great price for a really great shaver.</li>
            <li> I really liked this shaver, until it quit. Panasonic gave me a run-around about the warranty and ultimately did not honor their replacement policy. I will never buy another panasonic product after this experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this razor for a little more than a year. I liked it so much, I bought a second identical shaver to keep in my office. Shortly after buying the second, the first one started blinking oddly and then quit. It was well within the warranty period, so I called panasonic and got information for sending it in under warranty--which I did. Since I bought the shaver on amazon, that is the receipt I sent. Long story short, they basically told me that the amazon purchase receipt was not a receipt. I received this letter with my faulty shaver enclosed about four weeks after I sent it in. This is how panasonic treats people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, the second razor, which then became my primary shaver has also now quit. Needless to say, having purchased it also on amazon, I did not bother trying to contact panasonic. I did however purchase another shaver that, though not quite as good as the panasonic, does have a company that stands behind their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adios panasonic. For everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signed,&lt;br /&gt;Someone who buys a whole lot of stuff.</li>
            <li> This is an overpriced razor.  Does not cut close at all.  I purchased a Remington for $39.  And it cuts way closer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different electric razors over the years, and have never found one that I&#x27;ve liked or that did a comparable job to blades.  I&#x27;m a guy who shaves my whole head too.  I bought this on a whim after reading some of the reviews, and I am impressed.  I can shave with it dry very quickly, or if I use my shaving lotion and take a couple extra minutes, I can shave my beard just about as close as blades can.  A+</li>
            <li> I have had many electric razars and been dissapointed with all of them.  This seems to work very well and I don&#x27;t need to touch up afterwards with a blade.  I actually found an electric razor I can use!</li>
            <li> After some initial confusion completely related to the ineptitude of the USPS, I received my shaver and am completely satisfied with the vendor and product.</li>
            <li> I paid top dollar for this shaver. It came with a cleaning stand that I religiously used. About the 3rd time I used the cleaning stand I found it full of really gross liquid. So I purchased a new cartridge, read the instructions (again) carefully and started the next cleaning cycle. Same thing. Now, after about a year and one new cartridge and one new blade set I&#x27;m ready to toss this into the landfill. It sounds like a lawnmower, and cuts like a hacksaw. If it only cost $29 dollars I wouldn&#x27;t complain. But I&#x27;ve got about $150 into this very poorly designed razor.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to but this shavor has become an essential travel accesory.  It won&#x27;t take you from a beard to clean shaven, but it will certainly keep 1-day of stuble in check.  I probably only shave with a razor once a week and use this the rest of the week.  It also goes weeks on a single charge and the docking station that clean it is great.  No hassle, just drop it off at the end end of the week and your good</li>
            <li> Nice shaver.  I bought it as a Christmas gift for my son and he states that it gives a nice, close, nick free shave.</li>
            <li> The product has worked as advertised. The shaver provides an adequately close shave, with little effort. I had not used an electric shaver in many years and was pleasantly surprised at the closeness of the shave. The cleaning/drying/charging component has worked extremely well----it&#x27;s pretty much, &amp;#34;Set it and forget it!&amp;#34;  I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver -- last year Christmas (2011) and forgot to write a review... This shaver is the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used... I always used to have problems with the ones I would always use - I used to buy the best I could find, been using the Mach3 Turbo for a long time... and some others... and they always cause burn and or bumps... etc.. on and on... and they are so expensive.. I couldn&#x27;t shave every day with those either, too much irritation to my sensitive skin.. This shaver is excellent, gives a close shave... I used it for a month with shaving gel and I cannot say enough good things about it - - No more costly shavers every time I go to the store... And I like the cleaning system - - You can get the cartridges right here on amazon, they aren&#x27;t very much - the shaver doesn&#x27;t need the full cleaning cycle each time... all depends on how you use it.. I use it almost every day and cleaning through the &#x27;system&#x27; process about 3 times a week, the cartridge will last about 30 days to 45 days... For those reviewers that say it&#x27;s not needed - - Well yes, it&#x27;s not needed, but it works for the shaver -- meaning, it&#x27;s cleaned and dried properly so the blades last longer... My blades are still as sharp as they were when I got over a year ago... and the cleaning system works great - - I would rather spend about $10 for 3-4 months of cartridges vs. spending alot more for razors and replacing the blades and especially cleaning it by hand.... One of the reasons I wanted to try this and see if it worked like alot of reviewers say was to cut down on shaving time and it certainly does and it&#x27;s so easy and quick.. And I don&#x27;t want to spend extra time cleaning it by hand.. Just put it in the system and it&#x27;s done...  GREAT PRODUCT AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE TO TRY... I DON&#x27;T THINK YOU&#x27;LL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!</li>
            <li> I have always been an opponent for an electric razor for a number of reasons, biggest one is that I have sensitive skin and without pressing really hard on my face, never seemed to get a close shave.  After my friend got his, and after a recent visit to the big box store where I got to see a 40 dollar price tag on disposables, I was convinced to try.  I opted for the most bang for my buck and a model that was wet dry, you can actually use shaving cream with this model, which helps to nearly eliminate the break in irritation of most razors.  The shave I get in just 2.5 minutes (the razor has a timer) is so smooth and so easy, its sad to think of all the money and time I have wasted over the years on traditional shaving products.  Fantastic shaver, fantastic value.</li>
            <li> I just received my new piece of technology this year for Christmas.  Who would expect I wanted it to be a razor.  I remember using one when I was younger with my Grandpop, it was one of the Norelco models.  I remember that, even though I didn&#x27;t have facial hair at that time, after using it my face would be sore.  I&#x27;ve always wanted an electric razor, ever since that time, I&#x27;m not sure why.  Probably to connect some how with my Grandpop who is no longer with us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did so much research online prior to buying this.  I was completely surprised to find that the top model on every website I found was this one, by Panasonic.  I figured I would find Norelco or maybe Braun but not Panasonic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to trust all the strangers out there who were extremely pleased with their purchases and buy my own.  WOW is all I can say, the technology has come so far since that floating head Norelco that they STILL sell.  This razor amazed me on the first use.  They say to give your skin a few weeks to adjust to the new electric shaver but I really don&#x27;t think it even needs that.  The shave is so close, so smooth, as smooth as a blade.  Zero irritation and that is only using it dry.  You can also take it in the shower with you, or use it with shaving cream.  I could not be happier and want to urge all of you out there looking for a new shave.  Give this one a try, you absolutely will not be sorry.  Yes it&#x27;s Panasonic, and yes I am 100% happy with mine, the most comfortable shave ever!</li>
            <li> Got this today.  Waded through a lot of extra words in the instruction book to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing anything.  Charged it, cleaned it, then shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know an electric razor could do that.  Dang.  My face is amazingly smooth in under five minutes.  My skin isn&#x27;t irritated the way it often is with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming the thing is reasonably durable, this is full of win.  5-stars; would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very over rated.  This is a decent razor, it delivers an OK shave but has trouble on the neck.  Contrary to many reviews this is not the world&#x27;s greatest razor.</li>
            <li> From day 1 this shaver outperforned all previous wet/dry Panasonics I have used in the past, 15 years. The close shave is unparalleled and is very quiet. Its a great shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver cost more than I usually spend for a shaver, but I think it is worth it.  It is really a smooth shaver; easy to use and easier to clean.  I am very please with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been stuck with my Gillette Fusion for years now since most electric shavers I have tried only irritated my skin and left much stubble on my face. And the Fusion gave me a great shave with minimal irritation. But then.... I found that some people were recommending this shaver to us \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; types. I was skeptical, and a little nervous. I don&#x27;t have a lot of money, and spending $150 on something I wasn&#x27;t sure would even work for me was risky. I did it though, and I will tell ya what. :-) As long as you shave every day, this shaver will not disappoint! I don&#x27;t get the irritation, and if I use it dry, I get a terrific shave! If I let it go over the weekend or something, I still have to use my Fusion since the hair is so thick and long at that point. But my point is that I LOVE this razor! I would wholeheartedly recommend this product to those who have sensitive skin with thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this from a 4 year-old Norelco SmartTouch XL rotary razor. I hesitated at the large price tag but took the leap and it was well worth it. This shaver cuts closer than any of my previous rotary razors. I also have a light beard and I can shave my neck, right along the beard, without it yanking any hairs at all. I&#x27;m pretty confident that if I went over my beard with this thing, it would shave it off with a few passes without any hair-pulling. The cleaning mode is a LITTLE loud, but no louder than the razor itself. Plus, if you shave in the morning, you&#x27;ll probably be at work while it cleans, anyway. Now, the cleaning cartridges cost $10 for 3, and the manual says to replace them every month. Not sure how long they really last yet.</li>
            <li> First, I do NOT find this to be a &#x27;one pass&#x27; shaver. If you want a CLOSE shave, like any other shaver it will take time, stretching the skin and multiple passes. Period.      Plusses:    The shaver is very LIGHT - I would think good for those who are arthritic  The ultra thin foil shaves COMFORTABLY and GENTLY.  No matter how many passes I make, the shave REMAINS gentle.  It is possible to shave CLOSER than my high-end, self-cleaning Braun.  It shaves MORE closely in a single pass.  It is quieter, with a monotone hum at precisely A below Middle C.  The cleaning cartridges, since they are dry, CAN not spill and are more compact to STORE.    Minus:    Noisy when cleaning and the clean/dry cycle, since it uses water and not alcohol, takes longer. Though it doesn&#x27;t appear necessary to clean daily.      Notes:    I have very sensitive throat skin and a very heavy beard  Using a safety razor on my throat ALWAYS leaves it covered with a thin sheet of blood.  I always use the equivalent of Williams&#x27; Lectric Shave.  I never use a shaver in the shower.  I replaced a Braun Pulsonic with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is an amazing razor!  I had an older, cheaper panasonic and I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing. The closest shave I have ever had in my life. Cuts the hair on my neck like no other. The cleaning system is just a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many electric shavers over the years and I always thought they sucked. I have a heavy beard growth and while they were usually OK on the cheeks, they missed a lot of hairs on the neck and other areas. I gave up on them a long time ago and had shaved with blades and foam exclusively from around my early twenties until my mid to late thirties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward until a couple of years ago and I was given a Braun Series 7 which was amazing. Electric shavers had obviously progressed a lot in the last decade or so. This thing actually shaved me properly all over and I could do it dry! I didn&#x27;t have to shave in the shower like I usually do and no more foam, rash, cuts etc. I became a convert to electric shaving and never looked back. At the time, I believed the performance of the Braun Series 7 was the best I could ever expect from an electric and I swore I would always stick with Braun from then on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was until I was recently given this Panasonic shaver as a gift from my father. Long story short, this thing is incredible and is much better than the Braun. It is FAST! This shaver gives me a fantastic baby smooth, irritation free shave in around five minutes. It is so powerful that it literally makes facial hair disappear as if it is being &#x27;erased&#x27; from your face as you shave. I never thought I would say this and I didn&#x27;t think it was possible but in my opinion, this shaver gives a shave that is BETTER THAN A BLADE! The pop up trimmer also works very well for shaping sideburns etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this shaver highly enough. It works great and is very easy to maintain and keep clean and now it&#x27;s making me wonder; if this model is this good, is the five blade model even better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An amazing piece of technology that really delivers what men want; a fast, smooth, irritation free, very close shave. An easy five stars.</li>
            <li> Did the job, but you had to go over spots repeatedly.  I was somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this electric shaver. It easily shaves the hard to get areas on my neck and the self cleaning feature is great. I use it roughly every three to four days and can finish shaving in about 5 minutes. This is by far the closet shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a great job on my face. It gets as close as a razor without any irritation. It doesn&#x27;t do the best job on my neck as I always have to go over it with a razor. If I didn&#x27;t care about a few stubbles on my neck I could get away with it but I do care. You can use this wet or dry. I never use it with shaving cream &amp; it does not bother me at all. I have another Panasonic trimmer which also does a great job. I think Panasonic makes a great quality shavers &amp; trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I think razor blades such as the mach 5 do a far better job than any electric shaver. I tried this just to see and sure enough I hate all electric razors.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for a month now and find it to give me a much better/closer shave than the  Braun shaver it has replaced.  I bought it on a special pricing and don&#x27;t think that I could have gotten any better at any price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an electric razor that I can use in the shower, that doesn&#x27;t require any special shaving cream/oil/lotion, and gives a good, close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was astounded after my first shave.  It was the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in ages, left me feeling no razor burn, and left NO stubbly patches/spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has traveled with me to several countries now, and the charge easily lasts for two weeks.  It&#x27;s easy to clean, even without the cleaning unit.  You just pop off the shield, clean it under running water, and then hold the power button for two seconds to take it up to supersonic speeds to clean the blades.  It&#x27;s an absolute joy and I&#x27;m thrilled with my choice.</li>
            <li> Not the 5 Star shaver it is presented to be. I get a nice (dry) face shave using facesaver, HOWEVER, the NECK remains a big problem!! Always a tradeoff between pressing harder, removing (most) hairs and getting redness/ bumps OR going over lightly leaving many hairs behind and looking like a dork...     Panasonic, back to the drawing board - and please stop sponsoring reviews, it will come back to haunt you.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m 66 years old, so I&#x27;ve tried many of them. From all the different brands available, Panasonic is the one I like the most. This one is even better than all the previous ones, including Braun, Philips, and other Panasonic models. It is quiet, smooth, and on top of it, does a perfect job from the very first use. As if all this is not enough, it is beautifull...!!!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this razor as a Christmas gift for myself. I have only used an electric razor a few times before purchasing this one. I had used a Norelco rotary product before, and it destroyed my skin on the first use. I tried it for about a week and then gave up and went back to the trusty Mach 3. I was tired of getting the razor burn every time I shave, so I looked into different electrics. I have sensitive skin and I looked through the reviews to find what might fit me best.    Then I found this razor.    After I got it, I ran it through the clean/dry/charge cycle to rid the materials of any manufacturing byproducts, like oils and metal bits, before use. It&#x27;s a wet/dry razor, so I took it in the shower like I normally do with the blade. I used a small, thin layer of shaving cream and WOW. What a difference. No irritation, and a really close shave. I admit it&#x27;s not as close as a blade, but it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now, and what little discomfort that occurred after shaving has now gone away. I get a wonderfully close and smooth shave every time. I have a goatee and this razor ignores the longer hairs if you kinda pull them to the side, and it will get all the stubble in the area. The trimmer on this razor ACTUALLY WORKS! I have small, fine, blonde hairs on my ears and this thing took all of that off. I normally shave my head in the warmer months, and that will be my next venture with this razor. Highly recommended product, and it was $92 and some change with shipping, but I paid for 2-day shipping because I couldn&#x27;t wait. That beats the hell out of the $249.99 retail price tag.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin around my neck...no problem with this thing!!! charging clean is great, cleaning doesn&#x27;t need to happen everyday. I use a gel shaving cream with a quick renise after use then just a stand cleaning about once every 1-2 weeks you don&#x27;t need to buy cleaning detergent refills for each month. Use as recommend by Panasonic 30 days straight, I know its hard to do especially if you don&#x27;t work or shave on the weekends but trust me it helps your face get used to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 20 years now. I have a lot of bumps and such on my face, so I switched to electric shavers as I got tired of the weekly \\&quot;bleeding\\&quot; I&#x27;d endure from the first shave from a new blade on my old \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; razor. My most recent electric shaver was on it&#x27;s last legs, so I started researching on what I might like to buy next. I saw this shaver, the Panasonic ES8249S Arc IV Nanotech Vortex Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, as part of a gold box deal here on Amazon. Although I&#x27;d never used a \\&quot;foil\\&quot; shaver, the reviews seemed pretty positive, so I decided to give it a go. After a few months use, below are my pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- While not as close-shaving as a blade, it gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t do a good job of manually cleaning/washing my shaver (I don&#x27;t do it often enough), so the automatic cleaner is a nice, easy feature.&lt;br /&gt;- While your mileage may vary, my face didn&#x27;t need any adjustment time with this shaver, as I typically have when switching to a new shaver, which was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;- I get a close shave without having to use any cream or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The first time I used it, my wife immediately commented on how much louder it was than my old shaver. It sounds like a combination between a dental drill (it has a very high speed motor) and a bug zapper (you can hear the individual hairs being cut). The cleaner is similarly loud and runs for well over an hour when cleaning your razor&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver&#x27;s head is large and shaped such that I have some trouble shaving up to my sideburns and under my nose. At first I thought it just might be something I need to get used to, I still need to use the trimmer more than I did with my other razors&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning cartridges don&#x27;t last as long as they&#x27;re supposed to. According to the manufacturer&#x27;s specs, they should last about a month, but I get the \\&quot;status\\&quot; light telling me to change my cartridge after two weeks. You don&#x27;t have to change it then, but you can&#x27;t use the cleaning unit to clean your shaver until you do, which is annoying (and expensive). My beard is not overly heavy, so I&#x27;m not sure why it doesn&#x27;t last closer to a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither a pro nor a con:&lt;br /&gt;- Panasonic recommends you replace the blades after two years and the foil covering after a year. On my old rotary head shavers, the only thing you&#x27;d have to replace is the rotary head blades. So, with a foil razor, you have an added annual expense as compared to a rotary.&lt;br /&gt;- The location of the on/off switch relative to how I hold the shaver ... the way it fits my hand, I usually end up accidentally turning the shaver off twice a week while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give this product four stars. It gives a close shave and although it has a few \\&quot;nits\\&quot;, it was a good buy.on&#x27;t have to change it then, but you can&#x27;t use the cleaning unit to clean your shaver until you do, which is annoying (and expensive).

            <li> I purchased this from another retailer due to free shaving mirror included in that purchase (same price).  I have used it daily since I got it on 02-09-2011.  The unit is really light and feels good in the hands.  It is really quiet compared to my old Braun 7000.  I looked at the different options and ended up choosing the Panasonic due to the wet/dry shave ability.  The price point was a little better once I look around.  The pivot system on this unit follows my face quite well.  The independent 4 blade system is a nice design.  I think it helps in such a great shave.  Yes, I do need to do more then one pass to get rid of the hair.  Then again I had to do the same with my Braun unit as well this was not a deal breaker for me.  The shave is really close and a single shave for me is around 10% of charge(around 5-6 minutes).  The cleaning mode is quieter then my ten year old Braun shaver.  I have not used the self cleaning mode, but I will be able to try it out after my trip in March.  The only negative I have found is that I cannot find the refill blades or cleaning cartridges locally.  The cleaning cartridges are cheaper too if you do the subscribe and save option.  The Braun refills are around 10-12 dollars locally where I live.  I ordered 4 three packs for a six month renewal and then went into the subscribe and save settings and set it to skip the next 6 month shipment.  That way I would get a new years supply ordered next year.  I am very happy with this unit!</li>
            <li> This product works great. I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday and his face is always smooth. He used to break out with his old razor and doesn&#x27;t anymore. Beauty Encounter send the product on time (early) and over both of us are pleased. The cleaning is not loud and doesn&#x27;t take an hour. I think people were just naggin in other reviews. I give it 2 thumbs out and it looks awesome! It&#x27;s a great update for the guy who has everything :)</li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic based on the good reviews. However, it takes me 8 to 10 minutes to get a reasonable shave versus 4 to 5 minutes with my old Braun( Model Pulsonic 9595)    The Panasonic appears to cut only in one direction - with the direction of hair growth, which is odd because cutting against the direction of hair growth is what gives a close shave.    The only pros versus the Braun are cheaper cleaning cartridges and faster cleaning/charging time.    I&#x27;ve gone back to my Braun</li>
            <li> I had previously owned a Braun foil shaver with the self cleaning base.  It did do a good job, but not as good as a razor.  But the Panasonic is another story.  Firstly, after two and half months, it still shaves closer than I am able to with a razor.  No electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used has done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feature I find most useful is the ability to use it wet or dry.  It shaves closest when used with shaving cream (or soap or gel or what-have-you), but it does shave very close and comfortably dry as well.  I like the cleaning system better than the braun, which uses an alcohol based solvent for cleaning.  The Braun did clean well, but the solution would evaporate quickly in warm weather, and did make the bathroom smell a bit.  The panasonic cleaning system uses a little detergent cake and water.  So far, it has performed flawlessly.  The self cleaning cycle is also many times quieter than the braun&#x27;s system.  The shaver does switch on and off, but it&#x27;s volume is more than tolerable (sounds a bit like a mobile phone ringing while set on &#x27;vibrate&#x27;).  In comparison, the Braun sounded like a small power tool going on and off for 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that you can just rinse the \\&quot;blades\\&quot; under the faucet to clean the razor.  Some have complained about water damage, but I don&#x27;t believe the unit is meant to be used in the shower or to be completely rinsed.  That said, it&#x27;s just not difficult to rinse off just the blades and foil, and not soak the rest of the unit.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to thoroughly clean it while on vacation when one doesn&#x27;t have the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, on a couple of short vacations, the charge has been more than adequate for wet shaving and rinsing the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be a bit pricey but, overall, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the overall performance of this shaver! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a foil type shaver.    It&#x27;s easy to hold and easy to manipulate around my face. Ergonomically it&#x27;s spot on. The HydraClean system works well and keeps the shaver looking brand new. The battery life is also a plus, I can use it for close to two weeks between charges. WOW, my old Remington needed a charge every three days.</li>
            <li> I tend to shy away from 5 star reviews due to principle but I have to say that this purchase has exceeded every expectation I may have had.  I used to use electric razors when I first started shaving but they were either hand me downs or cheap models.  I switched to blades to get a closer shave and was pretty satisfied with the results and figured the smoother face was worth the extra hassle.    For a number of reasons including cuts and ingrown hairs, I started investigating electric shavers.  I was a little put off by the cost but I started calculating the cost for shaving cream and replacement razors (I had been using disposables) and figured that I could buy a $100+ shaver and, over time, see a relative wash in terms of cost.      After perusing several sites dedicated to electric razor reviews (and I do mean several), I came up with the conclusion that I might indeed be able to get a close shave with the convenience of an electric. I had always used rotary shavers, but my research suggested that foil shavers were best for people that shave everyday and don&#x27;t let their beard get especially thick.  This knowledge helped narrow my focus. I recognized that the Panasonic ES8249S was consistently rated highly by just about every reviewer.   As I tend to do with Amazon, I lurked around until the price went down to something I was comfortable with and I pulled the trigger.    They say it takes about 30 days for your face to get used to a new style of shave, which is unfortunate because the return policy only lasts 30 days.  Fortunately for me, I was enjoying a fantastic shave within 2 weeks.  I decided to use a little shaving cream for a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shave to help break my face in.  The first week there was some minor irritation and a little bit of a learning period as I figured out how best to maximize the efficiency of the razor.    A month later and I am getting as close a shave as I experienced with blades and I have the luxury of a quick afternoon/evening shave should Idecide I want to look my best for an evening out.  The added cleaning feature is nice to have though I&#x27;m not sure it is a necessity for everyone.  There is a model that is less expensive without it, and my understanding is that it is the same razor.    I definitely recommend this product and am glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> Bought this in June 2010 and it still works perfectly. No issues. I don&#x27;t even use the washing stand anymore and just opt to wash it under the sink. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over four years and it still works great. The charging/washing unit thing doesn&#x27;t wash it right anymore, but it still charges and dries it well. I probably messed it up somehow and it&#x27;s not the fault of the product. I&#x27;ve save a ton of money using this and haven&#x27;t had to change the shaver head yet. Nice shave. No razor bumps. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> IT WAS  A CHRISTMAS REQUEST AND HE SEEMS HAPPY WITH IT.  I RECEIVED IT IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR THAT.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.  Blades still do a better job around the neck, but this Panasonic does a very good job.  You do have to make several passes to get a close shave, but owing to the wet/dry feature my skin is smoother and un-irritated as it would be with a blade or dry only electric.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying this is my first electric razor.  Being in the military, I typically shave 5x a week.  I have a skinny face and protruding adams apple, which made it hard for me to shave around my jawline/neck without nicking myself with a traditional razor.  I have fairly light growth, but what I do have is very wiry.    Pros:    - I have what some would call a babyface and I experienced little to no irritation after first use.  A little moisturizer afterwards and my face was smoother than I can remember in a long time.    - Incredibly close shave, much better than I expected from an electric razor.  In my opinion, the only way to get closer with a razor is to shave against the grain which we all know is a bad idea.    - No more razor nicks around jawline/adams apple.    - Wet/Dry.  Shaving cream + this &#x3D; win.    - Reduced frequency of ingrown hairs.    - Self Cleaning.  Completely unecessary to be quite honest, but nice for the lazy folks.  It may help extend the lifespan of the foil/blades, but I am not sure.    Cons:    - Pop up trimmer not so great.  I still have to line my sideburns up with a razor.    - Cleaning/drying cycle on base station is a bit loud.  It isn&#x27;t terribly loud, but you definitely notice it&#x27;s on.  If it was in a master bath connected to the master bed your significant other would notice if the door is open.  Probably not if door is closed.    - Cleaning solution needs to be changed every 1-2 months depending on frequency of use.  Not a dealbreaker since the shaver can always be cleaned by hand.  3 packs run about $10 on amazon just fyi.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would be an electric razor man, but I was sick of buying $30 cartridges every two weeks - I was determined to find one that was CLOSE to the quality of a new razor shave.  I am officially blown away by this product, as the shave is as good/better and is much more gentle on my face.    I could never shave two consecutive days with a razor and was always left with a raw face and neck - NO MORE!!!!  At first this missed an ingrown hair or two, but after a week or two of using it, I always walk away with a clean shave.      Love being able to shave in the shower with shave cream too.  Easy to clean and not necessary to buy a ton of the cleaning cartridges - I get far more cleans out of them than they say one should.    Before finding this, I tried the best of Braun and Phillips Norelco - both three-headed monsters and the same style as this one.  After trying five different electric shavers and returning them all I was nearly defeated in my search.  This was the last one I would try and I was and still am blown away nearly six months later.    BRAVO Panasonic - PLEASE keep making this and I will buy one every few years for the rest of my life as it pays for itself in less than one year.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 2 months now!  I have no complaints!  It works well after my face adjusted to the razor and it works even better in the shower!</li>
            <li> I like to keep my head shaved, but razor &amp; cream every day is a pain in the rear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to use primarily on my head and it&#x27;s done a fantastic job!  It&#x27;s not quite a smooth as a razor blade, but I&#x27;ve never cut myself with the ES8249S and it get&#x27;s me about 99% as smooth.  It&#x27;s plenty good enough for my daily needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually didn&#x27;t think I would use this on my face - my primary purpose was my dome - but after seeing what a great job it did there I&#x27;ve started using it on my face too.  It&#x27;s actually better at shaving a head than a face, but I have a very tricky patch on my neck that always seems to need a blade to get completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also able to do my head a lot faster with the Panasonic shaver than my Mach 3.  It would take me about 7 or 8 minutes to do a full head shave with a blade (taking care not to cut myself).  I can do a good job in about 3.5 minutes with the Panasonic and a great job in about 5 minutes (that built-in timer is pretty handy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system works well I guess.  It cleans out all of the little hairs in the razor and leaves it smelling... clean.  The scent is a bit chemically for my taste.  I typically rinse the head in the sink and then run it through a full cleaning cycle once a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The speed of the razor is amazing.  Much, much, much faster than my old Norelco foil shaver I got when I turned 16.  You can really hear all of the little hairs being cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this razor.  If you&#x27;re looking for something to keep your head shaved - look no further.  It&#x27;s not as good as a blade, but almost so and it&#x27;s a good bit faster!</li>
            <li> After using Norelco triple header shavers for years, I decided to try a foil shaver.  The Braun units were expensive, and had the cleaning solution based on rubbing alcohol, which evaporated and caused other concerns.  Then I discovered the Panasonic series, and found this model at a good price point, and it included a cleaning base.    All in all it works slightly better than my Norelco 8240XL (which is now my travel shaver), and the cleaning system is decent.  It takes about 1-1.5 hr to clean dry and charge the shaver.  No significant cons, except the head foils will detach when the plastic cover is removed sometimes.  I would recommend this shaver, it is a good unit for the money.</li>
            <li> Hello All,    This is the first time I am using any electric Shaver and I bought this one. I usually user Mac 3. Read reviews and most people advised that it takes some time for your skin to adjust to new shaving mechanism and you need to use this shaver for 2-3 weeks before you can really feel it.    However I just had my first shave with this one and trust me guys its amazing. I have never written a review but when a product where you put so much bucks...gives you such a good result..you also want to do something in return...:)    I would recommend this shaver though I have only used it once but this is the closest shave I have ever got almost feels like I am in my back in my 16-17 when you used to have less or even no beard at all... Damn clean shave.....      Tooo good!! hope it gets better after each shave.    Love this Shaver.    All the best!!    Cheers!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my husband. He loves it more than his Braun electric. He gets a closer shave and likes the sanitation option.</li>
            <li> Summary of pros:  Shaves great on a greasy or sweaty face.  Cleans quick and effectively  Shaves quick and close    Summary of cons:  Pop-up razor is slightly flimsy    This razor works perfectly, and is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned so far. Before the Arc IV, I used an electric Braun shaver (don&#x27;t remember the model, I bought it from costco), which shaved alright under most conditions, but was absolutely useless when my face was greasy or sweaty, and ended up causing me more pain than I&#x27;d have liked. Since the Arc IV can be used with shaving gel or on a wet face, it solves the problem. Also, I legitimately think it shaves better when my face is greasy or wet, with or without gel, so I&#x27;m very pleased.    Another thing I hated about my Braun was its cleaning stations: it was expensive ($5 a month) and absolutely necessary. If I skipped a cleaning and just dusted the hairs out, the grease on the shaver would make the next shave infuriating and painful. The Arc IV is wonderful to clean; because it&#x27;s waterproof, you just put a little ordinary liquid soap and water on the head, operate the turbo mode, then take it apart and rinse the pieces off under a faucet. The entire cleaning process takes a mere minute from start to finish, and leaves it perfectly clean for the next shave. By the way, it baffles me how waterproof this thing is; it has no problems charging even when there is water on the metal contacts used for charging! I&#x27;m very impressed.    The only problem (hardly a problem) with cleaning it this way is that you have to lay all of the parts out to dry for a couple of hours; even drying the pieces off with a towel, you cannot immediately recombine the parts because they won&#x27;t dry correctly. Doing so leaves a kind of rusty smell for the next shave, but the shave is still very good.     The last thing I hated about my Braun is the time it took to shave: 5-7 minutes for a good shave, 7-10 for a great shave. Shaving with the Arc IV is ridiculously quick; I can get a pretty good shave in 2.5 minutes (no joke), and a pretty great shave in about 5 minutes. The head of this razor is relatively huge with its 4 blades, which is why the shave is so quick.    Probably the only thing I don&#x27;t like about the Arc IV is its pop-up razor, as it feels a little flimsy and easily pops back down while I am using it. It&#x27;s not a big deal; I just generally have to be slow and careful when using it.    All in all, this is an excellent razor, and I&#x27;d easily suggest this to my friends. Stop reading the (enormously positive, and accurate) reviews and just buy it already! You&#x27;ll be glad you made the decision to switch.</li>
            <li> This razor is imho the best foil shaver you can get for around $100 and under. Depending on the price it becomes a very good buy or a not so good buy.  I bought this razor during Amazon&#x27;s Gold Box sale and it was priced at $89.99. Normally, I believe its priced $130 which I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy at that price.  The razor delivers a close smooth shave with its \\&quot;4 Blade Technology\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve had the lower model Panasonic 8109 and it only has three blades, so having an extra blade cuts it closer for me and in less passes. I have small asian hair and it works really well around the cheeks and mouth. However , it doesn&#x27;t work very well with my neck hair, being that they&#x27;re really thin.   Ergonomically, the razor looks like its lower model 8109 and works just as well. It also comes with a nicer travel bag than its lower model the 8109, but that to be expected given the higher price point. This model is pretty quiet, compared to the cheaper razors I&#x27;ve tried before.  The cleaning base is just a gimmick imo or marketing to pull you to buy something more expensive. It&#x27;s nice to have around, but you could live without it.  As long as you wash/dry the razor everytime you use it, it should be as nice as using the charging base.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like for this particular model is that the motor is a bit slow. Slow in the sense that the same 3 Blade Razor (8109) uses the same motor. Don&#x27;t get me wrong its fast enough for what I want it to do, I just think since you have another blade you should have a bit faster motor to move the other additional blade right?  In conclusion, buy it if it is cheap or on sale, don&#x27;t buy it if it&#x27;s over $100 because it&#x27;s just not worth it at that price.</li>
            <li> After 40 years of blade shaving, I decided blades weren&#x27;t cutting it any longer. I had tried electric razors previously but never found them effective and I always developed significant rashes and skin reactions to them. The reviews on the Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers were good, so I thought I would give this one a try. It was on a Gold Box special for $89 so I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paired it with Billy Jealousy Hydroplane shave cream hoping the combination would help me save face and avoid the skin reactions I had in the past. WOW! Best shave I&#x27;ve had in years, and the best shave ever from an electric razor! The BJ Hydroplane shave cream provides a remarkably smooth shave,and if it begins to dry out before finishing, I can just add more water and it is good to go again. And no razor burn or skin reactions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is very effective in providing a close shave, and it is easy to use and maintain with the included automatic cleaner. The razor also can be cleaned easily by taking off the foil and running water through it while on turbo mode (see instructions). I actually do both so that the cleaning solution in the unit will last longer before needing to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES8249S Arc IV Wet/Dry shaver is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT AFTER 16 MONTHS:&lt;br /&gt;I have continued to love my shaver until now. After 16 months, the cleaning/charging base has quit. The plugin cord still works on the shaver ~ it can be recharged by plugging it directly to the base of the shaver itself. So the cord is not the problem: it is the base. The base shows no indication it is receiving electrical current: the lights don&#x27;t come on, the shaver won&#x27;t recharge, and the cleaning system won&#x27;t clean. One consolation is that I the got shaver on a great sale! And it still works fine, but the charging/cleaning base (which I used daily) no longer works. As far as I know, the base alone is not available for purchase.</li>
            <li> Just got this shaver a week ago and it seems to work fine.  It is a bit louder than my old Panasonic shaver but works fine.  Like the idea of the cleaning station, will probably just clean it whenever the battery runs low and I recharge it so I don&#x27;t expect to have to pay a lot for cleaning solution.  One can also clean normally with just regular liquid soap.  Nice to have a battery charge indicator also.</li>
            <li> I have this for 1 month now - used it with no irritation and no issues since day 1. After a couple of days I started to use an electric shave lotion with it, so it&#x27;s an almost dry shave. The electric shave lotion improves shave accuracy and speeds up the process. I keep the shaver on the locked position - I tried the soft position but the locked one gives better results for me. Sometimes I alternate both.   I have a quite tough beard. For me it works perfectly, even better than a classic shaver. My beard orientation is going somehow from left to right especially on the neck. With a classic shaver I couldn&#x27;t shave the right part of my neck without irritating it.   Shaving results with the Panasonic are much better. Shaving time depends on the desired results as well if one shaves every day or every two days. I&#x27;m mostly in the latter case, so shaving time goes from 5 to 10 minutes if I want everything perfect. Before cleaning it in the support I brush away the cut hair from inside - I think this way I can renew the cleaning liquid more rarely.  Overall it&#x27;s a perfect shaver for me - I had an electric more than 10 years ago so I can&#x27;t compare it with any other recent one.</li>
            <li> My husband has had the opportunity to test the difference between the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic shaver and this Panasonic 8249. The Braun had trouble coping with the neck area whereas the Panasonic did a great job there. Where the Braun did a pretty good job, the Panasonic produced a fantastically smooth skin surface (I&#x27;m seconding his opinion!) That is why I&#x27;m writing this glowing review. I can truly appreciate the difference in the quality shave that this Panasonic gives. So if you are buying a shaver for your spouse, I recommend this one highly since you will definitely be enjoying the benefits of it. It gets five solid stars from me.</li>
            <li> This was on sale for $89 and decided it was a good deal, considering the reviews and the normal price in stores.  I always used conventional razors, albeit finally thought.. let&#x27;s try an electric one.. been awhile.. and it works great for a quick shave, when I don&#x27;t want to reshave for the night.. or go out for a few minutes.. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had long fantasized about owning a Panasonic but the price always seemed outrageous.  However, my Braun was on its last legs andl Amazon had this model on sale for under $100, so I bit.  After a month of use, I am very pleased with this shaver.  First, it shaves closer than my Braun.  The 5 o&#x27;clock shadow I had from the Braun doesn&#x27;t show up until the next morning with the Panasonic.  It isn&#x27;t unusual for me to go 30+ hours before I feel I need my next shave.   Second, I find the higher-pitched whine of the Panasonic is much easier on my ears than the lower buzz of the Braun  Third and unexpected: when I was using the Braun my beard stank.  Using the Panasonic my nasty beard smell is gone.  I suppose the Braun&#x27;s alcohol-based rinse cleaning system is much inferior to the foaming detergent system of the Panasonic and that accounts for the difference.</li>
            <li> After 6 years using the same machine , decided to buy anew one in stead of replacing some parts, since it doesn&#x27;t ads up, so pay for anew one when you can ,thanks to Amazon you will see huge discount every few month on this item , and by the way , the machine is 100% Japan.</li>
            <li> I did as much research as possible before I made the decision to purchase an electric shaver. I am 54 and never had used one but I have found that the shave is very close and the easy to use. I have only used the shaver for about a month but at this point in time I am very impressed with the shaver.</li>
            <li> i took a chance buying this for my husband for xmas because he is picky about electric razors. past experiences were not so good. we went to a friedns house and he also had this razotr, i ordered it the next day, gave it to my husband for xams and he uses it EVERY day, and he stated its the best electric shaver he has ever had.  kudos to me and the razor. thanks:)</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver in September 2010. Shaves ok and if I work at it can get a relatively close shave. Cleaning system is not satisfactory. When I can get it to work it leaves a lot of residue inside the shaver. It is ofter difficult to get the shaver into &#x27;clean&#x27; mode.  Called Panasonic customer service twice about this problem. The girl who supposedly represented their technical service did not have a clue about what the problem was. All she could offer was that the entire razor &amp; cleaning station should be returned for service.  A little empathy toward a customer would have been appreciated. As it is, I&#x27;m through with Panasonic. I&#x27;ll continue to use this shaver with manual cleaning til it gets tired, then replace it.</li>
            <li> Really nice little shaver esp. the trimmer for days when I don&#x27;t mind a little stubble.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic was purchased after reading reviews here &amp; elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;1 recurring \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; was \\&quot;it&#x27;s noisy when in clean mode...\\&quot; my comment is why are standing there listening.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not whisper quiet, but I sure don&#x27;t find it \\&quot;offensive\\&quot;.....IMHO&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with a shaver v/s blade was a bit of a transition, but after you&#x27;ve used it for a while dry shaving is \\&quot;OK\\&quot;, wet is awesome {use a very thin gel, water it down &amp; use a light coating).&lt;br /&gt;Also even with \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shave I found rinsing while shaving improved performance over dry.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it a 4.5 if I could, there&#x27;s never a \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; product, but this is close....</li>
            <li> I have previously had several brands of shavers including earlier versions of Panasonic. This is the first shaver I have owned that shaves all parts of my face and neck without having to use an accessory for the difficult places. This shaver worked well in the nose area and the edges of the mouth. It did not take a month for the shaver to become accustomed to my face. It did a nice smooth and complete job beginning with the first use. Having used a shaver for many years with fair results I was surprised at the quality of the work that this shaver accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints with the cleaning system which works as advertized. However, I don&#x27;t take it along on fairly short trips. Away from home I use the suggested method of soapy fluid and a simple rinse. The ability to charge the shaver with the cord connected directly to the shaver instead of the use of the cleaning system is a nice option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase and the shaver&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never shaved with an electric razor I liked until now. I&#x27;ve never been satisfied with the closeness of the shave. I switched to this razor from Gilette Fusion and the shave is comparable. I&#x27;ve been using the razor about a week. At $5 a blade, Fusion shaving was adding up. I saw this as an Amazon Deal of the Day for about $80 so I went for it. It&#x27;s a great shave. I have a heavy beard and it handles it well, without razor burn. We&#x27;ll see how long the foil, blades, and cleaning solution last, it may no be much of a savings. Others recommended Billy Jealousy Shave Gel[[ASIN:B000A5CPJ4 Billy Jealousy Hydroplane Shave Cream, 8-Ounce Bottle]], so I bought that too. It is definitely recommended to complement the razor. The quality of the shave with the shave gel versus shaving dry is much better. You only use a drop of the shave gel per shave so the cost is minimal. I usually rinse the razor after shaving and then run it through a cleaning cycle on the base. Pretty neat. The directions are a little confusing, but once you use the base, it&#x27;s really very simple. I&#x27;d recommend this shaver, especially since Amazon seems to put it on sale periodically.</li>
            <li> I have used a few electric shavers in the past and this is my favorite so far.  I have used it for almost 2 years now and feel that I have a pretty good handle on what I like and don&#x27;t like.  So here it goes:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- This shaver cuts closer than any other electric I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m in the military and have to be clean shaven all the time.  On those rare occasions that I am on leave and allow my facial hair to grow a little this shaver is still able to cut smoothly.  It has no problem handling a day or two of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver head glides smoothly over the contours of my neck and jaw.  I have had trouble with other shavers cutting my skin around my throat.  I have not had that issue with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;- Replacement blades are comparable in price to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning system is LOUD!  It cleans the shaver very well, but I usually only do it on the weekend so it doesn&#x27;t wake my wife up at 6 in the morning during the week.  I just rinse mine after I use it and set the cleaning system \\&quot;Dry\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;Clean\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;- This shaver does not feature a travel lock.  I have never had an issue with the shaver turning on in my bag, but I&#x27;m convinced that it will happen eventually.&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning system cartridges are pretty expensive.  I replace mine about 4 times a year so I guess it isn&#x27;t a big deal to me, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not cleaning the way it is supposed to at such a long replacement cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly recommend this shaver whole-heartedly.  The construction seems sturdy and I expect that the shaver will outlast all my previous shavers.  Check this one out if you&#x27;re in the market for a shaver.  I think you&#x27;ll be extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Gold Deal and found that it is a good razor for my replacement of another older Panasonic.  The only problem I have it that my neck burns after I shave.  Otherwise, I would recommend it!  It has good shave time and easy to read screen and one charge lasts at least for 14-18 shaves.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with how close the shave is.&lt;br /&gt;Good charge life and easy to clean even with out the station.</li>
            <li> I have used several different electric razors over the years.  I am in the unfortunate position of having to shave every day, with a beard that is tough and skin that is sensitive.  The only time I was able to get a truly good shave was the one time each week that I used a regular razor (more than once a week was too hard on my skin).  My razor of choice was a Gillette Fusion ProGlide.  My previous electric razor was a Braun 7526, which I was happier with compared to previous Norelco and Braun electric razors that I have owned over the years.  This Panasonic is off the charts for me.  I purchased the Billy Jealousy Hydroplane shave cream to use with it, and I always shave in the shower.  After one week, I was so happy with my Panasonic that I threw away the Gillette!  The shave that I get is equal to a regular razor.  I had to give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The perfect shaver for my daughter. She loves the way it feels in her hand. She says it is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Rarely am I disapointed with a highly customer rated amazon product, but this one fell short for me.  It is excellent all around, BUT the actual shave.  I find it to be not nearly as good as the Norleco type electric shavers I have used for the past 20 years.  Didnt bother me too much until I went back and realized what I paid for this with its fancy cleaning system, yikes, not worth it, dont know what i was thinking.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement shaver for my older Panasonic one which I purchased in 2007, but developed a short in the cleaning cradle after 5 years.  The old one was outstanding.  This one was a very suitable replacement in all regards.  Basically the same design, but with a different model number.  Clean shaves, worked very well.  I used it for a week without incident.  At the end of the first week, I installed the cleaning cartridge and filled the cleaning reservoir with tap water.  The cleaner started to allow water from the reservoir to enter the cleaning cartridge.  However, the flow never stopped.  Water began to overflow the cartridge and flowed onto the counter.  I pulled the plug, dried the counter and shaver parts.  After a several hour wait, I repeated the same process with the same results, water flooding the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completed the required paperwork and sent the unit to Panasonic in Texas for repairs / replacement.  This model,  ES8249S, was purchased from Amazon.  However, I am guessing it was not a current model with Panasonic because the replacement I received from the Panasonic was model [[ASIN:B002N5MHLK Panasonic ES-LA93-K Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Black]], the new Wet/Dry Shaver with Ultra-thin Vibrating Outer Foil and Nanotech(tm) Blades.  This shaver is outstanding, quiet, non-pulling, thorough and pricier than the one I returned for repair.  Thank you, thank you, thank you Panasonic for your great repair / exchange policy.  I am delighted with the ES-LA93 model.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this razor for about three weeks now. He loves it! He says his skin isn&#x27;t as irritated as it used to be with blade razors. Also, he is very pleased with how close of a shave he gets from this razor.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, this is a great razor.  I used to be in the military and I would chop my face up with whatever new 3,4, or 5 blade metal razor was out at the time.  Afterwards, my shaving habits were less strenuous and I was able to put up with the neck and face irritation I got by reducing shaving or growing a beard for months on end.  Eventually, my girlfriend told me that I looked like a hobo and couldn&#x27;t grow a beard for a while so I switched to a Braun Series 3.  That was OK...I would give it 3 stars.  However, I would literally rub and rub and rub the head of that shaver into my skin to get a semi-close shave and there would still be neck, chin, and random spots of face hair still left.  I did this dance for about 6 months (with razor shaving mixed in to clean up as necessary) and after so much rashing and sensitive shaving (that hurt!) I saw this as a Deal of the Day and clicked without thinking twice!  Best...idea...ever!  2 months in, and it&#x27;s like a whole new world!  I actually don&#x27;t dread shaving (although I do skip the weekends usually, but this baby picks right up on Sunday when I attack my muzzle...just use the attached trimmer to shave the little beard down a bit and you are good to go).  I keep the unit out of the base until it is ready for a recharge and then do a full clean cycle when that happens (usually lasts for about 2 weeks of charge with 5 minutes shaving 5-6 days a week).  I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Thank you for contacting Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is normal for hair trimming to fall on your clothes / body if you are shaving. The shaver head or the unit itself is not meant to collect or catch beard trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope this information is helpful to you.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From: prodpersonalhealth@callcenter.us.panasonic.com</li>
            <li> The HydraClean feature fails at every aspect I can think of:  1. It takes a very long time to process.  2. It is very loud during the process.  3. After the process, the shaver stinks with a foul odor.  4. The charge basin clogs up very easily and can result in a dirty mess (hair+detergent+dirty water goo).   5. The cartriges are expensive.  6. The cartridges have to be exchanged frequently, and it&#x27;s not only the money aspect, it&#x27;s the effort/maintenance that&#x27;s required.  7. The whole HydraClean system has this cheap, gimmicky feel to it - a total contrast to the actual device, which looks very high class/premium.    I think, given hindsight, I would pay extra to not have HydraClean (seriously!). What&#x27;s the big deal about cleaning it yourself, anyway?     Shaving the sideburns and the jawline is a pleasant experience. However, when shaving chin &amp; goatee hair that&#x27;s longer than about 1 mm, you frequently feel the pain of hair being ripped off. Also, I noticed some inefficiency with this device (it can take you &gt;5min to get a proper shave if you don&#x27;t just have a stubble), but nowhere is the inefficiency as bad as on the facial hair below the chin (on the frontal throat). Sometimes there are about 3-6 obstinate hairs unimpacted. You could seriously shave over 10min and they would still survive (abraised/grinded skin included) . In those cases I still have to use a manual razor b/c this foil shaver wont get them. If you only shave short stubbles then you will have a pleasant experience. I think the more potent motor from the higher end model should be adopted by all Panasonic foil shavers.    On the plus side this shaver is very safe.    The packaging is a little short of mediocre. There is too much documentation. One manual suffices.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical when it comes to electric shavers.  Most electric shavers just shorten the stuble, but this one actually shaves it off leaving your face smooth.  For years I&#x27;ve had to use the gillette four blade razors because it was the only thing that would get the job done.  Gillette rapes you every time you buy replacement razors.  I get pissed off everytime I had to drop a $20 bill to buy the replacement razors!  But not anymore.  Panasonic delivers what it promises.  You need this razor!</li>
            <li> Just for context, I am a picky shaver (one who shaves) with sensitive skin and a round, slightly chubby face. I also shave against the grain for a very close shave. I used to shave with a razor, but got tired of cutting myself. :-)  I first got a Panasonic ES8077S. It worked well, but pinched me too much and gave me cuts (I now know this was because I was using it wet). Shave was about 90% as close as using a razor in the shower.  I switched to a Remington MS680CS for the past year and it was fine. Noisy, but OK. Cheaper than the others. Shave (dry) was about 70% as close as using a razor.  Then I got tired of the level of stubble I had at night and decided to try something new. So I got a Norelco Speed 8240. It was VERY quiet, but the shave was worse. Shave (dry) was about 55% as close as using a razor.  So, I finally have gone back to Panasonic. Noise is in between the other two. Shaving dry is about 85% as close as using a razor and no cuts, and wet is about 92% as close as using a razor with some occasional cuts.  I&#x27;m staying with Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, have been using it daily for last four or five years. No problems, just changing the blades once a year. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this deal @ Amazon.com on 9/19/2011. The charger cleaner was dead in the water right out of the Box. Called support&lt;br /&gt;got to hear what the other compliants had said. That you have to send the shaver &amp; the cleaner/charger back to have it serviced. I don&#x27;t think think so. The shaver works pretty nice. But I think that Amazon should step up to window on this one&lt;br /&gt;&amp; quit selling JUNK.&lt;br /&gt;I have to add to this review . The washer does Work. You have to fill the water well above the line. So I have to give this a 4 star&lt;br /&gt;Rating. Luvred</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver and I love it! I never thought I&#x27;d buy one, but finally did when razor blades became SO EXPENSIVE. Provides comfortable and close shave. One feature I like is the WET/DRY capability. I do not use it in the shower, but the WET/DRY capability makes clean up so easy - just remove the top and put both the top and the head of the razor under running water. Shake off and let dry. I do occasionally use a razor blade to remove a few whiskers under my chin. It provides MANY shaves from a single charge.I never have used the cleaning device it came with. Never felt the need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (February 26, 2013):  Still the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve had. As mentioned above, the clean-up is so simple and effective. One note, manufacturer mentions \\&quot;breaking in your whiskers to the shaver\\&quot;.  This is true. Don&#x27;t try to get the absolute closest shave the first week you own it.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this everyday and really loves it. It has a great self cleaning module and easily travels. It comes with a travel case.</li>
            <li> Works very well when new. After using this shaver for 2 years i have found out it performs well when fully charged. Must change foil and blades yearly to have it shave well for you which can get expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be redundant and go on about how great a shaver this product is, but I would like to stress that the cleaning cartridge while not necessary to cleaning the shaver does an excellent job at cleaning and maintaining the blades. I&#x27;ve had mine for a year and a half now and I haven&#x27;t had to change the blades or foil; the shave quality is the same as the day as I got it. I would like to attribute this to my consistent cleaning with the base and replacing the cartridge every 3 months (you can use them for longer than then recommended 30-45 days).</li>
            <li> Ive always wanted the category to perform better and it appears that someone has finally made a decent one. I&#x27;m about a year into mine. Shave not as close as traditional razor, but not too far off. Makes life easier.</li>
            <li> This is a great product however when cutting neck hair it doesn&#x27;t seem to get close enough to hit everything. It Also struggles when my hair grows for a day or 2 because it cant handle the longer hair.</li>
            <li> I chose this item because I wanted to try a different manufacturer since I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco for about 4 years. Initially it worked very well but it wasn&#x27;t logo before the blades seem to get dull and it took much longer to shave. Had to go over the same areas many times before it felt like I was fully shaved.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor 2 years ago and still using it.  It&#x27;s a great value when you think of how much money you save and give a great shave without any cutting or niks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for two years now, and it has been reliable and works well.  It is better than almost all other shavers I have previously owned.  The cleaner, on the other hand, stinks.  It smelled bad, never really cleaned the shaver thoroughly (left behind clipped hair residue) and promptly died as soon as the warranty ended and started leaking (very expensive) cleaner all over the place.  I returned it for repair and they required me to ship the whole package back and charged a $46 fee.  I sent it in and they promised a return within 7-10 business days.  Here I am 12+ days out and they are now telling me the unit cannot be replaced, the equivalent refurbished replacement unit is backordered and it will be another week.  Their story keeps changing every time I contact them, so who knows what they will say tomorrow.  Maybe this review will get their attention.  I am fed up with Panasonic repair in McAllen, TX at this point.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for few years. Vortex keeps the blades clean and less smell. The battery lasted fine, but after two years, I think the battery lasts less time. (I drain the battery before recharge.)</li>
            <li> This electric shaver performs very well, so I&#x27;ve been told.  It was purchased as a gift for my son and he is well-pleased with the product&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my fiance for Christmas and he says it&#x27;s the best elecric shaver he&#x27;s had.  The only con is the \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; is a little on the loud side.</li>
            <li> This is Ultimately the best shaver on the market..&lt;br /&gt;I have Zero complaints..for a wet/dry this has to be the best bang for the buck out there..enuf said</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for a few months now and I really like it.  I use it as a wet razor in the shower.  It is easy to hold on to, even when it is wet.  I use a shave cream with it to make the razor glide over my face.  This is the first electric shaver I have owned with a battery meter, it is very nice and a must have in the future for me. I have not used the cleaning system, I just rinse the unit after each use.  My two complaints about this unit are battery life and the noise.  The past few electric razors I have owned lasted two weeks or more on a single charge.  This shaver lasts about a week.  I guess they expect you to use the cleaning system to keep it charged.  This razor is loud.  My wife woke up the first morning I used it becuase of the noise, and sound does not travel well in my house.  Now that everyone is use to it, it is not a big deal. Overall, I would recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I primarily purchased this to replace a 2 Blade Braun shaver that was close to 10 years old.  I like the fact that it is WET and DRY however that doesn&#x27;t really matter much to me.  I am after the dry shave.  In this facet the Panasonic barely outperforms the Braun.  By all the reviews I figured this would work well but for me it does not.  It still doesn&#x27;t give a very good neck shave and the size of the head makes it difficult to navigate into nooks and crannies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could care less about the cleaning system if I can just use soap and water so I&#x27;ve never used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the WET shave once with this razor and it was really good almost as good as a real razor.  However what&#x27;s the point?  If I am going through all the trouble of lathering up I would rather use a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately this was a gold box deal and its good enough to keep without returning. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone looking for a decent neck shave though.  $80 sure.....$180 no way.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my braun,&lt;br /&gt;Wow!&lt;br /&gt;So much better.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like more rpms and cuts better, no stubble.&lt;br /&gt;I will give away my braun with the new foil!!&lt;br /&gt;A++++ seller&lt;br /&gt;-scott w las vegas</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I have used Gillette Mach/Fusion so far. I used to shave every other day while using a razor, but used to get cuts every now and then. So decided to try an electric shaver. I got this for less than ninety bucks, so probably was a good deal. The cleaning system is useless, but I use it as a charger. At the time I bought this I researched Braun, Norelco and Panasonic. This was the only electric shaver which came with all these three - a cleaner/charger station, could do dry/wet shave and had a travel (240v) charger adaptor separately etc. There is a pouch also which makes it easy to carry while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the shaving part. I&#x27;ve had it for almost 5 months now and use it every weekday. It takes anywhere between 5-7 minutes for a \\&quot;close\\&quot; shave. The skin feels smooth and the finish is good. However, it doesn&#x27;t shave the neck area properly. So I still keep a razor handy and run it through those areas where there is still left over hair. The dry shave doesn&#x27;t really work for me, so I lather it up using foam or even just plain water is okay. You have to clean it after every 2-3 strokes to work properly. I am not a 100% satisfied with the finish and the time it takes, but there are no cuts, bruises etc. which is  primarily why I got this shaver. Overall, a very good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Jun/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for a year and replaced the inner blades ($19), foil ($32) and cleaning solution cartridges ($9). Shaver is like new now, but still won&#x27;t shave the neck areas properly and takes pretty much the same time (around 6-7 minutes for a close shave daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update April/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaver was working fine, but then it stopped charging randomly. When I pick it up from the cleaning system for shaving in the morning it will show 0% charge and won&#x27;t work. This was an intermittent problem though, but still very annoying. Seemed like a problem with the cleaner/charger. I am so used to shaving with the electric shaver and couldn&#x27;t use manual razor blades because they cause me cut, burns and bumps. I also didn&#x27;t have another backup electric shaver. I called up Panasonic and since I had 2 months left on the two year warranty they asked me to ship the entire unit with accessories to their Texas service center. I had all the boxes, accessories and receipt so I sent it for replacement (cost me about $15 bucks to ship via USPS w/ tracking). I&#x27;m waiting for the new unit now (Panasonic won&#x27;t repair personal products, only replacement if under warranty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile I just couldn&#x27;t shave with manual razors anymore and I ordered a cheap electric shaver, [[ASIN:B004UQ6Q62 Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]] which has been phenomenal. Read my review on that shaver on the product link.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Panasonic for standing firm on their 2 year warranty policy. It took less than 3 weeks for the whole return process, I sent the old one on Apr 18th and I received a replacement on May 6th. They sent me the latest [[ASIN:B005DKKBP6 Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc5 Men?s Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Multi-Flex Pivoting Head and Automatic Cleaning System]] probably because the old one was out of production now. Now that is customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for this!</li>
            <li> Have trouble with unit in the charger in &amp;#34;Wash&amp;#34; cycle. would have had to send whole unit back for warranty.  My question is &amp;#34;What do I do for shaving while it is gone&amp;#34;. Not eh end of the world so I don&#x27;t use that part.  Wash by hand.  What not recommend it because of having to send whole unit back.</li>
            <li> My husband would never shave before because he has very thick hair on his face. (very coarse hair too) NO other electric shaver did the job. We always ended up throwing them out. This one was very highly rated on consumer reports and it works well with a few passes and a little trimming up with a regular razor. He now heads to work looking handsome and well-groomed. I am grateful of this little thing.</li>
            <li> My once every five years electric shaver replacement</li>
            <li> The coolest shaver you will ever see. Cuts as close as a tradional razor.</li>
            <li> So, before ordering this, I had been without an electric razor for probably over two years, and the last electric shaver I had was a cheap-o one that my parents had bought me for christmas as a teenager. I had been using varyingly fusion and quattro disposable razors, but the obscene profit margin on replacement cartridges appalled me. Thus, I started using the cheaper brands of plastic disposables. What I ended up with were piles of plastic junk in my shower, because the razors don&#x27;t give a good quality shave after only a few uses; plus, I have a really sensitive face and no matter how slowly or carefully I shaved, I would ALWAYS cut or nick my face, then later would have ingrown hairs or something. It was infuriating and led me to simply trim my face with hair clippers... not the cleanest look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had a similar panasonic razor in my shopping cart for a while, one without the cleaning doodad. But one day there was a daily deal on this razor-- it was SUCH a good deal, so I just had to buy this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for the first time, I was simply AMAZED. I went straight away to using it in the shower, since I&#x27;ve never had an electric razor with this capability. I cannot stress enough how sensitive my face is... But this thing didn&#x27;t give me ANY problems! Shaving with this razor and Aveeno therapeutic shave gel in the shower was AWESOME. Literally, I had never had as good or as close of a shave, even with a razor! That blew my mind. I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s possible but it is. After my first shave, my face was so smooth and clean... no breakouts after. My second use gave me a tiny amount of razor rash, but that&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t use it properly. The manual also states that it may take a bit of time for your face to get used to the razor. This is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviewer said that the cleaning station is not worth it. I dunno about that. It&#x27;s REALLY nice to not even have to clean your shaver yourself. Just drop it in the dock, hit the button, and it cleans, dries, and charges your razor for you. The shaver also has an ultrasonic cleaning mode for those who want to do it themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO satisfied with this razor. It is my shaving salvation. This thing is on a whole &#x27;nother level.hit the button, and it cleans, dries, and charges your razor for you. The shaver also has an ultrasonic cleaning mode for those who want to do it themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO satisfied with this razor. It is my shaving salvation. This thing is on a whole &#x27;nother level.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic I have owned. the first was a three blade model which I used for about a year before getting this one on Hot Deals. It is not better....&lt;br /&gt;The biggest complaint I have is the charging stand/cleaner. The fans get noisy and if the razor is accidentally bumped after placed in charger not only does it fail to charge, it actually discharges the razor to 0  and you have nothing to shave with the next time. This has happened to me too many times and has finally driven me back to Norelco which I used for years before the two Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This is the third Panasonic razor I have owned.  I purchased this based on the quality and performance of the first two and on Amazon&#x27;s rating.  This has worked well for the first year, but now \\&quot;loses its mind\\&quot; occasionally to the point where the display produces gibberish.  About 25% of the time it will charge fully, but typically only charges enough for two days (about 8.5 minutes) of shaving - leaving me frustrated and with stubble on day three.  The cleaning base only works well about 30% of the time.  The base will always charge but typically will not cycle at all or bails out part way through leaving the razor head filled with soapy water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m willing to give Panasonic another try, but am hoping to find something a little less high-tech and hopefully more reliable.</li>
            <li> This shaver saves time for me in the morning because I can shave in the shower. Very easy to clean in the shower, I did put the cleaner in the base but have yet to use it. Shaver cuts very close without irritation, could be because its in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 45 days, my beard grows back much quicker mid-day that if I used a razor. It does not get under my nose no matter how hard I try. It doesn&#x27;t get my neck anywhere as close as a razor. It&#x27;s convenient for a quick shave, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I like the way this razor shaves me. It&#x27;s as good or better than any electric I&#x27;ve ever used, especially with a little soap or cream to lubricate the skin. I agree with the other reviewers, however, that the cleaning system included with this version of the razor isn&#x27;t worth the money. I bought it on sale so there was no upcharge for the cleaning system, which keeps me from feeling ripped off. The system isn&#x27;t worth much, though. The clean cycle is not that clean, and it&#x27;s designed to re-use water a few times before changing it. Yuck. The cleaning refills are also pretty expensive, and there is no substitute available. The owners manual describes cleaning the razor with a little dish soap applied to the blades, then turning it on and letting the soap permeate the head. That method is much simpler and cheaper than the fancy system. Look for other versions of the same razor which don&#x27;t include the system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for quite a number of years, but have been disappointed at their quality in the last two models I bought.  This shaver is absolutely awesome.  Using it in the shower is like shaving without a blade: very smooth and close.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I feel like my Norelco from 2005 does a better job still at shaving.  I say these are overrated.</li>
            <li> I am sad to report that my husband&#x27;s cleaning base has ceased working 15 months after purchase and right after I bought another 6 months supply of cleaning cartridges.  As others wrote, I thought that paying the higher price for this shaver would bring me quality that would last at least 3 years. Hm, going back to the Braun -- goodbye Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how good the shave, no one wants to replace such an expensive item after only 15 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad for father&#x27;s day. He is in love with this shaver. He especially likes the close shave without the irritation and shaving bumps.</li>
            <li> When I returned from the hospital, I was put on a blood thinner for 60 days.  (All is well now, thanks.)  The doctor recommended that I avoid shaving with a sharp blade -- at least for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Since I did not want to grow a beard, I looked for an electric that could be easily cleaned.  The reviews brought me to this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an excellent shaver.  Gave me a real close shave.  Easy to hold and to work.  Cleaned very well with the cleaning well.  I still prefer a blade -- but this is a very close second.</li>
            <li> More than once this thing has run out of batteries on me mid-shave. It will last a few shaves, but will not work while plugged into the wall. Also the battery does not keep its charge very long when not in use.</li>
            <li> Ok, if you can shave dry with a month old rusty Bic disposable razor, this shaver is still probably for you, but don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF, however, you&#x27;re like me and have extremely sensitive skin, this shaver has been a blessing. And by extremely sensitive, I mean I get razor burn 2-3 times per week only because I was down to shaving every other day to try to keep my skin under control. I used a sensitive skin preshave, a sensitive skin shave gel, a sensitive skin after shave and face emollients along with the popular five blade sensitive skin shaver. I couldn&#x27;t use a brand new one because it would still wear into my skin. If it was too old it would do the same thing. So finding the sweet spot on the shaver alone was rough. I&#x27;d get maybe 4-5 shaves out of a shaver after it was broken in before I&#x27;d have to toss it and start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave electrics flat don&#x27;t work for me and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. Every wet shave electric I tried started out bad, improved a little and then after a month wasn&#x27;t cutting hair efficiently, requiring more passes over my beard and resulting in razor burn....yes, from an electric. That&#x27;s how sensitive my skin is. Even the vaunted Braun 7 series resulted in bad experience after bad experience so that after 3 weeks I took one back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try this one, mainly because it was an amazon daily deal for $88 (can&#x27;t beat that) and after reading reviews that looked like there were at least a few people in the same boat as I am (of course all the other high end shavers have similar reviews, but the price here was tough to walk away from).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was well packaged, easy to set up and charge (I love that it can be charged in the base or just with the cable), and I was ready to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I shaved with it I decided to go on a Friday night to give my face the weekend to recover. Completely unnecessary as this Shaver pulled it off. A perfectly smooth face, and my neck didn&#x27;t feel like hamburger. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaved again the next day and still perfect. That Sunday I got aggressive and shaved early in the morning and then again that evening after working out. I haven&#x27;t shaved twice in a day since high school. Not even so much as any redness or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month later and I&#x27;m still using this daily. People at work noticed the difference because I&#x27;d be smooth and red one day, then fuzzy and red the next with my old bladed shaver. With this Panasonic, smooth and healthy looking every day. I&#x27;m sold on this shaver 100% and plan on keeping it for as long as it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is ever perfect, and I do have a few quibbles. The on button seems to me to be too big and the ergonomics put it right where I rest my thumb so I&#x27;ve turned it off accidentally while shaving numerous times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a four blade shaver, it has four independently floating shave screens that sit on top of two blades. Not a big deal, but since all four heads need to pass over the hair to get it, this shaver is terrible for trimming around sideburns or facial hair. The pop up trimmer seems pretty flimsy to me and doesn&#x27;t exactly glide well for straightening around moustaches or goatees, so i still have need of my bladed shaver for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning base is great, and since you can pick clean, charge, or dry, it&#x27;s nice to be able to clean it myself and then drop it in to dry properly, or just drop it in once a week for a full cleaning cycle. As other reviews have noted, the cleaning cycle is noisy and the shaver itself turns on and off numerous times during the cycle, so I tend to run it when I&#x27;m planning on leaving. The non-alcoholic cleaner is great (I was skeptical since just about every other brand uses alcohol for cleaning) and for my super sensitive skin  the shaver doesn&#x27;t need rinsed prior to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, for the ladies, I read a few reviews of women using this shaver for themselves so encouraged my wife to try it since I&#x27;ve been so pleased with my results so far. I now have to make sure I get it out of the shower and cleaned before I use it because it has replaced her Venus bladed shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit;  five years later I decided to come back and update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still far and away the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  I was a bit surprised I&#x27;ve had this for five years but my purchase records show it.  I&#x27;ve replaced the foil and blades four times (I just replace both once a year, they&#x27;re on Amazon as kits so I just did both) and this has held up well.  The cleaning base finally died about a month ago, a year or so ago the lights stopped working but the unit itself would work.  It finally stopped draining and drying properly so I tossed it.  The shaver itself is having issues wher I have to charge it once a week (used to go quite a bit longer) but the battery is probably just wearing out.  The display is also wearing out, the center section isn&#x27;t readable at all so I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s low until it starts flashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still very happy with this and trying to decide if I want to get another one or get an upgrade.

            <li> rcvd this for fathers day. great gift. always have used blades... i was getting lazy about shaving daily. i have only used it a week and it works great. i have sensitive skin on my neck and it doesnt sem to irriatate it too much. i know it will only get better with time. BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> This electric razor gives a great close shave without irritation.  Holds charge very well, and doesn&#x27;t require any additional accessories.  You may want more cartridges down the line for cleaning, but all self cleaning razors are like that.  This is a very great price, better than many of the razors available at even higher prices.  Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This razor does not give a close shave at all and it not very good quality overall. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this product.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this Panasonic razor, he uses it to shave his head and beard.  Baby smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Diana</li>
            <li> I upgraded from the three blade shaver to this arc 4 shaver and it was a big improvement.  I wanted to find a shaver strong enough to shave my head as well as my face and this did a great job of doing so.  The battery life is good and I can shave my head and my face and still have juice left in the battery .  I find myself changing out the foil and blades out just under a year if not sooner but I do shave my head which I know makes the arc 4 put in work.  There are no bad things to really say about this shaver it shaves good and doesnt leave me with any irratation.  The cleaning base works good but I always was the arc 4 under water first before I put it in the cleaning base.  I would recommend this shaver if you are looking in buying a cheaper version because panasonic has come out with arc 5 shavers since then.  I cant speak for the arc 5 and Im sure it works awesome, but if you need a cheaper version this gets the job done.  I forgot to mention that I do have a thick beard and this shaver has no problem cutting my beard.  I will not be upgrading  to any other electric shaver I have since picked up straight blade shaving and I am beginning to like it more.</li>
            <li> While it was working it did a pretty good job although I have one of those kinds of beards that don&#x27;t do well with electric razors.  It always felt like it was burning my shin when I used it.  Eventually the automatic cleaning function stopped working but it was under warranty so I was able to send it back to Panasonic.  After about 3 months I received a brand new one of the current model.  I never even took it out of the box.  Electric razors just aren&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for about one year. While I have been pretty happy with results, I just have to add some thoughts.  I have had to change the foil and cutters twice, cause they were starting to bite my face and pulling instead of cutting. I only shave wet in the shower with nivea gel. Only get about (3 or 4) 6 minute shaves per charge.&lt;br /&gt;This cost @50.00 for replacement head started me to look around for something else. In comes the Braun 380s wet or dry shaver.  I have used it now for 4 days and still has a full charge. The shave I get with the Braun is a little better than the Panasonic (sorry).  Neck area and jaw line is smoother also.  This shaver only cost me 87.00 w/coupon.  So it was an easy buy.&lt;br /&gt; We will see how long the heads and cutters last. Already the battery charge is better.  Will keep you all updated.</li>
            <li> Always used a razor with a blade. did not know if i would like an electric razor.  works very good like it very much</li>
            <li> Shaver works well.  It is hard to tell how the blade technology is different from anything that came before it.  If you like the way an older model worked, you should like this model too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three gripes: 1-After three 10-minute shaves, shaver battery goes to 50%; 2-Soap/Water replacement instructions are baffling; 3-My shaver&#x27;s LCD panel became useless after a drop in the shower...a wet/dry shaver should survive a drop in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product since December 2010 and have used it on average 3 times a week since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not had to replace anything. I used the self cleaner for the first year or so but after that I just rinse it thoroughly and let it dry as I live away from home a lot and don&#x27;t want to transport the base unit around. It charges fine from both the base and just direct from the power cord and a charge sees me through a weeks worth of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a shave in the shower guy and thats what I got this for. I always use it with shaving gel and it&#x27;s been great. I&#x27;ve used it dry once or twice when needs must, and the results were good, just a little more irritation. Never had any cuts or nicks.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a really nice close shave and irritation is very minimal. It can be a little tricky to get as close a shave around the jaw and neck area, but it is with all shavers so I can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t think of anything bad about it. Was a great investment and hasn&#x27;t let me down. Is still doing exactly what it is designed to do 2 years on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK electric shaver, does the work.</li>
            <li> It is an ok product. For the price, I gave it 3 stars. I will otherwise give 2 stars for shaving.</li>
            <li> My husband needs to have a close shave for work, and hated having to get up earlier just to blade-shave. This gest just as close, looks just as nice, and takes much less time. His hair grows quickly, so he does it every morning and looks great. Very satisfied. It has a self-cleaning that is easy to use, and the blades last a long time.</li>
            <li> Does a good job without pulling but does not get a close shave everywhere. Often you have to go over the same spot many times and from different directions.</li>
            <li> being someone that has to shave every single day for work, Its nice to have this electric shaver so my face isnt so beat up all the time.&lt;br /&gt;The charge can last me over a week while doing two shaves every day, and i&#x27;ve had the same set of blades on it for over 6 months and they still cut like they did day 1.&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe i have is that it can not get the hair on my neck at all, i&#x27;m stuck using a regular razor for that, but i cant really blame that on the shaver since i&#x27;ve never had an electric that could do my neck well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like you&#x27;d be better off buying just the razor instead of the cleaning system because lets be real here, its a wet/dry razor. the little cleaning station cant do more than you can easily do by just throwing some antibacterial soap on it and turning it on while dunked in a sink full of water, its more of a gimmic if you ask me. The cleaning station regularly gets clogged with hair, and it just did not seem to do anything spectacular i couldnt do myself. the fan it uses to dry the razor after a cleaning is almost obnoxiously loud. with it sitting in the bathroom attached to my bedroom it would bother me when i tried to go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;all in all a good purchase, and i would not hesitate to purchase another. especially if you could get it cheaper without the cleaning thing.</li>
            <li> This gives my a nice close shave wet or dry. There is a battery life indicator so you never get caught with a dead battery and it tells you when you need to pop it back into the base for cleaning. There is also a popout clipper for trimming your sideburns.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace my Braun of 5 years.  I have sensitive skin and needed a shaver that would accommodate and this one has not disappointed.  Great shave every day with a very close/clean shave and no razer burn.  I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ved owned this for 2+ years and still works great. I had to replace the inner blade once.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic RC9-07 Shaver Hydro cleaner charger I purchased in December does not clean anymore.  I have a years supply of cleaning cartridges that I can&#x27;t use now.  The sellers warranty was only good for 90 days.  I now know why.  I like the shaver, but the cleaner charger is junk.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my uncle because he has sensitive skin and I researched that this type of shaver is best for such skin types. He loves it. He even loves all the bells and whistles too, which weren&#x27;t so complicated as to discourage use. He reports that it gives him a very close shave without any irritation. It is very easy to clean (run it through some water) and the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> Bought this from Amazon for less than 1/2 of what retailers are asking in Canada ($300).  Seems like a solid shaver. Have been using it for several months now to shave head and face. No real complaints. The removable foil and cover seems a little flimsy - handle carefully. I always run it over soaped up skin and rinse it frequently during use...overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this shaver except how terribly loud it is when it&#x27;s going through its self-cleaning. The noise is so bad, I have to shut the bathroom door. Shaves great!</li>
            <li> My husband is picky but this me all his expectations and then some! he loves it and doesnt know why he didt get it before!  its his most favorite birthday present I have ever gotten him!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost 3 years (i think) and still use it every day. This is a great product. I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone who likes to get a 90% close shave in 20% of the time without having to worry about water or shaving cream. Please note: I used this for over 2 years of active duty and never heard a word about my shave not being close enough.</li>
