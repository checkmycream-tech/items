            <li>This combination of products really has given me the best skin of my life.</li>
            <li>That is the honest to G-D truth.</li>
            <li>I make my own skin and body care products, and use this oil for a couple of the products.</li>
            <li>I love this brand for jojoba oil, and the 4-oz bottles are a good size.</li>
            <li>It also works as a nice massage oil.</li>
            <li>I use a quarter size amount in my hair and it looks nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>Lather up your shaving cream over the oil on your face with the brush until it is nice and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 4.</li>
            <li>Even though I just got this product a week ago I&#x27;m confident that it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>I rubbed it on my toes, I liked the way it was</li>
            <li>It does not have a noticeable scent of its own</li>

            <li>I did research on the best products for skin care under a beard, and this came up over and over as a main ingredient.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has a perfect mild scent and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy at all but smooth &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li>Great product, it arrived super feast</li>

            <li>Unless it says organic or natural it probably isn&#x27;t the best thing for your skin, but it won&#x27;t kill you I guess.</li>
            <li>My package came right on time &amp; it was in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally bought it because I read that it was good for strengthening finger nails.</li>

            <li>please make sure the product is intact, before sending it out.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Of course, I wanted my skin to be healthy and glowing on my wedding day</li>
            <li>Also, after the wedding, I started skimping on my routine and did begin breaking out much more often and lost that healthy glow.</li>
            <li>great price fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I use my orange ginger lotion from the body shop that works better for me.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with this oil, and have run out but will definitely be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>I love this oil</li>
            <li>and it works for that as well :3</li>
            <li>No smell, no nasty residue, no problems!</li>
            <li>OK price.</li>
            <li>But I also love it for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot, and most don&#x27;t get all the makeup off or irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Love this for my homemade face creams.</li>
            <li>Plastic bottle has a flip top lid which makes dispensing easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>think it works better.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for more uses, and in case you&#x27;re wondering...</li>
            <li>now I know why jojoba oil is in most conditioning products &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It got rid of most</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>Safely shipped.</li>
            <li>It has a rancid smell whereas most jojoba has a neutral odor.</li>
            <li>My ends look healthy and hydrated but not at all</li>
            <li>This claim does not detract from how pleased I am with this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>it makes the ends feel much more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I can literally use 2 drops, rub it between my palms, and glide it over the surface of my hair like a silicone serum to add shine, but if I use any more than that it won&#x27;t soak in and looks greasy.</li>
            <li>My favorite oils to use would be olive oil, coconut oil and castor or almond oil</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is great, and it doesn&#x27;t leave as much of an oily feeling as does Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I love jojoba oil</li>
            <li>Of course I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of jojoba oil and the most affordable.</li>
            <li>I use it with essential oils in the bath and it works great!</li>
            <li>I love Jojoba Oil, as well as Coconut and Castor Oil, for some of my homemade all-natural skin and hair care solutions.</li>
            <li>i love it&lt;</li>
            <li>love this oil for my face, i put it on at night &amp; in the morning as a moisturizer.</li>

            <li>Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Instead of drying out my skin and causing it to think it needs to produce more oil, it soothes and moisturizes and makes my skin think it needs to take a break.</li>

            <li>The shipping was fast and I received an email from the seller to make sure I was happy with the product, which I am.  </li>
            <li>Many compliments and requests for more.</li>
            <li>Great product, however I would like to see is price more reasonable.</li>
            <li>amazing texture, makes my skin look/feel fabulous</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>The dispenser top is okay, but I would have preferred a glass</li>
            <li>I love this jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li>My most favorite oil.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly in my hair.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>Just what I was expecting thanks!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has no scent, and is not greasy, I always feel great after I apply them on my full body right after I got out shower or use it on my hands, face and neck in my office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so great to fine pure products without junk in them.</li>
            <li>-)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this to a friend also someone who wants smooth skin also its great for hair growth and keeps your hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li>and I think my hair looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I think this is not quite as good as Sedu pure argan oil, but is better for me than</li>
            <li>This is the single best makeup remover I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Great, natural product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and makes my hair very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I bought the product to keep my lobes in good shape while stretching my lobes for large ear piercings.  </li>
            <li>First let me say it smells really good and is a smooth consistency.    </li>
            <li>After I unwrap my hair in the morning it is soft, shiny, and it feels great.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizer that&#x27;s not greasy looking but offers a dewy look.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best, I tried argan oil just once only 2 drops from a vendor and it seemed just as good.</li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer, helps control oil production and helps clear acne.</li>
            <li>It has never caused my face to break out and is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Item arrived fast and in good condition without any leakage.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for use in combination with other emollients.</li>
            <li>So, there&#x27;s that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall... not bad!</li>
            <li>so I easily covered it with makeup.</li>
            <li>Jojoba is just as great as many oils such as coconut, olive oil or almond oil.</li>
            <li>I have been using this throughout my pregnancy to easy my itchy belly.  </li>
            <li>I went to try something more natural and heard good things about jojoba</li>
            <li>it allows me to keep just the right amount of oil in my hair and beard so that they lay nice and frizz free.</li>
            <li>It is the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve used, hands down.</li>
            <li>No complaints about the oil itself -- it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I like to use it twice a week at night, because it absorbs quickly, and you wake up with smooth skin!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping :)</li>
            <li>nice and a dry oil good stuff</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t huge though</li>
            <li>I have been putting it on my face every day and night and its made a HUGE difference already.</li>
            <li>I am huge fan of Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>This one has a light scent, absorbs well into the skin, and is a great carrier oil to use with essential oils.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m very happy with the results as an after-shower moisturizer on my face; so far, I&#x27;ve had no trouble with acne popping up as a consequence.</li>
            <li>Great all around essential oil.</li>
            <li>This is a really light oil and it does absorb into the skin well without leaving a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>My face is smooth, I stopped breaking out and it soothes my fry skin.</li>
            <li>This has been fantastic and help me when inserting tapers.  </li>
            <li>At the same time I believe this oil is great for all skin types...not just people with oily</li>
            <li>This is one of the best things if your gauges are giving you trouble.</li>
            <li>its a fabulous Oil...just what i needed for my DIY projects</li>
            <li>I love that it prevents wrinkles and keeps my skin looking dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I still had an old bottle with the more substantial push top lid that I was able to replace it with.</li>
            <li>Tried all the acne products out there to keep me acne free.</li>
            <li>Mixes great with lotions and essential oils.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just fantastic.</li>
            <li>After I shower, my hair is silky smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair smooth and manageable and my skin glowing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so comfortable with it, I even use it on my lips and in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was going to use this to &#x27;smooth&#x27; my beard but found it made my face feel oily and sweaty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great alternative to makeup remover products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please feel free to comment, if you have any additional information.  </li>
            <li>Good for hair and scalp, makes hands soft.  </li>
            <li>Good quality product for beauty and natural perfumery applications.</li>
            <li>so far so good, I just stared using this</li>
            <li>I read it is good for your face since it&#x27;s like your natural face oils.  </li>
            <li>(It was more like wax, right out of the fridge.  </li>
            <li>Good oil, has very minimal smell and should take on any scent you want to add to it to make it your own custom scent.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.purchases due to the cheap bottle;  The bottle is not really a big deal, all in all the product is great.  </li>
            <li>It is not bad, I will use it to make my hair end smooth.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product because I needed Jojoba oil to act as the activator/carrier for my rosacea medicine.  </li>
            <li>more than once cause despite the first time I thought that must have been some fluke/mistake, but nope.</li>
            <li>I do not use this on my face because I have found a higher quality jojoba oil that is 10x better.</li>
            <li>good for ear streching and your lobes in general</li>
            <li>but I think this significantly reduces the amount.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave a greasy feeling and is absorbed by the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>This oil is especially great to use after you have had to wash your hands frequently, it will restore the flexibility of your skin and protect it from drying out any further or cracking.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Good price super fast shipping thank you so much</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I put more on at night because too much during the day will leave the skin looking a tad oily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve added a touch of lavender essential oil since its so good for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 39 weeks along and can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  </li>
            <li>The same product on Amazon was priced cheaper than what the retail store had it listed for, so it was good buy.  </li>
            <li>Good product overall.</li>
            <li>NO bad smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very practical and useful product and I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Nice and fresh, mostly odorless (if it smells like anything there&#x27;s a slight cardboard smell... it&#x27;s not a bad thing) and the bottle is more convenient than the dropper</li>
            <li>My whole life (I&#x27;ll be 50 soon), I&#x27;ve never been able to use a moisturizer because, no matter how mild it said it was, it would cause my face to explode.</li>
            <li>- I told her as well as many many many other friends the perks of using this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only shave over your razor burn/ingrown hair prone areas once which should be easy considering how close the jojoba will get your shave on its first pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Non irritating, great for acne prone skin since it most closely imitates the natural, good oils in your skin.</li>
            <li>Very pure and light.</li>
            <li>but the oil itself is s great product for helping my hands and other body parts stay moisturized.</li>
            <li>This works great as an ingredient (or standalone) lotion as well as for other homemade products like hair pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and actually good for my skin, encouraging healthy skin instead of drying and causing wrinkles like other make-up removing products on the market.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair in hopes it will help my mild dandruff.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs into skin quickly with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>I have used it in an oil mix for my hair for a quite a while and more recently have begun using it as a face moisturizer, which I LOVE.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and as described</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t pour out too quickly.</li>
            <li>and it shipped really quickly.</li>
            <li>it is not too greasy and it obsorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin look healthy, soft, smooth and glowy</li>
            <li>and it absorbs quickly and is odorless.</li>
            <li>Kept my skin soft, moisturizer, and acne free :)</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, arrived as described.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly and intact.</li>
            <li>It came really quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to use on my natural hair and it works great and is light enough not to cause a lot of build up</li>
            <li>Many of the sources I found said that it&#x27;s normal for the oil to smell nutty, and it can seem to smell like sesame oil or bacon to some people.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend purchasing this oil, and I will certainly be back for more myself!</li>
            <li>Gives ZERO irritation on even the most sensitive, allergy-ridden eyes!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t bother to write reviews unless i&#x27;m really happy with a product, or really unhappy, but in this case I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>After using this for a while now I&#x27;ve also realized that this works amazingly well as a topical anti itch remedy as well.  </li>
            <li>After using this for a while now I&#x27;ve also realized that this works amazingly well as a topical anti itch remedy as well.  </li>
            <li>If you do, use some undiluted oil to calm the irritation.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle, non-greasy and light.</li>

            <li>Also, my skin now stays soft and smooth through the winter!</li>
            <li>Jojoba seems to be the most like our natural skin oil.  </li>
            <li>I love how it is 100% natural.</li>
            <li>It was worth buying.</li>
            <li>Its so versatile and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>At the end of your HOT shower run hot water on your face for a good minute while using a toothbrush to brush the hairs in the opposite direction of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2.</li>
            <li>This will keep the natural oils on your face and the magical jojoba.</li>
            <li>absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I love Jojoba oil for my natural hair</li>
            <li>I love this all natural product</li>
            <li>So far Desert Essence and Acne.org Jojoba oil are my favorite.</li>
            <li>but so far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>My face has never been so healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I then use a natural bristle brush to better distribute the jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>makes my skin feel soft and refreshing.</li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly and really softens my skin, with no bad reactions.</li>
            <li>His mom has naturally super straight hair!</li>
            <li>This was a good price for such a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Healed my ear right up, and allowed my earrings to go in no problem.</li>
            <li>It provides just the right about of moisture without being greasy.</li>
            <li>this right after I take a shower.  </li>
            <li>Right Now</li>
            <li>In addition, it is great for essential oil diffusing and general skin care.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I took me so long to get into the natural product world, but I am officially a convert lol.</li>
            <li>It will keep your face moisturized and clean for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying from this company, however everything came on time and looked exactly like the picture (no spills or anything!).</li>
            <li>Once I started back up with religiously following my routine, my skin is very smooth and nice again.    </li>
            <li>After seeing the same exact product in a retail store for more than double the price on Amazon.com, I ordered and have been very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>It makes my otherwise dry damaged hair look great &amp; feel amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>Multiple uses, good price, and very natural.</li>
            <li>My skin is usually oily and acne prone, but this doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy and it feels great.</li>
            <li>I mixed this with other oils to make my own body butter, and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love that it is 100% pure, not too oily, and keeps my skin looking clear.</li>
            <li>He is mixed race with a head of soft, spiral curls that are gorgeous...</li>
            <li>this oil is a great carrier of my essential oils - terrific on the skin.</li>
            <li>and it absorbs super fast.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other oils and this one is by far the best safe and gentle enough for newborns dry skin</li>
            <li>My nails are incredible weak</li>
            <li>Because of my allergies I am very sensitive to fragrances; this oil has a slight nutty odor which doesn&#x27;t bother my sinuses, and I actually find it kind of pleasant smelling.  </li>
            <li>As far as the oil, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>I had a healthy glow, face seemed tighter and fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>more like an odor on my last two bottles.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my frizzy split ends, I can put it on in the morning and it won&#x27;t look greasy!</li>
            <li>I also have oil on my skin after cleaning and rinsing my face with jojoba oil and hot water.</li>
            <li>It actually feels better than the premixed beard oil I was using before.</li>
            <li>I used it all over my skin including face, and it leaves the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my third bottle and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The product I received is exactly like the Desert Essence I have purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I recommend trying to ditch the face wash for a week or 2 first and see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a tiny dropper on top</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that the organic version has a funny smell that&#x27;s why I opted for this one.</li>
            <li>So be aware that it may cause a reaction.</li>
            <li>Will buy more if I can catch this on sale somewhere or when I start to run low.</li>
            <li>It slides on smoothly and absorbs almost immediately - not nearly as heavy as coconut oil and no need to blot it off with a towel afterward.</li>
            <li>My skin has much fewer breakouts (I&#x27;m at that hormonal time in life-not fun) and looks healthier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first experience with jojoba and I will never buy from this brand again.</li>
            <li>Since day one, skin has been soft, acne free</li>
            <li>caution -- the first time I tried this</li>
            <li>I love to use is after a bath and especially after a shave!</li>
            <li>Hopefully, someone with more knowledge can give me a definite answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most essential oils are packaged in a darkened glass bottle to help it stay &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and some oils will eat away at plastic.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>So you may have to experiment to find the right amount of product for your own hair, but err on the side of using too little if you have somewhere to go right after putting it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a good size, but a little too large for TSA&#x27;s liking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size, but a little too large for TSA&#x27;s liking.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel sooo soft and look fresh and glowy (think JLo!).</li>
            <li>But this Only Was Actually Really Good....Great for Hot Oil Treatment (In My Opinion)....Great Stuff, Just in Love with Avocado Oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not touch your face during the day and wash your hands frequently to keep them clean, just in case you do accidentally touch your face.</li>
            <li>Best oil out there hands down, it absorbs very quickly, if you have oily skin and dry at the same time i highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I read the reviews which appear quite positive.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this oil for sometimes and have positive results.</li>
            <li>I pretty much use it anywhere on my skin, scalp and hair any time I want.</li>
            <li>My hair looks greasy with pretty much any \\&quot;frizz reducing\\&quot; product</li>
            <li>and it takes of pretty much everything.</li>
            <li>This is important b/c out of all of the compounds in nature, this wax ester is the most similar to human skin oil which is called sebum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great alone or mixed with other oils.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Rinse off your face COMPLETELY with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 7.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that all of the information about jojoba oil is true.  </li>
            <li>and I am not having to pop the pimples because they are going down on their own.  </li>
            <li>Pat your face dry and apply another layer of the magical JoJoba oil.</li>
            <li>But, it absorbs quickly, gets rid of the itchiness, leaves skin soft with no greasy residue, and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea and super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I was able to use it on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>, I put pure lavender oil in it for fragrance and use it on my body.</li>
            <li>My piercer recommended a couple drops of jojoba oil to help strengthen some skin around my navel area to prevent my ring from tearing through, but the bottle is so large</li>
            <li>I was debating whether or not to get the organic one or the pure jojoba oil from desert essence.</li>
            <li>I got the 100% pure one(cheaper)</li>
            <li>100% Pure.</li>
            <li>This product is not 100% pure as they claim it to be.  </li>
            <li>Clear plastic is not the optimum container for any oil product as it may take on some of the less healthful properties of the plastic.</li>
            <li>I mixed with some Young Living essential oils for a pleasant smell and skin pampering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very high quality brand and would recommend it myself to anyone</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not very oily either which is super nice, and I can definitely see the change in my skin, much softer than before..</li>
            <li>Quick and the quality is great, I use this oil on my body skin and small amount on my hair during the dry months.</li>
            <li>Very reliable merchant, on time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>

            <li>Product was as described, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have put it on most of my face (except around the eyes) and it&#x27;s definitely helping to clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>think it is better on your plumbing than olive oil, especially if you have old cast iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful not only as a makeup remover, but as a moisturizer and oil treatment for hair as well.</li>
            <li>This is fairly easy to distribute throughout your hair, even with long hair, and you don&#x27;t need very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I started putting a few drops of jojoba oil on the ends of my clean, damp hair and it has made a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Great for skin a little goes a long way after you cleanse your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is great for the scars on my face and for moisturizing the tight and dry spots on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite beauty product because it&#x27;s so versatile, natural, and actually works!</li>
            <li>I first got jojoba oil to help with my scalp- so far, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with that.</li>
            <li>I love that this oil is 100% natural and is so similar to the skin&#x27;s natural oils (skin&#x27;s built-in moisturizer!).</li>
            <li>but the blemishes are healing much faster than normal</li>
            <li>This is my first time doing this and my skin is responding well to it so far.  </li>
            <li>I may try sweet almond oil next ,or emu oil.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, but this product has not failed me yet.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer, incredibly soft and smooth, and it even looks younger.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews for this particular brand and product, I went for it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good for your skin in a general sense, even for the face (in small quantities, because I suspect it made me break out once or twice).</li>
            <li>But Because I am Just Sticking to Two Particular Oil</li>
            <li>I use this product mainly to remove my eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t work particularly well for me.  </li>
            <li>I am sure they use a lot of illegal chemicals in their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, with jojoba oil, it just made everything better.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly to use on my face and scalp.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I took some out of the bottle, it quickly melt back to oil.  </li>
            <li>Right Now...Using 6 or 7 or 8 Different for Your is Just too Much....</li>
            <li>I can go from skin that feels like it&#x27;s on fire from itching to calm and cool in less than a minute.</li>
            <li>I can go from skin that feels like it&#x27;s on fire from itching to calm and cool in less than a minute.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My hair and skin is very dry by nature, but this stuff works magically by softening and moisturizing my hair like no other.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this product is a good moisturizer, especially during these dry winter months.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but the bottle can leak when a little pressure is applied.</li>
            <li>Great oil, wish it wasnt so expensive for just 4oz</li>
            <li>I ended up using a nickel-sized amount of this and that was far too much.  </li>
            <li>I ended up using a nickel-sized amount of this and that was far too much.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>Now it am using an old fashioned double edged razor which I find is actually shaving better - check the web for the process.</li>
            <li>Its good oil, just dont leave it by a window getting sun, after a while it build up some kind of white stuff in the oil, like if it had gone bad or something</li>
            <li>-in-all, this is an economical choice for me and is providing several benefits for my hair.  </li>
            <li>-in-all, this is an economical choice for me and is providing several benefits for my hair.  </li>
            <li>shipping was fast and easy and in as little as a week</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD FOR SMALL DRY SPOTS, ESPECIALLY CUTICLES AND HEELS.  </li>
            <li>This works far better and costs much less.  </li>
            <li>have thick, dry hair and used Moroccan Oil that makes it look great.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more, for friends that have severe problems with dry weather cracking their fingers and hands.</li>
            <li>I use it for my face because I get horribly dry skin in the winter and it helps keep my skin smooth and clear of pimples and blackheads.</li>
            <li>I have been putting this soley on my nose after using a somewhat strong facial cleanser (Neutrogena Deep clean), and I have had barely any white heads since I started applying this.  </li>
            <li>Winter will be the true test of how well this works though when I try it on my dry eczema</li>
            <li>I have had one particular crack in the crease of my index finger that has been an open wound that refuses to heal for a solid year or more; after using this product every day for a week, the crack that refused to heal has actually healed!  </li>
            <li>Shave over every area of your face in short very gentle strokes almost applying no pressure at all.</li>
            <li>Very natural product.  </li>
            <li>I found this when I was searching for just the right natural pre-wedding skin care routine last year.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In fact, when used with my new medicine, it has helped to clear up all of my symptoms, improved the condition of my face, and reduced any wrinkles I as developing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great substitute for lotion and moisturizers which usually have harsh chemicals that go into your blood stream.</li>
            <li>I was having an issue with a more than normal oily nose as well as little white heads in the corners.</li>
            <li>Obviously, I used this oil every single day, and it made my skin so silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I  am 40 something with fine lines, dull complexion and have really struggled with cystic acne.</li>
            <li>I have bought this Jojoba Oil, organic or pure for multiple times for myself and my friends.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of pure oils.  </li>
            <li>Taking it on planes is a nightmare; I&#x27;ve found that I have to dedicate a single disposable plastic bag for this stuff, and inevitably every time I remove it from my suitcase, a significant amount of the oil has leaked out into the plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that it worked very quickly to clear up my complexion and also my young daughter&#x27;s exzema.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft when I use it.</li>
            <li>Desert Essence 100% Natural Jojoba Oil - use as moisturizer before bed  5)</li>
            <li>I got this because my skin is so sensitive to everything</li>
            <li>AND OMG, MY HAIR WAS NOTICEABLE SOFT</li>
            <li>I use it for my skin and hair and it leaves my skin looking shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>After expressing my concern directly with Desert Essence and asking whether anything in their processing of the oil had changed.  </li>
            <li>It has no smell or dyes - totally natural and does not cause pore clogging or breakout.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>NO heavy smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see so many of the lines that I&#x27;ve been seeing lately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has completely eliminated the dandruff my beard would shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recommend Pacific Shaving companies all natural shaving</li>
            <li>so far Amazon website won&#x27;t let me get through for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I use jojoba as a natural moisturizer, and Dessert Essence does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>I use jojoba as a natural moisturizer, and Dessert Essence does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and likes this oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not heavy or greasy at all</li>
            <li>a considerable amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pH (or something) to the face&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li>looks so much fresher when I&#x27;m using it regularly.</li>
            <li>In the morning my face is completely radiant and my skin feels silky soft.</li>
            <li>Made my skin clear and soft, not oily like I thought it would.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh at all on my skin.</li>
            <li>near the eyes if you rub your eyes during the night it&#x27;ll irritate your eyes to the point where you may have to get out of bed to rinse them out.</li>
            <li>I use directly on the body and as an add on to home made moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my face at night and it is soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>I also put it in my hair at night and it keeps my curls soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy at all</li>
            <li>I think anyone can apply this on their hair before shampooing to keep your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I oil my whole entire body with it.</li>
            <li>Wish they had a bigger size for how much it is.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft, not oily at all, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>Ever since I used this oil on my hair after I shower,  people have been complimenting how soft and healthier it looks now.</li>
            <li>I would never go back to proactiv for anything really.</li>
            <li>I was excited as well as nervous because putting more oil in my face its kinda crazy.</li>
            <li>However, I do agree that the bottle is a little hard to use without making a mess, but I&#x27;m just going to buy a reusable glass bottle with a built in eye dropper and enjoy the savings on future purchases due to the cheap bottle;  The bottle is not really a big deal, all in all the product is great.  </li>
            <li>only reason I am not giving a 5 star is that I feel it was a bit over priced for such a small quantity...if I could just get more for my money I&#x27;d be much happier.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way :)</li>
            <li>Also my face is more subtle and hydrated in fact</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an effective moisturizer layer for dry days and helps (at least does not disrupt) healing.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is a penetrating oil which means it can penetrate down through the layers of skin and is highly absorbable so if there are any toxins in the oil, they are being absorbed through your skin and into your body so you definitely want to use organic jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>Last but not least.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>so I feel that my skin will not dry out on my face, and if I put excess, simply try and spread it elsewhere, or get a paper towel or something to pad your face down lightly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and smooth and I have some frizz (hard to avoid in Georgia)</li>
            <li>and this really helps my dry hair.</li>
            <li>After you let it soak in and blot off any extra, your hands just feel like they naturally would if you had your natural oils intact, it&#x27;s not too greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is really 100% pure jojoba oil; but so far, I like it.</li>
            <li>Jojoba is the only moisturizer that does NOT break me out and that is saying a lot since I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my skin for a year now and have seen a major difference.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you only need a very small amount to moisturize.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old was recently diagnosed with eczema, I used a generous amount after her bath last night, and this morning, her flare up is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The next day, I dialed it back to just a few drops and it was fine.  </li>
            <li>The next day, I dialed it back to just a few drops and it was fine.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it moisturize my skin unlike anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried [even coconut oil] but it has helped clear up my skin as well.</li>
            <li>When I put it on my face it made it soft and no shine later in the day like you would think.  </li>
            <li>only products with natural ingredients on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this in my hair which is transitioning back to natural</li>
            <li>Hope this is some kind of glitch, but I got the entirely wrong product and</li>
            <li>Every single time I pack this thing up, even just into a gymbag for a short trip to work, I find when I remove it that a large amount of the oil has leaked out through the cap and soaked the area around the container.</li>
            <li>I had initially postponed buying my next set of oils (essentials and a carrier) purely because of the price per ounce, but upon ordering this and using it regularly for two weeks already, I can see that it is going to last me a while.</li>
            <li>Also, if you have to constantly wash your hands because you&#x27;re in the medical field or something similar, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you have to constantly wash your hands because you&#x27;re in the medical field or something similar, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>It makes his hair seem really weighed down if I use a little more, but if I use less, it doesn&#x27;t help to manage the curls</li>
            <li>I recently came across this oil on my search for an all natural facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Although it does feel weird at first, I believe it&#x27;s a better alternative than other drugstore removers which contain harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>This stuff definitely helps flare ups of dyshydrosis to stop getting any worse and start to heal, I don&#x27;t know if it actively acts as an inflammatory or it just protects the skin from irritation, whatever the case it actually helps and allows me to use the prescription cream less frequently (which is a great thing).  </li>
            <li>Seems to be exactly the same as previously purchased jojoba oil from Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>for the packaging, I was happy the inside was sealed but disappointed it came in a plastic bottle.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know much about jojoba oil but shouldn&#x27;t this be in a dark bottle?</li>
            <li>I actually went to Whole Foods the other day &amp; saw that they sold it there</li>
            <li>because, its already long so i figured to let it grow naturally</li>
            <li>Please note that when reading other reviews from this and other products, that sometimes people get bottles of oil that have gone rancid, so make sure when you get it that it has a pleasant nutty odor and doesn&#x27;t stink really bad!  </li>

            <li>This particular brand appears to be lighter than other brands I have tried which is a benefit when using it on your skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this to cleanse my face for a few weeks and have seen amazing results, less breakouts, moisturized skin, and less redness.</li>

            <li> That is the honest to G-D truth.</li>
            <li> I make my own skin and body care products, and use this oil for a couple of the products.</li>
            <li> I love this brand for jojoba oil, and the 4-oz bottles are a good size.</li>
            <li> It also works as a nice massage oil.</li>
            <li> I use a quarter size amount in my hair and it looks nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Lather up your shaving cream over the oil on your face with the brush until it is nice and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 4.</li>
            <li> Even though I just got this product a week ago I&#x27;m confident that it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> I rubbed it on my toes, I liked the way it was</li>
            <li> It does not have a noticeable scent of its own</li>
            <li> Nice container.</li>

            <li> A nice oil for the skin-</li>
            <li> It smelled nutty, kind of like sesame oil...</li>

            <li> Nice oil.</li>
            <li> I did research on the best products for skin care under a beard, and this came up over and over as a main ingredient.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a perfect mild scent and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy at all but smooth &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> Great product, it arrived super feast</li>
            <li> :) Love it!</li>

            <li> My nails look great, and I rarely have any cuticle problems.</li>
            <li> Unless it says organic or natural it probably isn&#x27;t the best thing for your skin, but it won&#x27;t kill you I guess.</li>
            <li> My package came right on time &amp; it was in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally bought it because I read that it was good for strengthening finger nails.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Of course, I wanted my skin to be healthy and glowing on my wedding day</li>
            <li> Also, after the wedding, I started skimping on my routine and did begin breaking out much more often and lost that healthy glow.</li>
            <li> great price fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I use my orange ginger lotion from the body shop that works better for me.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this oil, and have run out but will definitely be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> I love this oil</li>
            <li> and it works for that as well :3</li>
            <li> No smell, no nasty residue, no problems!</li>
            <li> OK price.</li>
            <li> But I also love it for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot, and most don&#x27;t get all the makeup off or irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> Love this for my homemade face creams.</li>
            <li> Plastic bottle has a flip top lid which makes dispensing easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> think it works better.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for more uses, and in case you&#x27;re wondering...</li>
            <li> now I know why jojoba oil is in most conditioning products &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It got rid of most</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> Safely shipped.</li>
            <li> It has a rancid smell whereas most jojoba has a neutral odor.</li>
            <li> My ends look healthy and hydrated but not at all</li>
            <li> This claim does not detract from how pleased I am with this product.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> it makes the ends feel much more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I can literally use 2 drops, rub it between my palms, and glide it over the surface of my hair like a silicone serum to add shine, but if I use any more than that it won&#x27;t soak in and looks greasy.</li>
            <li> My favorite oils to use would be olive oil, coconut oil and castor or almond oil</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is great, and it doesn&#x27;t leave as much of an oily feeling as does Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I love jojoba oil</li>
            <li> Of course I will be buying more.</li>

            <li> Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Instead of drying out my skin and causing it to think it needs to produce more oil, it soothes and moisturizes and makes my skin think it needs to take a break.</li>
            <li> Love this product and have ordered it many times.</li>

            <li> I love this jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> My most favorite oil.  </li>
            <li> I use it mostly in my hair.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> Just what I was expecting thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has no scent, and is not greasy, I always feel great after I apply them on my full body right after I got out shower or use it on my hands, face and neck in my office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so great to fine pure products without junk in them.</li>
            <li> -)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this to a friend also someone who wants smooth skin also its great for hair growth and keeps your hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> and I think my hair looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I think this is not quite as good as Sedu pure argan oil, but is better for me than</li>
            <li> This is the single best makeup remover I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great, natural product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and makes my hair very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I bought the product to keep my lobes in good shape while stretching my lobes for large ear piercings.  </li>
            <li> First let me say it smells really good and is a smooth consistency.    </li>
            <li> After I unwrap my hair in the morning it is soft, shiny, and it feels great.  </li>
            <li> Great moisturizer that&#x27;s not greasy looking but offers a dewy look.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best, I tried argan oil just once only 2 drops from a vendor and it seemed just as good.</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer, helps control oil production and helps clear acne.</li>
            <li> It has never caused my face to break out and is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Item arrived fast and in good condition without any leakage.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for use in combination with other emollients.</li>
            <li> So, there&#x27;s that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall... not bad!</li>
            <li> so I easily covered it with makeup.</li>
            <li> Jojoba is just as great as many oils such as coconut, olive oil or almond oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using this throughout my pregnancy to easy my itchy belly.  </li>
            <li> I went to try something more natural and heard good things about jojoba</li>
            <li> it allows me to keep just the right amount of oil in my hair and beard so that they lay nice and frizz free.</li>
            <li> It is the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve used, hands down.</li>
            <li> No complaints about the oil itself -- it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I like to use it twice a week at night, because it absorbs quickly, and you wake up with smooth skin!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping :)</li>
            <li> nice and a dry oil good stuff</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t huge though</li>
            <li> I have been putting it on my face every day and night and its made a HUGE difference already.</li>
            <li> I am huge fan of Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> This one has a light scent, absorbs well into the skin, and is a great carrier oil to use with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m very happy with the results as an after-shower moisturizer on my face; so far, I&#x27;ve had no trouble with acne popping up as a consequence.</li>

            <li> I love that it prevents wrinkles and keeps my skin looking dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I still had an old bottle with the more substantial push top lid that I was able to replace it with.</li>
            <li> Tried all the acne products out there to keep me acne free.</li>
            <li> Mixes great with lotions and essential oils.</li>

            <li> I was going to use this to &#x27;smooth&#x27; my beard but found it made my face feel oily and sweaty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great alternative to makeup remover products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please feel free to comment, if you have any additional information.  </li>
            <li> Good for hair and scalp, makes hands soft.  </li>
            <li> Good quality product for beauty and natural perfumery applications.</li>
            <li> so far so good, I just stared using this</li>
            <li> I read it is good for your face since it&#x27;s like your natural face oils.  </li>
            <li> (It was more like wax, right out of the fridge.  </li>
            <li> Good oil, has very minimal smell and should take on any scent you want to add to it to make it your own custom scent.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.purchases due to the cheap bottle;  The bottle is not really a big deal, all in all the product is great.  </li>
            <li> It is not bad, I will use it to make my hair end smooth.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product because I needed Jojoba oil to act as the activator/carrier for my rosacea medicine.  </li>
            <li> more than once cause despite the first time I thought that must have been some fluke/mistake, but nope.</li>
            <li> I do not use this on my face because I have found a higher quality jojoba oil that is 10x better.</li>
            <li> good for ear streching and your lobes in general</li>
            <li> but I think this significantly reduces the amount.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave a greasy feeling and is absorbed by the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> This oil is especially great to use after you have had to wash your hands frequently, it will restore the flexibility of your skin and protect it from drying out any further or cracking.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Good price super fast shipping thank you so much</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I put more on at night because too much during the day will leave the skin looking a tad oily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added a touch of lavender essential oil since its so good for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 39 weeks along and can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  </li>
            <li> The same product on Amazon was priced cheaper than what the retail store had it listed for, so it was good buy.  </li>
            <li> Good product overall.</li>
            <li> NO bad smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very practical and useful product and I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Nice and fresh, mostly odorless (if it smells like anything there&#x27;s a slight cardboard smell... it&#x27;s not a bad thing) and the bottle is more convenient than the dropper</li>
            <li> My whole life (I&#x27;ll be 50 soon), I&#x27;ve never been able to use a moisturizer because, no matter how mild it said it was, it would cause my face to explode.</li>
            <li> - I told her as well as many many many other friends the perks of using this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only shave over your razor burn/ingrown hair prone areas once which should be easy considering how close the jojoba will get your shave on its first pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Non irritating, great for acne prone skin since it most closely imitates the natural, good oils in your skin.</li>
            <li> Very pure and light.</li>
            <li> but the oil itself is s great product for helping my hands and other body parts stay moisturized.</li>
            <li> This works great as an ingredient (or standalone) lotion as well as for other homemade products like hair pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural and actually good for my skin, encouraging healthy skin instead of drying and causing wrinkles like other make-up removing products on the market.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair in hopes it will help my mild dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs into skin quickly with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I have used it in an oil mix for my hair for a quite a while and more recently have begun using it as a face moisturizer, which I LOVE.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and as described</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t pour out too quickly.</li>
            <li> and it shipped really quickly.</li>
            <li> it is not too greasy and it obsorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin look healthy, soft, smooth and glowy</li>
            <li> and it absorbs quickly and is odorless.</li>
            <li> Kept my skin soft, moisturizer, and acne free :)</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, arrived as described.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and intact.</li>
            <li> It came really quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on my natural hair and it works great and is light enough not to cause a lot of build up</li>
            <li> Many of the sources I found said that it&#x27;s normal for the oil to smell nutty, and it can seem to smell like sesame oil or bacon to some people.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend purchasing this oil, and I will certainly be back for more myself!</li>
            <li> Gives ZERO irritation on even the most sensitive, allergy-ridden eyes!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother to write reviews unless i&#x27;m really happy with a product, or really unhappy, but in this case I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> After using this for a while now I&#x27;ve also realized that this works amazingly well as a topical anti itch remedy as well.  </li>
            <li> After using this for a while now I&#x27;ve also realized that this works amazingly well as a topical anti itch remedy as well.  </li>
            <li> If you do, use some undiluted oil to calm the irritation.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle, non-greasy and light.</li>

            <li> Also, my skin now stays soft and smooth through the winter!</li>
            <li> Jojoba seems to be the most like our natural skin oil.  </li>
            <li> I love how it is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> It was worth buying.</li>
            <li> Its so versatile and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> At the end of your HOT shower run hot water on your face for a good minute while using a toothbrush to brush the hairs in the opposite direction of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2.</li>
            <li> This will keep the natural oils on your face and the magical jojoba.</li>
            <li> absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I love Jojoba oil for my natural hair</li>
            <li> I love this all natural product</li>
            <li> So far Desert Essence and Acne.org Jojoba oil are my favorite.</li>
            <li> but so far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> My face has never been so healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I then use a natural bristle brush to better distribute the jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel soft and refreshing.</li>
            <li> it absorbs quickly and really softens my skin, with no bad reactions.</li>

            <li> It provides just the right about of moisture without being greasy.</li>
            <li> this right after I take a shower.  </li>
            <li> Right Now</li>
            <li> In addition, it is great for essential oil diffusing and general skin care.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I took me so long to get into the natural product world, but I am officially a convert lol.</li>
            <li> It will keep your face moisturized and clean for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying from this company, however everything came on time and looked exactly like the picture (no spills or anything!).</li>
            <li> Once I started back up with religiously following my routine, my skin is very smooth and nice again.    </li>
            <li> After seeing the same exact product in a retail store for more than double the price on Amazon.com, I ordered and have been very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> It makes my otherwise dry damaged hair look great &amp; feel amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> Multiple uses, good price, and very natural.</li>
            <li> My skin is usually oily and acne prone, but this doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy and it feels great.</li>
            <li> I mixed this with other oils to make my own body butter, and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love that it is 100% pure, not too oily, and keeps my skin looking clear.</li>
            <li> He is mixed race with a head of soft, spiral curls that are gorgeous...</li>
            <li> this oil is a great carrier of my essential oils - terrific on the skin.</li>
            <li> and it absorbs super fast.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other oils and this one is by far the best safe and gentle enough for newborns dry skin</li>
            <li> My nails are incredible weak</li>
            <li> Because of my allergies I am very sensitive to fragrances; this oil has a slight nutty odor which doesn&#x27;t bother my sinuses, and I actually find it kind of pleasant smelling.  </li>
            <li> As far as the oil, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> I had a healthy glow, face seemed tighter and fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> more like an odor on my last two bottles.  </li>
            <li> It really helps my frizzy split ends, I can put it on in the morning and it won&#x27;t look greasy!</li>
            <li> I also have oil on my skin after cleaning and rinsing my face with jojoba oil and hot water.</li>
            <li> It actually feels better than the premixed beard oil I was using before.</li>
            <li> I used it all over my skin including face, and it leaves the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The product I received is exactly like the Desert Essence I have purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I recommend trying to ditch the face wash for a week or 2 first and see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a tiny dropper on top</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that the organic version has a funny smell that&#x27;s why I opted for this one.</li>
            <li> So be aware that it may cause a reaction.</li>
            <li> Will buy more if I can catch this on sale somewhere or when I start to run low.</li>
            <li> It slides on smoothly and absorbs almost immediately - not nearly as heavy as coconut oil and no need to blot it off with a towel afterward.</li>
            <li> My skin has much fewer breakouts (I&#x27;m at that hormonal time in life-not fun) and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first experience with jojoba and I will never buy from this brand again.</li>
            <li> Since day one, skin has been soft, acne free</li>
            <li> caution -- the first time I tried this</li>
            <li> I love to use is after a bath and especially after a shave!</li>
            <li> Hopefully, someone with more knowledge can give me a definite answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most essential oils are packaged in a darkened glass bottle to help it stay &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and some oils will eat away at plastic.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> So you may have to experiment to find the right amount of product for your own hair, but err on the side of using too little if you have somewhere to go right after putting it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a good size, but a little too large for TSA&#x27;s liking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size, but a little too large for TSA&#x27;s liking.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel sooo soft and look fresh and glowy (think JLo!).</li>
            <li> But this Only Was Actually Really Good....Great for Hot Oil Treatment (In My Opinion)....Great Stuff, Just in Love with Avocado Oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not touch your face during the day and wash your hands frequently to keep them clean, just in case you do accidentally touch your face.</li>
            <li> Best oil out there hands down, it absorbs very quickly, if you have oily skin and dry at the same time i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I read the reviews which appear quite positive.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for sometimes and have positive results.</li>
            <li> I pretty much use it anywhere on my skin, scalp and hair any time I want.</li>
            <li> My hair looks greasy with pretty much any \\&quot;frizz reducing\\&quot; product</li>
            <li> and it takes of pretty much everything.</li>
            <li> This is important b/c out of all of the compounds in nature, this wax ester is the most similar to human skin oil which is called sebum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great alone or mixed with other oils.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Rinse off your face COMPLETELY with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 7.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that all of the information about jojoba oil is true.  </li>
            <li> and I am not having to pop the pimples because they are going down on their own.  </li>
            <li> Pat your face dry and apply another layer of the magical JoJoba oil.</li>
            <li> But, it absorbs quickly, gets rid of the itchiness, leaves skin soft with no greasy residue, and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I was able to use it on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> , I put pure lavender oil in it for fragrance and use it on my body.</li>
            <li> My piercer recommended a couple drops of jojoba oil to help strengthen some skin around my navel area to prevent my ring from tearing through, but the bottle is so large</li>
            <li> I was debating whether or not to get the organic one or the pure jojoba oil from desert essence.</li>
            <li> I got the 100% pure one(cheaper)</li>
            <li> 100% Pure.</li>
            <li> This product is not 100% pure as they claim it to be.  </li>
            <li> Clear plastic is not the optimum container for any oil product as it may take on some of the less healthful properties of the plastic.</li>
            <li> I mixed with some Young Living essential oils for a pleasant smell and skin pampering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very high quality brand and would recommend it myself to anyone</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very oily either which is super nice, and I can definitely see the change in my skin, much softer than before..</li>
            <li> Quick and the quality is great, I use this oil on my body skin and small amount on my hair during the dry months.</li>
            <li> Very reliable merchant, on time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>

            <li> Hasn&#x27;t helped much with my acne</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about putting ANY type of oil on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will absolutely keep purchasing my jojoba oil from Desert</li>
            <li> The oil is clear and golden with no scent.</li>
            <li> Your product works very well on frizzy hair and keeps the curl in without having to use  a lot of it.</li>

            <li> Product was as described, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have put it on most of my face (except around the eyes) and it&#x27;s definitely helping to clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> think it is better on your plumbing than olive oil, especially if you have old cast iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful not only as a makeup remover, but as a moisturizer and oil treatment for hair as well.</li>
            <li> This is fairly easy to distribute throughout your hair, even with long hair, and you don&#x27;t need very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I started putting a few drops of jojoba oil on the ends of my clean, damp hair and it has made a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Great for skin a little goes a long way after you cleanse your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is great for the scars on my face and for moisturizing the tight and dry spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite beauty product because it&#x27;s so versatile, natural, and actually works!</li>
            <li> I first got jojoba oil to help with my scalp- so far, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with that.</li>
            <li> I love that this oil is 100% natural and is so similar to the skin&#x27;s natural oils (skin&#x27;s built-in moisturizer!).</li>
            <li> but the blemishes are healing much faster than normal</li>
            <li> This is my first time doing this and my skin is responding well to it so far.  </li>
            <li> I may try sweet almond oil next ,or emu oil.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, but this product has not failed me yet.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearer, incredibly soft and smooth, and it even looks younger.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews for this particular brand and product, I went for it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good for your skin in a general sense, even for the face (in small quantities, because I suspect it made me break out once or twice).</li>
            <li> But Because I am Just Sticking to Two Particular Oil</li>
            <li> I use this product mainly to remove my eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work particularly well for me.  </li>
            <li> I am sure they use a lot of illegal chemicals in their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, with jojoba oil, it just made everything better.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly to use on my face and scalp.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I took some out of the bottle, it quickly melt back to oil.  </li>
            <li> Right Now...Using 6 or 7 or 8 Different for Your is Just too Much....</li>
            <li> I can go from skin that feels like it&#x27;s on fire from itching to calm and cool in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> I can go from skin that feels like it&#x27;s on fire from itching to calm and cool in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My hair and skin is very dry by nature, but this stuff works magically by softening and moisturizing my hair like no other.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this product is a good moisturizer, especially during these dry winter months.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but the bottle can leak when a little pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> Great oil, wish it wasnt so expensive for just 4oz</li>
            <li> I ended up using a nickel-sized amount of this and that was far too much.  </li>
            <li> I ended up using a nickel-sized amount of this and that was far too much.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin</li>
            <li> Now it am using an old fashioned double edged razor which I find is actually shaving better - check the web for the process.</li>
            <li> Its good oil, just dont leave it by a window getting sun, after a while it build up some kind of white stuff in the oil, like if it had gone bad or something</li>
            <li> -in-all, this is an economical choice for me and is providing several benefits for my hair.  </li>
            <li> -in-all, this is an economical choice for me and is providing several benefits for my hair.  </li>
            <li> shipping was fast and easy and in as little as a week</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD FOR SMALL DRY SPOTS, ESPECIALLY CUTICLES AND HEELS.  </li>
            <li> This works far better and costs much less.  </li>
            <li> have thick, dry hair and used Moroccan Oil that makes it look great.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more, for friends that have severe problems with dry weather cracking their fingers and hands.</li>
            <li> I use it for my face because I get horribly dry skin in the winter and it helps keep my skin smooth and clear of pimples and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I have been putting this soley on my nose after using a somewhat strong facial cleanser (Neutrogena Deep clean), and I have had barely any white heads since I started applying this.  </li>
            <li> Winter will be the true test of how well this works though when I try it on my dry eczema</li>
            <li> I have had one particular crack in the crease of my index finger that has been an open wound that refuses to heal for a solid year or more; after using this product every day for a week, the crack that refused to heal has actually healed!  </li>
            <li> Shave over every area of your face in short very gentle strokes almost applying no pressure at all.</li>
            <li> Very natural product.  </li>
            <li> I found this when I was searching for just the right natural pre-wedding skin care routine last year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In fact, when used with my new medicine, it has helped to clear up all of my symptoms, improved the condition of my face, and reduced any wrinkles I as developing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great substitute for lotion and moisturizers which usually have harsh chemicals that go into your blood stream.</li>
            <li> I was having an issue with a more than normal oily nose as well as little white heads in the corners.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I used this oil every single day, and it made my skin so silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I  am 40 something with fine lines, dull complexion and have really struggled with cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I have bought this Jojoba Oil, organic or pure for multiple times for myself and my friends.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of pure oils.  </li>
            <li> Taking it on planes is a nightmare; I&#x27;ve found that I have to dedicate a single disposable plastic bag for this stuff, and inevitably every time I remove it from my suitcase, a significant amount of the oil has leaked out into the plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that it worked very quickly to clear up my complexion and also my young daughter&#x27;s exzema.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft when I use it.</li>
            <li> Desert Essence 100% Natural Jojoba Oil - use as moisturizer before bed  5)</li>
            <li> I got this because my skin is so sensitive to everything</li>
            <li> AND OMG, MY HAIR WAS NOTICEABLE SOFT</li>
            <li> I use it for my skin and hair and it leaves my skin looking shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> After expressing my concern directly with Desert Essence and asking whether anything in their processing of the oil had changed.  </li>
            <li> It has no smell or dyes - totally natural and does not cause pore clogging or breakout.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> NO heavy smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see so many of the lines that I&#x27;ve been seeing lately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has completely eliminated the dandruff my beard would shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recommend Pacific Shaving companies all natural shaving</li>
            <li> so far Amazon website won&#x27;t let me get through for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I use jojoba as a natural moisturizer, and Dessert Essence does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I use jojoba as a natural moisturizer, and Dessert Essence does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and likes this oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not heavy or greasy at all</li>
            <li> a considerable amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pH (or something) to the face&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
            <li> looks so much fresher when I&#x27;m using it regularly.</li>
            <li> In the morning my face is completely radiant and my skin feels silky soft.</li>
            <li> Made my skin clear and soft, not oily like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh at all on my skin.</li>
            <li> near the eyes if you rub your eyes during the night it&#x27;ll irritate your eyes to the point where you may have to get out of bed to rinse them out.</li>
            <li> I use directly on the body and as an add on to home made moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my face at night and it is soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I also put it in my hair at night and it keeps my curls soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy at all</li>
            <li> I think anyone can apply this on their hair before shampooing to keep your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I oil my whole entire body with it.</li>
            <li> Wish they had a bigger size for how much it is.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft, not oily at all, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Ever since I used this oil on my hair after I shower,  people have been complimenting how soft and healthier it looks now.</li>
            <li> I would never go back to proactiv for anything really.</li>
            <li> I was excited as well as nervous because putting more oil in my face its kinda crazy.</li>
            <li> However, I do agree that the bottle is a little hard to use without making a mess, but I&#x27;m just going to buy a reusable glass bottle with a built in eye dropper and enjoy the savings on future purchases due to the cheap bottle;  The bottle is not really a big deal, all in all the product is great.  </li>
            <li> only reason I am not giving a 5 star is that I feel it was a bit over priced for such a small quantity...if I could just get more for my money I&#x27;d be much happier.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way :)</li>
            <li> Also my face is more subtle and hydrated in fact</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an effective moisturizer layer for dry days and helps (at least does not disrupt) healing.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is a penetrating oil which means it can penetrate down through the layers of skin and is highly absorbable so if there are any toxins in the oil, they are being absorbed through your skin and into your body so you definitely want to use organic jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> Last but not least.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> so I feel that my skin will not dry out on my face, and if I put excess, simply try and spread it elsewhere, or get a paper towel or something to pad your face down lightly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and smooth and I have some frizz (hard to avoid in Georgia)</li>
            <li> and this really helps my dry hair.</li>
            <li> After you let it soak in and blot off any extra, your hands just feel like they naturally would if you had your natural oils intact, it&#x27;s not too greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is really 100% pure jojoba oil; but so far, I like it.</li>
            <li> Jojoba is the only moisturizer that does NOT break me out and that is saying a lot since I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my skin for a year now and have seen a major difference.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you only need a very small amount to moisturize.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old was recently diagnosed with eczema, I used a generous amount after her bath last night, and this morning, her flare up is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The next day, I dialed it back to just a few drops and it was fine.  </li>
            <li> The next day, I dialed it back to just a few drops and it was fine.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it moisturize my skin unlike anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried [even coconut oil] but it has helped clear up my skin as well.</li>
            <li> When I put it on my face it made it soft and no shine later in the day like you would think.  </li>
            <li> only products with natural ingredients on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair which is transitioning back to natural</li>
            <li> Hope this is some kind of glitch, but I got the entirely wrong product and</li>
            <li> Every single time I pack this thing up, even just into a gymbag for a short trip to work, I find when I remove it that a large amount of the oil has leaked out through the cap and soaked the area around the container.</li>
            <li> I had initially postponed buying my next set of oils (essentials and a carrier) purely because of the price per ounce, but upon ordering this and using it regularly for two weeks already, I can see that it is going to last me a while.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have to constantly wash your hands because you&#x27;re in the medical field or something similar, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you have to constantly wash your hands because you&#x27;re in the medical field or something similar, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> It makes his hair seem really weighed down if I use a little more, but if I use less, it doesn&#x27;t help to manage the curls</li>
            <li> I recently came across this oil on my search for an all natural facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Although it does feel weird at first, I believe it&#x27;s a better alternative than other drugstore removers which contain harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely helps flare ups of dyshydrosis to stop getting any worse and start to heal, I don&#x27;t know if it actively acts as an inflammatory or it just protects the skin from irritation, whatever the case it actually helps and allows me to use the prescription cream less frequently (which is a great thing).  </li>
            <li> Seems to be exactly the same as previously purchased jojoba oil from Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> for the packaging, I was happy the inside was sealed but disappointed it came in a plastic bottle.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about jojoba oil but shouldn&#x27;t this be in a dark bottle?</li>
            <li> I actually went to Whole Foods the other day &amp; saw that they sold it there</li>
            <li> because, its already long so i figured to let it grow naturally</li>
            <li> Please note that when reading other reviews from this and other products, that sometimes people get bottles of oil that have gone rancid, so make sure when you get it that it has a pleasant nutty odor and doesn&#x27;t stink really bad!  </li>

            <li> This 100% pure jojoba oil is much better than others, in the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smells.</li>
            <li> This particular brand appears to be lighter than other brands I have tried which is a benefit when using it on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this to cleanse my face for a few weeks and have seen amazing results, less breakouts, moisturized skin, and less redness.</li>

            <li> Out of the oils I&#x27;ve tried so far: coconut &amp; castor oil (not very much</li>
            <li> I find this oil light enough to use daily on both face and body and also, it works to mix with other castor (which is thick) as a weekly oil-and-steam, deep-clean facial.</li>
            <li> But the major difference, I have not had one single breakout of cystic acne since.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and costs the same as any other specified eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is small, which was expected since it is only 4 ounces, but it doesn&#x27;t take more than a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and can become greasy if too much is applied, so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> every other day (Lubriderm Sensitive) bc</li>
            <li> When I first got this small bottle in the mail, i assumed it wouldn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> , I add it to my body lotion after showering for the same effect, I use it with my conditioner after washing my hair to soften it &amp; after i flat iron my hair its silkier but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Acne products have always dried out my skin and no matter how much moisturizer I put on, it gets flaky and dry mid-day.  </li>
            <li> I promised myself that when my previous chemical-laced bottle of facial moisturizer ran out I would replace it with an all natural product.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL AS IT IS A THIN LIQUID AND CAN SPILL EASILY.</li>
            <li> Be mindful not to use to much or you will end up with an oil slick.</li>
            <li> There is enough oil in this bottle to moisturize my stretched ear lobes for years.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a lot of difference in my nails, but I haven&#x27;t had any break since I got it.</li>
            <li> My hair is long enough to reach my chest, and all I need is about 7-8 drops of</li>
            <li> Pros: Lasts a LONG time if you only use it for the face and hair.</li>
            <li> I would definitely consider buying this again (although it will be a long time before I run out).a lot of that</li>
            <li> I would definitely consider buying this again (although it will be a long time before I run out).</li>
            <li> I had flakes and dry, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It is related to dry skin</li>
            <li> Its light and keeps my face moisturized... at least for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have used this product every single day for the last eight years, but noticed a strange fragrance...</li>
            <li> Does not weigh my fine thin hair down.</li>
            <li> Like I was yanking my hair all night or put some kind of bad chemcial on it.</li>
            <li> but I would try this if you&#x27;ve had issues as long as I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave in the direction of hair growth and never against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this was long and thorough</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have stretched ear lobes that I massage every day with this</li>
            <li> Maybe wet hair is a different story?</li>
            <li> I would have to agree with Aaron Barse, I bought this oil to massage my stretched ears</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> 1 bottles lasts a LONG time</li>
            <li> It has left my skin so soft and with very few impurities.</li>
            <li> , I deep condition with this weekly, and i STILL have half of the bottle left.  </li>
            <li> It provides well balanced moisture but also lacks all of the chemicals that other moisturizers have that actually harm your face and can make your face dryer in the long run.  </li>
            <li> and I get hormonal related blemishes and this product does not clog my pores and cause pimples like some other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use shampoo/conditioner, I simply put this and left it in along with maybe a little water to have damp hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, I have very long, waist-length hair and my ends can get really dry because the oils from my scalp are just not reaching or hydrating the ends.</li>
            <li> I used to have really dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My dry scalp is gone now.</li>
            <li> I never get flakiness anymore, even when I have used this with acne medications that normally dry me out.</li>
            <li> I use it on my body after a shower, after dry brushing, and on my face at night.</li>
            <li> Bought for dry skin caused by acne treatments.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issue with build up or oiliness unless I apply it to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> and when I don&#x27;t wear it, my skin feels dry.  </li>
            <li> : Does not heal or cure dry skin.</li>
            <li> This may be a no-brainer, but if you&#x27;re putting oil on your skin to moisturize your dry skin then this is not the brand for you.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this product to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> But my hair is dry and frizzy because it&#x27;s dyed, and that&#x27;s what I wanted help</li>
            <li> I then let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li> I get dry scalp in the winter and needed something to help moisturize it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit greasy on my face and in general and a little goes a longggggg way.</li>
            <li> My face would dry out EVERY single time I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> and it has a natural sheen, is softer, and no more beard dandruff.</li>
            <li> With other moisturizers my cheeks tends to get little dry white patches, especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Man oh Man, a little goes such a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it every day as a moisturizer and it balances my skin so that it actually is less oily later in the day.</li>
            <li> And it costs about half the price here on Amazon than it did in the local shop.  </li>
            <li> a long time user of Desert Essence products I&#x27;m hopeful that the next few production lots get cleaned up and the purity of the product returns.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t help with my dry scalp as expected.</li>
            <li> and I have used a few drops mixed in with my conditioner when my hair is feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is that others have had with it smelling bad or sketchy product bottles, but the one I received came in the standard retail bottle and has just a faint odor similar to baby oil (though this oil does not require the pressing of innocent babies for their oh so useful oils..).</li>
            <li> The one thing that bugged me not about this particular product, but even in general it&#x27;s an expensive oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days now</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t absorb oil unless the hair is wet.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much difference between brands of jojoba, but I found the quality to be as expected.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drop of this jojoba oil in my facial moisturizer morning and night.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s still wet, I comb a hair treatment product through it.  </li>
            <li> The product came soon than expected.</li>
            <li> If your a man with thick coarse facial hair, razor burn/ingrown neck hair issues, and have to shave every day because of your job than you NEED to try this oil.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the flip-top lid broke the very first time I opened it, rendering jt useless.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I&#x27;ve used this all summer to soothe and repair dryness.  </li>
            <li> A bit pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as an eye make up remover and have found that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> After switching to this jojoba oil my skin no longer feels dry and tight.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an odor and blends well with my other moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Other than that one zit</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Just a few drops go a long way</li>
            <li> It also does not smell like any of the other jojoba oil I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, but jojoba oil moisturizes without breaking me out.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I use a small amount in my bath salt blend and there is definitely an oily film on my skin and in my tub after bathing.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it to other</li>
            <li> Anyway, you can also use it on your skin, i.e. face and other body areas.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, not sure if it will do the same for you</li>
            <li> You only need a small drop.</li>
            <li> Works as well as olive oil yet without the extreme greasiness-</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t love it. :(</li>
            <li> I have also used it when I made other lotions and body butters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about its use for (European) hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> some of the other sellers use and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other products to make a hair souffle.  </li>
            <li> I think the way you use this product, and in combination with what other products, is going to make a difference in the results you see.  </li>
            <li> Just the other day my co-worker complimented my skin.</li>
            <li> I compared pictures and the color seems on par with other bottles.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s considerably less expensive than the Sedu product, and that might lead to me choosing this over the Sedu (eventually -- I have the 4 ounce bottle of this and it is enough to last for a very long time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so if you&#x27;re afraid it&#x27;s a small bottle, you&#x27;ll be surprised how long it will last you.</li>
            <li> small bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t transport well.</li>
            <li> (have also been trying different conditioners lately).  </li>
            <li> The only thing is you have to re-apply often to keep moisturized, which can be seen as a negative.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel too weighted down or greasy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily and weighed down.</li>
            <li> My skin is excessively post-menopausal *dry</li>
            <li> drawback is it has a slight smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for almost half a year.</li>
            <li> my skin became less and less oily.</li>
            <li> It looked slightly marbled, but it was all hardened.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the seal is just not quite as tight as it should be.</li>
            <li> Takes little to accomplish a lot as a skin softener.  </li>
            <li> I EVEN PUT A LITTLE IN MY SHAMPOO BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that Desert Essence can investigate this issue a little deeper.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it at the health food store but since I was already placing an online order for other products, I decided to add a bottle of jojoba too.</li>
            <li> It is a little thicker than the organic one, because of this it will take longer to absorb into skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little apprehensive when I opened the bottle.  </li>
            <li> For every other use, however, this stuff rocks!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also trying to mix a few drops of jojoba oil with my shampoo</li>
            <li> I had to go through the trouble of boxing it and returning it.</li>
            <li> I started putting a few drops of this oil on my scalp once a week with a q tip before bed.</li>
            <li> A few drops of this in my beard every morning</li>
            <li> I PUT THIS ON MY HAIR AFTER I BLOW DRIED IT</li>
            <li> is I rub a thin layer all over my hands and then let it soak in for 10 to 15 minutes and then blot off any extra with a tissue paper or napkin.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my conditioner too.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs into the skin within a few minutes..15 or so.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops n a cloth</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my hands, rub them together, and apply to the ends of damp hair.  </li>
            <li> A few drops of this on your beard after showering and towel drying your beard will stop your skin from itching or flaking.  </li>
            <li> Used it once and now use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and have already noticed some changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> I also apply this to my face  after using my Fenugreek mask I learned from FarahDhukai on youtube and my  Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing, 1 Pound.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops is all it takes.</li>
            <li> I have use this product everyday since I got it from the mail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I will use it year round.</li>
            <li> After setting for a few minutes, it was like butter.)  </li>
            <li> Lightweight and thin, I&#x27;d recommend it for face only, though.</li>
            <li> I used plain jojoba on the rest of my body and I like that as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gud but little pricey as bottle is small</li>
            <li> I also use it as a moisturizer on my face for extra oomph during dry, cold winter weather.  </li>
            <li> It smells pretty badly and doesn&#x27;t feel like</li>
            <li> It has a very slight nutty scent which I like a lot, but once it soaks in there&#x27;s no more smell.  </li>
            <li> I tested it for myself and my face is less shiny than usual!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it just the bottle I received but it leaks.  </li>
            <li> I am not entirely sure how to use it for that, so that&#x27;s probably my fault.</li>
            <li> I have been using Desert Essence Jojoba for a couple months now and usually order from a chain drug store, but this time I decided to get it through amazon for the two day shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off get a small shower mirror and shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> so I usually use  Cantu Shea Butter Leave in Condintioning Hair</li>
            <li> And of course, you can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price (as per usual).</li>
            <li> I apply a small amout, two to three drops, to my face at night after washing massaging into my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I do my usual dermalogica face routine and use a couple of drops on my face before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I use oil everyday for EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> but it does work because my skin went from excessive oil to maintainable.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, I&#x27;m not sure if this is truly all jojoba or not.  </li>
            <li> 100% jojoba oil usually feels on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Product sold to me was tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This particular brand was recommend personally to me so bad to try it out.</li>
            <li> There is a faint odor that is reminiscent of a subtle flower smell, but nothing overpowering.</li>
            <li> If you have Dyshidrosis, like I do, then you know that it is hard to find skin products that help the situation and don&#x27;t irritate your condition.  </li>
            <li> Either Id break out, Id have a rash flare up or they made my skin look terribly dull.</li>
            <li> so it is hard for me to find a moisturizer that won&#x27;t cause a break out, but have had no problems with this oil.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a couple weeks and developed really bad acne on my forehead, then I started putting it on my forehead every night for a week again and the acne is shrinking.</li>
            <li> (at least I think it does lol).I like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned numerous bottles of this (I like the oil), but the container design makes it incredibly inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Ive added a cpl drops it to a face cream that was too thick and clogging my pores to dilute it</li>
            <li> I tried a small amount on my dry hair and it immediately looked dirty.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it makes the product unusable due to smell and irritation.</li>
            <li> And coconut oil usually made my cystic acne worse, so</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been dry once this winter since using it (and it usually gets bad in the winter).</li>
            <li> I have been using expensive anti-aging products for over a year now and they haven&#x27;t made the difference this little miracle has already made.</li>
            <li> I was always trying different moisturizers and finding that my skin had bad reactions to them.</li>
            <li> For being an oil, it&#x27;s surprisingly not oily.</li>
            <li> The cap was broken.</li>
            <li> Poor kid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Proactiv just made everything a lot worse.</li>
            <li> I never had bad trouble</li>
            <li> Leave it on all day, and you don&#x27;t feel crap unlike the other stuff where you feel it on your face</li>
            <li> I aslo use it to condition my cuticles (instead of expensive cuticle oil &amp; I</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use it because putting oil on my face just seemed crazy to me.</li>
            <li> how can a oil help with oily skin so desperate to find something I ordered it and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to post a picture of the oil cold.  </li>
            <li> This item jojoba has a unpleasant sent to it as well.</li>
            <li> Smells really bad, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to smell like that, but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> its a Bad Product/Oil,</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Just... not what I wanted it for. :(</li>
            <li> and you hate it.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel bad wiping my eyes with it!</li>
            <li> Another difference is that Trader Joe&#x27;s jojoba bottle has a seal to retard oxidation and Desert Essence doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was highly disappointed by it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I had a terrible case of keratosis pilaris (bumpy skin on arms and thighs) after having each of my kids.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Enjoying this!! will be ordering from this vendor again</li>
            <li> I use this for my body and ears when stretching and I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome multi-purpose beauty product that everyone should have!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great all around essential oil.</li>
            <li> Great for eye makeup remover</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My mom used to get this all the time.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> This brand of jojoba oil is great.  It doesn&#x27;t have an odor and blends well with my other moisturizer.  My skin feels so soft when I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this jojoba oil as a moisturizer and I love how it feels on my skin.  It&#x27;s especially nice around my eyes.  It has no odor and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  My make-up goes on smoother after I&#x27;ve moisturized with this oil. I&#x27;m also trying to mix a few drops of jojoba oil with my shampoo everytime I wash my hair in hopes it will help my mild dandruff.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s cured it, but it&#x27;s maybe helped some.      Overall, this product is a good moisturizer, especially during these dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I have bought this Jojoba Oil, organic or pure for multiple times for myself and my friends. It is a great product. I pretty much use it anywhere on my skin, scalp and hair any time I want. I have one in my office and one at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no scent, and is not greasy, I always feel great after I apply them on my full body right after I got out shower or use it on my hands, face and neck in my office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very practical and useful product and I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Oh I love this oil!! I have struggled with cystic acne for 10+ years and this oil has helped me, so I have not had one since using this product, about 3 months ago. I use it to take off my make up, a skin moisturizer, face wash, and in my homemade body butter. It actually wears well under my make up! There is no smell  like coconut oil. And coconut oil usually made my cystic acne worse, so I can&#x27;t use it on my face. I am so, so happy I found this product!</li>
            <li> Very nice oil, I put pure lavender oil in it for fragrance and use it on my body. It does not leave a greasy feeling and is absorbed by the skin very quickly. Very reliable merchant, on time.</li>
            <li> The cap was broken. please make sure the product is intact, before sending it out. I had to go through the trouble of boxing it and returning it. i was looking forward to trying this out.</li>
            <li> I used to have really dry scalp. I started putting a few drops of this oil on my scalp once a week with a q tip before bed. My dry scalp is gone now. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Husband uses this product and loves it.</li>
            <li> Use this for my beard. I had flakes and dry, coarse hair. A few drops of this in my beard every morning and it has a natural sheen, is softer, and no more beard dandruff. I love it.</li>
            <li> Very good.  Takes little to accomplish a lot as a skin softener.  Quit putting it in my hair when I noticed my hair falling out.  Is there a connection?</li>
            <li> I found this when I was searching for just the right natural pre-wedding skin care routine last year. Of course, I wanted my skin to be healthy and glowing on my wedding day so I did lots of research to find my ideal routine. After some trial and error, I came up with the following products:    1) Dr. Woods Pure Black Soap - use to wash face twice daily  2) Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel - use as toner twice daily  3) Burts Bees Radiance Day Lotion with SPF 15 - use in the a.m.  4) Desert Essence 100% Natural Jojoba Oil - use as moisturizer before bed  5) St. Ives Apricot Scrub Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control - use to gently exfoliate twice a week  6) Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask - use after exfoliating once a week in acne-prone areas only    This combination of products really has given me the best skin of my life. I did get a zit on the day before my wedding, but that was from stress and I don&#x27;t believe that any products I used could have avoided that. It wasn&#x27;t huge though so I easily covered it with makeup. Other than that one zit though, my skin looked very nice. Also, after the wedding, I started skimping on my routine and did begin breaking out much more often and lost that healthy glow. Once I started back up with religiously following my routine, my skin is very smooth and nice again.    I love that this oil is 100% natural and is so similar to the skin&#x27;s natural oils (skin&#x27;s built-in moisturizer!). I never get flakiness anymore, even when I have used this with acne medications that normally dry me out. Also, my skin now stays soft and smooth through the winter!</li>
            <li> this was perfect. great price fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I got this because my skin is so sensitive to everything but i found this item doesnt do anything for me. I use my orange ginger lotion from the body shop that works better for me. This item jojoba has a unpleasant sent to it as well.</li>
            <li> Item arrived fast and in good condition without any leakage.  This is a really light oil and it does absorb into the skin well without leaving a greasy residue.  When I put it on my face it made it soft and no shine later in the day like you would think.  I&#x27;ve used it for five days now and it&#x27;s purging my skin but the blemishes are healing much faster than normal and I am not having to pop the pimples because they are going down on their own.  I did mix a soulution of 1/10 tea tree oil/jojoba oil though.  This is my first time doing this and my skin is responding well to it so far.  I used plain jojoba on the rest of my body and I like that as well.</li>
            <li> As far as the oil, it&#x27;s fine.  I&#x27;m not sure if it just the bottle I received but it leaks.  The plastic cap is pushed onto the bottle, it is not screwed on and there is no gasket.</li>
            <li> I have been using jojoba oil to wash my face with instead of otc face washes and my face has never been happier! It does great at removing waterproof mascaras as well. A little goes a long way with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much! I was very impressed with this oil, and have run out but will definitely be ordering more soon. Obviously, I used this oil every single day, and it made my skin so silky smooth.  That is the honest to G-D truth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after I read several articles touting the multiple uses of Jojoba oil. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it worked very quickly to clear up my complexion and also my young daughter&#x27;s exzema. Just a few drops go a long way and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I make my own skin and body care products, and use this oil for a couple of the products. One of my favorites is to use this for the oil cleansing method (face cleanser)  I love this jojoba oil!</li>
            <li> I PUT THIS ON MY HAIR AFTER I BLOW DRIED IT AND OMG, MY HAIR WAS NOTICEABLE SOFT AND I MADE IT EVEN SOFTER BY RUNNING THE BLOW DRYER THROUGH MY HAIR AGAIN. I WILL DEFINITELY PURCHASE THIS AGAIN, IT DOES NOT HAVE A SMELL TO IT. I JUST WISH IT CAME IN A LARGER SIZE. I EVEN PUT A LITTLE IN MY SHAMPOO BOTTLE. THIS STUFF IS GREAT.</li>
            <li> I love this oil you can use it for basically everything. I use it for my skin and hair and it leaves my skin looking shiny and soft. I also use it when I streatch my ears up and it works for that as well :3</li>
            <li> If you have Dyshidrosis, like I do, then you know that it is hard to find skin products that help the situation and don&#x27;t irritate your condition.  Even lotions labeled &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; still irritate my fingers, but this oil does not.  Because of my Dyshidrosis, I use prescription anti-inflammatory steroid creams to combat flare ups, but this leaves your skin thinner and prone to cracking.  I have had one particular crack in the crease of my index finger that has been an open wound that refuses to heal for a solid year or more; after using this product every day for a week, the crack that refused to heal has actually healed!  This stuff definitely helps flare ups of dyshydrosis to stop getting any worse and start to heal, I don&#x27;t know if it actively acts as an inflammatory or it just protects the skin from irritation, whatever the case it actually helps and allows me to use the prescription cream less frequently (which is a great thing).  The way i use this product is I rub a thin layer all over my hands and then let it soak in for 10 to 15 minutes and then blot off any extra with a tissue paper or napkin.  After you let it soak in and blot off any extra, your hands just feel like they naturally would if you had your natural oils intact, it&#x27;s not too greasy.  This oil is especially great to use after you have had to wash your hands frequently, it will restore the flexibility of your skin and protect it from drying out any further or cracking.  Because of my allergies I am very sensitive to fragrances; this oil has a slight nutty odor which doesn&#x27;t bother my sinuses, and I actually find it kind of pleasant smelling.  I don&#x27;t bother to write reviews unless i&#x27;m really happy with a product, or really unhappy, but in this case I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.  However, I do agree that the bottle is a little hard to use without making a mess, but I&#x27;m just going to buy a reusable glass bottle with a built in eye dropper and enjoy the savings on future purchases due to the cheap bottle;  The bottle is not really a big deal, all in all the product is great.  Please note that when reading other reviews from this and other products, that sometimes people get bottles of oil that have gone rancid, so make sure when you get it that it has a pleasant nutty odor and doesn&#x27;t stink really bad!  Also, if you have to constantly wash your hands because you&#x27;re in the medical field or something similar, I highly recommend this product.  After using this for a while now I&#x27;ve also realized that this works amazingly well as a topical anti itch remedy as well.  I can go from skin that feels like it&#x27;s on fire from itching to calm and cool in less than a minute. Great stuff.purchases due to the cheap bottle;  The bottle is not really a big deal, all in all the product is great.

            <li> I use it as a make up remover before my face wash and it is so amazing. My face is smooth, I stopped breaking out and it soothes my fry skin. Will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Just as it says it is!</li>
            <li> I have used this product every single day for the last eight years, but noticed a strange fragrance... more like an odor on my last two bottles.  After expressing my concern directly with Desert Essence and asking whether anything in their processing of the oil had changed.  They responded that it had.  What they describe as a nutty fragrance is what I would describe as the same rancid odor that rancid sunflower seeds emit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to purchase Trader Joe&#x27;s jojoba oil and there was no rancid odor.  Another difference is that Trader Joe&#x27;s jojoba bottle has a seal to retard oxidation and Desert Essence doesn&#x27;t.  I am hoping that Desert Essence can investigate this issue a little deeper.</li>
            <li> After seeing the same exact product in a retail store for more than double the price on Amazon.com, I ordered and have been very pleased with the product.  There is enough oil in this bottle to moisturize my stretched ear lobes for years.  I bought the product to keep my lobes in good shape while stretching my lobes for large ear piercings.  This has been fantastic and help me when inserting tapers.  No smell, no nasty residue, no problems!</li>
            <li> I use this a s a make-up remover and it&#x27;s incredible! I have normal skin and I get hormonal related blemishes and this product does not clog my pores and cause pimples like some other products I have used. I love that it&#x27;s all natural and actually good for my skin, encouraging healthy skin instead of drying and causing wrinkles like other make-up removing products on the market.</li>
            <li> I love this brand for jojoba oil, and the 4-oz bottles are a good size. Great price!</li>
            <li> This is a good product delivered on time and in good condition for a reasonable price. I find this oil light enough to use daily on both face and body and also, it works to mix with other castor (which is thick) as a weekly oil-and-steam, deep-clean facial. It has no smell or dyes - totally natural and does not cause pore clogging or breakout.</li>
            <li> my wife likes it. that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Cleared up may face in no time.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Bought it multiple times. Use it for massages and as a carrier oil to mix with essential oils. It&#x27;s has a perfect mild scent and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy at all but smooth &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> Really like product. Just wish was it was in glass bottle instead of plastic.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is an essential part of my skincare regimen. I use it on my body after a shower, after dry brushing, and on my face at night. It is also great for re-hydrating my hair after sun exposure or swimming. I love the Desert Essence brand in general, and its Jojoba oil is of excellent quality and value.</li>
            <li> OK price. Much cheaper options out there but the oil itself is s great product for helping my hands and other body parts stay moisturized.</li>
            <li> Great product. Goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way. Absorbs into skin quickly with no greasy residue. Makes skin looks years younger immediately. I follow with Shea Butter to lock in the effect of the oil. Love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it as a make up remover.  I use a drop of it mixed in with my morning application of Oil of Olay lotion when my face get sunburned and I have used a few drops mixed in with my conditioner when my hair is feeling dry.  I think it is working as I had hoped.  Winter will be the true test of how well this works though when I try it on my dry eczema hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This small bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Bought for dry skin caused by acne treatments. Acne products have always dried out my skin and no matter how much moisturizer I put on, it gets flaky and dry mid-day.  Now I mix my daily moisturizer with Jojoba oil and I never get flaky (even on Accutane!).  I put more on at night because too much during the day will leave the skin looking a tad oily.  I will never be without this again!</li>
            <li> I first got jojoba oil to help with my scalp- so far, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with that.I am not entirely sure how to use it for that, so that&#x27;s probably my fault. For every other use, however, this stuff rocks!! It really helps my frizzy split ends, I can put it on in the morning and it won&#x27;t look greasy! My hair looks greasy with pretty much any \\&quot;frizz reducing\\&quot; product so it&#x27;s great. I put a few drops in my conditioner too. But I also love it for my skin. It is the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve used, hands down. I have tried a lot, and most don&#x27;t get all the makeup off or irritate my eyes. This stuff not only gets everything off, it also moisturizes at the same time. And it&#x27;s natural so I don&#x27;t feel bad wiping my eyes with it! It&#x27;s also a great moisturizer for my face. My skin hasn&#x27;t been dry once this winter since using it (and it usually gets bad in the winter). My skin is usually oily and acne prone, but this doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy and it feels great. Hasn&#x27;t helped much with my acne but I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to. This is my new favorite beauty product because it&#x27;s so versatile, natural, and actually works! Everyone needs a bottle in their medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> I believe I&#x27;ve already reviewed this product, but I have to review it again if so. I love this oil! I stopped using it for a couple weeks and developed really bad acne on my forehead, then I started putting it on my forehead every night for a week again and the acne is shrinking. I have put it on most of my face (except around the eyes) and it&#x27;s definitely helping to clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my skin for a year now and have seen a major difference. I love that it is 100% pure, not too oily, and keeps my skin looking clear. I even used it during pregnancy and avoided getting any stretch marks! I love this product</li>
            <li> When I first got this small bottle in the mail, i assumed it wouldn&#x27;t last long at all. Man oh Man, a little goes such a long way. I use this everyday. I applied some to my hair conditioner and shampoo, I deep condition with this weekly, and i STILL have half of the bottle left.  I&#x27;ve had this for two months now.</li>
            <li> Love this for my homemade face creams. Very light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added a touch of lavender essential oil since its so good for my skin.  This oil absorbs into the skin within a few minutes..15 or so.  No greasy feel after that.  Don&#x27;t get this in your eyes if you&#x27;ve added EO. If you do, use some undiluted oil to calm the irritation.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s the best moisturizer.  Jojoba seems to be the most like our natural skin oil.  Good price and good for you.  Plastic bottle has a flip top lid which makes dispensing easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s.  I use vitamin e oil around my eyes.  Just dot it on..no rub.</li>
            <li> Great oil, wish it wasnt so expensive for just 4oz but its top quality!</li>
            <li> This is the single best makeup remover I have ever used. Just a few drops n a cloth and it takes of pretty much everything. In addition, it is great for essential oil diffusing and general skin care.</li>
            <li> Best oil out there hands down, it absorbs very quickly, if you have oily skin and dry at the same time i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Great ingredient for homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> In addition to arriving quickly and exactly as described, this product is amazing!!!  My piercer recommended a couple drops of jojoba oil to help strengthen some skin around my navel area to prevent my ring from tearing through, but the bottle is so large I figured i&#x27;d see what else I could use it for.  First let me say it smells really good and is a smooth consistency.    Ive added a cpl drops it to a face cream that was too thick and clogging my pores to dilute it and it gives my skin an amazing healthy glow, I add it to my body lotion after showering for the same effect, I use it with my conditioner after washing my hair to soften it &amp; after i flat iron my hair its silkier but not greasy.  I aslo use it to condition my cuticles (instead of expensive cuticle oil &amp; I think it works better.)  I&#x27;m still looking for more uses, and in case you&#x27;re wondering...the piercing is still there so i guess it strengthened the skin. I&#x27;d consider this a beauty must have...now I know why jojoba oil is in most conditioning products &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I bought this product to treat sebum plugs. It got rid of most but I still have some occurring.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it is really amazing moisturizer. I purchased it for a project and ended up using it almost every day.</li>
            <li> Second bottle. Great for ezcema. Does not burn or hurt but softens. Does not cure eczema but helps the symptoms. This bottle leaks when traveling so I put it in another bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Very pure and light. Does not weigh my fine thin hair down.</li>
            <li> I love how it is 100% natural. Jojoba oil is great for the scars on my face and for moisturizing the tight and dry spots on my skin. It is also a wonderful massage oil. Multiple uses, good price, and very natural. It was worth buying.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Safely shipped. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I recently came across this oil on my search for an all natural facial moisturizer. I promised myself that when my previous chemical-laced bottle of facial moisturizer ran out I would replace it with an all natural product. I was very hesitant about putting ANY type of oil on my face. My face produces a lot of oil and shine like a star!! So, I figured &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; would be the LAST thing for me to put on my face....until I came across Jojoba oil. Through my research I discovered that Jojoba oil technically it is not actually an oil, but rather a wax ester. This is important b/c out of all of the compounds in nature, this wax ester is the most similar to human skin oil which is called sebum. When we apply Jojoba to the skin can it &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; our skin into thinking it is producing enough oil, thus balancing oil production. For acne-prone people Jojoba oil is non-comedogenic so you can use it without fear. I tested it for myself and my face is less shiny than usual! At the same time I believe this oil is great for all skin types...not just people with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this oil in my mix of scalp oils for hair growth. I highly recommend this product. My research indicated that this is a great brand. This isn&#x27;t the organic version, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary.</li>
            <li> My pharmacist in Germany suggested that I use this instead of cortison-based creams to stop itchy spots. And it works!!! It also works great as a deodorant, believe it or not.</li>
            <li> Just what I was expecting thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using jojoba oil for years as it&#x27;s wonderful for your skin and does not cause breakouts. I usually buy it at the health food store but since I was already placing an online order for other products, I decided to add a bottle of jojoba too. Jojoba oil is a penetrating oil which means it can penetrate down through the layers of skin and is highly absorbable so if there are any toxins in the oil, they are being absorbed through your skin and into your body so you definitely want to use organic jojoba oil. This is not organic. It also does not smell like any of the other jojoba oil I&#x27;ve used. It has a rancid smell whereas most jojoba has a neutral odor. I would suggest using another brand.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of jojoba oil! I use it at night (mixed with rosehip oil) as a moisturizer and my skin loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I have very long, waist-length hair and my ends can get really dry because the oils from my scalp are just not reaching or hydrating the ends. So, I started putting a few drops of jojoba oil on the ends of my clean, damp hair and it has made a HUGE difference. My ends look healthy and hydrated but not at all oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely keep purchasing my jojoba oil from Desert Essence- it&#x27;s an amazing product for a great value.</li>
            <li> I use Desert Essence Jojoba as part of a bath salt soak and as an oil cleanser for my face. The oil is clear and golden with no scent. I have extremely oily skin, but jojoba oil moisturizes without breaking me out.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I didn&#x27;t care for was the claim on the bottle that said it does not leave things oily. I use a small amount in my bath salt blend and there is definitely an oily film on my skin and in my tub after bathing. I also have oil on my skin after cleaning and rinsing my face with jojoba oil and hot water. This claim does not detract from how pleased I am with this product. I will purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li> Love the product, but the bottle can leak when a little pressure is applied. I put my oil in a different bottle and now have zero problems.</li>
            <li> I wish to apologize for my last review.  I had not recommended this product but that was an error. The review was for a different company.  Your product works very well on frizzy hair and keeps the curl in without having to use  a lot of it.</li>
            <li> It can be used as is or added to shampoo.  I use it both ways.  I have dry hair and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily hair or skin, I suggest you use it in shampoo.</li>
            <li> Using it as a beard oil. It&#x27;s very nice stuff, surprisingly. It actually feels better than the premixed beard oil I was using before. Straight jojoba, works for me.</li>
            <li> The jojoba oil is great for skin. I used it all over my skin including face, and it leaves the skin soft and smooth. I was debating whether or not to get the organic one or the pure jojoba oil from desert essence. I got the 100% pure one(cheaper) and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all. NO heavy smell. Ive stoppped buying lotions and use essential oils instead. Will buy another soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for awhile now and I love it.  It works great on my hair leaving it moisturized but not \\&quot;oily\\&quot;.  After I unwrap my hair in the morning it is soft, shiny, and it feels great.  I also see an improvement on my split ends!</li>
            <li> This is good quality jojoba oil! It makes my otherwise dry damaged hair look great &amp; feel amazingly soft. A little goes a long way :)</li>
            <li> Great oil for adjusting the sebum in skin and hair, used as a pre shampoo treatment.  I like to use it twice a week at night, because it absorbs quickly, and you wake up with smooth skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days now but I can already see a difference. I originally bought it because I read that it was good for strengthening finger nails. My nails are incredible weak so I wanted to try it. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a lot of difference in my nails, but I haven&#x27;t had any break since I got it. I also read that it was good for acne, which I am prone to. I have been putting it on my face every day and night and its made a HUGE difference already. My skin is clearer, incredibly soft and smooth, and it even looks younger. I don&#x27;t see so many of the lines that I&#x27;ve been seeing lately. I have been using expensive anti-aging products for over a year now and they haven&#x27;t made the difference this little miracle has already made. I would recommend purchasing this oil, and I will certainly be back for more myself!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best things if your gauges are giving you trouble. Healed my ear right up, and allowed my earrings to go in no problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my hair and skin.  It has a very slight nutty scent which I like a lot, but once it soaks in there&#x27;s no more smell.  I put a few drops on my hands, rub them together, and apply to the ends of damp hair.  Once my hair dries and the oil has soaked in it makes the ends feel much more hydrated.  Coconut oil seems to sit on my hair and not soak in but this jojoba oil doesn&#x27;t do that.  I also use it as a moisturizer on my face for extra oomph during dry, cold winter weather.  Very pleased with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have also used argan oil.  This works far better and costs much less.  I think it smells terrific too.  I use it daily on my face, hair, or both.  I&#x27;ve had no issue with build up or oiliness unless I apply it to dry hair.  My hair is low porosity so it doesn&#x27;t absorb oil unless the hair is wet.  I can literally use 2 drops, rub it between my palms, and glide it over the surface of my hair like a silicone serum to add shine, but if I use any more than that it won&#x27;t soak in and looks greasy.</li>
            <li> Great oil! Jojoba is just as great as many oils such as coconut, olive oil or almond oil. My favorite oils to use would be olive oil, coconut oil and castor or almond oil</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about jojoba oil but shouldn&#x27;t this be in a dark bottle?</li>
            <li> I am huge fan of Jojoba oil. I have used it in an oil mix for my hair for a quite a while and more recently have begun using it as a face moisturizer, which I LOVE. On my face it is very light. It provides just the right about of moisture without being greasy. With other moisturizers my cheeks tends to get little dry white patches, especially in the winter months. But the jojoba oil keeps my face moisturized throughout the day. This particular brand appears to be lighter than other brands I have tried which is a benefit when using it on your skin.</li>
            <li> I use Desert Essence Jojoba Oil on my face as a moisturizer and makeup remover, also on my hands and feet for extra softness.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews which appear quite positive.  but I have not used the product so I am reserving judgement.  I hope it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> One suggestion i have is for bottle to have a dropper.</li>
            <li> It is so great to fine pure products without junk in them.</li>
            <li> its a fabulous Oil...just what i needed for my DIY projects</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and as described</li>
            <li> I use this for my oily blemish-prone skin and it has really helped improve the quality of my skin. I love it! I use it every day as a moisturizer and it balances my skin so that it actually is less oily later in the day. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scentless and it protects my skin from drying out too much in the winter. Jojoba oil is great, and it doesn&#x27;t leave as much of an oily feeling as does Argan oil. Sometimes I mix it in with a bit of essential oil. It also works as a nice massage oil.</li>
            <li> Using it as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> My face loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love jojoba oil and I have always used this brand. It&#x27;s great and does not make my scalp itch or burn.</li>
            <li> Great for oil cleansing on the face.</li>
            <li> I add this to my beard and hair after every wash, and it has definitely helped soften it and make it easier to manage, removing a lot of the tangle. However, it needs ~ 12 hours to fully soak in, so for morning shower people, it might not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has completely eliminated the dandruff my beard would shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is it has a slight smell.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle and I love this stuff. Its so versatile and well worth the money. Of course I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of jojoba oil and the most affordable. I use a quarter size amount in my hair and it looks nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Amazing oil! Great moisturizer. I use it with essential oils in the bath and it works great! Definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying from this company, however everything came on time and looked exactly like the picture (no spills or anything!). I love Jojoba Oil, as well as Coconut and Castor Oil, for some of my homemade all-natural skin and hair care solutions. I recommend this size (4 oz) for anyone just getting acquainted with using Jojoba!! Love it!</li>
            <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;i will order again&lt;br /&gt;is the best for my hair&lt;br /&gt;the best for my legs&lt;br /&gt;perfect&lt;br /&gt;very good</li>
            <li> My package came right on time &amp; it was in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil for my face, i put it on at night &amp; in the morning as a moisturizer. You can tell it really absorbs instead of sit on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really awesome, will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This oil does a good job of keeping split ends away and fly-away strands in place.  I put a squirt in my hand and apply after washing my hair.  It give hair a good sheen, too.</li>
            <li> Been using Jojoba oil for years. Desert Essence does not disappoint! Jojoba is the only moisturizer that does NOT break me out and that is saying a lot since I have VERY sensitive skin. I love that it prevents wrinkles and keeps my skin looking dewy and fresh. I apply at night and in the mornings.</li>
            <li> great product very moisturizing</li>
            <li> this is my 3rd time purchasing it. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Desert Essence Jojoba for a couple months now and usually order from a chain drug store, but this time I decided to get it through amazon for the two day shipping. The product I received is exactly like the Desert Essence I have purchased elsewhere. I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is that others have had with it smelling bad or sketchy product bottles, but the one I received came in the standard retail bottle and has just a faint odor similar to baby oil (though this oil does not require the pressing of innocent babies for their oh so useful oils..). As for the product effectiveness it is great. it allows me to keep just the right amount of oil in my hair and beard so that they lay nice and frizz free. Be mindful not to use to much or you will end up with an oil slick. Cheers.</li>
            <li> If your a man with thick coarse facial hair, razor burn/ingrown neck hair issues, and have to shave every day because of your job than you NEED to try this oil. I have been searching for something to stop ingrown hairs on my neck for years now and I finally found jojoba oil. This stuff is like magic! My method for shaving is now as follows, everyone is different but I would try this if you&#x27;ve had issues as long as I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off get a small shower mirror and shave in the shower. Also get a DE safety razor with Feather blades and A good shaving lather and badger brush. Recommend Pacific Shaving companies all natural shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1. At the end of your HOT shower run hot water on your face for a good minute while using a toothbrush to brush the hairs in the opposite direction of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2. Apply a nice amount of this magical JoJoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 3. Lather up your shaving cream over the oil on your face with the brush until it is nice and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 4. Shave over every area of your face in short very gentle strokes almost applying no pressure at all. Only pass over each area once to get the cream off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 5. Repeat step 2-4 if you have to. Do not repeat step 2-4 more than once! No need to pass over your face more than twice with the blade. This will reduce the chance of getting ingrown hairs and razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 6. Rinse off your face COMPLETELY with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 7. Last but not least. Pat your face dry and apply another layer of the magical JoJoba oil. It will keep your face moisturized and clean for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only shave over your razor burn/ingrown hair prone areas once which should be easy considering how close the jojoba will get your shave on its first pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT CLEANSE YOUR FACE WITH FACE WASH BEFORE or AFTER SHAVING. This will keep the natural oils on your face and the magical jojoba. If you have acne and need to use face wash than use those products at night or the opposite time of day that you shave. I recommend trying to ditch the face wash for a week or 2 first and see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not touch your face during the day and wash your hands frequently to keep them clean, just in case you do accidentally touch your face. Also make sure you wash or use hand sanitizer after you blow your nose! The bacteria in your mouth and nose will cause problems on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use only products with natural ingredients on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave in the direction of hair growth and never against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this was long and thorough but I swear I have finally found the solution to ingrown hairs and razor burn with this Jojoba Oil!</li>
            <li> He has guages and uses this to soften the ears and make the holes larger (or however that goes) and he said he loves it.  Not to mention I couldnt find it anywhere at a local store.</li>
            <li> Works pretty great for what i use it for</li>
            <li> This particular brand was recommend personally to me so bad to try it out. I love the fact that you only need a very small amount to moisturize. It&#x27;s a very high quality brand and would recommend it myself to anyone</li>
            <li> Quick and the quality is great, I use this oil on my body skin and small amount on my hair during the dry months. Works wonders .</li>
            <li> I just ran out of this but it works good on my skin and helps my eye area (at least I think it does lol).I like it.</li>
            <li> I did research on the best products for skin care under a beard, and this came up over and over as a main ingredient.  A few drops of this on your beard after showering and towel drying your beard will stop your skin from itching or flaking.  My boyfriend uses it and hasn&#x27;t had either issue since using it.</li>
            <li> Hope this is some kind of glitch, but I got the entirely wrong product and so far Amazon website won&#x27;t let me get through for a replacement.  Will update if this ends well!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other oils and this one is by far the best safe and gentle enough for newborns dry skin</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and product is same as a description. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, good product</li>
            <li> This product arrived in perfect shape, just as listed on the day promised.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much difference between brands of jojoba, but I found the quality to be as expected. Good price for the product you get.</li>
            <li> Love this Oil. Used it once and now use it everyday. No sticky residue and no irritation. A little bit goes a long way so if you&#x27;re afraid it&#x27;s a small bottle, you&#x27;ll be surprised how long it will last you. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this throughout my pregnancy to easy my itchy belly.  I&#x27;m now 39 weeks along and can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  No, it wont override heredity to prevent stretch marks.  But, it absorbs quickly, gets rid of the itchiness, leaves skin soft with no greasy residue, and lasts all day.  For being an oil, it&#x27;s surprisingly not oily. And it costs about half the price here on Amazon than it did in the local shop.  My only complaint is that the flip-top lid broke the very first time I opened it, rendering jt useless.  Thankfully, I still had an old bottle with the more substantial push top lid that I was able to replace it with.</li>
            <li> This 100% pure jojoba oil is much better than others, in the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smells. There is a faint odor that is reminiscent of a subtle flower smell, but nothing overpowering. This works great as an ingredient (or standalone) lotion as well as for other homemade products like hair pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product with fast shipping: 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This amount of oil will last you for a while. It&#x27;s got a tiny dropper on top so it doesn&#x27;t pour out too quickly.</li>
            <li> Even though I just got this product a week ago I&#x27;m confident that it&#x27;s a good product and it shipped really quickly. I&#x27;ve heard that the organic version has a funny smell that&#x27;s why I opted for this one. I use it for my hair and my face it&#x27;s a bit greasy on my face and in general and a little goes a longggggg way.</li>
            <li> My skin is excessively post-menopausal *dry*, and I use this before applying foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders!</li>
            <li> I like this. I plan on using it everywhere and compare&lt;br /&gt;it to other oils.&lt;br /&gt;When I rubbed it on my toes, I liked the way it was&lt;br /&gt;quickly absorbed into the skin. Later my toes became&lt;br /&gt;itchy. So be aware that it may cause a reaction. I am&lt;br /&gt;not allergic to anything. I don&#x27;t know the analysis of this&lt;br /&gt;and I don&#x27;t care because I have unlimited uses that I&lt;br /&gt;have not tried yet. Like my tools, pruning shears, stain&lt;br /&gt;removal, cooking, etc.</li>
            <li> I was having an issue with a more than normal oily nose as well as little white heads in the corners. I did research about what you could use to stop this, and I found a couple times Jojba oil recommended by females. (I assume females know a lot about skincare, as they do care more.)  I have been putting this soley on my nose after using a somewhat strong facial cleanser (Neutrogena Deep clean), and I have had barely any white heads since I started applying this.  One or two drops is all you need..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works really well. Great price. Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> The same product on Amazon was priced cheaper than what the retail store had it listed for, so it was good buy.  I love Jojoba oil for my natural hair becasue it is not too greasy and it obsorbs quickly.  I wish Desert Essence sold it in a bigger bottle.  Maybe they do but I just have not come across it yet.  Anyway, you can also use it on your skin, i.e. face and other body areas.  If you have not tried it, I recommend that you do.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this will work for you but it has done wonders for me.  My skin is clearer, softer, and feel so much better.  I use it with scented oil and love the results.  Like I said, not sure if it will do the same for you but it worked for me!</li>
            <li> I use jojoba as a natural moisturizer, and Dessert Essence does not disappoint. It&#x27;s a good size, but a little too large for TSA&#x27;s liking.</li>
            <li> I use jojoba as a natural moisturizer, and Dessert Essence does not disappoint. It&#x27;s a good size, but a little too large for TSA&#x27;s liking.</li>
            <li> I use after shower/dry skin brushing and it leaves my skin feeling sooo smoooooth...it&#x27;s not very oily either which is super nice, and I can definitely see the change in my skin, much softer than before..only reason I am not giving a 5 star is that I feel it was a bit over priced for such a small quantity...if I could just get more for my money I&#x27;d be much happier.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and likes this oil.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is Bigger than I thought, I use it on  my legs, feet and hands.</li>
            <li> I use this XXXX on everything ... hair, face, body! It is a GREAT moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I had a terrible case of keratosis pilaris (bumpy skin on arms and thighs) after having each of my kids. It is related to dry skin and I guess hormones in my case. I put this on my arms and legs every time I shower. I follow up with lotion on top every other day (Lubriderm Sensitive) bc it is not enough to keep me hydrated alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used as a moisturizer on a daily basis at night. I add my anti-aging products on top. I have zero acne. I never had bad trouble but now I have none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, dry hair and used Moroccan Oil that makes it look great. Jojoba oil is not enough for my hair, but may work for others. I have put in my toddlers curls when they seemed dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MIRACLE OIL...seriously.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a week ago. The 4oz bottle. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and have already noticed some changes in my skin. The acne on my face has disappeared. I&#x27;ve even noticed that some of the acne scars I had on my face have faded! This product is great!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my oil cleaning regime. Seems to be exactly the same as previously purchased jojoba oil from Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Happy with product.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair which is transitioning back to natural I didn&#x27;t cut my hair though because, its already long so i figured to let it grow naturally and this really helps my dry hair. I also apply this to my face  after using my Fenugreek mask I learned from FarahDhukai on youtube and my  Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing, 1 Pound. It makes my skin look healthy, soft, smooth and glowy so I like it. As for my hair it definitely moisturizes but it doesn&#x27;t define my waves/curls so I usually use  Cantu Shea Butter Leave in Condintioning Hair Cream or Herbal Essence Hello Hydration Conditioner which I buy at walgreens. The conditioner is $3.79+tax and the Leave in Conditioning hair cream is 4.79+tax. These both work incredible for defining hair along with Argan Oil Curl Cream which you can purchase at Sally&#x27;s for $4.25. Bottom line I reccomend Jojoba Oil it works like a charm. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as a carrier oil for essential oils and it works perfectly for that. It does not have a noticeable scent of its own so it does not distract from the scent of the essential oil.</li>
            <li> Very good softens my hair very well</li>
            <li> Pure jojoba oil is excellent. Nice container. Excellent for use in combination with other emollients. Would definitely purchase again from the source</li>
            <li> This feels very nice on my skin. Not heavy or greasy at all and it absorbs quickly and is odorless. I had been using coconut oil and for some reason it started drying out my skin, and in the winter that is not what I want happening. After switching to this jojoba oil my skin no longer feels dry and tight. Just a few drops is all it takes. The bottle is small, which was expected since it is only 4 ounces, but it doesn&#x27;t take more than a few drops at a time. Will buy more if I can catch this on sale somewhere or when I start to run low.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drop of this jojoba oil in my facial moisturizer morning and night. What a difference! It has reduced my oil production and smoothed my skin a considerable amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Jojoba oil is perfect for the face, as it is meant to be of similar pH (or something) to the face&#x27;s natural oils. It slides on smoothly and absorbs almost immediately - not nearly as heavy as coconut oil and no need to blot it off with a towel afterward. I have no issues with breakouts and my skin looks so much fresher when I&#x27;m using it regularly. And of course, you can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price (as per usual).</li>
            <li> wonderful. My mom uses this oil and I tried some on my baby&#x27;s skin as well. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Kept my skin soft, moisturizer, and acne free :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gud but little pricey as bottle is small</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It&#x27;s great alone or mixed with other oils.</li>
            <li> I received this from my sister, as a gift,  about 6 months ago. I was hesitant to use it because putting oil on my face just seemed crazy to me. I  am 40 something with fine lines, dull complexion and have really struggled with cystic acne. After reading reviews for this particular brand and product, I went for it. I saw an improvement in my skin almost immediately. I had a healthy glow, face seemed tighter and fine lines less noticeable. But the major difference, I have not had one single breakout of cystic acne since. I apply a small amout, two to three drops, to my face at night after washing massaging into my face and neck. It absorbs quickly without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I took me so long to get into the natural product world, but I am officially a convert lol. This oil is an amazing moisturizer. Makes my skin feel sooo soft and look fresh and glowy (think JLo!). Literally everything makes me break out but surprisingly this doesn&#x27;t! You only need a small drop. I&#x27;ll never use chemical ridden moisturizers again! It&#x27;s inexpensive too!I LOVE this oil!!! It soaks into my skin and makes my skin feel beautiful. I do my usual dermalogica face routine and use a couple of drops on my face before I go to bed. In the morning my face is completely radiant and my skin feels silky soft. I also use this oil in the bath which is lovely. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 9 weeks and my friends and family have all bought it too. My skin looks and feels very healthy - I&#x27;m very impressed :-)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this to a friend also someone who wants smooth skin also its great for hair growth and keeps your hair looking healthy. HOPE THIS HELPS :)</li>
            <li> I am amazed how much this product has changed my skin. I was always trying different moisturizers and finding that my skin had bad reactions to them. Either Id break out, Id have a rash flare up or they made my skin look terribly dull. However, this stuff is truly a miracle worker for me. Not only does it moisturize my skin unlike anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried [even coconut oil] but it has helped clear up my skin as well.</li>
            <li> I use it before I shave with a blade... put it on a couple of minutes before shaving gel and you&#x27;ll get the smoothest shave ever.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> THIS IS IT!  100% Pure. Unscented. Works better than ANY product on the market for repairing cracked hands, fingers, feet, etc. It is NOT oily. Excellent price. You will NOT be disappointed in this product. I will definitely order more, for friends that have severe problems with dry weather cracking their fingers and hands. Exceptional!</li>
            <li> Tried all the acne products out there to keep me acne free. But I decided to try these oil to help manage my acne from breaking out all over my face. I have use this product everyday since I got it from the mail. I was excited as well as nervous because putting more oil in my face its kinda crazy. I use this as moisturizer day time and nightime. Not only that, I  use it as moisturizer for my cuticles and my scalp coz i get dandruff during winter time. I love this all natural product and I dont think I will use another acne product that are out in the market at all. JOJOBA OIL is the bomb!</li>
            <li> It is not bad, I will use it to make my hair end smooth. Hope it can help. And it is really odourless.</li>
            <li> Saw this oil in a video and knew l had to have it.  Great price and fast delivery. Will be using them again in the future.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil for my hair and I love it! It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel too weighted down or greasy. I also use it on my face from time to time to protect against winter dryness and it works really well at keeping it moisturized. I actually went to Whole Foods the other day &amp; saw that they sold it there so I purchased my second bottle. Excellent product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I got the oil as fast as it was promised. The oil is great for hand and face moisturizer. I mixed with some Young Living essential oils for a pleasant smell and skin pampering.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil, comes out great and love the convenient size.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer that&#x27;s not greasy looking but offers a dewy look.</li>
            <li> In transitioning to non-toxic make-up and beauty products, I found this stuff. It&#x27;s amazing! I use it on my face after my shower. Day and night. And it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts! My whole life (I&#x27;ll be 50 soon), I&#x27;ve never been able to use a moisturizer because, no matter how mild it said it was, it would cause my face to explode. Not this stuff. It&#x27;s actually the closest thing to what our skin produces. Instead of drying out my skin and causing it to think it needs to produce more oil, it soothes and moisturizes and makes my skin think it needs to take a break. My skin has much fewer breakouts (I&#x27;m at that hormonal time in life-not fun) and looks healthier. And it&#x27;s moisturized!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for sometimes and have positive results. It is good both for hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Great product. Quick shipping :)</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, arrived as described.</li>
            <li> Great quality jojoba oil! Fast shipping and unbeatable price. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and super sensitive skin. I use this on my legs after shaving and on my face after washing it. Great for moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin. No additives to worry about breaking out your skin. No fragrances to have to deal with.</li>
            <li> Great for problem skin- works excellent to take off even the most stubborn waterproof eye makeup- even lash adhesive for falsies! Gives ZERO irritation on even the most sensitive, allergy-ridden eyes!  Works as well as olive oil yet without the extreme greasiness- think it is better on your plumbing than olive oil, especially if you have old cast iron.</li>
            <li> Love this product and have ordered it many times. I have to use gluten free products and this oil is wonderful for celiacs. it absorbs quickly and really softens my skin, with no bad reactions. Love it.</li>
            <li> Pure jojoba oil is great for skin and hair.  A little goes a long way, and I&#x27;ve used this all summer to soothe and repair dryness.  This was a good price for such a high quality product.</li>
            <li> It came and I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> Great for skin a little goes a long way after you cleanse your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The oil reduced more oil production throughout the day clearing up blemishes and acne.</li>
            <li> I love jojoba oil. This one has a light scent, absorbs well into the skin, and is a great carrier oil to use with essential oils. I like to use it for back massages and for my face before bed time.</li>
            <li> Yes I loved this product.  Good for hair and scalp, makes hands soft.  Smell was alright to me.  Gave it five stars.</li>
            <li> All I put on my hair is this.  My hair is long enough to reach my chest, and all I need is about 7-8 drops of this right after I take a shower.  It&#x27;s light and makes my hair very smooth.  After I rub this into my hair, I rub the residue onto my hands.  My nails look great, and I rarely have any cuticle problems.</li>
            <li> I love it. Out of the oils I&#x27;ve tried so far: coconut &amp; castor oil (not very much but I&#x27;m only 12). This is by far the best, I tried argan oil just once only 2 drops from a vendor and it seemed just as good. Odorless and absorbent. It&#x27;s a great substitute for lotion and moisturizers which usually have harsh chemicals that go into your blood stream. Lotions that have fragrance listed as an ingredient can have up to 200 ingredients to create that fragrance or perfume.  Unless it says organic or natural it probably isn&#x27;t the best thing for your skin, but it won&#x27;t kill you I guess. The one thing that bugged me not about this particular product, but even in general it&#x27;s an expensive oil. Being 12 I&#x27;m on a budget : )</li>
            <li> Excellent carrier oil with its own added attributes.  Mixes great with lotions and essential oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. He is mixed race with a head of soft, spiral curls that are gorgeous... but I have NO IDEA how to manage these curls! Poor kid. His mom has naturally super straight hair! I&#x27;ve never had to deal with curly hair in any way before now. I have tried a couple of my personal frizz management hair products that I love in his hair, but they&#x27;re so expensive... I went to try something more natural and heard good things about jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love it. :( It makes his hair seem really weighed down if I use a little more, but if I use less, it doesn&#x27;t help to manage the curls and he ends up with mats that try to dread themselves. Doesn&#x27;t help that the hair on the back of his head seems to want to be a different texture than the rest of his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have stretched ear lobes that I massage every day with this and it&#x27;s just fantastic. So, there&#x27;s that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall... not bad! Just... not what I wanted it for. :(</li>
            <li> Great product, it arrived super feast and I was able to use it on my dry skin.  I would recommend the product and the seller!</li>
            <li> 2017 Review: I should have updated this awhile ago... I&#x27;ve been purchasing again and the quality is very good. Oil is very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013 Review: Last two bottles purchased have smelled like a forest fire and are unusable. Desert Essence lists on its website that their Jojoba Oil is harvested from the Sonora Desert. Given the forest fires in Arizona last summer it is understandable that their product would pick up traces of ash. Unfortunately it makes the product unusable due to smell and irritation. 2 Stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a long time user of Desert Essence products I&#x27;m hopeful that the next few production lots get cleaned up and the purity of the product returns.</li>
            <li> Smells really bad, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to smell like that, but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> great brand, has nice nutty smell</li>
            <li> Using Jojoba oil in combination with Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel has changed my face dramatically. I have smaller pores now, no roughness or blemishes, and my skin is baby smooth. I adore this product.</li>
            <li> It is a little thicker than the organic one, because of this it will take longer to absorb into skin. It is a great moisturizer, helps control oil production and helps clear acne.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make beard balm for my son in law. I have also used it when I made other lotions and body butters. It makes my skin so smooth! Definitely on my must have on hand list!</li>
            <li> nice and a dry oil good stuff</li>
            <li> Use it instead of lotion.  I also use it as an eye make up remover.  Very natural product.  I feel safe when using it</li>
            <li> This stuff is good for your skin in a general sense, even for the face (in small quantities, because I suspect it made me break out once or twice). It&#x27;s an effective moisturizer layer for dry days and helps (at least does not disrupt) healing. I&#x27;m not sure about its use for (European) hair. I tried a small amount on my dry hair and it immediately looked dirty. Maybe wet hair is a different story?</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil, and I also use this on my dogs.</li>
            <li> Good quality product for beauty and natural perfumery applications. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Made my skin clear and soft, not oily like I thought it would. Very good product!</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product because I needed Jojoba oil to act as the activator/carrier for my rosacea medicine.  I was pleasantly surprised that all of the information about jojoba oil is true.  It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, doesn&#x27;t increase my acne, and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, when used with my new medicine, it has helped to clear up all of my symptoms, improved the condition of my face, and reduced any wrinkles I as developing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing -- I immediately purchased a 4 ounce amber glass bottle to store the oil in.  Clear plastic is not the optimum container for any oil product as it may take on some of the less healthful properties of the plastic.</li>
            <li> NO bad smell.So far Desert Essence and Acne.org Jojoba oil are my favorite. Wish they sold a bigger bottle. I use oil everyday for EVERYTHING! My husband loves it too as after shave and for his hair.</li>
            <li> Love jojoba oil.  I use it as a moisturizer for my face and neck.  It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  I love the way it leaves my skin feeling.  I use it in the morning and at night and when I don&#x27;t wear it, my skin feels dry.  So good for your skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite sometime now (to remove makeup) and I must say that it&#x27;s wonderful! It&#x27;s not harsh at all on my skin. It&#x27;s very useful not only as a makeup remover, but as a moisturizer and oil treatment for hair as well. Just read up on jojoba oil :) Love it!</li>
            <li> Thank you very pleased with my order</li>
            <li> Pros: Lasts a LONG time if you only use it for the face and hair. Bought it in May or June 2012. It has been 9 months and it is still 35+% full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does not heal or cure dry skin. It is a temporary fix. Burns the eyes and scalps if you leave it on. I left it in my roots cause I heard jojoba oil is good for the face/skin but when I woke up and touched my scalp the roots and scalp felt HURT/bruised. Like I was yanking my hair all night or put some kind of bad chemcial on it. I didn&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t even use shampoo/conditioner, I simply put this and left it in along with maybe a little water to have damp hair. It hurt my scalp more than once cause despite the first time I thought that must have been some fluke/mistake, but nope. It was the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left near the eyes if you rub your eyes during the night it&#x27;ll irritate your eyes to the point where you may have to get out of bed to rinse them out. This may be a no-brainer, but if you&#x27;re putting oil on your skin to moisturize your dry skin then this is not the brand for you. Try something else. I got this to get rid of flakes and it worked (temporarily) but I had to switch to a better product/oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first experience with jojoba and I will never buy from this brand again. I may try sweet almond oil next ,or emu oil.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil.  I use directly on the body and as an add on to home made moisturizers.</li>
            <li> worked well for my hair. i seen this on you tube video</li>
            <li> A nice oil for the skin- I use it in my homemade lip balms and lotions.</li>
            <li> I have been using this to cleanse my face for a few weeks and have seen amazing results, less breakouts, moisturized skin, and less redness. My 5 year old was recently diagnosed with eczema, I used a generous amount after her bath last night, and this morning, her flare up is almost completely gone! You can see where the redness and irritation was, but it is about 90% smoother and not itching and stinging anymore! We will continue using this at night and follow up with CeraVe lotion in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I use this not only as a body and hair moisturizer, but as a pre and post shave lotion as well. I have acne prone skin so it is hard for me to find a moisturizer that won&#x27;t cause a break out, but have had no problems with this oil. A little goes a long way and can become greasy if too much is applied, so use sparingly. Great product that has lots of uses.</li>
            <li> Love including this in my face routine and it smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> this oil is a great carrier of my essential oils - terrific on the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I use it for my face because I get horribly dry skin in the winter and it helps keep my skin smooth and clear of pimples and blackheads. I also put it in my hair mixed with lavender oil when I workout. After I shower, my hair is silky smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Great for massages!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - I use it on my face as a moisturiser and as a makeup remover. The only complaint I have is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t transport well. I had it in a sealed plastic baggy to take with me on the road and the bottle leaked. I&#x27;d say the seal is just not quite as tight as it should be. It does, however, serve its purpose well! I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face to moisturize and as a carrier oil, mixed with Tea Tree (for acne) and Frankincense (for acne scarring). I have never used Jojoba oil before so I don&#x27;t have a comparison but so far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Great quality oil. Works well for skin or hair, and even for *ahem* lube.</li>
            <li> LOW quality, but does the job to get eye makeup off. I do not use this on my face because I have found a higher quality jojoba oil that is 10x better.</li>
            <li> This is the only product used in our house for face moisture.  It provides well balanced moisture but also lacks all of the chemicals that other moisturizers have that actually harm your face and can make your face dryer in the long run.  Great, natural product!</li>
            <li> I Do Not Use Jojoba Oil Anymore, Not Because its a Bad Product/Oil, But Because I am Just Sticking to Two Particular Oil Right Now...Using 6 or 7 or 8 Different for Your is Just too Much....But this Only Was Actually Really Good....Great for Hot Oil Treatment (In My Opinion)....Great Stuff, Just in Love with Avocado Oil Right Now</li>
            <li> I really like it , it helped me to get rid of the split ends and it&#x27;s also very great as a moisturizer for my skin.</li>
            <li> use this to cleanse my face i love it</li>
            <li> The best product for my oily skin. I have been using this oil for almost half a year. Since day one, skin has been soft, acne free and I must say wrinkles are much smoother now!!!&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a makeup remover, which is THE BEST, I mean the best and the quickest way to remove the makeup...</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this oil.  I love this stuff!  I will keep this around all the time now.</li>
            <li> so far so good, I just stared using this but I do like it.</li>
            <li> I mix this with vitamin e and coconut oil and apply to my face and hands every evening. My face has never been so healthy and soft. I will be finding more uses for this, it&#x27;s miraculous.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. This is my second order and I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on my natural hair and it works great and is light enough not to cause a lot of build up</li>
            <li> great for hair and skin - just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Good oil, has very minimal smell and should take on any scent you want to add to it to make it your own custom scent.</li>
            <li> I regularly buy this jojoba oil. I have used it on my face at night and it is soft in the morning. It has never caused my face to break out and is great for my sensitive skin. I also put it in my hair at night and it keeps my curls soft. In addition, when I am deep conditioning my hair, using this oil adds to the moisture.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> 100% jojoba oil at a great price! arrived quickly and intact.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed!  Excellent moisturizer and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Good product overall. Seems to work well on my skin. No issues.</li>
            <li> I purchased it as a pre-lubricant to shaving. I moved from $30+ dollar Gillette 4 blade shaving process. Now it am using an old fashioned double edged razor which I find is actually shaving better - check the web for the process. This combined with &amp;#34;taking one&#x27;s time&amp;#34; is an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> I like this oil for my hair, skin and nails. the price was reasonable and the shipping was fast, I will be ordering again</li>
            <li> I would have to agree with Aaron Barse, I bought this oil to massage my stretched ears and I love it! It&#x27;s not heavy at all and it absorbs super fast. I also swear to it for chapped lips</li>
            <li> This stuff is the truth for skin and hair! My hair and skin is very dry by nature, but this stuff works magically by softening and moisturizing my hair like no other.  My skin is velvety smooth after using it!  I will always have jojoba oil in my arsenal!</li>
            <li> I mixed this with other oils to make my own body butter, and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It keeps my hair smooth and manageable and my skin glowing. I would recomend this product to anyone with dry skin. I think anyone can apply this on their hair before shampooing to keep your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Its good oil, just dont leave it by a window getting sun, after a while it build up some kind of white stuff in the oil, like if it had gone bad or something</li>
            <li> good for ear streching and your lobes in general</li>
            <li> I use this product mainly to remove my eye makeup.  It&#x27;s all natural and costs the same as any other specified eye makeup remover.  I keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price. Nice and fresh, mostly odorless (if it smells like anything there&#x27;s a slight cardboard smell... it&#x27;s not a bad thing) and the bottle is more convenient than the dropper some of the other sellers use and it arrived on time. I like it.</li>
            <li> A good product, using it to make my own lotion, and it works great!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil because it is very versatile, I saw a review on youtube and she explained that this oil is very good for oily skin which I have and it was a bit mind boggling because I&#x27;m thinking to myself how can a oil help with oily skin so desperate to find something I ordered it and shipping was fast and easy and in as little as a week my skin became less and less oily. When I&#x27;m at work i no longer have to run in the bathroom and blot my face or hide and do a touch up. Also my face is more subtle and hydrated in fact I oil my whole entire body with it. I&#x27;m not saying that you won&#x27;t have an ounce of oil on your skin but it does work because my skin went from excessive oil to maintainable.</li>
            <li> I had initially postponed buying my next set of oils (essentials and a carrier) purely because of the price per ounce, but upon ordering this and using it regularly for two weeks already, I can see that it is going to last me a while. I use around five drops/use or per concoction, and it looks untouched. Also, I&#x27;m very happy with the results as an after-shower moisturizer on my face; so far, I&#x27;ve had no trouble with acne popping up as a consequence. I&#x27;m so comfortable with it, I even use it on my lips and in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. In case you&#x27;ve never Jojoba-ed before, it does not have a smell.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy for my natural hair. You can also use a body oil.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of pure oils.  I use them for my skin and hair.  This product is great.  It is %100 and great quality oil.  I mix it with other products to make a hair souffle.  I use it on my skin as a night-time serum after my toner and it controls acne break outs.  The shipping was fast and I received an email from the seller to make sure I was happy with the product, which I am.  I appreciate the great product and the wonderful customer service.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my hair.  I already have combination skin with an oily t-zone and facial oils don&#x27;t work particularly well for me.  But my hair is dry and frizzy because it&#x27;s dyed, and that&#x27;s what I wanted help with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of hair oils.  I think this is not quite as good as Sedu pure argan oil, but is better for me than Redken Diamond Oil Shatterproof Shine Intense.  However, it&#x27;s considerably less expensive than the Sedu product, and that might lead to me choosing this over the Sedu (eventually -- I have the 4 ounce bottle of this and it is enough to last for a very long time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to describe my hair treatment routine so you can see where and how I use this.  I think the way you use this product, and in combination with what other products, is going to make a difference in the results you see.  I wash my hair every day (have been trying different shampoos), followed by using a conditioner (have also been trying different conditioners lately).  While it&#x27;s still wet, I comb a hair treatment product through it.  My current treatment product has a lot of silicones and also keratin.  I then let my hair air dry.  (My hair is waist-length so this takes overnight.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning before work, I brush my hair with a detangling brush, then I put about 4-5 drops of this in my hands, spread it around on my palms, and run my hands over my hair.  I then use a natural bristle brush to better distribute the jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing this for a few weeks now and I think my hair looks pretty good.  It&#x27;s shiny without being greasy.  It&#x27;s soft and smooth and I have some frizz (hard to avoid in Georgia) but I think this significantly reduces the amount.  My oil did not have any kind off smell, it was fine.  This is fairly easy to distribute throughout your hair, even with long hair, and you don&#x27;t need very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caution -- the first time I tried this, I&#x27;d been using the Redken Diamond Oil.  I need a lot of that so I assumed I would need a lot of this.  I ended up using a nickel-sized amount of this and that was far too much.  That *did* make my hair look greasy.  The next day, I dialed it back to just a few drops and it was fine.  So you may have to experiment to find the right amount of product for your own hair, but err on the side of using too little if you have somewhere to go right after putting it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, this is an economical choice for me and is providing several benefits for my hair.  I would definitely consider buying this again (although it will be a long time before I run out).a lot of that so I assumed I would need a lot of this.

            <li> Wish they had a bigger size for how much it is.</li>
            <li> Great for mine and my daughters hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily and weighed down. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD FOR SMALL DRY SPOTS, ESPECIALLY CUTICLES AND HEELS.  BE CAREFUL AS IT IS A THIN LIQUID AND CAN SPILL EASILY.</li>
            <li> I USED IT ABOUT THREE TIMES FOR ABOUT 40-50 MINUTES AND NOT ONCE DID IT MAKE MY HAIR FEEL ANY SMOOTHER&lt;br /&gt;OR MOISTURIZED AT ALL!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased to make whipped body butter as gifts over Christmas, turned out great! Many compliments and requests for more. Will definitely order again next year to make another batch!</li>
            <li> I was going to use this to &#x27;smooth&#x27; my beard but found it made my face feel oily and sweaty. It has found another purpose as a massage oil - a use for which it is well suited.</li>
            <li> Great for the price and wonderful for smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Great product!! makes my skin feel soft and refreshing. I love to use is after a bath and especially after a shave! The product came soon than expected. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product, however I would like to see is price more reasonable.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but a little goes a long way. It leaves my skin feeling soft, not oily at all, and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I&#x27;ve tried a handful of facial moisturizes and none have worked as well or have been as beneficial as this oil.</li>
            <li> I use this to take my makeup off every night. It&#x27;s such a great alternative to makeup remover products. I also use it to moisturize my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair and as a makeup remover. Ever since I used this oil on my hair after I shower,  people have been complimenting how soft and healthier it looks now.They asked me if I got my hair treated, but nope this oil was the key. Also this oil is perfect for  removing makeup. Although it does feel weird at first, I believe it&#x27;s a better alternative than other drugstore removers which contain harmful chemicals. I also have sensitive skin, but this product has not failed me yet. I&#x27;m definitely purchasing another one.</li>
            <li> amazing texture, makes my skin look/feel fabulous</li>
            <li> i use it as my daily face moisturizer and to massage my face every few days works great has never broken me out sometimes i pu some of it in my baths</li>
            <li> Amazing,  does wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> The quality is excellent and price fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need jojoba oil, look no further</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as a night time regimin for my face. It has left my skin so soft and with very few impurities. Just the other day my co-worker complimented my skin. NEVER HAVE I EVER HEARD THIS IN MY LIFE - I told her as well as many many many other friends the perks of using this product. It has the same PH level as the skin so it does not leave your skin oily, while maintaining a balance level of moisture. I will use it year round.</li>
            <li> Good product, I&#x27;m a long-time user.</li>
            <li> Great product and good price.  I have been using this as an eye make up remover and have found that a little goes a long way.  It is gentle, non-greasy and light. I am also now using it as a carrier oil for my essential oils. Will definitely buy again.  May go organic next time though.</li>
            <li> Great product and service rated 5 star!</li>
            <li> Works great for oil cleansing method!</li>
            <li> Started using this stuff last December, and thank god I did. My face would dry out EVERY single time I got out of the shower. Using all these s***ty creams by \\&quot;top\\&quot; companies like Proactiv, and well, others. I really don&#x27;t remember since it&#x27;s been a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv just made everything a lot worse. I would never go back to proactiv for anything really. I am sure they use a lot of illegal chemicals in their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, with jojoba oil, it just made everything better. I put on enough so I feel that my skin will not dry out on my face, and if I put excess, simply try and spread it elsewhere, or get a paper towel or something to pad your face down lightly. Leave it on all day, and you don&#x27;t feel crap unlike the other stuff where you feel it on your face and you hate it.</li>
            <li> Good price super fast shipping thank you so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is really 100% pure jojoba oil; but so far, I like it. :)  I bought it mainly to use on my face and scalp.  I get dry scalp in the winter and needed something to help moisturize it.  Additionally, I have acne.  I read it is good for your face since it&#x27;s like your natural face oils.  It was a great price for 4 ounces!  And I had fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little apprehensive when I opened the bottle.  It smelled nutty, kind of like sesame oil...and I could see how some people think it smells like bacon.  So, I decided to research about what it should smell like and look like.  (I&#x27;ve never bought jojoba oil before.)  I compared pictures and the color seems on par with other bottles.  Many of the sources I found said that it&#x27;s normal for the oil to smell nutty, and it can seem to smell like sesame oil or bacon to some people.  I also discovered that jojoba oil should have a buttery consistency when it is cooled.  If it doesn&#x27;t, it probably has a carrier oil mixed in.  So, I tossed it into the fridge and left it there overnight.  In the morning, I looked at the bottle and tried to test the consistency.  It looked slightly marbled, but it was all hardened.  The consistency seemed similar to butter, but some people might think it is like wax.  (It was more like wax, right out of the fridge.  After setting for a few minutes, it was like butter.)  As soon as I took some out of the bottle, it quickly melt back to oil.  In conclusion, I&#x27;m not sure if this is truly all jojoba or not.  I&#x27;ll try to post a picture of the oil cold.  Hopefully, someone with more knowledge can give me a definite answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the packaging, I was happy the inside was sealed but disappointed it came in a plastic bottle.  Most essential oils are packaged in a darkened glass bottle to help it stay &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; and some oils will eat away at plastic.  The dispenser top is okay, but I would have preferred a glass dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a website that testsessential oils from different sellers and posts the findings, while remaining unbiased.  In the future, I plan on buying jojoba oil from one of the verified sellers in order to compare the two bottles.  I&#x27;ll try to remember to post my findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the oil being organic, it doesn&#x27;t say organic anywhere on the bottle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to comment, if you have any additional information.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The product I received was just as it was described. It has been working well in my hair conditioner concoction.</li>
            <li> I like it enough. Its light and keeps my face moisturized... at least for a few hours. The only thing is you have to re-apply often to keep moisturized, which can be seen as a negative.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Our skin loves us!</li>
            <li> This product is not 100% pure as they claim it to be.  It is mixed in with what seems to be olive oil. It smells pretty badly and doesn&#x27;t feel like 100% jojoba oil usually feels on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Product sold to me was tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend not buying it on here, or paying the extra few dollars and getting it from your local whole foods store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was highly disappointed by it!</li>
            <li> This product works great for beard dandruff.  This company had the best price and delivery was fast.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> No complaints about the oil itself -- it&#x27;s fine. Here&#x27;s the deal, though: the container DOES NOT TRAVEL WELL. Every single time I pack this thing up, even just into a gymbag for a short trip to work, I find when I remove it that a large amount of the oil has leaked out through the cap and soaked the area around the container. Taking it on planes is a nightmare; I&#x27;ve found that I have to dedicate a single disposable plastic bag for this stuff, and inevitably every time I remove it from my suitcase, a significant amount of the oil has leaked out into the plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned numerous bottles of this (I like the oil), but the container design makes it incredibly inconvenient. I&#x27;ll be going with a different brand next time around.</li>
            <li> Great alone as a moisturizer, excellent with castor oil and tea tree for the oil cleansing method. Lightweight and thin, I&#x27;d recommend it for face only, though. Non irritating, great for acne prone skin since it most closely imitates the natural, good oils in your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this jojoba oil.  I mix it with 20 drops of tea tree oil.  It is used as a toner for 10 minutes then rinsed off.  However, beware if purchasing this product in the winter.  I received 2 bottles today in the mail and the oil was frozen when I retrieved my package from my mailbox.  Very disappointed.  I do not know if this weather element has altered the oil.</li>
            <li> Product was as described, fast shipping.  Would buy from again.  Thanks</li>
            <li> My most favorite oil.  I use it mostly in my hair. But I mix it into body lotion as well. It&#x27;s great on sunburn. I just love it. I&#x27;ve been using it for probably 6 years. 1 bottles lasts a LONG time</li>
            <li> It came really quickly. Nice oil. Just doesn&#x27;t help with my dry scalp as expected.</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair, it caused my hair to fall out. I used it on my face, didn&#x27;t see any progress, only made my skin oily. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great for making your own beauty items</li>
