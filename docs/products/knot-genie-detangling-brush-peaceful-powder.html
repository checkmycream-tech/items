    <ol>
            <li>but it did not have the best reviews.  </li>
            <li>it was great.  </li>
            <li>Great brush though</li>
            <li>does great job</li>
            <li>works great</li>
            <li>She says it works great on matted hair.</li>
            <li>We are using it on our dogs and it works great for them though.</li>
            <li>Works great on cat too, and they love it!</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>The color is nice though.</li>
            <li>magical brush does an amazing job and without any struggle.</li>
            <li>We needed more portable options for diaper bag, and downstairs diaper caddy, so purchased two of the handle-free options.  </li>
            <li>I bought  two mini knot genies at our favorite kid&#x27;s salon for my two daughters.</li>
            <li>I purchased this one instead and am satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I spend more time picking it up off the floor after dropping it than I do brushing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am telling all  of my mom friends who need help to get one of these ingenious brushes.</li>
            <li>Wish it was more inpressive</li>
            <li>We love the full size even more than the mini.</li>
            <li>The blue color--both girls&#x27; favorite is beautiful.</li>
            <li>My toddler has curly hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>but she can use this one just fine.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do as good of job as my old paddle brush.</li>
            <li>It really does work!!!</li>
            <li>Finally, at 10, she can now brush her own hair well and easily!</li>
            <li>I had originally started her with a dense synthetic boar bristle brush - yeah,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I thought it was a dream come true.</li>
            <li>(she has a sensitive head as many children do at age 4).</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not so good with doing other people&#x27;s hair).  </li>
            <li>We got the Knot Genie with the handle first -</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work any wonders and not any better than a regular hair brush.</li>
            <li>This brush really works!</li>
            <li>This brush actually works great on long, tangled hair.</li>
            <li>My step daughter never looks forward to brushing her hair and this really worked wonders!</li>
            <li>The Knot Genie has extremely stiff bristles which are very unforgiving when pulling through hair, which does make it good at detangling,</li>
            <li>Worked better than expected on my daughters very curly hair.</li>
            <li>that one I felt seemed really risky damage-wise.  </li>
            <li>The knit genie was a miracle -- so much so that I often forgot the genie part of the name and referred to it as the miracle brush.</li>
            <li>my daughter really doesn&#x27;t like to have her hair touched at all,</li>
            <li>we were really hoping that this would be the answer to our hair brushing drama.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are wide which helps to seperate her hair better and work through tangles.  </li>
            <li>The Wet Hair Brush, however, has covered tips which makes it much more pleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>although also very painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still find that I have to brush the ends of her hair first and then brush from the top down.  </li>
            <li>Even wet, her hair is easy to brush through.  </li>
            <li>However, I would say that this brush is only marginally better at detangling than a store-bought brush of the same type.</li>
            <li>so it has a noisy, hollow scratchy sound that I don&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li>that I paid for overnight shipping to get this new one sooner.</li>
            <li>After the screaming stopped, I decided to try it on my own head and could barely stand the pain (and I like to think I have very little feeling in my head</li>
            <li>Anyways, this brush was not for us, but I have more recently purchased the Wet Hair Brush, so here is a side by side</li>
            <li>And the brushes must loose some of their genie magic over a couple of years (though our old one still worked much better than other brushes, even after two years of use) because brushing through the matted morning tangles took just a few strokes with the new brush.</li>
            <li>If you have a curly hair or a child with a curly hair, you know very well the daily struggle with combing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush for my 6 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>really works for girls and boys, in the shower or out... looked a long time for something like this...</li>
            <li>I was really hopeful this would work on my long tangle prone hair</li>
            <li>This is my second Knot Genie purchase - I have a 22 month old with mounds of curly hair -</li>
            <li>Minimal effort needed to pull through hair (and for her we have to brush straight out of bath, as well as in the morning when she wakes up), and did not pull on her toddler hair/curls.  </li>
            <li>The bristles do not have a protective cap on them so it can be rough on the scalp if you apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>far as design, the Wet Hair Brush is much more comfortable to hold vs. the Knot Genie which is a very uncomfortable cloud shape.</li>
            <li>One has really thick hair and the other fine hair, both straight.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel a little rough, but my toddler adjusted quickly to their feeling on her head.</li>
            <li>Wet Hair Brush has extremely flexible bristles which also make it very gentle when pulling through the hair.</li>

            <li> Little large for small hands.</li>
            <li> about 3/4 down her back when wet!  </li>

            <li> She prefers it from her other brushes too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are no tips on the bristles of the Knot Genie which makes it feel like dragging a bunch of sharp pins across your scalp.</li>
            <li> I can see how this would work well for other people, but couldn&#x27;t get through to the underside of her hair.</li>
            <li> that was not right</li>
            <li> She previously had cried every time I tried to brush her hair</li>
            <li> - my little diva comes and sits in my lap for me to do her hair when I pull the brush out of the drawer.</li>
            <li> It has cut down the amount of time that I spend brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair from 45 minutes to 10 minutes without tears!</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the shape is difficult to hold in small hands (my adult but small hands, although not &amp;#34;Dooneese&amp;#34; small).</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is too thick for this brush.</li>
            <li> It now takes much less time to brush her hair each morning and it is less painful for her as well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line, the Knot Genie is painful and difficult to hold.</li>
            <li> The three mornings without it were so miserable with the screaming and crying (both me and  my daughter, I admit!)</li>

            <li> This is my second Knot Genie purchase - I have a 22 month old with mounds of curly hair - about 3/4 down her back when wet!  I had originally started her with a dense synthetic boar bristle brush - yeah, that was not right (I&#x27;m not so good with doing other people&#x27;s hair).  I then used a regular plastic ball-tipped bristle brush - that one I felt seemed really risky damage-wise.  We got the Knot Genie with the handle first - it was great.  Minimal effort needed to pull through hair (and for her we have to brush straight out of bath, as well as in the morning when she wakes up), and did not pull on her toddler hair/curls.  We needed more portable options for diaper bag, and downstairs diaper caddy, so purchased two of the handle-free options.  I will say that I like the handle option a little bit better - but that&#x27;s partially because my hands are a little on the small side, and this is a wide brush.  Great brush though - my little diva comes and sits in my lap for me to do her hair when I pull the brush out of the drawer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as we had hoped on curly hair.</li>
            <li> If you have a curly hair or a child with a curly hair, you know very well the daily struggle with combing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;This magical brush does an amazing job and without any struggle. My son loves it and use it himself once he realized it doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;It does great job</li>
            <li> I bought  two mini knot genies at our favorite kid&#x27;s salon for my two daughters. One has really thick hair and the other fine hair, both straight. The knit genie was a miracle -- so much so that I often forgot the genie part of the name and referred to it as the miracle brush. One brush was lost long ago, and over spring break, we left the other at our family&#x27;s house on accident. The three mornings without it were so miserable with the screaming and crying (both me and  my daughter, I admit!) that I paid for overnight shipping to get this new one sooner. We love the full size even more than the mini. The blue color--both girls&#x27; favorite is beautiful. And the brushes must loose some of their genie magic over a couple of years (though our old one still worked much better than other brushes, even after two years of use) because brushing through the matted morning tangles took just a few strokes with the new brush.</li>
            <li> Worked better than expected on my daughters very curly hair. We love it!</li>
            <li> Meh. It didn&#x27;t work any wonders and not any better than a regular hair brush. The color is nice though.</li>
            <li> This brush really works! My toddler has curly hair that tangles easily and this brush detangles with ease. The bristles feel a little rough, but my toddler adjusted quickly to their feeling on her head. Now I do not have to use detangling spray.</li>
            <li> really works for girls and boys, in the shower or out... looked a long time for something like this... long hair too</li>
            <li> my daughter really doesn&#x27;t like to have her hair touched at all, let alone brushed.  we thought this would help, but after we used it one time she begged us to use a regular brush.  it didn&#x27;t detangle at all.  we sent it back.  we were really hoping that this would be the answer to our hair brushing drama.  not so.  we ended up going and getting her hair chopped off, again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. Her hair gets knots instantly after she brushes it. I have even had to take her to a hair stylist to get the knots brushed out when I couldn&#x27;t do it. Finally, at 10, she can now brush her own hair well and easily!</li>
            <li> Little large for small hands. works great</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my 6 year old daughter.  She saw an advertisement on TV for a different brush that was supposed to get tangles out easier than a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush but it did not have the best reviews.  I purchased this one instead and am satisfied with it.  She prefers it from her other brushes too.  The bristles are wide which helps to seperate her hair better and work through tangles.  I still find that I have to brush the ends of her hair first and then brush from the top down.  It took time to get used to though.  The bristles do not have a protective cap on them so it can be rough on the scalp if you apply too much pressure.  I also bought the smaller size for her to use.  It got lost shortly have we bought it but she can use this one just fine.</li>
            <li> The knot genie is a life saver! It has cut down the amount of time that I spend brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair from 45 minutes to 10 minutes without tears! My 5 year does not want me to use anything else to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Knot Genie as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She previously had cried every time I tried to brush her hair (she has a sensitive head as many children do at age 4). After reading the reviews, I thought it was a dream come true. After the screaming stopped, I decided to try it on my own head and could barely stand the pain (and I like to think I have very little feeling in my head - I can rip a brush through without flinching.) Anyways, this brush was not for us, but I have more recently purchased the Wet Hair Brush, so here is a side by side comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no tips on the bristles of the Knot Genie which makes it feel like dragging a bunch of sharp pins across your scalp. My daughter screamed on every occasion! The Wet Hair Brush, however, has covered tips which makes it much more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wet Hair Brush has extremely flexible bristles which also make it very gentle when pulling through the hair. However, I would say that this brush is only marginally better at detangling than a store-bought brush of the same type. The Knot Genie has extremely stiff bristles which are very unforgiving when pulling through hair, which does make it good at detangling, although also very painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as design, the Wet Hair Brush is much more comfortable to hold vs. the Knot Genie which is a very uncomfortable cloud shape. I spend more time picking it up off the floor after dropping it than I do brushing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line, the Knot Genie is painful and difficult to hold. Plus, it makes my kid scream.</li>
            <li> This was ordered for my stylist.  She says it works great on matted hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to anyone with a screaming child at hair brushing time. It really does work!!! Even wet, her hair is easy to brush through.  It helps isolate the knots without pulling her hair out at the scalp. Wish I heard of this two years ago! I am telling all  of my mom friends who need help to get one of these ingenious brushes. A winner in my book!!!</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful this would work on my long tangle prone hair but it doesn&#x27;t do as good of job as my old paddle brush. It&#x27;s super light so it has a noisy, hollow scratchy sound that I don&#x27;t really like. Wish it was more inpressive</li>
            <li> This brush actually works great on long, tangled hair. Only complaint is that the shape is difficult to hold in small hands (my adult but small hands, although not &amp;#34;Dooneese&amp;#34; small). Works great on cat too, and they love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is too thick for this brush. Not having a handle made it harder to use. I can see how this would work well for other people, but couldn&#x27;t get through to the underside of her hair. We are using it on our dogs and it works great for them though.</li>
            <li> My step daughter never looks forward to brushing her hair and this really worked wonders! It now takes much less time to brush her hair each morning and it is less painful for her as well!</li>
