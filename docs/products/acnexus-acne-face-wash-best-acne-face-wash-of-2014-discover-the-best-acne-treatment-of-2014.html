            <li>I read all reviews and was convinced it would be a good product</li>
            <li>I read all the good reviews before purchasing this acne wash.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product!</li>
            <li>and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>smoother skin smells great and does a super job</li>
            <li>He loves it and is more confident during his puberty years.</li>
            <li>Use many time</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>It has not cleared up the acne, but it does looks somewhat better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE them both.</li>
            <li>maybe i&#x27;ll have better results to share.</li>
            <li>I love love love it.</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>Be aware of any sponsored products on Amazon, good products don&#x27;t require advertisement.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, it leaves your skin super soft and bright.</li>
            <li>This soap is great, my 14 years old son loves it.</li>
            <li>so I have to use more, but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li>This product smells pleasant and is not overly drying to the skin, which I was surprised about.</li>
            <li>After 2 months using this product we both see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>works great for my teenage son</li>
            <li>We have both seen remarkable results with several days use.</li>
            <li>a nice fine grade scrub that makes my skin feel soft after use.</li>
            <li>It is all natural &amp; has oils to hydrate skin so it is effective for people of all ages.</li>
            <li>So far I like this product, but honestly for the cost, I&#x27;d rather look for an acne system.</li>
            <li>This has been worth the price.</li>
            <li>Just like the Pronexin, it leaves my face soft and REALLY clean feeling!</li>
            <li>Although she never had a large problem with it, it does work better to keep her skin clear than the mainstream store bought products.</li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling my face has after washing without feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>Using it for thirty days or more provides evidence of results of daily use.</li>
            <li>So far it doesn&#x27;t keep my skin oil free all day.</li>
            <li>I have cystic acne, so I had no high hopes that this would help that greatly, but it definitely has a spa quality to it.</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well, smells okay and feels gentle enough on my skin.  </li>
            <li>She uses it daily even though she objects to the strong smell.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting the large chunks of exfoliant or the brown color.  </li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t help with that.</li>
            <li>Item as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>product absolutely is producing improvements to our skin, and my son had almost severe acne.</li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>The crushed walnuts that make up the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; are not ground up so fine as before.  </li>
            <li>So far, this has really helped my acne to go away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will not be purchasing this product any more, and I am really disappointed that the original product is no longer available.</li>
            <li>Even works on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I have never had skin problems so as you could imagine when I started to break out I, too, quickly tried other things.</li>
            <li>I used this stuff about 10 years ago to clear up acne</li>
            <li>I have been using Acnexus for over a year, and I think it does help with keeping my adult acne under control.</li>
            <li>My early 20&#x27;s daughter still uses this.</li>
            <li>I really think they are the same</li>
            <li>I started using it again because I was looking for a natural exfoliant.</li>
            <li>LIke the fact that is all natural too.</li>
            <li>My blackheads take much longer to come back, and I can go a day or even several without washing my face, and I won&#x27;t break out immediately.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any major breakouts since I started using this wash</li>
            <li>: It doesn&#x27;t lather so be careful not to use too much product.</li>
            <li>My face is glowing, the few zits I get are very small and basically similar to what you&#x27;d have after a good facial.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for myself, a mid 40s woman who developed sudden skin problems in recent years, and for my teen.</li>
            <li>This works very well for cleansing and with small pimples , but I have adult cystic acne</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Made me break out almost every time</li>
            <li> This works very well for cleansing and with small pimples , but I have adult cystic acne and it really doesn&#x27;t help with that. I&#x27;m still going to use acnexus, but will look for another product for the cystic acne.</li>
            <li> This soap is great, my 14 years old son loves it. Previously he was using Proactive and still broke out with hug zits. After 2 months using this product we both see a huge difference. He loves it and is more confident during his puberty years.</li>
            <li> ATTENTION&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60; DO NOT BUY!!!&lt;br /&gt;Prior to buying I read all reviews and was convinced it would be a good product but it was in fact the WORST..it made me break out and cause sores on my face!</li>
            <li> Like it. Use many time</li>
            <li> works great for my teenage son</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and it works!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the large chunks of exfoliant or the brown color.  I also wasn&#x27;t expecting great results like I got.  Proactiv stopped working for me completely and I was having cystic acne worse than ever, in addition to regular acne, blackheads, and a general sallow appearance to my skin. My skin was dry and inflamed and my clogged pores couldn&#x27;t release any of the gunk. This stuff seems to change everything.  My face is glowing, the few zits I get are very small and basically similar to what you&#x27;d have after a good facial.  My blackheads take much longer to come back, and I can go a day or even several without washing my face, and I won&#x27;t break out immediately.  This product is great!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It has all natural ingredients in it, so I know I&#x27;m not putting harsh chemicals on my face like benzoyl peroxide. It worked well for me and I have had severe acne in the past.</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My daughter is using this product on her skin. It has not cleared up the acne, but it does looks somewhat better. I don&#x27;t know I will buy it again though.</li>
            <li> I have been using Acnexus for over a year, and I think it does help with keeping my adult acne under control. However, this last delivery, even though the bottle was completely covered with plastic, the product had spilled all over inside that, and it was quite a mess, not to mention that a fair amount of the (expensive!) product was wasted, having oozed all over the inside of the packaging. Like the product, wish the manufacturer would tighten the cap before sealing it!</li>
            <li> My early 20&#x27;s daughter still uses this. We tried to use another product thinking that she shouldn&#x27;t need this anymore and she broke out terrible. This has been worth the price. It is cheaper here than other places.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware!  This is a very different product than it used to be. Ingredients are quite different, and in different quantities.  The crushed walnuts that make up the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; are not ground up so fine as before.  Feels like I am scratching my face even when not scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this product any more, and I am really disappointed that the original product is no longer available.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, it leaves your skin super soft and bright.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing due to some negative reviews mostly from other sites. However, I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product! I have read that the company is a scam, if so well they&#x27;ve got me! I bought this for myself, a mid 40s woman who developed sudden skin problems in recent years, and for my teen. I must say that yes, I saw results in just one day. We have both seen remarkable results with several days use. I only use once a day at night. I have never had skin problems so as you could imagine when I started to break out I, too, quickly tried other things. Proactiv was too harsh for me, as was the OTC products...salacytic acid and benzoyl peroxide. The Clinique acne formula also did nothing to help my skin. This product smells pleasant and is not overly drying to the skin, which I was surprised about. In fact, I haven&#x27;t used a moisturizer yet. I&#x27;m examining closely to see if I will need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product absolutely is producing improvements to our skin, and my son had almost severe acne. I would recommend testing a small area of the face first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: It doesn&#x27;t lather so be careful not to use too much product. I did once and felt a tingling to my face afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be without this product again.</li>
            <li> Got this product for my wife. She uses it daily even though she objects to the strong smell. It has definitely reduced the little bit of acne on her face. Although she never had a large problem with it, it does work better to keep her skin clear than the mainstream store bought products. She uses it in the shower, but had to replace the pump with an extra one she had from another product. The pump that came with the bottle never worked.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well. I have been using it for over 5 years &amp; have awesome skin because of it. It is all natural &amp; has oils to hydrate skin so it is effective for people of all ages.</li>
            <li> I am using BOTH the Pronenix and the Acnexus. I really think they are the same, I can&#x27;t see a difference in smell, texture or performance. I LOVE them both. I use the Acnexus in the shower because of the pump, and I like to use it on my back, chest and face. Just like the Pronexin, it leaves my face soft and REALLY clean feeling! REALLY LIKE IT LOTS!!! I&#x27;ll continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Rating this a three because I have only used the product for a couple of weeks. Using it for thirty days or more provides evidence of results of daily use. So far it doesn&#x27;t keep my skin oil free all day. Even after using it twice a day. The directions call for using a washcloth to spread it around your face, but I prefer to use my hands. I have had a few breakouts, but they went away after a day or so. So far I like this product, but honestly for the cost, I&#x27;d rather look for an acne system. I will keep using it until it&#x27;s gone maybe i&#x27;ll have better results to share.</li>
            <li> a nice fine grade scrub that makes my skin feel soft after use. I have cystic acne, so I had no high hopes that this would help that greatly, but it definitely has a spa quality to it.</li>
            <li> I read all the good reviews before purchasing this acne wash.  So far so good!  I love the clean feeling my face has after washing without feeling dry.  Whiteheads I had,did come to the surface.  I have not had any major breakouts since I started using this wash but it has only been several weeks.  Will give you an update as it progresses!</li>
            <li> So far, this has really helped my acne to go away. I currently am still using this and hoping it will. The only thing that i don&#x27;t like is the fact it doesn&#x27;t foam up when i&#x27;m scrubbing it which makes it so I have to use more, but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li> It Works     Smaller pores smoother skin smells great and does a super job</li>
            <li> I used this stuff about 10 years ago to clear up acne and it was amazing.  I started using it again because I was looking for a natural exfoliant. I love love love it. Even works on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well, smells okay and feels gentle enough on my skin.  LIke the fact that is all natural too.</li>
