            <li>and this is the only one that works best in my hand.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I have bought so many products for wrinkles and firmness over the years.  </li>
            <li>This product is okay, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be truly moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>The smell is interesting too</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>It is creamy smooth and has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>the plus side the tube of moisturizer is large making it a good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it as a hand cream now because I have more useful face products for my 50+ y.o. skin/face...</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t like fragrances, this might be a good cream for you.)</li>
            <li>So far  they are the best facial probucts that I have used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see anything special about this product.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just too quick to judge on this.  </li>
            <li>Great product with visible results seen in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>it leaves your face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>(It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, tho, so</li>
            <li>I also use the whole line for my morning and evening cleanse.</li>
            <li>So far I have not seen any amazing results but the skin on these areas is not as sensitive as my facial skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent lotion, but I expected more considering the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit I ordered this product with high hopes after reading the only 2 available reviews I found.</li>
            <li>It contains a high amount of Retinol-A, and it also firms your skin.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!  </li>
            <li>I love the Firma Derm  Firm and moisturize.</li>
            <li>OMG I bought this on the off chance to try somethin new and see if it works...</li>
            <li>and since I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>Ive only used it once, it applies easily even with a small amount, pea size is enough for my face and it absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I usually do a little more research before I buy, especially something I&#x27;ll be using on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>I put it on at night after I bathe and in the morning I&#x27;m silky soft.</li>
            <li>Use this at night and use triple action vitamin c serum  and Olay Quench for morning .</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old</li>
            <li>Light enough to wear under makeup, heavy enough for a night cream</li>
            <li>Its is the first Pharmagel product That I used and it helps firm and keep my skin moisturzed.</li>

            <li> I also use it to keep my heels baby soft -- apply a very small amount to heels every time when they are damp dried after bathing or swimming.</li>
            <li> the negative side, it made my face red and blotchy, not a good look.</li>

            <li> I like it, but I am not sure if it is doing the job</li>

            <li> OMG I bought this on the off chance to try somethin new and see if it works... I put it on my stomach one night, rubbed a fair amount into the areas where the stretch marks were the worst, and when i got up the next morning, i put another coat on, but before i did i noticed my stretch marks had gone from dark purple-ish red to almost being unable to see... it gave me some hope. I have tried at least 7 different lotions and body butters since my bump has started getting bigger, and so far this stuff works wonders! Hope this helps! :)</li>
            <li> I love the Firma Derm  Firm and moisturize. Its is the first Pharmagel product That I used and it helps firm and keep my skin moisturzed. It is the reason  that I wanted to try the other Pharmagel products. So far  they are the best facial probucts that I have used.</li>
            <li> The only thing that it&#x27;s missing is an SPF. This feels great at night and if you&#x27;re not going into the sun.</li>
            <li> i used this for my hand after working in the kitchen and before sleeping. I can tell you it leaves your hand hydrated, moist and wrinkle free.&lt;br /&gt;This size last longer. In fact I&#x27;m on my second pack now! Will keep using as I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of hand lotion and this is the only one that works best in my hand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything special about this product.  I&#x27;m using it as a hand cream now because I have more useful face products for my 50+ y.o. skin/face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does list good skin care ingredients.  Maybe I&#x27;m just too quick to judge on this.  But personally, I won&#x27;t buy it again.  (It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, tho, so if you have sensitive skin or don&#x27;t like fragrances, this might be a good cream for you.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good, but not a miraculous fix</li>
            <li> I like it, but I am not sure if it is doing the job</li>
            <li> I usually get this at the beauty supply store because I&#x27;m licensed. But they have been out of it for several weeks so I looked on Amazon. Low and behold, they have it for almost the same price I pay! Thanks Amazon! I love this stuff. It is creamy smooth and has a nice light scent. Plus has age defying ingredients. I put it on at night after I bathe and in the morning I&#x27;m silky soft.</li>
            <li> Really nice lotion! It takes very little for your whole face and neck . it leaves your face feeling soft and smooth. Has great ingredients for moisturizing and wrinkles. Use this at night and use triple action vitamin c serum  and Olay Quench for morning . My wrinkles have started to disappear VERY HAPPY!  Really LOVE IT!  WILL BUY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find the perfect moisterizer. This one isn&#x27;t it for me. It&#x27;s a heavier moisterizer, and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into my face so well. I&#x27;ve been wearing it at night, since during the day it makes me quite oily.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It does what it says it does and makes your skin look very healthy.</li>
            <li> Ive only used it once, it applies easily even with a small amount, pea size is enough for my face and it absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Best moisture for your face and body. I&#x27;ve been using for 10 years. I look fab!</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and I have bought so many products for wrinkles and firmness over the years.  I bought this about a week ago and I have seen amazing results!  I can&#x27;t believe how great this product makes my skin look!  Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  It contains a high amount of Retinol-A, and it also firms your skin.  I use it on my face.  Wow!!  I just love it!</li>
            <li> Great product with visible results seen in just a few weeks. Light enough to wear under makeup, heavy enough for a night cream</li>
            <li> Have used it before but not at this low price.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be truly moisturizing.  I feel like I need something else after using it.  The smell is interesting too it reminds me of a hotel room!</li>
            <li> I have used this product since Nov 2012 and it really does firm your skin. I also use the whole line for my morning and evening cleanse. Give it a try you will see the difference...amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent lotion, but I expected more considering the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I ordered this product with high hopes after reading the only 2 available reviews I found. I usually do a little more research before I buy, especially something I&#x27;ll be using on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side the tube of moisturizer is large making it a good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, it made my face red and blotchy, not a good look. I guess the wonder ingredient retinol isn&#x27;t for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I am using this as a moisturizer on my hands,feet, and post surgical scars at night. So far I have not seen any amazing results but the skin on these areas is not as sensitive as my facial skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 5 years and I&#x27;m still going. I cant find it locally anymore and since I can&#x27;t live without it I but it online. I use it on my face twice a day.</li>
            <li> Works great. Hydrates well and leaves skin feeling moist into the next day. However I can achieve the same results using Nivea Extra Moisturizing Lotion for dry skin and it cost a heck of a lot less and can be conveniently picked up at almost any store.</li>
            <li> Great for your face. I also use it to keep my heels baby soft -- apply a very small amount to heels every time when they are damp dried after bathing or swimming.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  It keeps my face moisturized all day and may be the reason I am complimented on my skin.  Regardless, it is an excellent product for all ages.</li>
