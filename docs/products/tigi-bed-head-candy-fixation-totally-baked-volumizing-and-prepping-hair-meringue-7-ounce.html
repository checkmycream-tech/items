            <li>In my eternal search for the perfect hair product, this one is the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li>Just put a couple squirts into the palm of your hand, rub your hands together to spread the product around good, and then work through hair.</li>
            <li>I did not find this as good as Got2B Fat-tastic which always gives me lots of body, thickness, and holding.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how good it smells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to give my hair a good conditioning before I try again.  </li>
            <li>Good for someone with curly hair.</li>
            <li>: Awesome, like a light lemony scent.</li>
            <li>It also gives the slightest amount of a piecey look to layers which is good for my bulky hair.    </li>
            <li>this product is like a moose type product and didn&#x27;t do good for my hair type.</li>
            <li>(and to be completely fair, I&#x27;ve used it once...</li>
            <li>Works well, gives my hair body, prices is good</li>
            <li>The price is also a good plus too.</li>
            <li>I loved everything about this product.</li>
            <li>And the fact that it works so exceptionally well probably made the adaption easier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;it works great, smells soo good, and does everything that it says, I just love my hair when I use this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get it, considering how many great reviews the product gets.  </li>
            <li>Product has a nice smell and good hold.  </li>
            <li>I have used many many volumizers over the years, and this one is incredible.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It gives my hair SO much more volume and it feels thicker too!</li>

            <li>The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have and trick is not to use too much.</li>
            <li>, I get nice volume without weight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a foam, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I would buy this again just for the smell.  </li>
            <li>The best for naturally wavy hair!!!</li>

            <li>I have medium length VERY fine hair.</li>
            <li>The wife loves this stuff for her very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It smelled great and it worked nicely on my hair, but I had to discard the whole bottle because of what it did to my hands.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product it gives you great volume and added some nice shine to boot.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the most useful product to be honest, and with a scent like that...don&#x27;t bother!</li>

            <li>LOVE</li>

            <li>I am constantly looking for the perfect volumizing hair product.</li>

            <li>Oh I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have semi-short hair and use maybe 3 or 4 squirts at the MOST.</li>
            <li>My favorite mouse of all time</li>
            <li>It also smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t run out.</li>

            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this many times and just can&#x27;t tell if there&#x27;s a difference between when I use it and when I don&#x27;t...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take alot of this product to do the job, and I love that.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I went out and bought my own bottle</li>
            <li>this stuff smells great and works very well.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love Bed Head Products, but this one I rate with 4 stars.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get much better</li>
            <li>It is just ok.  </li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t use this over drying product if you love your hair</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>except generally okay</li>
            <li>The more you use the stiffer your hair gets too.  </li>
            <li>And, yes, I did use this product appropriately. . .</li>
            <li>I love this product, I get lift &amp; volume to my finer hair&lt;</li>
            <li>is my favorite product  of my salon.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I thought, why not use more?</li>
            <li>Love it, Love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting better but still give your hair some volume.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love this stuff and we can buy it cheaper on line than in the salon</li>
            <li>Instead I paid more and bought</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I am already gonna have to order more</li>
            <li>I love Tigi Bed Head and their super innovative and amazing products.</li>
            <li>In searching for the next best hair product for baby fine hair, I&#x27;ve tried MANY...</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very full, looks fuller/has more volume, and it gives my hair body.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works with your hair to get it into a nice workable style!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I have fine hair that is just above my shoulder.</li>
            <li>I only use about 1 pump every time I use it and the volume is perfect for my baby fine, short/medium length hair.</li>
            <li>Great for fine hair..although you&#x27;ve got to use very sparingly~</li>
            <li>I love my hair when its fabulous, and I love weed.</li>
            <li>So if nice smelling hair is worth the price to you, I would say to give Candy Fixation a try.</li>
            <li>Go easy on the amount.</li>
            <li>I also like the pump so easy to control amount.</li>
            <li>Pay way more but much more worth it than this stuff.</li>
            <li>first I found the very sweet smell a bit over-powering and wasn&#x27;t sure if I was able to adapt to this, but I have.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine with a mix of waves and cork screw curls and damages easy</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and this made it feel like had glue in my hair.</li>
            <li>Does not work well with my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>As the previous reviewers have said, this smells great!</li>
            <li>I have a ton of fine, and it tends to get a bit oily around my scalp.</li>
            <li>It gives me great volume and makes it easier to back comb.</li>
            <li>I cut my hair off into a very short pixie and this stuff still works great for my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a light weight pump of foam that will give your hair texture &amp; body.</li>
            <li>Not only that, the product acutally works great for curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>This product smells amazing the mousse aspect of it however doesn&#x27;t have much holding power</li>
            <li>I used this last night and it held up great.</li>
            <li>mousse offers a lot more than just a &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; smell (and let&#x27;s be honest-</li>
            <li>I have beautiful long brown hair</li>
            <li>and then one more pump evenly distributed all around) and try it on off days like the weekend until you get the right amount for your hair length and type.</li>
            <li>When I use it and then blow dry, it really poofs up my hair, gives great volume!</li>
            <li>I have to say, the difference was amazing, I went from &#x27;loser hair&#x27; to a finally &#x27;normal looking hair&#x27;.</li>
            <li>BOUGHT THIS ORIGINALLY FROM A HAIR SALON.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find them on amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty outstanding.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about trying this</li>
            <li>Great product, really defines and holds my natural curls.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells sweet, kinda like candy, I prefer clean to sweet, but</li>
            <li>Great product, arrived as expected.</li>
            <li>ALOT MORE REASONABLE PRICE THRU AMAZON.</li>
            <li>For A Day is a better root volumizer and has a much cleaner scent and feel.</li>
            <li>This stuff adds volume and texture even after I straighten my hair, and it has the slightest smell of sweet lemons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(although I also use some volumizing Bed Head Superstar products before that, so they help too) but most importantly, it REALLY is a PREPPING</li>
            <li>It makes my hair full, it feels thicker and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>One full pump...</li>
            <li>She was reviewing some sweet smelling products.</li>
            <li>I have fine and thin hair, so this worked perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>If you love big hair, you will love this product.</li>
            <li>I got lucky while on vacation and went into a salon for a trim.</li>
            <li>I received it really quick</li>
            <li>The scent is awesome at first but may clash with other hair products you use it with, I&#x27;ve never had much of a problem with it</li>
            <li>The product was okay, the seller was great, but the Totally Baked caused the same allergic reaction on my hands that the Tigi Mega Whip did.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a lot in the bottle, it is easy to apply, and you don&#x27;t need to add much.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky, unless I use too much; however, I usually use 2-3 pumps on my roots, and it works perfect.</li>
            <li>I am growing out my hair and it is just getting to almost shoulders and this has made the wait of growing so much easier and easy to control.</li>
            <li>The lady who does my hair used this on me when she styled my hair and at first sniff I had to have it!</li>
            <li>The lemon scent is light and smells good throughout the day - not overwhelming, just light.</li>
            <li>No joke, this stuff smells exactly like lemon meringue pie!</li>
            <li>First off, it smells HEAVENLY!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for fine hair.</li>
            <li>have a lot of hair, but the texture is very silky and fine.</li>
            <li>Using this mousse seems to help control oil at my scalp and helps keep my hair looking fresh in between washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first time I tried it I put 1 full pump on my hair</li>
            <li>and I have gotten numerous compliments on how nice my hair smells when I use it.  </li>
            <li>There is no other hair product of this nature that is anywhere near as good.  </li>
            <li>From reading the reviews, this seemed like the right product to add some &amp;#34;oomf&amp;#34; to my hair.</li>
            <li>The plus side is when you do use the right amount  </li>
            <li>price is right and smells awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use!</li>
            <li>I love it for just a little body on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I may find better use for it in the summer when my hair can get a bit more dried out.</li>
            <li>meringue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight hair.</li>
            <li>I use a big squirt of this foam and rub it into my scalp on the top part of my hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper to buy on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update!</li>
            <li>This product gives me so much bounce and body!  </li>
            <li>This is the first thing I have used that gives my hair volume.</li>
            <li>The first time that I used this mousse, I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it from a friend.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is ok.</li>
            <li>;) )</li>
            <li>(Again, I have many layers and the longest parts of my hair go until above my butt).</li>
            <li>I first heard about this product from a blogger, kandee johnson.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, long waves and this is the best volumizing product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but if you have hard to handle hair, don&#x27;t use more than two pumps (I do them one at a time and use the first pump on the crown and top where I want</li>
            <li>I use a flat iron and my hair is more manageable with this product.</li>
            <li>I had a really hard time successfully giving my hair</li>
            <li>I use 11/2 pump and run it through my hair and air dry, looks great all day long...</li>
            <li>Toss this in my damp hair, take a hit of your favorite bud, blow dry a bit, girl, you will look stellar.</li>
            <li>I love that if I have it in and my hair goes flat throughout the day or after wearing a hat, I can easily &#x27;mold&#x27; it back to how I want it.</li>
            <li>At first I was not sure how I liked the texture of the product as it made my hair feel like I had been in a dust storm, but the benefits far outweight the feel which I adapted to very quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...smells yummy, one bottle lasts a long time and works well providing lift and fullness to hair.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but not sure if it does what its supposed to.</li>
            <li>It gives it a nice little boost, and I might supplement my roots with extra volumizing stuff if I want to look extra good.</li>
            <li>I found this on Amazon for less and it arrived very quickly with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Then blow dry and watch the magic happen.</li>
            <li>The only downside I can see is that it does have a fairly strong smell (almost like coconut).</li>
            <li>I am so happy to FINALLY have something that works well, does NOT weigh my hair down, does NOT feel like a wax product, and makes my hair look and feel 30 times thicker.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use it with a certain hairspray because of this.  </li>
            <li>Totally Baked has done wonders for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>On to the actual product... it seems to hold my styling a little more than nothing, but not anything outstanding.</li>
            <li>Now I just wish they had a hairspray that smelled just as sweet because the hairsprays I&#x27;ve used cover up the delicious smell of this product :(</li>
            <li>thinking maybe I just put too much on</li>
            <li>Really brings out the curl too.</li>
            <li>This product very give you volume</li>
            <li>Been using this product for awhile and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair very sticky.</li>
            <li>This mousse is really great on my thin hair.  </li>
            <li>My Hair is straight this product did not impart body, style or curls.  </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;mousse&amp;#34; works very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care much for this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even touch my hair with my fingers or have it touch my face because it&#x27;s a very sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give as much volume as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>If you use too much</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really like having tacky paste in your hair..</li>
            <li>but I really, really did not like how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really like the smell too much.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and this works great for me.</li>
            <li>Its lightweight and really helps give my hair body and texture.</li>
            <li>I really like these products and the way the smell.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair much fuller looking.</li>
            <li>It adds so much volume and texture to it</li>
            <li>they really do thanks to this meringue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Made my hair really sticky and greasy...</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>I used this product sparingly (2 pumps) on wet hair, just on the top.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and does not make my hair look like it has mousse in it,</li>
            <li>I have thinner hair and have trouble keeping it looking fab without some kind of product, which as you know ladies, turns into a freaking plethora of damn products.</li>
            <li>, the smell was the only thing I liked about this product but it will be going back.</li>
            <li>when I use Totally Baked, then add a curl spray (I use the GHD curl spray, but it&#x27;s not as effective if I don&#x27;t use Totally Baked before it) before using my curling iron, my curls and waves stay in my hair for DAYS!</li>
            <li>I found the smell to be subtle but pleasant.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, especially on fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, flat hair and</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this product works wonders for providing volume without being greasy or weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this one because it seemed to have so many good reviews, but I actually had such a different experience that I checked the bottle a few times to make sure I got the same product as everyone else!</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine grey hair</li>
            <li>but once you dry it, it&#x27;s totally fine.</li>
            <li>I am very thankful because it seems like every time I have a new style I need a new product!</li>
            <li>you have super short hair</li>
            <li>I avoid putting it at the roots, and mainly use it on my ends.</li>
            <li>Closest to my favorite (Catwalk Fashionista Big and Bigger) that they no longer make.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super sticky and gross feeling.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, stops fly aways and calms my hair down.</li>
            <li>am currently using 16 different Bed Head products so I can really compare how effective the different products of the line are.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, which I have had a hard time finding a product that will keep it full looking all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sad too because the smellll and look it gives my hair is great.</li>
            <li>So far this product works really well.</li>
            <li>The hair feels much thicker, but remains soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to cause dryness and turns my normally sleek hair into fuzz that begs to be conditioned.  </li>
            <li>I have used many other volumizing mousse, but no other product works as well as this.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and would not use it if you have fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li>Luckily the scent fades pretty quickly, so it&#x27;s not in your hair all day, but</li>
            <li>sweet smell, not much effect, makes hair dull.not good for thin hair</li>
            <li>My new go to mousse.</li>
            <li>I figured I didn&#x27;t give it a good enough try, so I&#x27;d tried a few more times after that with only a little bit.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice; it&#x27;s seriously smells like meringue.  </li>
            <li>I have fine flat hair and this product actually makes me feel like I have hair.</li>
            <li>, I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I like Bedhead Small Talk better and would recommend that over this one.</li>
            <li>Wow, it gave my roots volume!</li>
            <li>Made my fine hair a sticky mess.</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that it makes my hair kind of sticky, or make it feel like you haven&#x27;t showered and make you think that your hair is a mess, when it actually looks really nice, but I guess that was happens when you add products to your hair.</li>
            <li>I have reasonably good hair, average thickness and shine, but it requires a little teasing and product to give it body and help it stay in place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m attempting to actually learn to LIKE my hair curly and so far, this product has really helped!</li>
            <li>I love the volume whether I put it in dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li>My hair just always reverts back to its natural, straight state.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job with short hair.</li>
            <li>And wow, does it ever!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My natural hair is frizzy, so I have to straighten it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>They have never lasted in my hair (even when a professional stylist did it for my friend&#x27;s wedding.</li>
            <li>I have to tell you, I completely agree.</li>
            <li>Bumble and Bumble curl conscious Calming Creme.</li>
            <li>But also, if I want my curls wild for an evening out, it works for that too.</li>
            <li>They feel soft too.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to smell I would skip this product.</li>
            <li>I have thick healthy hair</li>
            <li>I recently had my stylist give me a textured short A-cut which could have gone bad in so many ways; my hair is SUPER fine.</li>
            <li>Gone are the days of fine hair frizz from past perms...</li>
            <li>I may try again using less and edit my review)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a product worth trying - and seriously, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have very full thick hair</li>
            <li>As every girl with straight hair it seems, I long for curls and waves.</li>
            <li>but I also really wanted to test out how long my curls would</li>
            <li>Works well,  just be careful not to use too much!</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin, so that may be why it doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
            <li>Recently discovered it, now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does what it says and really gives some umph and nice texture to my hair, but it makes my hair just feel REALLY DIRTY and waxy.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair dry and doesn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think that any hair product can help my hair enough for me to swear by it though, and Candy Fixation is not any different.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how many reviews I read that said they loved the scent because this product smells disgusting!</li>
            <li>I have thick hair, which means it flattens out very quickly if I don&#x27;t use mousse.</li>
            <li>I have normal to fine dark brown hair with a little natural wave.</li>
            <li>It does seem to dull the shine and leave a residue in hair, but if you need volume for fine hair, this is the one.</li>
            <li>I have fine thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have a huge supply of hair products I try to tame this unruly hair and get some volume without weighing it down too much.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m willing to give it another try, but it was not a good experience the first time.</li>
            <li>But you must be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li>Probably the fragrance, since I am prone to eczema and it is sometimes caused by fragrances.  :o</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair with a bit of natural curl.  </li>
            <li>It smelled delicious, but it made it a bit hard to dry with my hair dryer and it was certainly difficult to run my fingers through.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel comfortable with this stuff in my hair, so only wear it on late night dates where I know I&#x27;ll get to shower it out soon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I used too much or maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t wet enough when I used this product</li>
            <li>and I agree, a little sticky at first</li>
            <li>Also, I have fine, thin, long hair, and without blow drying my hair, it is completely straight and flat.</li>
            <li>I will say that a little definitely goes a long way when it comes to the amount you need to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it makes your hair feel a little bit dry, but it really does it&#x27;s job quite well!!</li>
            <li>i have VERY fine, VERY thin hair.</li>
            <li>My sister has fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone that has fine or thin hair and looking for a product that volumizes without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li>Again, out of all the gels, mouse (Height of Glam mouse by Vavoom runs a close second but thickens my hair a little too much)</li>

            <li> Good for someone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> : Awesome, like a light lemony scent.</li>
            <li> It also gives the slightest amount of a piecey look to layers which is good for my bulky hair.    </li>
            <li> this product is like a moose type product and didn&#x27;t do good for my hair type.</li>
            <li> (and to be completely fair, I&#x27;ve used it once...</li>
            <li> Works well, gives my hair body, prices is good</li>

            <li> The wife loves this stuff for her very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It smelled great and it worked nicely on my hair, but I had to discard the whole bottle because of what it did to my hands.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product it gives you great volume and added some nice shine to boot.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the most useful product to be honest, and with a scent like that...don&#x27;t bother!</li>

            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love Bed Head Products, but this one I rate with 4 stars.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get much better</li>
            <li> It is just ok.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t use this over drying product if you love your hair</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> except generally okay</li>
            <li> The more you use the stiffer your hair gets too.  </li>
            <li> And, yes, I did use this product appropriately. . .</li>
            <li> I love this product, I get lift &amp; volume to my finer hair&lt;</li>
            <li> is my favorite product  of my salon.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I thought, why not use more?</li>
            <li> Love it, Love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting better but still give your hair some volume.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this stuff and we can buy it cheaper on line than in the salon</li>
            <li> Instead I paid more and bought</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I am already gonna have to order more</li>
            <li> I love Tigi Bed Head and their super innovative and amazing products.</li>
            <li> In searching for the next best hair product for baby fine hair, I&#x27;ve tried MANY...</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very full, looks fuller/has more volume, and it gives my hair body.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works with your hair to get it into a nice workable style!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I have fine hair that is just above my shoulder.</li>
            <li> I only use about 1 pump every time I use it and the volume is perfect for my baby fine, short/medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair..although you&#x27;ve got to use very sparingly~</li>
            <li> I love my hair when its fabulous, and I love weed.</li>
            <li> So if nice smelling hair is worth the price to you, I would say to give Candy Fixation a try.</li>
            <li> Go easy on the amount.</li>
            <li> I also like the pump so easy to control amount.</li>
            <li> Pay way more but much more worth it than this stuff.</li>
            <li> first I found the very sweet smell a bit over-powering and wasn&#x27;t sure if I was able to adapt to this, but I have.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine with a mix of waves and cork screw curls and damages easy</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and this made it feel like had glue in my hair.</li>
            <li> Does not work well with my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> As the previous reviewers have said, this smells great!</li>
            <li> I have a ton of fine, and it tends to get a bit oily around my scalp.</li>
            <li> It gives me great volume and makes it easier to back comb.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair off into a very short pixie and this stuff still works great for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a light weight pump of foam that will give your hair texture &amp; body.</li>
            <li> Not only that, the product acutally works great for curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing the mousse aspect of it however doesn&#x27;t have much holding power</li>
            <li> I used this last night and it held up great.</li>
            <li> mousse offers a lot more than just a &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; smell (and let&#x27;s be honest-</li>
            <li> I have beautiful long brown hair</li>
            <li> and then one more pump evenly distributed all around) and try it on off days like the weekend until you get the right amount for your hair length and type.</li>
            <li> When I use it and then blow dry, it really poofs up my hair, gives great volume!</li>
            <li> I have to say, the difference was amazing, I went from &#x27;loser hair&#x27; to a finally &#x27;normal looking hair&#x27;.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS ORIGINALLY FROM A HAIR SALON.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find them on amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty outstanding.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about trying this</li>
            <li> Great product, really defines and holds my natural curls.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells sweet, kinda like candy, I prefer clean to sweet, but</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> ALOT MORE REASONABLE PRICE THRU AMAZON.</li>
            <li> For A Day is a better root volumizer and has a much cleaner scent and feel.</li>
            <li> This stuff adds volume and texture even after I straighten my hair, and it has the slightest smell of sweet lemons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (although I also use some volumizing Bed Head Superstar products before that, so they help too) but most importantly, it REALLY is a PREPPING</li>
            <li> It makes my hair full, it feels thicker and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> One full pump...</li>
            <li> She was reviewing some sweet smelling products.</li>
            <li> I have fine and thin hair, so this worked perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> If you love big hair, you will love this product.</li>
            <li> I got lucky while on vacation and went into a salon for a trim.</li>
            <li> I received it really quick</li>
            <li> The scent is awesome at first but may clash with other hair products you use it with, I&#x27;ve never had much of a problem with it</li>
            <li> The product was okay, the seller was great, but the Totally Baked caused the same allergic reaction on my hands that the Tigi Mega Whip did.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot in the bottle, it is easy to apply, and you don&#x27;t need to add much.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky, unless I use too much; however, I usually use 2-3 pumps on my roots, and it works perfect.</li>
            <li> I am growing out my hair and it is just getting to almost shoulders and this has made the wait of growing so much easier and easy to control.</li>
            <li> The lady who does my hair used this on me when she styled my hair and at first sniff I had to have it!</li>
            <li> The lemon scent is light and smells good throughout the day - not overwhelming, just light.</li>
            <li> No joke, this stuff smells exactly like lemon meringue pie!</li>
            <li> First off, it smells HEAVENLY!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for fine hair.</li>
            <li> have a lot of hair, but the texture is very silky and fine.</li>
            <li> Using this mousse seems to help control oil at my scalp and helps keep my hair looking fresh in between washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first time I tried it I put 1 full pump on my hair</li>
            <li> and I have gotten numerous compliments on how nice my hair smells when I use it.  </li>
            <li> There is no other hair product of this nature that is anywhere near as good.  </li>
            <li> From reading the reviews, this seemed like the right product to add some &amp;#34;oomf&amp;#34; to my hair.</li>
            <li> The plus side is when you do use the right amount  </li>
            <li> price is right and smells awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use!</li>
            <li> I love it for just a little body on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I may find better use for it in the summer when my hair can get a bit more dried out.</li>
            <li> meringue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight hair.</li>
            <li> I use a big squirt of this foam and rub it into my scalp on the top part of my hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much cheaper to buy on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update!</li>
            <li> This product gives me so much bounce and body!  </li>
            <li> This is the first thing I have used that gives my hair volume.</li>
            <li> The first time that I used this mousse, I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it from a friend.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is ok.</li>
            <li> ;) )</li>
            <li> (Again, I have many layers and the longest parts of my hair go until above my butt).</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product from a blogger, kandee johnson.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, long waves and this is the best volumizing product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> but if you have hard to handle hair, don&#x27;t use more than two pumps (I do them one at a time and use the first pump on the crown and top where I want</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron and my hair is more manageable with this product.</li>
            <li> I had a really hard time successfully giving my hair</li>
            <li> I use 11/2 pump and run it through my hair and air dry, looks great all day long...</li>
            <li> Toss this in my damp hair, take a hit of your favorite bud, blow dry a bit, girl, you will look stellar.</li>
            <li> I love that if I have it in and my hair goes flat throughout the day or after wearing a hat, I can easily &#x27;mold&#x27; it back to how I want it.</li>
            <li> At first I was not sure how I liked the texture of the product as it made my hair feel like I had been in a dust storm, but the benefits far outweight the feel which I adapted to very quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...smells yummy, one bottle lasts a long time and works well providing lift and fullness to hair.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but not sure if it does what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> It gives it a nice little boost, and I might supplement my roots with extra volumizing stuff if I want to look extra good.</li>
            <li> I found this on Amazon for less and it arrived very quickly with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Then blow dry and watch the magic happen.</li>
            <li> The only downside I can see is that it does have a fairly strong smell (almost like coconut).</li>
            <li> I am so happy to FINALLY have something that works well, does NOT weigh my hair down, does NOT feel like a wax product, and makes my hair look and feel 30 times thicker.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use it with a certain hairspray because of this.  </li>
            <li> Totally Baked has done wonders for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> On to the actual product... it seems to hold my styling a little more than nothing, but not anything outstanding.</li>
            <li> Now I just wish they had a hairspray that smelled just as sweet because the hairsprays I&#x27;ve used cover up the delicious smell of this product :(</li>
            <li> thinking maybe I just put too much on</li>
            <li> Really brings out the curl too.</li>
            <li> This product very give you volume</li>
            <li> Been using this product for awhile and really like it.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair very sticky.</li>
            <li> This mousse is really great on my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> My Hair is straight this product did not impart body, style or curls.  </li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;mousse&amp;#34; works very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much for this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even touch my hair with my fingers or have it touch my face because it&#x27;s a very sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give as much volume as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> If you use too much</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really like having tacky paste in your hair..</li>
            <li> but I really, really did not like how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really like the smell too much.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this works great for me.</li>
            <li> Its lightweight and really helps give my hair body and texture.</li>
            <li> I really like these products and the way the smell.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair much fuller looking.</li>
            <li> It adds so much volume and texture to it</li>
            <li> they really do thanks to this meringue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Made my hair really sticky and greasy...</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I used this product sparingly (2 pumps) on wet hair, just on the top.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and does not make my hair look like it has mousse in it,</li>
            <li> I have thinner hair and have trouble keeping it looking fab without some kind of product, which as you know ladies, turns into a freaking plethora of damn products.</li>
            <li> , the smell was the only thing I liked about this product but it will be going back.</li>
            <li> when I use Totally Baked, then add a curl spray (I use the GHD curl spray, but it&#x27;s not as effective if I don&#x27;t use Totally Baked before it) before using my curling iron, my curls and waves stay in my hair for DAYS!</li>
            <li> I found the smell to be subtle but pleasant.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, especially on fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, flat hair and</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product works wonders for providing volume without being greasy or weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this one because it seemed to have so many good reviews, but I actually had such a different experience that I checked the bottle a few times to make sure I got the same product as everyone else!</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine grey hair</li>
            <li> but once you dry it, it&#x27;s totally fine.</li>
            <li> I am very thankful because it seems like every time I have a new style I need a new product!</li>
            <li> you have super short hair</li>
            <li> I avoid putting it at the roots, and mainly use it on my ends.</li>
            <li> Closest to my favorite (Catwalk Fashionista Big and Bigger) that they no longer make.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also super sticky and gross feeling.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, stops fly aways and calms my hair down.</li>
            <li> am currently using 16 different Bed Head products so I can really compare how effective the different products of the line are.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, which I have had a hard time finding a product that will keep it full looking all day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad too because the smellll and look it gives my hair is great.</li>
            <li> So far this product works really well.</li>
            <li> The hair feels much thicker, but remains soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to cause dryness and turns my normally sleek hair into fuzz that begs to be conditioned.  </li>
            <li> I have used many other volumizing mousse, but no other product works as well as this.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and would not use it if you have fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li> Luckily the scent fades pretty quickly, so it&#x27;s not in your hair all day, but</li>
            <li> sweet smell, not much effect, makes hair dull.not good for thin hair</li>
            <li> My new go to mousse.</li>
            <li> I figured I didn&#x27;t give it a good enough try, so I&#x27;d tried a few more times after that with only a little bit.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice; it&#x27;s seriously smells like meringue.  </li>
            <li> I have fine flat hair and this product actually makes me feel like I have hair.</li>
            <li> , I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I like Bedhead Small Talk better and would recommend that over this one.</li>
            <li> Wow, it gave my roots volume!</li>
            <li> Made my fine hair a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it makes my hair kind of sticky, or make it feel like you haven&#x27;t showered and make you think that your hair is a mess, when it actually looks really nice, but I guess that was happens when you add products to your hair.</li>
            <li> I have reasonably good hair, average thickness and shine, but it requires a little teasing and product to give it body and help it stay in place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m attempting to actually learn to LIKE my hair curly and so far, this product has really helped!</li>
            <li> I love the volume whether I put it in dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li> My hair just always reverts back to its natural, straight state.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job with short hair.</li>
            <li> And wow, does it ever!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My natural hair is frizzy, so I have to straighten it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> They have never lasted in my hair (even when a professional stylist did it for my friend&#x27;s wedding.</li>
            <li> I have to tell you, I completely agree.</li>
            <li> Bumble and Bumble curl conscious Calming Creme.</li>
            <li> But also, if I want my curls wild for an evening out, it works for that too.</li>
            <li> They feel soft too.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smell I would skip this product.</li>
            <li> I have thick healthy hair</li>
            <li> I recently had my stylist give me a textured short A-cut which could have gone bad in so many ways; my hair is SUPER fine.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of fine hair frizz from past perms...</li>
            <li> I may try again using less and edit my review)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a product worth trying - and seriously, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have very full thick hair</li>
            <li> As every girl with straight hair it seems, I long for curls and waves.</li>
            <li> but I also really wanted to test out how long my curls would</li>
            <li> Works well,  just be careful not to use too much!</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and thin, so that may be why it doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
            <li> Recently discovered it, now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does what it says and really gives some umph and nice texture to my hair, but it makes my hair just feel REALLY DIRTY and waxy.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair dry and doesn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think that any hair product can help my hair enough for me to swear by it though, and Candy Fixation is not any different.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how many reviews I read that said they loved the scent because this product smells disgusting!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, which means it flattens out very quickly if I don&#x27;t use mousse.</li>
            <li> I have normal to fine dark brown hair with a little natural wave.</li>
            <li> It does seem to dull the shine and leave a residue in hair, but if you need volume for fine hair, this is the one.</li>
            <li> I have fine thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have a huge supply of hair products I try to tame this unruly hair and get some volume without weighing it down too much.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m willing to give it another try, but it was not a good experience the first time.</li>
            <li> But you must be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li> Probably the fragrance, since I am prone to eczema and it is sometimes caused by fragrances.  :o</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair with a bit of natural curl.  </li>
            <li> It smelled delicious, but it made it a bit hard to dry with my hair dryer and it was certainly difficult to run my fingers through.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t feel comfortable with this stuff in my hair, so only wear it on late night dates where I know I&#x27;ll get to shower it out soon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I used too much or maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t wet enough when I used this product</li>
            <li> and I agree, a little sticky at first</li>
            <li> Also, I have fine, thin, long hair, and without blow drying my hair, it is completely straight and flat.</li>
            <li> I will say that a little definitely goes a long way when it comes to the amount you need to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it makes your hair feel a little bit dry, but it really does it&#x27;s job quite well!!</li>
            <li> i have VERY fine, VERY thin hair.</li>
            <li> My sister has fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone that has fine or thin hair and looking for a product that volumizes without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> Again, out of all the gels, mouse (Height of Glam mouse by Vavoom runs a close second but thickens my hair a little too much)</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;ll work for someone with thick hair, but my hair is more sparse and doesn&#x27;t do well with heavy products.</li>
            <li> there are many times i insert hairpieces or outright full wigs because i get so frustrated with the change in my hair texture!  </li>
            <li> My styling routine after adding Totally Baked is a flat iron, backcombing, and some hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go overboard and use too much or your hair will feel sticky after drying it.</li>
            <li> But, after I straighten it, my hair becomes lifeless and flat.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short, my hair looked like an atomic mushroom cloud.</li>
            <li> so it likes to fall flat with all of its weight and humidity in Florida.</li>
            <li> So out comes the shine spray which made my hair flat</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and don&#x27;t mind the texture this leaves because it makes my hair look full.  </li>
            <li> but it felt totally thick again and gave me a much fuller look all over!  </li>
            <li> It is bulky a little wavy but only here and there and getting a good haircut is next to impossible.</li>
            <li> One bottle will last you a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually product weighs my hair down, but I found that I need four pumps of the product to obtain the right styling consistency which allows for the needed control.  </li>
            <li> Very........ Plastic, and dull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but disappointing.</li>
            <li> It smells like cake (literally) and a lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used about 4 puffs and worked it into the crown and back of my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> will keep buying it as long as i can find it.</li>
            <li> I went 3 days once just because I wanted to see how long they lasted</li>
            <li> Although I forced it into curling by over heat-styling it,  it didn&#x27;t take much of a breeze to make pieces stick out.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin / fine hair.</li>
            <li> (I have PCOS, most of it just falls out sadly), this product doesnt weigh my hair down...</li>
            <li> (I use various other products before that.</li>
            <li> I blow dry some days or let it naturally dry others, either way it works.</li>
            <li> Blow dry for like 2 min (if that) until dry.</li>
            <li> use this in my hair while blow-drying when my hair is ALMOST completely dry.</li>
            <li> , I just work it in and dry.</li>
            <li> This made my hair dry, brittle feeling and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry and used two pumps.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and thin, just above shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Really gives the hair body and makes my hair easier to tame when blowdrying using a round brush.</li>
            <li> My hair texture is slightly coarse and wavy with average thickness.</li>
            <li> The product gives you that dirty feel for easy styling while maintaining volume.</li>
            <li> I have long straight thin hair ..</li>
            <li> I only use about a pump and a half.</li>
            <li> After blowing it dry, it was so sticky that I broke ends trying to comb it through, and my In-Styler curling iron was almost useless, a tool that is normally fantastic for adding body, shine, and just a little curl.  </li>
            <li> just a tiny little amount, hoping to avoid that.</li>
            <li> But, I only used a little and my hair looked like a cheep wig.</li>
            <li> It makes your ends feel rough but will let up overnight.</li>
            <li> Just bought a few extra bottles in case it is ever discontinued.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not ready to toss it out just yet</li>
            <li> It gives me body to my thin straight hair!I</li>
            <li> have really thick hair and a lot of it which makes it flat unless I back comb it.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I think with this product, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Btw, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> I work it in to wet hair and then blow dry with a round brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews that says it is sticky</li>
            <li> other than making my hair sticky.</li>
            <li> You definitely only need a small amount, if you over due it your going to have the grossest feeling hair ever.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s been left in the sun for a few days, or something!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comparing this to other mousses I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> All the other mousses I&#x27;ve bought at a grocery or drug store so my expectations weren&#x27;t too fancy.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anything other than the smell.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and it can be difficult to judge how much to use.</li>
            <li> But like other reviews use less then u think..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the one to use products in my hair all that much, but I was getting bored with my dull, short hair and wanted to do something about it.</li>
            <li> (my hair is long, past my shoulders).</li>
            <li> Seems people love or hate it</li>
            <li> Finally a product that doesn&#x27;t leave my waves crunchy nor weigh them down!!!</li>
            <li> It gives body and lift without weighting down my hair or leaving it sticky.  </li>
            <li> Every product I have tried weighs my hair down or ends up looking and feeling like floor wax.</li>
            <li> so it tends to weigh down no matter what I put in it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair TOO weighed down or greasy to where I couldn&#x27;t use it, but there&#x27;s no chance I could&#x27;ve gone a day without washing in between.  </li>
            <li> However, it also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel like it has a ton of product in it</li>
            <li> Is not to heavy on hair as other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Everything else weighs my hair down by the end of the day and it become limp.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel dry and hard.</li>
            <li> the past, I have used thickeners (such as Bamboo, Bumble &amp; Bumble Thick-</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, nor did it become stiff.</li>
            <li> It was a little crispy which Got2B is not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Volume: a little bit.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t really do much for me except make my hair look dirty.  </li>
            <li> My hair was not controllable as even straightening  my hair rendered uneven texture.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have it for a few months.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money in my mind.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear this at all in warm weather because the combination of sweat and this stuff just seems like the worst idea</li>
            <li> A messy do.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Im not a huge fan of the smell, but it thankfully fades as your hair dries</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling a little dirty, stiff and sticky and my curls get really tangled with it.</li>
            <li> so I added Velcro rollers for a half an hour and voila!</li>
            <li> It holds without being sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> little product makes tons of volume and the fragrance is ymmy!</li>
            <li> And you need very little.</li>
            <li> I have tried small amounts of it</li>
            <li> Then I use a paste to make it messy!</li>
            <li> It pumps out instead of the usual mousse that is creamy and fluffier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile and usually buy it at the hairdresser.</li>
            <li> My hair is gummy and yucky with just a small amount</li>
            <li> I am not sure what type of curls this product would work on, but it was not mine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure how or when to use this product.</li>
            <li> and I used a small amount of this foam, and my hair immediately felt synthetic and likes a Barbie&#x27;s hair without the shine.</li>
            <li> It was awful, my hair was gross and greasy right after a shower, I&#x27;d never experienced anything like that with any other mousse!</li>
            <li> When you order things offline (instead of in a hair salon) be prepared for bottles of old product that have gone bad.</li>
            <li> I have short hair now, but I wish I had found this mousse before cutting my hair off</li>
            <li> It was quite a test, because I wanted to wash my hair and it was weird trying not to get it wet</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do note that when I say texture, I mean course texture.</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Plus, Got2B lasts forever and is much less expensive.</li>
            <li> so this product had some serious contenders.  </li>
            <li> bought this months and months ago and have probably only used it a handful of times just because of how bad it makes me feel.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores!</li>
            <li> I wish this product wasn&#x27;t so hard to find!  </li>
            <li> It gives me enough volume to hide the awful haircut I have and camouflage the uneven layers while I let it grow out once again</li>
            <li> some poor before I started using this,</li>
            <li> In Spray and Redken Guts), but they are unnecessary when I use this product.</li>
            <li> I just was to tired to start over.</li>
            <li> Regardless, it makes my hair look and feel sticky/greasy and dirty immediately, and dull.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy this.</li>
            <li> Omg, my hair looks like do do, think ill just stay in.</li>
            <li> for me it is a one-day treatment … feels horrible the next day!</li>
            <li> Im giving it three stars for the moment, once I try the product out again, ill update.</li>
            <li> Three gave me some body but also makes my hair feel dirty and weird.  </li>
            <li> but it makes my hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> but it still felt dirty.</li>
            <li> It gives your hair that dirty texture that the powders do and allows me to curl my hair...</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Throw away all of your mousse, it&#x27;s useless compared to this!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and not a lot of it ...  :(</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> goopey chances are you got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair looked bad, felt *</li>
            <li> It looked so bad</li>
            <li> This is grrrreat for my damn thin, unforgivingly boring hair.</li>
            <li> I got swollen, painful, blisters all over my hands from using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with Bed Head products.</li>
            <li> Idiot me</li>
            <li> I have yet to receive anything that has gone bad, and hopefully it stays that way!</li>
            <li> Hate this product!!</li>
            <li> It was horrible!!!</li>
            <li> disgusting*, and was unmanagable.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t touch your hair, it will feel nasty and greasy.</li>
            <li> I have a horrible time with  my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the worst styling product I&#x27;ve ever used my life!</li>
            <li> Blech!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS ORIGINALLY FROM A HAIR SALON. LOVE THIS ON MY SHORT HAIR. ALOT MORE REASONABLE PRICE THRU AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Excellent for volume and control.  Been using it for years.  A can lasts 8 to 9 months with daily use.  My favorite.</li>
            <li> I am constantly looking for the perfect volumizing hair product. This is not it. It has a nice lemony scent to it but it makes my hair feel dirty. I have tried small amounts of it thinking maybe I just put too much on but it still felt dirty. It did not provide my hair with more volume either.</li>
            <li> Oh I love this stuff. I love the smell!!! But you must be careful not to use too much or you&#x27;ll end up having to wash your hair again. I have semi-short hair and use maybe 3 or 4 squirts at the MOST. If you love big hair, you will love this product. When I use it and then blow dry, it really poofs up my hair, gives great volume! Really brings out the curl too. One bottle will last you a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have super short hair you will probably only need 1-2 squirts. Just put a couple squirts into the palm of your hand, rub your hands together to spread the product around good, and then work through hair. VOILA! Then blow dry and watch the magic happen. Volume GALORE. You will be amazed. I love it!</li>
            <li> Work amazing gives my hair great body!</li>
            <li> My favorite mouse of all time</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product works wonders for providing volume without being greasy or weighing down my hair. It comes out like a mouse. One pump is plenty for my hair.  I work it in to wet hair and then blow dry with a round brush. It provides hold and volume all day.  It also smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> This product very give you volume, I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium/fine, semi-straight/wavy. Just a little goes a long way. Regardless, it makes my hair look and feel sticky/greasy and dirty immediately, and dull. I avoid putting it at the roots, and mainly use it on my ends. When I use this product, I&#x27;m dying for a shower by the end of the day. I couldn&#x27;t possibly go 24 hours. I find that Queen For A Day is a better root volumizer and has a much cleaner scent and feel.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for fine hair.Wont purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells edible!  LOVE it!  Works great, as well - I use it before gel for my curly hair.  It was recommended on the site naturallycurly.com, which is a great resource for curly-haired girls.  I&#x27;m attempting to actually learn to LIKE my hair curly and so far, this product has really helped!</li>
            <li> Totally Baked has done wonders for my fine hair.  My hair was not controllable as even straightening  my hair rendered uneven texture.  My hairdresser introduced me to Totally Baked and I am amazed.  I now have control over my hair. My styling routine after adding Totally Baked is a flat iron, backcombing, and some hairspray.  Usually product weighs my hair down, but I found that I need four pumps of the product to obtain the right styling consistency which allows for the needed control.  At first I was not sure how I liked the texture of the product as it made my hair feel like I had been in a dust storm, but the benefits far outweight the feel which I adapted to very quickly. If you have uncontrollable fine hair then this is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Hate this product!! I have baby fine hair and this made it feel like had glue in my hair. I would not recommend this to anyone. I tried to vary the amounts of product I used &amp; it still felt the same way. It was horrible!!!</li>
            <li> I did not find this as good as Got2B Fat-tastic which always gives me lots of body, thickness, and holding. It was a little crispy which Got2B is not. Plus, Got2B lasts forever and is much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and don&#x27;t mind the texture this leaves because it makes my hair look full.  The scent is awesome at first but may clash with other hair products you use it with, I&#x27;ve never had much of a problem with it but I don&#x27;t use it with a certain hairspray because of this.  I love that if I have it in and my hair goes flat throughout the day or after wearing a hat, I can easily &#x27;mold&#x27; it back to how I want it.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for awhile and really like it.  Doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job with short hair.</li>
            <li> Made my fine hair a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> The lady who does my hair used this on me when she styled my hair and at first sniff I had to have it! It smells so good I can&#x27;t beleive I haven&#x27;t tried eating it yet! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really thick hair and a lot of it which makes it flat unless I back comb it. I use a big squirt of this foam and rub it into my scalp on the top part of my hair. I blow dry some days or let it naturally dry others, either way it works. It gives me great volume and makes it easier to back comb. I had a really hard time successfully giving my hair some poor before I started using this, and it&#x27;s much cheaper to buy on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update! I cut my hair off into a very short pixie and this stuff still works great for my hair. I am very thankful because it seems like every time I have a new style I need a new product! I get out of the shower spread this all over my hair. Blow dry for like 2 min (if that) until dry. Then I use a paste to make it messy! I have this on subscribe and save so I never run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: no longer on s&amp;s and amazon didn&#x27;t have it for a few months. Glad I didn&#x27;t run out. Make sure to stock up incase they stop selling it again!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works with your hair to get it into a nice workable style! I have a pixie cut and it&#x27;s perfect for giving me the volume I&#x27;m looking for. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it makes your hair feel a little bit dry, but it really does it&#x27;s job quite well!! It smells REALLY good, too!</li>
            <li> Love it! This is now the only product I use to style my hair. It&#x27;s not too sticky or clumpy. It allows me to style and re-style my hair as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very sticky. Would not recommend. Great smell! I have fine hair and would not use it if you have fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li> This mousse is really great on my thin hair.  It gives body and lift without weighting down my hair or leaving it sticky.  The BEST part is how yummy and delicious it smells!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived as expected. Hope to never be without it.</li>
            <li> I have medium length VERY fine hair. I use 2 pumps of this around the crown of my hair. It gives my hair texture, volume, and some staying power. And it smells wonderful!!! I will definitely continue to purchase and use this product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Hard to find in stores!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this. He used it to finish my hair and it smelled so good I had to ask him what it was!  Works great too. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve found a Tigi product I don&#x27;t like, Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the one to use products in my hair all that much, but I was getting bored with my dull, short hair and wanted to do something about it. From reading the reviews, this seemed like the right product to add some &amp;#34;oomf&amp;#34; to my hair. And wow, does it ever!!&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot in the bottle, it is easy to apply, and you don&#x27;t need to add much. It will add loads of volume to your hair. My only complaint would be that it makes my hair kind of sticky, or make it feel like you haven&#x27;t showered and make you think that your hair is a mess, when it actually looks really nice, but I guess that was happens when you add products to your hair. If you are looking for something to give your hair extra volume, this is it!</li>
            <li> My Hair is straight this product did not impart body, style or curls.  I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! Go easy on the amount. I use approx 1.5 pumps. The product gives you that dirty feel for easy styling while maintaining volume. It smells like cake (literally) and a lot goes a long way. Love. Love. Love. This stuff!!</li>
            <li> This stuff delivers volume!</li>
            <li> i have VERY fine, VERY thin hair. Every product I have tried weighs my hair down or ends up looking and feeling like floor wax. I got lucky while on vacation and went into a salon for a trim. The stylist used this on my hair, calling it her &amp;#34; go to &amp;#34; product for people with hair like mine. I am so happy to FINALLY have something that works well, does NOT weigh my hair down, does NOT feel like a wax product, and makes my hair look and feel 30 times thicker. This has been an amazing find for me! I could not find it in stores but I did find it on Amazon. If they ever stop making it, I guess I will just have to shave my head!  Buy and enjoy, my friends!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;mousse&amp;#34; works very well. It pumps out instead of the usual mousse that is creamy and fluffier. The lemon scent is light and smells good throughout the day - not overwhelming, just light. Also, I have fine, thin, long hair, and without blow drying my hair, it is completely straight and flat. This hair product works wonders on my hair! It makes my hair very full, looks fuller/has more volume, and it gives my hair body. It is truly amazing. I have used many other volumizing mousse, but no other product works as well as this. It is not sticky, unless I use too much; however, I usually use 2-3 pumps on my roots, and it works perfect. I highly recommend this product for anyone that has fine or thin hair and looking for a product that volumizes without weighing hair down. The price on Amazon is better than Target by about $3.00, so that is a perfect bonus! Thanks for carrying this superb product, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I have fine hair that is just above my shoulder. I use a flat iron and my hair is more manageable with this product. Have bought is A Lot in the last three years!</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine grey hair and this is the best product I have ever used. And you need very little. Kinda smells like a lemon meringue pie for a while. Great volume. I am growing out my hair and it is just getting to almost shoulders and this has made the wait of growing so much easier and easy to control. I also like the pump so easy to control amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews that says it is sticky and I agree, a little sticky at first but once you dry it, it&#x27;s totally fine. I love, love the smell. I think with this product, a little bit goes a long way. I only use about 1 pump every time I use it and the volume is perfect for my baby fine, short/medium length hair.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is frizzy, so I have to straighten it every time I wash my hair. But, after I straighten it, my hair becomes lifeless and flat. This stuff adds volume and texture even after I straighten my hair, and it has the slightest smell of sweet lemons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that when I say texture, I mean course texture. It makes your ends feel rough but will let up overnight.</li>
            <li> I wish this product wasn&#x27;t so hard to find!  I love this product.  I have thin, fine hair with a bit of natural curl.  This product gives me so much bounce and body!  I love it so much and the scent is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> I have long straight thin hair .. This is the first thing I have used that gives my hair volume. But like other reviews use less then u think.. It gives your hair that dirty texture that the powders do and allows me to curl my hair...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much for this product. It makes my hair feel dry and hard. It was a waste of money in my mind.</li>
            <li> Product has a nice smell and good hold.  A little bit goes a long way and it can be difficult to judge how much to use.</li>
            <li> Best mousse on the market!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good. I can&#x27;t get over how good it smells. The smell seems to linger in my hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does what it says and really gives some umph and nice texture to my hair, but it makes my hair just feel REALLY DIRTY and waxy. I can&#x27;t even touch my hair with my fingers or have it touch my face because it&#x27;s a very sticky feeling. I don&#x27;t wear this at all in warm weather because the combination of sweat and this stuff just seems like the worst idea ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this months and months ago and have probably only used it a handful of times just because of how bad it makes me feel. I just don&#x27;t feel comfortable with this stuff in my hair, so only wear it on late night dates where I know I&#x27;ll get to shower it out soon. It&#x27;s sad too because the smellll and look it gives my hair is great.</li>
            <li> This hair product does everything it says it will do. Makes a lot of curls!!! My Beautician told me about it.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and it works! Great buy and would recommend to a friend. I am glad I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> Does not work well with my baby fine hair. I think it is not quite tacky enough to lift my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.  It gives my hair volume which is what was needed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give as much volume as I thought it would. It&#x27;s OK but disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have reasonably good hair, average thickness and shine, but it requires a little teasing and product to give it body and help it stay in place.  I have used Totally Baked Hair Meringue only once and I&#x27;m willing to give it another try, but it was not a good experience the first time. I used about 4 puffs and worked it into the crown and back of my wet hair.  After blowing it dry, it was so sticky that I broke ends trying to comb it through, and my In-Styler curling iron was almost useless, a tool that is normally fantastic for adding body, shine, and just a little curl.  Although I forced it into curling by over heat-styling it,  it didn&#x27;t take much of a breeze to make pieces stick out.  I&#x27;ll need to give my hair a good conditioning before I try again.  One reviewer didn&#x27;t think it was tacky enough, so goes to show different strokes for different folks. I have never had a problem with any mousse before.  I won&#x27;t give up yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, after trying every possible way to make it work, I am done. One poof does nothing, 2 starts to create that sticky thing that keeps my hair from responding to heat styling. It seems to cause dryness and turns my normally sleek hair into fuzz that begs to be conditioned.  I don&#x27;t get it, considering how many great reviews the product gets.  Maybe I got a bad bottle. Or maybe it doesn&#x27;t work well with Wen hair cleanser, which I use.  I&#x27;ll never know because I&#x27;ll never try it again. In the trash it goes.</li>
            <li> light and smells good</li>
            <li> Was told by Tigi that this was similar to their discontinued Bed Head Mega Whip.  This product is not anything like it.  Wish they would bring the Mega Whip back</li>
            <li> Great volume. Closest to my favorite (Catwalk Fashionista Big and Bigger) that they no longer make. It does seem to dull the shine and leave a residue in hair, but if you need volume for fine hair, this is the one.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. This is all I use. The seller does a great job of sending the product on time.</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile and usually buy it at the hairdresser. but she was out.  I found this on Amazon for less and it arrived very quickly with free shipping.  Love the volume that this mousse provides.</li>
            <li> First use and I love this!! Really gives the hair body and makes my hair easier to tame when blowdrying using a round brush. I have longer hair and used about 2 pumps. My hair texture is slightly coarse and wavy with average thickness. I wanted some bounce so I added Velcro rollers for a half an hour and voila! Beautiful! Will continue to use this as my go to for volume!!</li>
            <li> This is easily the best product I have EVER used for volume. My hair is straight and thin, just above shoulder length. I have found 2-3 pumps works the best. I have used many many volumizers over the years, and this one is incredible. Just bought a few extra bottles in case it is ever discontinued.</li>
            <li> will keep buying it as long as i can find it. love it</li>
            <li> The best for naturally wavy hair!!! Finally a product that doesn&#x27;t leave my waves crunchy nor weigh them down!!! I love it and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair..although you&#x27;ve got to use very sparingly~ A little goes a long way. If you use too much it&#x27;s really like having tacky paste in your hair..The plus side is when you do use the right amount  it lasts and it really does give great body &amp; volume.</li>
            <li> The wife loves this stuff for her very fine hair.  She says it works wonders</li>
            <li> I love what it does for my hair.  The bonus is the wonderful smell!</li>
            <li> So far this product works really well. My hair is fine with a mix of waves and cork screw curls and damages easy (I have PCOS, most of it just falls out sadly), this product doesnt weigh my hair down...I use 11/2 pump and run it through my hair and air dry, looks great all day long...Im not a huge fan of the smell, but it thankfully fades as your hair dries so yay for that. I recently cut off 8 inches of hair and curls and frizz are rampant! I remembered bed head products helped when I actually tried to take care of my hair years ago, so back to a trusted brand and im def happy I did. When you order things offline (instead of in a hair salon) be prepared for bottles of old product that have gone bad. If they smell off, are overly sticky/goopey chances are you got a bad bottle. Return it...I have yet to receive anything that has gone bad, and hopefully it stays that way!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t figure it out. My hair is gummy and yucky with just a small amount and YES I use it right.&lt;br /&gt;I love Bed heads Superstar product and don&#x27;t recommend this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell yummy.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful and works so well in my hair, I look forward to using it each day, wonderful!</li>
            <li> This product simply did not work for me.  I have looser curls and am able to run my fingers through my hair.  With this product, I couldn&#x27;t move my fingers through my hair an inch.  My hair looked bad, felt *disgusting*, and was unmanagable.  I am not sure what type of curls this product would work on, but it was not mine.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> How have I not discovered this any sooner!? I LOVE this product. Recently discovered it, now I can&#x27;t live without it. It gives my hair SO much more volume and it feels thicker too! I love the tarty lemon meringue scent too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I used too much or maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t wet enough when I used this product but I really, really did not like how it made my hair feel. It smelled delicious, but it made it a bit hard to dry with my hair dryer and it was certainly difficult to run my fingers through. I bought this through Ulta on clearance and I&#x27;m not ready to toss it out just yet because it did smell amazing... I&#x27;m just not sure how or when to use this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t really do much for me except make my hair look dirty.  I have normal to fine dark brown hair with a little natural wave.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but not sure if it does what its supposed to. I have used this many times and just can&#x27;t tell if there&#x27;s a difference between when I use it and when I don&#x27;t... other than making my hair sticky. I prefer to just not use it.</li>
            <li> Great product, really defines and holds my natural curls.</li>
            <li> I love my hair when its fabulous, and I love weed. Of course \\&quot;Totally Baked\\&quot; was the product for me! I have thinner hair and have trouble keeping it looking fab without some kind of product, which as you know ladies, turns into a freaking plethora of damn products. This is grrrreat for my damn thin, unforgivingly boring hair. It gives it a nice little boost, and I might supplement my roots with extra volumizing stuff if I want to look extra good. Toss this in my damp hair, take a hit of your favorite bud, blow dry a bit, girl, you will look stellar.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my hair and I didn&#x27;t really like the smell too much. Good for someone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this works great for me. I started using it after I got a haircut and the stylist used it in my hair, I had to buy a bottle and have been using it since. My husband tried it when he ran out of his gel, and now uses it all the time too.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take alot of this product to do the job, and I love that. I only use about a pump and a half. Its lightweight and really helps give my hair body and texture. The smell is nice too.This has to be the best styling product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I really like these products and the way the smell.  I was so excited to find them on amazon.  I don&#x27;t like paying the price at salons.  I have fine flat hair and this product actually makes me feel like I have hair.</li>
            <li> I love this item!!! It gives me body to my thin straight hair!I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products! Looking forward to trying their curling iron products!</li>
            <li> The first time that I used this mousse, I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it from a friend. I loved it so much that I went out and bought my own bottle the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mousse offers a lot more than just a &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; smell (and let&#x27;s be honest- that scent makes you want to eat it out of the bottle!). It has become an essential part of my hair-style routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of hair, but the texture is very silky and fine. My biggest hair challenges are to create volume and to avoid fly-aways. This product helps with both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I have used thickeners (such as Bamboo, Bumble &amp; Bumble Thick-In Spray and Redken Guts), but they are unnecessary when I use this product. I apply a dollop to my roots  and tips (to prevent the fly-aways) when my hair is damp and then use the blow-dryer. I obtain incredible volume. The hair feels much thicker, but remains soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair is so fragile, I try to wash it as infrequently as possible (no sooner than every four days). Using this mousse seems to help control oil at my scalp and helps keep my hair looking fresh in between washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> this stuff smells great and works very well.  Volumizing is an understatement.  Love it.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy this.</li>
            <li> I love Bed Head Products, but this one I rate with 4 stars. You definitely only need a small amount, if you over due it your going to have the grossest feeling hair ever. It won&#x27;t come out unless you wash and shampoo either. Overall this product is ok. My hair is very fine and thin, so that may be why it doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how many reviews I read that said they loved the scent because this product smells disgusting! Like candy vomit that&#x27;s been left in the sun for a few days, or something! Luckily the scent fades pretty quickly, so it&#x27;s not in your hair all day, but wow! Foul. On to the actual product... it seems to hold my styling a little more than nothing, but not anything outstanding. I still need to use (a lot of) hairspray. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the most useful product to be honest, and with a scent like that...don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this one because it seemed to have so many good reviews, but I actually had such a different experience that I checked the bottle a few times to make sure I got the same product as everyone else! I&#x27;m comparing this to other mousses I&#x27;ve tried. All the other mousses I&#x27;ve bought at a grocery or drug store so my expectations weren&#x27;t too fancy. This is what I experienced..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold: basically nonexistant. .5 /5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Volume: a little bit. 2/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Awesome, like a light lemony scent. 4.5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel/Touchability: Next to none! Don&#x27;t touch your hair, it will feel nasty and greasy. 0/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it I put 1 full pump on my hair (my hair is long, past my shoulders). It was awful, my hair was gross and greasy right after a shower, I&#x27;d never experienced anything like that with any other mousse! I was actually embarrassed of my hair that day. I figured I didn&#x27;t give it a good enough try, so I&#x27;d tried a few more times after that with only a little bit. It didn&#x27;t get much better and I could feel and tell my hair was greasy, and it had no hold at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anything other than the smell.</li>
            <li> I have a horrible time with  my hair. It is bulky a little wavy but only here and there and getting a good haircut is next to impossible. I have a huge supply of hair products I try to tame this unruly hair and get some volume without weighing it down too much. This is the best product I have and trick is not to use too much. It gives me enough volume to hide the awful haircut I have and camouflage the uneven layers while I let it grow out once again so I can find someone to even it all out.    Seems people love or hate it but if you have hard to handle hair, don&#x27;t use more than two pumps (I do them one at a time and use the first pump on the crown and top where I want so umphh and then one more pump evenly distributed all around) and try it on off days like the weekend until you get the right amount for your hair length and type. It also gives the slightest amount of a piecey look to layers which is good for my bulky hair.    Again, out of all the gels, mouse (Height of Glam mouse by Vavoom runs a close second but thickens my hair a little too much) this stuff is the best, but amount used is very important.</li>
            <li> this just isn&#x27;t for my hair,  this product didn&#x27;t work for me because of the texture.  this product is like a moose type product and didn&#x27;t do good for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a replacement to Power Dressing by Pureology, and this is not it.  It is just ok.  I have tried one pump, two pumps, and three pumps.  Three gave me some body but also makes my hair feel dirty and weird.  I like Bedhead Small Talk better and would recommend that over this one.</li>
            <li> No joke, this stuff smells exactly like lemon meringue pie! It&#x27;s pretty outstanding. It also works! Now I just wish they had a hairspray that smelled just as sweet because the hairsprays I&#x27;ve used cover up the delicious smell of this product :(</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good, easily one of the best smelling hair products I&#x27;ve ever used. I have naturally curly hair and I&#x27;m always looking for products to help with it.  I don&#x27;t find this stuff works as well as it smells though. It leaves my hair feeling a little dirty, stiff and sticky and my curls get really tangled with it.</li>
            <li> This is the worst styling product I&#x27;ve ever used my life! I have beautiful long brown hair and I used a small amount of this foam, and my hair immediately felt synthetic and likes a Barbie&#x27;s hair without the shine. It&#x27;s also super sticky and gross feeling. I had to shampoo my hair twice in order to get this out. Please don&#x27;t use this over drying product if you love your hair, the smell was the only thing I liked about this product but it will be going back.</li>
            <li> I have very thin / fine hair. This is a light weight pump of foam that will give your hair texture &amp; body. Great for everyday use!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Makes my hair much fuller looking. I would definitely buy it again. I received it really quick</li>
            <li> There is no other hair product of this nature that is anywhere near as good.  Please do not discontinue it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why there was no caps of these products. except generally okay</li>
            <li> only product i use on my short spiky hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, which means it flattens out very quickly if I don&#x27;t use mousse. In my eternal search for the perfect hair product, this one is the best I have found so far. Don&#x27;t go overboard and use too much or your hair will feel sticky after drying it.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, which I have had a hard time finding a product that will keep it full looking all day.  This does the trick.  I have short hair now, but I wish I had found this mousse before cutting my hair off, I think it would have truly helped give my hair the oomph needed.  The smell is nice; it&#x27;s seriously smells like meringue.  The more you use the stiffer your hair gets too.  Washes out well.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, long waves and this is the best volumizing product I have ever used. A little bit goes a long way, I get nice volume without weight. Smells amazing as well.</li>
            <li> I am a TIGI Bed Head Addict, I openly admit this.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried/am currently using 16 different Bed Head products so I can really compare how effective the different products of the line are. This is my favourite (I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year) and if I had to limit myself to just one Bed Head product it would be this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I found the very sweet smell a bit over-powering and wasn&#x27;t sure if I was able to adapt to this, but I have. And the fact that it works so exceptionally well probably made the adaption easier.&lt;br /&gt;I use this in my hair while blow-drying when my hair is ALMOST completely dry. (I use various other products before that. I am a person who likes to rotate, I have several shampoos, several leave-in conditioners etc, so my hair always get an alternating benefit ;) ) It adds so much volume and texture to it (although I also use some volumizing Bed Head Superstar products before that, so they help too) but most importantly, it REALLY is a PREPPING meringue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight hair. It&#x27;s in a lot of layers, the longest almost reaching my..ahem..lower back. As every girl with straight hair it seems, I long for curls and waves. They have never lasted in my hair (even when a professional stylist did it for my friend&#x27;s wedding. The curls were gone in an hour). My hair just always reverts back to its natural, straight state.&lt;br /&gt;But when I use Totally Baked, then add a curl spray (I use the GHD curl spray, but it&#x27;s not as effective if I don&#x27;t use Totally Baked before it) before using my curling iron, my curls and waves stay in my hair for DAYS! I went 3 days once just because I wanted to see how long they lasted and then I couldn&#x27;t evade washing my hair any longer. It was quite a test, because I wanted to wash my hair and it was weird trying not to get it wet while in the shower, but I also really wanted to test out how long my curls would last.&lt;br /&gt;And they really do thanks to this meringue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 3 pumps formy hair. (Again, I have many layers and the longest parts of my hair go until above my butt).</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve tried for my fine hair. Everything else weighs my hair down by the end of the day and it become limp. This smells like lemon meringue pie! 2 1/2 squirts works perfect for my hair, I just work it in and dry. It makes my hair full, it feels thicker and it lasts all day. Love it!</li>
            <li> Gummy.  Sticky.  Hard/crunchy hair!  And, yes, I did use this product appropriately. . . just a tiny little amount, hoping to avoid that.</li>
            <li> I L O V E this product. I have thick healthy hair so it tends to weigh down no matter what I put in it but this just gives me the texture without making it look greasy. Btw, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A great product and easy to use ..</li>
            <li> Works well,  just be careful not to use too much!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I get lift &amp; volume to my finer hair&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite product  of my salon.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right and smells awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...smells yummy, one bottle lasts a long time and works well providing lift and fullness to hair.</li>
            <li> As the previous reviewers have said, this smells great! I have fine and thin hair, so this worked perfectly for me. I have never been disappointed with Bed Head products.</li>
            <li> In searching for the next best hair product for baby fine hair, I&#x27;ve tried MANY... so this product had some serious contenders.  First off, it smells HEAVENLY!  It&#x27;s just not the best product for me.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair TOO weighed down or greasy to where I couldn&#x27;t use it, but there&#x27;s no chance I could&#x27;ve gone a day without washing in between.  I may find better use for it in the summer when my hair can get a bit more dried out. (and to be completely fair, I&#x27;ve used it once... One full pump... I may try again using less and edit my review)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a product worth trying - and seriously, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product from a blogger, kandee johnson. She was reviewing some sweet smelling products. This was one of her favorites. I have to tell you, I completely agree. It smells awesome. Not only that, the product acutally works great for curly/wavy hair. A great purchase!</li>
            <li> This Tigi Bed Head hair product is great.  I heard about it on the View.  It holds without being sticky or stiff.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days of fine hair frizz from past perms...all to create what? A messy do. I love Tigi Bed Head and their super innovative and amazing products. I recently had my stylist give me a textured short A-cut which could have gone bad in so many ways; my hair is SUPER fine. She suggested this awesome meringue and recommended 1 1/2 pumps where i wanted the fullest volume. Idiot me......I thought, why not use more? To make a long story short, my hair looked like an atomic mushroom cloud. Note: stylists know best. The volume held all day. A little goes a long way, especially on fine hair. A must in my hair routine.</li>
            <li> Love it, Love the smell of it. Is not to heavy on hair as other products I have tried. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing the mousse aspect of it however doesn&#x27;t have much holding power it has a lighter hold. I was expecting better but still give your hair some volume.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this stuff and we can buy it cheaper on line than in the salon so that&#x27;s why erbium it here.</li>
            <li> Made my hair really sticky and greasy...it was like there was liquid gum in my hair. Maybe it&#x27;ll work for someone with thick hair, but my hair is more sparse and doesn&#x27;t do well with heavy products.</li>
            <li> little product makes tons of volume and the fragrance is ymmy!</li>
            <li> I am now on my second bottle of Totally Baked.  I have fine, flat hair and this product does the trick.  I apply before blow drying and it gives my hair not only volume, but also texture to help styling.  I use it everyday.  The smell is also great.  A great product.</li>
            <li> My hair stayed teased for 2 days! I have very full thick hair so it likes to fall flat with all of its weight and humidity in Florida. It smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> Works well, gives my hair body, prices is good</li>
            <li> I like it! it gives hair lots of body.</li>
            <li> Did not like this. Leaves my hair dry and doesn&#x27;t do much of anything. Instead I paid more and bought Bumble and Bumble curl conscious Calming Creme. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, stops fly aways and calms my hair down. But also, if I want my curls wild for an evening out, it works for that too. I just put it in wet hair and once my hair air dries i can scrunch and scrunch with my fingers and my curls will go wild without getting frizzy. My curls will stay in!! They feel soft too. Pay way more but much more worth it than this stuff. This made my hair dry, brittle feeling and frizzy. It did&#x27;t give my curls any definition.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I am already gonna have to order more, I cant find it at the store...&lt;br /&gt;it works great, smells soo good, and does everything that it says, I just love my hair when I use this!&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much. I love it for just a little body on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> The product was okay, the seller was great, but the Totally Baked caused the same allergic reaction on my hands that the Tigi Mega Whip did.  I got swollen, painful, blisters all over my hands from using this stuff.  It smelled great and it worked nicely on my hair, but I had to discard the whole bottle because of what it did to my hands.  Probably the fragrance, since I am prone to eczema and it is sometimes caused by fragrances.  :o(</li>
            <li> I really like this product it gives you great volume and added some nice shine to boot. The price is also a good plus too. I used this last night and it held up great. A little bit goes a long way too. Today I did an up do for a function tonight and the curl I got was amazing and my hair looks great and full. This will definitely be one of the products I go to the days before an up do.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about trying this but my hair felt crunchy. I tried it a couple of times and it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m also not into the smell. Blech!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells sweet, kinda like candy, I prefer clean to sweet, but whatever. It&#x27;s a foam, which is nice. But, I only used a little and my hair looked like a cheep wig. Very........ Plastic, and dull. So out comes the shine spray which made my hair flat, then comes the powder root lift, then the hair spray. Omg, my hair looks like do do, think ill just stay in. It looked so bad, I put on a baseball cap just to be alone. PS, I have a great hair and a really cool haircut. I just was to tired to start over. Cocktails with my dog instead of going out.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I would buy this again just for the smell.  I really don&#x27;t think that any hair product can help my hair enough for me to swear by it though, and Candy Fixation is not any different.  However, it also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel like it has a ton of product in it and I have gotten numerous compliments on how nice my hair smells when I use it.  So if nice smelling hair is worth the price to you, I would say to give Candy Fixation a try.</li>
            <li> it totally transforms your hair!  i have thinning, frizzy hair on my crown area and i am always struggling with styling my hair into something presentable!  there are many times i insert hairpieces or outright full wigs because i get so frustrated with the change in my hair texture!  i tried a couple of pumps of this on my hair and not only did the curls stay but it felt totally thick again and gave me a much fuller look all over!  for me it is a one-day treatment … feels horrible the next day!</li>
            <li> My new go to mousse. I have a ton of fine, and it tends to get a bit oily around my scalp. I used this product sparingly (2 pumps) on wet hair, just on the top. Wow, it gave my roots volume! No need to tease or hair spray. I found the smell to be subtle but pleasant.</li>
            <li> sweet smell, not much effect, makes hair dull.not good for thin hair</li>
            <li> I loved everything about this product. It gave me everything I was hoping for in a volumizing moose. I will say that a little definitely goes a long way when it comes to the amount you need to get the full effect. The only downside I can see is that it does have a fairly strong smell (almost like coconut). If you are sensitive to smell I would skip this product. Completely happy with everything else!</li>
            <li> Throw away all of your mousse, it&#x27;s useless compared to this!</li>
            <li> I have fine thick hair. My sister has fine thin hair. This works for both of us. I love the volume whether I put it in dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li> This mousse is awesome.  It is very lightweight and does not make my hair look like it has mousse in it, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and not a lot of it ...  :( ......Ive always doubted these products since only a miracle will give my hair volume but my guy friend told me to try it out while we were at the beach. I let my hair air dry and used two pumps. I have to say, the difference was amazing, I went from &#x27;loser hair&#x27; to a finally &#x27;normal looking hair&#x27;. It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, nor did it become stiff. I only used it that time but ive ordered it online. I cant wait to try it with a blow dryer and maybe straightner. Im giving it three stars for the moment, once I try the product out again, ill update.</li>
            <li> Made my hair look greasy.</li>
