            <li>It works better than Crystal, but still haven&#x27;t found the perfect deodorant that 100% won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to find a product that strives to be good for you.  </li>
            <li>the reviews for this looked good, so I wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li>I run around a fair amount and work at a nursing home</li>
            <li>, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>One day I was skating around some sort of street fair thing in Austin and came across a booth hosted by the nice people at Silver Botanicals.</li>
            <li>and it continues to work amazingly well for me.  </li>
            <li>Nice application, effective and doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothes.</li>
            <li>I have been allergic to almost every kind of deodorant, even the nonallergy kinds.  </li>
            <li>Kind of seems like a detox response</li>
            <li>I am getting used to the fact that one does have some perspiration in the under arm area during a warm day, but that&#x27;s with anything</li>
            <li>Super happy to have found a deodorant that works so well.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend convinced me to change to a deodorant without antiperspirant and aluminum free, so I found this one and loved it.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best natural deodorants I have used.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with this natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>This product worked great for my wife who purchased it, we moved to the Arizona desert right before summer</li>
            <li>The first two days were great.  </li>
            <li>She said this works great and would certainly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just ordered a refill (love the fact that you can re-use container)</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li>I also take/ingest chlorophyll capsules in conjunction and I love the combination.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>works for  more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I like that it is a safe product for her body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others without aluminium, and some worked well.  </li>
            <li>not the &amp;#34;fruit cocktail&amp;#34; of obnoxious extracts that do more to irritate the underarm then anything else.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very impressed and will definitely purchase the refill!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure as it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sold! :)</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>No nasty chemicals, works well to avoid odor, leaves no stains on clothing.</li>
            <li>and I will DEF buy more.</li>
            <li>Best to let it dry before you get dressed.</li>
            <li>This Silver Shield - Sensitive Skin deodorant product is particularly great for me.  </li>
            <li>Best all natural deodorant that works really well!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel the stinging, which is good.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I was also concerned about the smell, but it has a really good scent, like essential oils and herbs kind of smell</li>
            <li>awesome alternative to average deodorant</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty warm in there</li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant that I have found so far.</li>
            <li>This one though keeps me odor free all day with no irritation whatsoever, even after shaving.</li>
            <li>I used it for about 4 days and was happy that it did last through out the day</li>
            <li>I am also allergic to cheap metals.  </li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin, but don&#x27;t plan to do a lot of work or you&#x27;ll need to clean up and reapply.</li>
            <li>so I had been researching and came across this one and was so excited about to try it.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a sensitive skin deodorant since I have tried so many and most irritate my underarm.</li>
            <li>If I was lucky, I could get maybe six stinkless hours out of a product, but that was rare.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t sweat a lot and don&#x27;t have strong BO, specially in the winter.</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this one, and it seemed to work for the first 2 days, after that it just stopped being effective for me.</li>
            <li>I am soooooooo happy I found a natural product that actually works and doesn&#x27;t contain propylene glycol or aluminum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had success with a deodorant as with this one.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite natural deoderant.</li>
            <li>Love that it is natural.</li>
            <li>Because of the Aluminum in most deodorants I went on a search to find a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin so most products irritate it.  </li>
            <li>I discontinued the use right away and was so worried about what permanent damage this deodorant had caused on my arm pits.</li>
            <li>Anyway, no irritation from the silver deodorant, and I&#x27;m buying a lifetime supply right now.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use it right after you shave</li>
            <li>The 2x refill is exactly that, refills the roller cap bottle twice.</li>
            <li>Its seem pretty natural and safe, even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY products including Tom&#x27;s of Maine to help control my odor problem and FINALLY I&#x27;ve found a product that works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve typically used deodorants that contained aluminum, but with the studies linking aluminum to various health problems, it is nice to find a product that is safe and WORKS.  </li>
            <li>During that time, I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural deodorant available at Whole Foods (GeoDeo, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Weleda, etc.)</li>
            <li>A few days ago I was at roller derby practice, and I applied the silver deodorant sample after about an hour of a particularly grueling practice (AFTER I was already good and stinky).</li>
            <li>Large cyst like pimples?  </li>
            <li>This stuff is freakin&#x27; magic -- even super harsh ingredient deodorants don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day - even through my intense and sweaty cardio workouts at the gym after work.  </li>
            <li>Your product works very well.  </li>
            <li>And the price is really affordable and delivery is also fast.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>It works very well as a deodorant and anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>I really like the deodorant</li>
            <li>this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>My armpits are still really sore a day after.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really on the fence here.  </li>
            <li>Recently started doing research and decided to switch to a chemical free deodorant, although I have used Degree antiperspirant for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked very well</li>
            <li>I had high hopes given the positive reviews, but this really didn&#x27;t do anything for me in terms of odor protection.</li>
            <li>First off I want to say I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used MANY before, and while some worked, they caused a lot of irritation in my pits due to the amount of baking soda in them.</li>
            <li>I use Colloidal Silver for many other things but for deodorant?  </li>
            <li>However, this one goes on easily, has no odor, and keeps me dry.  </li>
            <li>I am glad they fixed the loose ball which used to leak around during applying.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making a healthy alternative to regular deodorant that actually works for me.  </li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot since it was one of the few non-aluminum deodorants on Amazon and the reviews, overall, were good.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is a little expensive, but for someone who can not use so many others I am happy.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work thus far, but the real test will be when the weather warms up.</li>
            <li>I really like Jason&#x27;s Natural Deodorant.  </li>
            <li>You know this was worth the purchase, it actually works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this to a few of my family members who are enjoying it as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use products with scents, and I normally go for organic/scentless products for my skin (laundry soap, bath soap, lotion etc).  </li>
            <li>Good but not great - for me.</li>
            <li>Purchased other aluminum free deodorants and they didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t live with it burning my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product really works for people who don&#x27;t have much luck with regular deodorants.</li>
            <li>One of the other reviewers said it felt like fire ants - exactly!!  </li>
            <li>It does sting just a little if I put it on right after freshly shaving my arm pits.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>But I got this product and after cleaning out my pores, I use this and WOW!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants and most of them work for a short time but don&#x27;t last all day.  </li>
            <li>I like how fresh it smells and it kept me dry all day.  </li>
            <li>It may help that I only put on a small amount (two quick swipes of the roll on) but that is more than enough to stop any smell</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m allergic to pretty much all fragrances, as well as a bunch of other chemicals that are often found in beauty / skin care products.</li>
            <li>Please be aware that at first it has a smell that you &amp;#34; think&amp;#34; will continue but it drys to no smell and keep you dry and last All day!!!</li>
            <li>Also, it is clear.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that sometimes itch.  </li>
            <li>After searching for a while, I decided to give Silver Shield Deodorant - Sensitive Skin Formula a try.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and will eliminate the odors.  </li>
            <li>So far this one has not and also seems to work quite well.  </li>
            <li>my skin had turned purple and blisters almost cuts had developed.</li>
            <li>I was surprised and</li>
            <li>The product does work, but for a sensitive product (my skin is sensitive)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product has not caused any irritation.  </li>
            <li>figured I&#x27;d be allergic to this as well, but they gave me a sample of the sensitive skin formula.</li>
            <li>Major sting!!  </li>
            <li>The only thing that kept me from running back to regular deodorant was that I feared their dangerous ingredients more than my own stench.</li>
            <li>I have used many, many, natural deodorants that have failed after a few hours.  </li>
            <li>and it really does keep you from stinking all day long.  </li>
            <li>I did a head to head shootout with my Dove For Men deodorant and hands down, Silver Shield wins.  </li>
            <li>I tried it more than once to make sure, but after each use I would have a bloody burn and rash under my arms.</li>
            <li>The other problem is the dispenser roller ball which frequently gets stuck and either picks up NO deoderant, or else too much.</li>
            <li>As a couple of other reviewers mentioned, I did run into a problem with stinging when I used it right after shaving; but found if I dry my skin off well and wait about 5-10 minutes before applying, I have no problem with stinging (and I have excruciatingly sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>On the positive side, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or feel sticky like some other natural deodorants, but this is sort of a moot point since I smell the same with or without it.</li>
            <li>I am trying to go natural with personal care products and</li>
            <li>Whether I shaved or not, the product still left my skin irritated, red, and extremely sensitive (and this is the sensitive formula).  </li>
            <li>but I ordered the normal not sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased the sensitive formula and there is a slight odor to it but very mild/pleasant, not floral or anything overpowering.</li>
            <li>And honestly, I am used to using Secret Clinical to stay dry and this actually worked.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t cause any problem except the occasional little sting right after I have shaved.</li>
            <li>It does take a little bit of time to dry, but if I&#x27;m in a hurry, a quick blast with the blow dryer</li>
            <li>When I tried Silver Shield Deodorant I was surprised because it lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>No smell after the workout when using this deodorant, other than normal sweat stink.</li>
            <li>So if I&#x27;m exercising, my options are to just be stinky, use one of those natural crystal things and be only \\&quot;kinda stinky,\\&quot; or to use irritating typical-ingredient deodorant and not stink but be SUPER ITCHY.</li>

            <li> Love that it is natural.</li>
            <li> Because of the Aluminum in most deodorants I went on a search to find a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin so most products irritate it.  </li>
            <li> I discontinued the use right away and was so worried about what permanent damage this deodorant had caused on my arm pits.</li>
            <li> Anyway, no irritation from the silver deodorant, and I&#x27;m buying a lifetime supply right now.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use it right after you shave</li>
            <li> The 2x refill is exactly that, refills the roller cap bottle twice.</li>
            <li> Its seem pretty natural and safe, even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY products including Tom&#x27;s of Maine to help control my odor problem and FINALLY I&#x27;ve found a product that works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve typically used deodorants that contained aluminum, but with the studies linking aluminum to various health problems, it is nice to find a product that is safe and WORKS.  </li>
            <li> During that time, I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural deodorant available at Whole Foods (GeoDeo, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Weleda, etc.)</li>
            <li> A few days ago I was at roller derby practice, and I applied the silver deodorant sample after about an hour of a particularly grueling practice (AFTER I was already good and stinky).</li>
            <li> Large cyst like pimples?  </li>
            <li> This stuff is freakin&#x27; magic -- even super harsh ingredient deodorants don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day - even through my intense and sweaty cardio workouts at the gym after work.  </li>
            <li> Your product works very well.  </li>
            <li> And the price is really affordable and delivery is also fast.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> It works very well as a deodorant and anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> I really like the deodorant</li>
            <li> this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> My armpits are still really sore a day after.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really on the fence here.  </li>
            <li> Recently started doing research and decided to switch to a chemical free deodorant, although I have used Degree antiperspirant for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked very well</li>
            <li> I had high hopes given the positive reviews, but this really didn&#x27;t do anything for me in terms of odor protection.</li>
            <li> First off I want to say I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used MANY before, and while some worked, they caused a lot of irritation in my pits due to the amount of baking soda in them.</li>
            <li> I use Colloidal Silver for many other things but for deodorant?  </li>
            <li> However, this one goes on easily, has no odor, and keeps me dry.  </li>
            <li> I am glad they fixed the loose ball which used to leak around during applying.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making a healthy alternative to regular deodorant that actually works for me.  </li>
            <li> Decent price.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot since it was one of the few non-aluminum deodorants on Amazon and the reviews, overall, were good.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive, but for someone who can not use so many others I am happy.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work thus far, but the real test will be when the weather warms up.</li>
            <li> I really like Jason&#x27;s Natural Deodorant.  </li>
            <li> You know this was worth the purchase, it actually works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this to a few of my family members who are enjoying it as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use products with scents, and I normally go for organic/scentless products for my skin (laundry soap, bath soap, lotion etc).  </li>
            <li> Good but not great - for me.</li>
            <li> Purchased other aluminum free deodorants and they didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t live with it burning my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product really works for people who don&#x27;t have much luck with regular deodorants.</li>
            <li> One of the other reviewers said it felt like fire ants - exactly!!  </li>
            <li> It does sting just a little if I put it on right after freshly shaving my arm pits.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> But I got this product and after cleaning out my pores, I use this and WOW!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants and most of them work for a short time but don&#x27;t last all day.  </li>
            <li> I like how fresh it smells and it kept me dry all day.  </li>
            <li> It may help that I only put on a small amount (two quick swipes of the roll on) but that is more than enough to stop any smell</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m allergic to pretty much all fragrances, as well as a bunch of other chemicals that are often found in beauty / skin care products.</li>
            <li> Please be aware that at first it has a smell that you &amp;#34; think&amp;#34; will continue but it drys to no smell and keep you dry and last All day!!!</li>
            <li> Also, it is clear.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that sometimes itch.  </li>
            <li> After searching for a while, I decided to give Silver Shield Deodorant - Sensitive Skin Formula a try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and will eliminate the odors.  </li>
            <li> So far this one has not and also seems to work quite well.  </li>
            <li> my skin had turned purple and blisters almost cuts had developed.</li>
            <li> I was surprised and</li>
            <li> The product does work, but for a sensitive product (my skin is sensitive)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product has not caused any irritation.  </li>
            <li> figured I&#x27;d be allergic to this as well, but they gave me a sample of the sensitive skin formula.</li>
            <li> Major sting!!  </li>
            <li> The only thing that kept me from running back to regular deodorant was that I feared their dangerous ingredients more than my own stench.</li>
            <li> I have used many, many, natural deodorants that have failed after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> and it really does keep you from stinking all day long.  </li>
            <li> I did a head to head shootout with my Dove For Men deodorant and hands down, Silver Shield wins.  </li>
            <li> I tried it more than once to make sure, but after each use I would have a bloody burn and rash under my arms.</li>
            <li> The other problem is the dispenser roller ball which frequently gets stuck and either picks up NO deoderant, or else too much.</li>
            <li> As a couple of other reviewers mentioned, I did run into a problem with stinging when I used it right after shaving; but found if I dry my skin off well and wait about 5-10 minutes before applying, I have no problem with stinging (and I have excruciatingly sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> On the positive side, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or feel sticky like some other natural deodorants, but this is sort of a moot point since I smell the same with or without it.</li>
            <li> I am trying to go natural with personal care products and</li>
            <li> Whether I shaved or not, the product still left my skin irritated, red, and extremely sensitive (and this is the sensitive formula).  </li>
            <li> but I ordered the normal not sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the sensitive formula and there is a slight odor to it but very mild/pleasant, not floral or anything overpowering.</li>
            <li> And honestly, I am used to using Secret Clinical to stay dry and this actually worked.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t cause any problem except the occasional little sting right after I have shaved.</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit of time to dry, but if I&#x27;m in a hurry, a quick blast with the blow dryer</li>
            <li> When I tried Silver Shield Deodorant I was surprised because it lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> No smell after the workout when using this deodorant, other than normal sweat stink.</li>
            <li> So if I&#x27;m exercising, my options are to just be stinky, use one of those natural crystal things and be only \\&quot;kinda stinky,\\&quot; or to use irritating typical-ingredient deodorant and not stink but be SUPER ITCHY.</li>
            <li> and she has sensitive skin and couldn&#x27;t use other deodorants.</li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless deodorants, they all cause these stains and have various other issues, such as white powder, burn my skin, what&#x27;s with all the floral odors?  </li>
            <li> On the reviews some people said it stings a little, so I got the one for sensitive skin (blue)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to try some other alternatives like not putting it on until I&#x27;m ready to leave the house once my skin has dried and the pores aren&#x27;t open.  </li>
            <li> However, I still have to use the aluminum based deodorants at the gym because the natural ones are just not strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used this, there was some slight burning, but that has subsided.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well, stayed wet and caused a rash after several days.</li>
            <li> This products works well, but contains a very small amount of deodorant for quite a large price.  </li>
            <li> it stings sometimes and I see other people making same claim.</li>
            <li> Others that were gentler just did not keep the odor away for very long.</li>
            <li> Plus it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After a year of trying out different natural deodorants, this one became one of my least favorites.  </li>
            <li> ALSO I have a reaction to it--it doesn&#x27;t burn like other reviewers, but my armpits ITCH like mad for a couple days if I use it for more than 1 day in a row.</li>
            <li> It is very unfortunate because I was so excited about this deodorant that got 3 different kinds!</li>
            <li> Also those deodorants do not really work.  </li>
            <li> Curious if any one else has had  break outs in armpits when using?  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but to me it is worth it for my health and to avoid the embarrassment of armpit odor.</li>
            <li> and I had to try to wipe it off with wet cloths.  </li>
            <li> He was also skeptical about odor control at first, but now he, too, is a believer.  </li>
            <li> I will probably buy a refill once I run out of mine, and recommend it to other women in my family.</li>
            <li> I had been using Crystal Salt for a number of years but had to discontinue due to my increased sensitivity and itchiness.  </li>
            <li> Even after working out I&#x27;m not as stinky as I am when using other products.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, none of them worked very well at controlling odors.  </li>
            <li> The bottle leaks and it never seems to dry no matter how much bathroom chicken dancing you do.</li>
            <li> I am a very active person -- I dance, do yard work, play roller derby, skate recreationally, etc.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with deoderant because about half way through the day, I can half smell BO nd half smell the deoderant.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I switched back to the &amp;#34;Original Formula&amp;#34; (and, I would imagine the, &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; Formula would be less irritating as well based on its name)</li>
            <li> I did have issues with rashes a few months into using this product, but I think it had to do with the laundry detergent I was using at the time.  </li>
            <li> I had been using Dove deodorant for a few years.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even think I need to use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Deodorant-wise, it does nothing for me after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Ugg, another natural deodorant fail.  </li>
            <li> I was prepared to be disappointed, AGAIN, but OMG, this stuff REALLY WORKS!  </li>
            <li> plus I&#x27;m not sure about the one ingredient and how it could affect my health.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure,  </li>
            <li> The bottle does not leak excessively.  </li>
            <li> I started applying coconut oil and healing ointment everyday and luckily it has been 8 days since this horrible incident and my skin is peeling off and the purple is disappearing slowly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since discovered that plain colloidal silver in a spray bottle works just as well, but is a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> Unless the metal is at least sterling silver if I have it on my skin</li>
            <li> No more smelly armpits!</li>
            <li> but my arm pits started getting red and on the 5th day I noticed I woke up with a bad burn</li>
            <li> My skin turned red all the way around the armpit and it was so painful for about an hour afterward.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, my concern about stinking is no more.</li>
            <li> My biggest concern was that a natural alternative would result in nasty B.O.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it just shy of 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I hate the roll-on aspect of it and the container is messy with some leakage if you shake it at all.</li>
            <li> Really stinks BAAD.</li>
            <li> I got a really bad burn after this product.</li>
            <li> It was so painful</li>
            <li> SO DISAPPOINTED!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I stopped using regular deodorant about  two years ago.  During that time, I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural deodorant available at Whole Foods (GeoDeo, Tom&#x27;s of Maine, Weleda, etc.) and several from Amazon.com.  Unfortunately, none of them worked very well at controlling odors.  If I was lucky, I could get maybe six stinkless hours out of a product, but that was rare. The only thing that kept me from running back to regular deodorant was that I feared their dangerous ingredients more than my own stench. I had gone through three or four different deodorants that I ordered from Amazon.com, but I still wasn&#x27;t convinced that any of them were &amp;#34;The One&amp;#34;.  I read the reviews on this deodorant and decided to give it a try. I was prepared to be disappointed, AGAIN, but OMG, this stuff REALLY WORKS!  It lasts all day - even through my intense and sweaty cardio workouts at the gym after work.  As a couple of other reviewers mentioned, I did run into a problem with stinging when I used it right after shaving; but found if I dry my skin off well and wait about 5-10 minutes before applying, I have no problem with stinging (and I have excruciatingly sensitive skin).  I&#x27;ve just ordered a refill (love the fact that you can re-use container) and now my husband is using it.  He was also skeptical about odor control at first, but now he, too, is a believer.  Thank you for making a healthy alternative to regular deodorant that actually works for me.  UPDATE  2/25/2016:  I have been using this deodorant daily for well over a year and it continues to work amazingly well for me.  I did have issues with rashes a few months into using this product, but I think it had to do with the laundry detergent I was using at the time.  I switched that out and I haven&#x27;t had any issues since.  I am soooooooo happy I found a natural product that actually works and doesn&#x27;t contain propylene glycol or aluminum.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Works well.  It&#x27;s good to find a product that strives to be good for you.  Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used this, there was some slight burning, but that has subsided. It seems to work thus far, but the real test will be when the weather warms up.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the regular formula one. I am glad they fixed the loose ball which used to leak around during applying. Made in the USA.</li>
            <li> Love this. I sometimes have forgotten to apply it daily and it keeps on working anyway. It&#x27;s like magic. I&#x27;ve never had success with a deodorant as with this one. I also take/ingest chlorophyll capsules in conjunction and I love the combination. The 2x refill is exactly that, refills the roller cap bottle twice. I don&#x27;t see myself ever changing deodorants after finding this silver gem! :0)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need a lot and it really does keep you from stinking all day long.  I did a head to head shootout with my Dove For Men deodorant and hands down, Silver Shield wins.  By the end of the day the Dove pit STANK but the Silver Shield pit still had no odor to it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite natural deoderant. Nice application, effective and doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothes. Well done!    Update: it stings sometimes and I see other people making same claim. I still use it, but definitely avoid after shaving.</li>
            <li> This Silver Shield - Sensitive Skin deodorant product is particularly great for me.  I have been allergic to almost every kind of deodorant, even the nonallergy kinds.  Also those deodorants do not really work.  Your product works very well.  Also I had a condition called hydradenitis supurativa from deodorant allergy and the doctor left big holes/scars in my underarms by using a \\&quot;Derma Jet\\&quot; instrument to inject antibiotics.  Your product keeps those holes/scars clearned and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product for people who have problems with almost all kinds of deodorant.</li>
            <li> I had been using Dove deodorant for a few years. My boyfriend convinced me to change to a deodorant without antiperspirant and aluminum free, so I found this one and loved it. I normally don&#x27;t sweat a lot and don&#x27;t have strong BO, specially in the winter. I really liked this deodorant, it works absolutely perfectly for me, I apply it in the morning and lasts all day with no problem, I don&#x27;t have to reapply. And the price is really affordable and delivery is also fast. On the reviews some people said it stings a little, so I got the one for sensitive skin (blue). I don&#x27;t really feel the stinging, which is good. I was also concerned about the smell, but it has a really good scent, like essential oils and herbs kind of smell I think. Its seem pretty natural and safe, even better than I expected. I will probably buy a refill once I run out of mine, and recommend it to other women in my family.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for my wife who purchased it, we moved to the Arizona desert right before summer and she has sensitive skin and couldn&#x27;t use other deodorants. She would use things from the health food store none of which helped with odor.  She said this works great and would certainly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Made me stink after using it for about a month. Really stinks BAAD.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin, but don&#x27;t plan to do a lot of work or you&#x27;ll need to clean up and reapply.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant for my husband...No more smelly armpits! We had tried a lot of different deodorants out there and none of them worked!!</li>
            <li> Best all natural deodorant that works really well!  Purchased other aluminum free deodorants and they didn&#x27;t work.  I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> Works well. Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works very well as a deodorant and anti-perspirant. I have sensitive skin it doesn&#x27;t cause any problem except the occasional little sting right after I have shaved. Best to let it dry before you get dressed. I learned to apply it shortly after my shower to allow drying time before I get dressed. Love that it is natural. Last a long time. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It helped with odor but it burned after shaving. It was so painful plus I&#x27;m not sure about the one ingredient and how it could affect my health.</li>
            <li> Great product! No residue... awesome alternative to average deodorant</li>
            <li> This products works well, but contains a very small amount of deodorant for quite a large price.  I&#x27;ve since discovered that plain colloidal silver in a spray bottle works just as well, but is a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that sometimes itch.  I had been using Crystal Salt for a number of years but had to discontinue due to my increased sensitivity and itchiness.  After searching for a while, I decided to give Silver Shield Deodorant - Sensitive Skin Formula a try.  It works better than Crystal, but still haven&#x27;t found the perfect deodorant that 100% won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Product works well but I ordered the normal not sensitive skin. Product works well would recommend it to anybody else</li>
            <li> You know this was worth the purchase, it actually works.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best natural deodorants I have used. I have used MANY before, and while some worked, they caused a lot of irritation in my pits due to the amount of baking soda in them. Others that were gentler just did not keep the odor away for very long. This one though keeps me odor free all day with no irritation whatsoever, even after shaving. I like rotating between this and milk of magnesia for my deodorants. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Curious if any one else has had  break outs in armpits when using?  Large cyst like pimples?  Kind of seems like a detox response but I&#x27;m not sure,  I really like the deodorant, it works well but I may be allergic to it , bummer!</li>
            <li> This product really works for people who don&#x27;t have much luck with regular deodorants. Smells great, does not irritate skin. works for  more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY products including Tom&#x27;s of Maine to help control my odor problem and FINALLY I&#x27;ve found a product that works.  I use Colloidal Silver for many other things but for deodorant?  WOW!  this stuff really works.  Even after working out I&#x27;m not as stinky as I am when using other products.  This is a MUST for your medicine cabinet.  It&#x27;s all natural and will eliminate the odors.  Thank you Silver Botanicals for making this product.</li>
            <li> I have used many, many, natural deodorants that have failed after a few hours.  However, this product works and lasts all day.  Hooray!  It does sting just a little if I put it on right after freshly shaving my arm pits.  However, that goes away within a minute.  It does take a little bit of time to dry, but if I&#x27;m in a hurry, a quick blast with the blow dryer is all that is needed.  I&#x27;ve also purchased the floral scent for my pre-teen daughter.  She likes the scent.  I like that it is a safe product for her body.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness.  This is the best deodorant that I have used that won&#x27;t kill me with some toxic ingredient.  I&#x27;ve tried many others without aluminium, and some worked well.  However, this one goes on easily, has no odor, and keeps me dry.  And I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting toxic metals on my body.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant that I have found so far. It works great.  Because of the Aluminum in most deodorants I went on a search to find a natural deodorant.  I&#x27;ve tried several natural deodorants and most of them work for a short time but don&#x27;t last all day.  When I tried Silver Shield Deodorant I was surprised because it lasted a long time.  I put in on in the morning, it lasted all day and even after working out the next morning I still did not have any armpit odor.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of weeks now and it is still working great.  It is expensive, but to me it is worth it for my health and to avoid the embarrassment of armpit odor.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a sensitive skin deodorant since I have tried so many and most irritate my underarm. So far this one has not and also seems to work quite well.  It is a little expensive, but for someone who can not use so many others I am happy.  I do wonder if I could even use the regular version?</li>
            <li> I had been using Crystal deodorant but I noticed it didn&#x27;t last through out the day so I had been researching and came across this one and was so excited about to try it. I used it for about 4 days and was happy that it did last through out the day but my arm pits started getting red and on the 5th day I noticed I woke up with a bad burn my skin had turned purple and blisters almost cuts had developed. I discontinued the use right away and was so worried about what permanent damage this deodorant had caused on my arm pits. I started applying coconut oil and healing ointment everyday and luckily it has been 8 days since this horrible incident and my skin is peeling off and the purple is disappearing slowly. I went back to using another crystal brand  and is helping a lot. I do not recommend this product. Sorry</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin so most products irritate it.  This product is no exception.</li>
            <li> Works. And keep working for 24 hours without irritation. BUT, here&#x27;s the caveat, it&#x27;s the colloidal silver that&#x27;s killing the odor causing bacteria, not the &amp;#34;fruit cocktail&amp;#34; of obnoxious extracts that do more to irritate the underarm then anything else. This would includ several of the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; preparations produced by Silver Sheild. That&#x27;s why I switched back to the &amp;#34;Original Formula&amp;#34; (and, I would imagine the, &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; Formula would be less irritating as well based on its name) The other problem is the dispenser roller ball which frequently gets stuck and either picks up NO deoderant, or else too much. If they offer a spray, buy that instead.</li>
            <li> Just started to try this one out. It seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> I am trying to go natural with personal care products and the reviews for this looked good, so I wanted to try it.  The first two days were great.  I like how fresh it smells and it kept me dry all day.  And honestly, I am used to using Secret Clinical to stay dry and this actually worked.  I was surprised and pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, on day three I shaved, got out of the shower, and immediately put the product on.  Oh my goodness! It started burning and stinging and I had to try to wipe it off with wet cloths.  My skin turned red all the way around the armpit and it was so painful for about an hour afterward.  One of the other reviewers said it felt like fire ants - exactly!!  Major sting!!  My armpits are still really sore a day after.  I&#x27;m hoping to try some other alternatives like not putting it on until I&#x27;m ready to leave the house once my skin has dried and the pores aren&#x27;t open.  If I can&#x27;t find a solution, I&#x27;m going to have to go back to my trusted, but not preferred, method of aluminum-based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did notice some leaking after you shake the product (which it says to do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really on the fence here.  The product does work, but for a sensitive product (my skin is sensitive) I just can&#x27;t live with it burning my skin.  What to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a year of trying out different natural deodorants, this one became one of my least favorites.  I did contact the company via their website and never received a response.  Whether I shaved or not, the product still left my skin irritated, red, and extremely sensitive (and this is the sensitive formula).  I just had to accept that it just wouldn&#x27;t work for me.  I really like Jason&#x27;s Natural Deodorant.  I found it through a magazine review and think it is the best I have found.  However, I still have to use the aluminum based deodorants at the gym because the natural ones are just not strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well, stayed wet and caused a rash after several days.</li>
            <li> The product worked well, it just got moldy, so I threw it out. I wonder if the product was out of date. I may go back to spraying the crystal water instead.</li>
            <li> Recently started doing research and decided to switch to a chemical free deodorant, although I have used Degree antiperspirant for years. My biggest concern was that a natural alternative would result in nasty B.O. I do a heated aerobic type yoga class with weights, cardio, etc...let me tell you the sweat POURS off during this workout. No smell after the workout when using this deodorant, other than normal sweat stink. Also day to day use it works great. I run around a fair amount and work at a nursing home so it&#x27;s pretty warm in there some days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it just shy of 2 weeks and I&#x27;m very impressed and will definitely purchase the refill!! I am getting used to the fact that one does have some perspiration in the under arm area during a warm day, but that&#x27;s with anything I&#x27;m sure as it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant. Needless to say, my concern about stinking is no more. Love this stuff. Decent price. I have tried it after shaving, although waited an hour or so, and had no issues. I purchased the sensitive formula and there is a slight odor to it but very mild/pleasant, not floral or anything overpowering. I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but I&#x27;m sold! :) Also key may be the amount you apply, so perhaps keep that in mind!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve typically used deodorants that contained aluminum, but with the studies linking aluminum to various health problems, it is nice to find a product that is safe and WORKS.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 months and swear by it. I have sensitive skin and this product has not caused any irritation.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to a few of my family members who are enjoying it as well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with deoderant because about half way through the day, I can half smell BO nd half smell the deoderant. But I got this product and after cleaning out my pores, I use this and WOW! IT works. I only have to use deoderant every two days! and that includes taking a shower every day!</li>
            <li> First off I want to say I have very sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t use products with scents, and I normally go for organic/scentless products for my skin (laundry soap, bath soap, lotion etc).  I am also allergic to cheap metals.  Unless the metal is at least sterling silver if I have it on my skin I will break out... it makes wear jeans a pain... so I expected when I purchased this to have some skin reaction but so far I have had no issues.  It may help that I only put on a small amount (two quick swipes of the roll on) but that is more than enough to stop any smell and I don&#x27;t even think I need to use it everyday.  It&#x27;s worked very well, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am a very active person -- I dance, do yard work, play roller derby, skate recreationally, etc. Also, I&#x27;m allergic to pretty much all fragrances, as well as a bunch of other chemicals that are often found in beauty / skin care products. And if you&#x27;ve ever had allergies to the ingredients in deodorant, you know how itchy and irritated your pits can get. So if I&#x27;m exercising, my options are to just be stinky, use one of those natural crystal things and be only \\&quot;kinda stinky,\\&quot; or to use irritating typical-ingredient deodorant and not stink but be SUPER ITCHY. One day I was skating around some sort of street fair thing in Austin and came across a booth hosted by the nice people at Silver Botanicals. I did not buy the deodorant then, because I&#x27;m allergic to everything and figured I&#x27;d be allergic to this as well, but they gave me a sample of the sensitive skin formula. A few days ago I was at roller derby practice, and I applied the silver deodorant sample after about an hour of a particularly grueling practice (AFTER I was already good and stinky). Not only did it make the existing stink vanish, it prevented me from being stinky for the rest of the night. This stuff is freakin&#x27; magic -- even super harsh ingredient deodorants don&#x27;t work as well. Anyway, no irritation from the silver deodorant, and I&#x27;m buying a lifetime supply right now. Super happy to have found a deodorant that works so well.</li>
            <li> I remember a day when all my white shirts didn&#x27;t get yellow pit stains.  I have tried countless deodorants, they all cause these stains and have various other issues, such as white powder, burn my skin, what&#x27;s with all the floral odors?  I just want a deodorant that works, doesn&#x27;t have an odor, and works through out the day.  I&#x27;ve finally found it and and I&#x27;m a customer for life.  I work for a living and sweat, trust me, the product works.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this natural deodorant. Please be aware that at first it has a smell that you &amp;#34; think&amp;#34; will continue but it drys to no smell and keep you dry and last All day!!!</li>
            <li> Love. No nasty chemicals, works well to avoid odor, leaves no stains on clothing. Just don&#x27;t use it right after you shave cause it stings.</li>
            <li> I got a really bad burn after this product. I tried it more than once to make sure, but after each use I would have a bloody burn and rash under my arms. It is very unfortunate because I was so excited about this deodorant that got 3 different kinds! Not they all have to be thrown away...</li>
            <li> This deodorant hasn&#x27;t worked for me at all. I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot since it was one of the few non-aluminum deodorants on Amazon and the reviews, overall, were good. Deodorant-wise, it does nothing for me after a few hours. It is not an antiperspirant. I hate the roll-on aspect of it and the container is messy with some leakage if you shake it at all. Plus it takes forever to dry. ALSO I have a reaction to it--it doesn&#x27;t burn like other reviewers, but my armpits ITCH like mad for a couple days if I use it for more than 1 day in a row. SO DISAPPOINTED! Save your money and get a deodorant that works and does not irritate!</li>
            <li> I put this on after my shower and now I do not stink!  It works for days at a time.  It is the only product that I have found that works.  Also, it is clear.  It is a liquid with a roller ball system.  The bottle does not leak excessively.  It is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Ugg, another natural deodorant fail.  I really had high hopes for this one, and it seemed to work for the first 2 days, after that it just stopped being effective for me. The bottle leaks and it never seems to dry no matter how much bathroom chicken dancing you do. The search continues.</li>
            <li> Good but not great - for me.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes given the positive reviews, but this really didn&#x27;t do anything for me in terms of odor protection. On the positive side, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or feel sticky like some other natural deodorants, but this is sort of a moot point since I smell the same with or without it.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well for me and I will DEF buy more.</li>
