            <li>this does the trick perfectly!</li>
            <li>this is the best product!</li>
            <li>best way I found to use it was shown on the John Frieda website.</li>
            <li>the best.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is some genuinely awesome stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used their color enhancing shampoos and conditioners for a while, with excellent results, and I thought this was something that would supplement those two products, but I&#x27;d never use this because I remember what Sun-In did to my hair!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall great product though!!!</li>
            <li>but it worked perfectly!  </li>
            <li>and my hair is perfect!</li>

            <li>and it lightens my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>The best way I can describe</li>
            <li>It works wonders and it makes my hair look just the perfect color I was wanting; however I did start to notice that my hair was getting frizzier (but I attributed it to Alabama humidity).</li>
            <li>it costs about $7, it&#x27;s the best beauty secret.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>One day I woke up and  my beautiful face framing bangs were gone!</li>
            <li>Gave me a beautiful blond color!</li>

            <li>I really loved this product.  </li>
            <li>This is why I pay good money for a salon...</li>
            <li>This is why I pay good money for a salon...</li>
            <li>After two my friends asked who lightened my hair because they loved it.    </li>
            <li>and I saw good results.</li>
            <li>Remember good ol&#x27; Sun-In?</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years with good results.  </li>
            <li>I also get complements on my color fairly often</li>
            <li>The John Frieda brand name is one that I always trust to make a good product and this product has lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>Even when I am rid of it, it will take even longer to grow the layers out to a style I feel good about again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it smells really good.</li>
            <li>However, I did try it and loved it.</li>
            <li>hair is in good condition</li>
            <li>I find that it is best to use it lightly, in moderation, noting the condition of your hair as you go.  </li>
            <li>I use this once every 6-8 months and get good results.</li>
            <li>good combo</li>
            <li>all good, reviews.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I use good conditioner and shampoo and like everything in life use the spray in moderation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came on time which amazon is always good with .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using John Frieda \\&quot;Blonde\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner for a while with fairly good results.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Clairol&#x27;s Touch of Sun (no longer in production) and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I had beautiful healthy hair</li>
            <li>It was so easy to use, I loved the color it gave me, and it saved me tons of money because I didn&#x27;t have to visit the salon!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased with the results I got.   </li>
            <li>Blonder Controlled Lightening Spray as I have heard many great things about his products</li>
            <li>Very satisfying product.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been chemically treated and was very healthy.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Unless you do it in really good sun, like Florida, it kind of looks orangey.    </li>
            <li>I think this is a better alternative to the very popular sun-in spray for your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>My hair stylist always says my hair looks healthy!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Hopefully, like so many Frieda products, they don&#x27;t discontinue it!</li>
            <li>(Please see my 4 before and after photos at the top!)</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Also, using hot tools isn&#x27;t best for your hair, so don&#x27;t do it all too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hope I helped, guysusing hot tools isn&#x27;t best for your hair, so don&#x27;t do it all too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally I love this product!</li>
            <li>I used to have beautiful light brown wavy hair.</li>
            <li>my head that had been sprayed lost ALL off its elasticity (the hair underneath was still healthy FYI)!</li>
            <li>IF YOU LOVE YOUR HAIR!</li>
            <li>It took me ages to grow my healthy shiny hair and now it is a disaster!</li>
            <li>Regardless, just like with any hair product, be sure to test it on a 1&amp;#34; section of hair that you can hide if you don&#x27;t like results before using all over!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>BOY am I EVER glad I did!  </li>
            <li>, so I came home and pulled this baby out of the bag and jumped in the shower (very excited!)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super sunny and bright!</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of lightning products &amp; this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It has created amazing, natural-looking highlights.</li>
            <li>The results were amazing.</li>
            <li>The lightening spray is amazing and works just as advertised.</li>
            <li>After growing out my hair for 8 months and having a color process, my hair looked and felt amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing...</li>
            <li>I have a really good head of hair to begin with, healthy and lots of it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li>that has caused this kind damage...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;gradual&amp;#34;, kind of.</li>
            <li>The thing is that bleach works with heat, and that&#x27;s why in hair salons they use aluminum foils on your hair with lightening, because it traps the moisture in and creates warmth (kind of like a sauna for your strands).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it so sparingly as to ruin your own hair.</li>
            <li>kind of wish I just bleached it.</li>
            <li>cheaper way to do your own highlights</li>
            <li>She said that the color was nice, but my hair itself looked liked it had been bleached by someone who fell asleep on the job.  </li>
            <li>But for anyone with warm tones, this will turn your hair orange, so stay away.</li>
            <li>and I have some nice layered sun-looking streaks.</li>
            <li>perfect i highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>spray has a pleasant scent and sprays on as a fine mist.  </li>
            <li>And the best part is how very natural it looks.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply</li>
            <li>stopped mybe 3 months  or more and it still light !!</li>
            <li>excellent way to lighten your hair and have it look natural.</li>
            <li>When I tell them I use Blonder, they laugh and can&#x27;t believe what a great job it does.</li>
            <li>Someone else in that situation is better apt to answer that.</li>
            <li>It may not be fair to review a product after just one use but my hair is too important to me</li>
            <li>To all you girls reading the good reviews or have recently started using this product and think it is works well and is an amazing product...well think again!!</li>
            <li>I have a great colorist that does a super job with the top and sides of my hair.</li>
            <li>This product works great for me, but may not be right for everyone.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I love love love it!</li>
            <li>Like others have said, I thought it was a great purchase at first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it because I see a noticeable difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>This product may seem to work great at first</li>
            <li>I am happy that this worked so well and that it is very inexpensive!</li>
            <li>and it works just fine!</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t overuse this stuff, and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li>It makes it a very light blond shade.</li>
            <li>box has some very important warnings:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>but if you use a purple shampoo once a week with this it takes the orangeness out and reveals beautiful bright blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I am writing this review after 2 uses, I can already see a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I like it better than dying my hair</li>
            <li>One tip though, make sure to spray it throughout your hair not just on top.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>By the time I sprayed all the hairs I wanted, most of the product leaked to the ends of my hair and eventually off my hair.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for more, this product is a lot of work to get the look.</li>
            <li>People have even started asking me where I get my hair done because they love the color.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to do a test patch just like you would most any hair bleaching systems.</li>
            <li>, I now look as if I have a mullet, as I had to have the most severe parts cut out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many reviews saying this product is OK</li>
            <li>LOVE it and</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>so I still have many months ahead of me until this nightmare is over.  </li>
            <li>And as always I am pleased with John Frieda&#x27;s products.eady in it.</li>
            <li>And as always I am pleased with John Frieda&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>Spritz on your hair and then style, and enjoy your day!  </li>
            <li>Overall I really loved this product!!!</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I have gotten more compliments on my hair since using this product.</li>
            <li>I love it, I&#x27;m using the shampoo, conditioner and spray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>Today 2 days after my 3rd treament, my hair looks and feels great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Way better than going to the saloon every month and spending lots of money.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand why this product has so many great reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light brunette for those who are wondering!</li>
            <li>Better to use like you would if you were getting highlights</li>
            <li>so you have a more dimensional look.  </li>
            <li>It takes a couple uses to see a difference which I love because it isn&#x27;t drastic.</li>
            <li>I have ordered from Amazon many many times but never felt a need to leave a review until this product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for that extra oomph to prepare for summer.</li>
            <li>It did work well on my sons hair though:)</li>
            <li>I had a cellophane and lanse-sa treatment to try to mitigate these effects and began using more hair masks.     </li>
            <li>If anyone would like a better comparison between this and</li>
            <li>the instructions say, \\&quot;the more heat you use, the greater the lightening effects.  </li>
            <li>At times I even have to wear &#x27;top piece wigs&#x27; to disguise the mohawk part/extreme breakage.  </li>
            <li>SO glad I didn&#x27;t put it in my hair, it would have wrecked it for no result.</li>
            <li>If I do, I will to the top of my hair, never the ends.</li>
            <li>This product fried my hair and it literally all broke off the top of my head.</li>
            <li>My best friend, mother, and co-worker all had the same issues!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Product out there that doesn&#x27;t MAGICALLY kill your hair.</li>
            <li>At this moment, I decided it&#x27;s best to only use this product MAYBE once a week if applied to healthy hair and all styling tools are avoided for 48 hrs.  </li>
            <li>, I can say that I&#x27;m satisfied with the color of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this product better than Sun-In, because it can be used on color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I spray it all over my hair after getting out of the shower, or if I&#x27;m touching up my roots, I just spray that area to avoid making the ends even lighter.</li>
            <li>Helps give my roots more color.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping with some toner it will look better.</li>
            <li>why go to the salon and have to pay more when you can pick and choose where and when you want them all from your home</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love how my hair color looked when it was lighter; however, not at the expense of frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I love john frieda products and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is more harmful than just going to the salon and bleaching your hair.</li>
            <li>With a clarifying shampoo and this stuff I was able to get out the purple/grey color.</li>
            <li>The spray works okay to brighten bleached hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I see more results just by going out in the sun for 1 day without having used any products.</li>
            <li>If you want your hair to be healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Any more times after that makes your hair more your hair will be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I havent been able to spend time in the sun this summer</li>
            <li>I am so incredibly glad i did.</li>
            <li>Many people have noticed and complimented on it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>An improvement sure, but I needed highlights to punch the hair up a couple of notches.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the change.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you could you</li>
            <li>but if you just want to keep up with your roots every couple of showers or so a good spritz will keep your winter roots looking summer fresh.</li>
            <li>Her hair is still healthy.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>its going to continue to get lighter and more orange.</li>
            <li>You want it to be distributed evenly through your hair and you do not want any blotches or any areas that are too saturated with it because that&#x27;s how you end up with more damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heat speeds up the process, but will also cause more damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The more exposure to heat, the more damage and guaranteed breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair dryer &#x3D; damage, but straightening iron &#x3D; EVEN MORE damage and breakage.</li>
            <li>Hair dryer &#x3D; damage, but straightening iron &#x3D; EVEN MORE damage and breakage.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use these more than twice in a week, nor do I use them more than 3 times a month.  </li>
            <li>Much better than sun in which had an orange tinge.</li>
            <li>For me , it is just a better alternative for bleaching or dying your hair.</li>
            <li>The reason I give it four stars is because i think it would be even a better product if it didn&#x27;t need heat.</li>
            <li>If you love your hair, do NOT, under any circumstances, buy this.</li>
            <li>At first, I was thrilled!</li>
            <li>After reading the horror stories of many fellow reviewers</li>
            <li>hesitate to recommend this product as there are many reports of hair breakage.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the accompanying</li>
            <li>I have used this on top of dying and have had no</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, love this product, smells better than putting vinegar in my hair at home to lighten, and am def buying again.</li>
            <li>I have been using John Frieda&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner for years and love them</li>
            <li>Many people also complain that it changed the texture of their hair and some</li>
            <li>Do not use more than once in between washing.</li>
            <li>Interesting to see what they added and why...    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I eventually had to cut off 5 inches of hair in order to prevent any more damage.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>After four uses, my hair is blonder in some sections but mostly just brassy and orange throughout.  </li>
            <li>This product is the best in lightning hair.&lt;br /&gt;Exclusive for blonde and medium color hair....</li>
            <li>Really, i love it.</li>
            <li>I ended up with blonde hair and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>Soooo much better than using bleach</li>
            <li>, I recommend this to anyone trying to light up their hair!</li>
            <li>Then I let my hair grow out more.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to use this product and apply heat before you shower</li>
            <li>I intend to order more of this product as the results are fantstic.</li>
            <li>But I saw this product and since I love their shampoo and cream rinse</li>
            <li>and they start to blend in better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I personally find that three uses is the perfect amount for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s back to perfect.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>if used in moderation, not used with the highest heat settings and/or used for the appropriate reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this product once and did not like what it did to the texture and quality of my hair as it seemed more brittle and prone to breakage.  </li>
            <li>Most of my coworkers thought I got my hair touched up.</li>
            <li>Like it, can&#x27;t say I love it.  </li>
            <li>The product also says it should be used with heated tools like a blow dryer, curling iron or flat iron for the greatest lightening effects.</li>
            <li>I end up with great color, healthy hair, and just a tiiiiny bit more body than I would have had naturally, which is a plus for me!</li>
            <li>Even after the first use I could see a difference in how shiny and bright my hair was.</li>
            <li>Color is beautiful, and everybody thinks it&#x27;s just my natural hair color.</li>
            <li>Please, if you want to keep your long healthy hair, STAY AWAY from this product!!!!</li>
            <li>daughter use this product  for long time and is very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I loved this product when I first started it</li>
            <li>Its good because you can do it in a series of applications to get the exact color you want.  </li>
            <li>Loved it at first.</li>
            <li>For natural blondes, who tend to have finer and slicker hair texture, this is usually kind of good thing because you get more body after treating your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told that these kind of products on this site can sometimes come tampered with (idk how true that is)</li>
            <li>A blow dry works best, although my straightener helps too.  </li>
            <li>My hair was in lovely condition, was treated very well with good quality shampoos, conditioners and non-rinse out cobditioners.&lt;br /&gt;Without</li>
            <li>Now my hair looks the perfect light summer blonde!  </li>
            <li>A nice product mainly for warm sunny days.</li>
            <li>I can now go months between salon appointments for my ideal shade of blonde.</li>
            <li>gave me great color lift, natural looking.</li>
            <li>If it is blonde you seek, while avoiding truely dying your hair, this $10 solution is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Enjoy :-)  </li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t experienced any damage from using this spray, but I went on YouTube and saw some of the reviews there.  </li>
            <li>This was also why my naturally curly hair had become board straight in the areas of greatest use (this freaked me out the most).  </li>
            <li>but it stayed healthy and smooth after 3 applications.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my hair becoming lighter.  </li>
            <li>That is the most important part.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t, just all around nice golden streaks that even my co-workers asked if i had my hair done.</li>
            <li>Good product, fast highlights</li>
            <li>I bought this spray to attempt to keep the roots lightened before a salon visit, and mom was right!!</li>
            <li>I just tone my hair by mixing blue food dye in my shampoo and conditioner, and everything is all good again!</li>
            <li>I would never apply this more than 2 or 3 times to any fresh grow out or onto bleached hair!</li>
            <li>a lot so got to condition more and with a really rich conditioner.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and lightens my hair subtley.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to saturate my hair with it,</li>
            <li>o tends to break easily.</li>
            <li>The product can be drying, but is easily corrected with weekly conditioning treatments.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to spray the product</li>
            <li>I especially love it because it&#x27;s so easy to keep up with my &amp;#34;roots&amp;#34; and such an easy, quick, cheap fix.</li>
            <li>The reason it says &amp;#34;controlled lightening&amp;#34; is because it&#x27;s not as strong as a salon.</li>
            <li>It works with hydrogen peroxide and doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell...</li>
            <li>If you are considering this product, I would strongly (STRONGLY) urge you to consider splurging at a salon.</li>
            <li>I find that this is not as strong as Sun-In.  </li>
            <li>I love my hair right now!</li>
            <li>This product goes on easily and smells fine.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my beautiful, virgin blonde hair....</li>
            <li>I liked this product the first couple times I used it</li>
            <li>So excited that I have an inexpensive and super easy way to control  my roots and color!  </li>
            <li>Would you throw bleach on your hair every day and expect it to be fine?</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is not processed at all.  </li>
            <li>Sun in has quick results and its like 8 ounces for 4 bucks) anyways !</li>
            <li>Huge chunk of it, GONE.</li>
            <li>I think they should stop selling this product all together and do everybody a HUGE favor .</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t highlight the tips like it suggested because my hair is already so light on the ends.</li>
            <li>But overall, this is great for blondes looking to go blonder.</li>
            <li>it made my hair very crunchy and kind of oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although this product did lighten my hair and bring out the blonde, it can also greatly damage your hair.</li>
            <li>After a few uses it seems wonderful, but just wait!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is still a ton of product left in the bottle, so I&#x27;m really happy with the bang for my buck.  </li>
            <li>Works great for lightening hair that is already naturally blonde.</li>
            <li>After spending many hours and money in some of the top Hair Salons in Beverly Hills spending over $300 per visit, I have finally found a product to lightly lighten my roots on my own.</li>
            <li>so i figured to get my summer light hair</li>
            <li>, in order to minimize damage, is I spray LIGHTLY, so that it is just misting my hair.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair and this spray does highlight it.</li>
            <li>The color was great; I even succeeded in fooling multiple hairdressers into believing that it was all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, this spray will lighten your hair and it looks great - initially.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of using it on my scalp hair, as I know the product is designed for, I decided  to use it to lighten my arm hair instead (which is a light blondish brown</li>
            <li>i give it a three because it did get my roots and hair incredibly light.</li>
            <li>I bought it when I had light brown dyed hair</li>
            <li>My hair turned light mocha brown.</li>
            <li>Once I had more fresh growout</li>
            <li>After treating my hair, I also then lightly coat it with a heat styling protectant.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really a light brown.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product if you like me and truly are a non bottled blonde, it works great with moderation</li>
            <li>far all is good.  </li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve switched to lemon juice &amp; chamomile to lighten my hair - it&#x27;s nicely non-toxic and smells nice, but definitely doesn&#x27;t work as quickly/evenly as the Frieda spray.</li>
            <li>Thanks John Frieda!!!</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use and can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li>their website it says you can use it as many times as needed to get the shade you want, but it has been my experience with these kinds of highlighters that if you do more than one to two applications a week and more than 3 to 4 a month it&#x27;s going to damage your hair, even using lots of deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>I noticed results after just one use and significant results after 3 uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was excited to try a product that would gradually lighten my hair to my desired lightness</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I was excited that it might let me go longer between colorings.  </li>
            <li>My hair has become significantly lighter.</li>
            <li>I generally like John Frieda products and have had good results with them.</li>
            <li>FIRST, I am a woman, I&#x27;m just using my husband&#x27;s account to write this review :) -ha.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IF you have roots and no hair appointment that afternoon-it&#x27;s worth it of course!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve researched it more thoroughly since, it seems like this stuff completely dries out hair and skin and isn&#x27;t really safe.</li>
            <li>I love being able to control exactly how much I use to lighten my hair.</li>
            <li>This is Sun-in for the modern age, although it still has many of the problems of the original.  </li>
            <li>Here is the second: La Bella Lightening Gel (same effect&#x27;s, better control, better smell, better color, better consitincy, better direction&#x27;s, no heat, no</li>
            <li>Now aware of how to treat this spray and prepared for the pampering that is needed after application, I am happy with the overall results.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally bright, blonde hair, but sometimes in the winter, it darkens up a bit.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so I really like this spray, but it can be damaging.</li>
            <li>Well Its been 2 months since my last salon session and before making an appointment I decided to give this a shot, after about a good 4 uses</li>
            <li>I suppose i really should have known better..</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not too sure that it really brightens your hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, sincerely I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice, natural looking color.</li>
            <li>also with either treatment, definitely invest in a good protein based moisturizing conditioner like agadir moisture masque and this will help prevent some breakage.</li>
            <li>It should absolutely be taken off of the shelves for the damage it causes to healthy hair.</li>
            <li>This is a more modern version of Sun-In.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really my all time favorite</li>
            <li>Also tends to lighten even my real blond hair to a more orangeish shade...  </li>
            <li>I think my hair looks good and yes, very blonde.  </li>
            <li>this is going to save me, to say nothing of the access to instantly gorgeous blonde hair whenever I feel like a touch up!  </li>
            <li>The product packaging recommends about 10 uses to get the full impact.</li>
            <li>Full stop.</li>
            <li>This is not as good as the product I mentioned above</li>
            <li>:) highly reccommended!</li>
            <li>Even with dry hair, the best straightener couldn&#x27;t completely mask it.  </li>
            <li>Certainly got blonder, but never quite as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>once beautiful hair is now a mess.</li>
            <li>I used it for 2 weeks straight in Mexico last month and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li>My hair was already blonde but more strawberry, I just spritzed it on my top layer of hair and styled 4 or 5 times</li>
            <li>Take some days off, use deep conditioner to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today 2 days after my 3rd treament, my hair looks and feels great!</li>
            <li>I began using this sporadically over the summer, and I loved how light my hair got from minimal use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the most expensive conditioners and leave-in products and doing the best I can to help it recover.</li>
            <li>Peroxide is the main ingredient in this formula, along with some more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; lightening ingredients.</li>
            <li>if it doesn&#x27;t work THAT quickly for you )</li>
            <li>If you need an immediate and quick change then buy dye</li>
            <li>) Use a mild clarifying shampoo to remove waxy buildup.</li>
            <li>: 5) I have tried a bunch of moisturizing haircare lines, and for me, the best have been the Neutrogena Triple Moisture Shampoo and Daily Deep Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I stopped using the conditioner immediately, but over the next 2-3 weeks I noticed more and more of my ends breaking and splitting UP my hair shaft, we&#x27;re talking</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am quite happy with the money I&#x27;ve saved using a box color (not too far from my natural) along with this product to get the color I like.</li>
            <li>visited salon after using this product and luckily for me my stylist realised i had been using something that was lifting my roots...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>rather my hair is becoming more golden light blonde.</li>
            <li>Blends nicely and provides just the right about of natural blond highlighting.</li>
            <li>I spritzed it pretty lightly all around my hair, and some of the spray must&#x27;ve landed on my ears.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t just read the good reviews when considering a product filled with peroxide and other chemicals.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I wanted to do...which was to lighten my hair in a cheap efficient way.</li>
            <li>I noticed a change after the very first use &amp; my hair has continued to get lighter with each use.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I first used this in October when my friend who has light brown hair told me she used it for highlights.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure if I sprayed a good amount on the top of my hair it would smell even worse.  </li>
            <li>Every few months, I treat my regrowth three times and end up bringing my light caramel-y tresses up to a perfect light honey blonde.</li>
            <li>Has nice smell too and does not dry my hair.</li>
            <li>:) It looks SO natural!</li>
            <li>After the first use of this product, I can already see the difference!</li>
            <li>This stuff helped so much!!</li>
            <li>Hair care 101 people: you shouldn&#x27;t use more than one lightning product at a time unless you are a professional!</li>
            <li>This worked pretty well!</li>
            <li>Not so great a lightener as it rapidly ruins hair!  </li>
            <li>to ensure the product would have a clean, consistent application on freshly washed hair.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for golden tones, yea this will do it.</li>
            <li>I rarely wore my hair up because of that before.</li>
            <li>It is SO effective, I had to stop using it because my hair was getting REALLY blonde, and not looking for a platinum effect.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe that John Frieda has stooped this low and produced a product like this.  </li>
            <li>Know how the sun turns your hair golden</li>
            <li>Know how the sun turns your hair golden</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I honestly don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve used it a third time - my hair is noticeably lighter.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lightening spray by far.</li>
            <li>Do not use it frequently and be sure not to spray the roots.  </li>
            <li>reason I got this is because I find it works really nicely on the darker hair that I have next to my neck-</li>
            <li>I like a more natural look</li>
            <li>Overall nice hair care product.</li>
            <li>I rarely blow-dry my hair (</li>
            <li>This product promises visible results in 3-5 uses, and since it is also a Frieda product, worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 uses</li>
            <li>A gorgeous blonde color, looks totally natural - and this smells good enough to use it any day after any shower, instead of having to take a shower after I spray it on!  </li>
            <li>I think you just have to know your hair, don&#x27;t expect to go all the way from brown to blonde without any damage, and be nice to your hair in the process.</li>
            <li>I realize having good hair isn&#x27;t everything, but for someone who has had healthy, natural, long hair her whole life, this is so upsetting for me.</li>
            <li>I have a long way to go and probably will not be able to use color of any kind on my hair until the areas I used the Go Blonder spray have completely grown</li>
            <li>I have a long way to go and probably will not be able to use color of any kind on my hair until the areas I used the Go Blonder spray have completely grown</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have more fun with a FULL head of hair than with blonde hair and hair breakage.</li>
            <li>It was right before my wedding</li>
            <li>I offered to brush it out, and as I did, my hair just began to break right off.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t overdo it either, it gave me just the right amount of lightener I desired.</li>
            <li>If you are using this product DO NOT use it often, or discontinue use right away.  </li>
            <li>All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li>so much cheaper and more natural than going to the salon!!  </li>
            <li>In which is very similar, and that seems to leave my hair in better condition, but doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as this does.</li>
            <li>I eventually noticed that the lightening spray lightened my natural highlights and brought up the color of my hair, so it looked very natural and really nice.</li>
            <li>It adds some nice, natural-looking brightness for people like me who are not interested in &amp;#34;going for it&amp;#34; and getting full salon highlights.</li>
            <li>I STRONGLY advise anyone against this spray..spend the money and see a professional stylist, Lightening should not be done at home</li>
            <li>Which makes me feel better because I was worried I had some sort of vitamin deficiency, but it also makes me feel worse because before I used this product all of the Amazon reviews were good.</li>
            <li>Which makes me feel better because I was worried I had some sort of vitamin deficiency, but it also makes me feel worse because before I used this product all of the Amazon reviews were good.</li>
            <li>I use it on the rare occasion when I heat-style my hair, but mostly when I will be outside in the sun during the day.</li>
            <li>Pretty much if your hair is naturally a cool tone brunette, it should work.</li>
            <li>I had no idea what was going on, and for a long time, I was in denial that it had anything to do with my beloved John Frieda spray -- it had worked wonderfully for such a long time, so why would it suddenly start damaging my hair?</li>
            <li>but i only used on my tips for the look , just once a week and nothing else than going outside with the sun at noon lol</li>
            <li>I am naturally a lighter medium blonde with beautiful natural highlights.</li>
            <li>I first bought the spray two years ago, right about when it first came out.</li>
            <li>Using this product with my blow dryer 1 or 2x a week keeps it super light and barely costs anything compared to the salon.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have very much of it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, and I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important to note that most of the people saying their hair started breaking off used this excessively or incorrectly.</li>
            <li>(so it is probably more technically correct to say that I used it strictly by the directions 2 times).     </li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re willing to work for it and be patient, this will work.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair with natural lighter brown highlights.</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>As a blonde, I can confidently say \\&quot;YES!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>When I first heard about this product, I decided to check it out.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t magic or some miracle product -- it&#x27;s peroxide mixed with some fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have not even finished my first bottle</li>
            <li>and then I use a hot iron on my bangs.  </li>
            <li>, she wants her 4-5 x a year $150 from me!  </li>
            <li>, she wants her 4-5 x a year $150 from me!  </li>
            <li>I have tiny hairs sticking straight up on top of my head, from the damage, and I can barely get a brush through my once healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>first noticed the breakage after my first highlight in the salon during the use of this product.</li>
            <li>I have had so many people comment on how blonde my hair has gotten.</li>
            <li>At first I was semi-pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>However, after finishing the first bottle of this product my hair began to snap off at the roots/part leaving 1-2 inch pieces.  </li>
            <li>I use ash blonde color on my hair but sometimes want to brighten it up a bit more.  </li>
            <li>And i really saw results !</li>
            <li>We have been using this a couple of years now since it first came out.</li>
            <li>I had used this for months and was very pleased that it kept my dark roots at bay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another downside of this product is that coloring hair darker will proof challenging later</li>
            <li>And you should probably try test patches to make sure your multiple coloring methods don&#x27;t do things like make your hair fall out!!  </li>
            <li>The bottle says it takes 7- 8 uses to see results, I saw results after the first time.</li>
            <li>I ONLY use it on the roots around the face and visible areas on top of my head - not on the whole head/hair!</li>
            <li>I chose this product prior to reading the many reviews that talk about how it damaged people’s hair.  </li>
            <li>I have light brown hair with too much silver but used to spray and enjoy using Sunin when I was much younger</li>
            <li>My hair is dyed blonde and I was looking for a more summer</li>
            <li>My hair is much lighter and shinier now!</li>
            <li>It brightens exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I noticed results the with the first dose.  </li>
            <li>I then did it again the next day and it got even more lighter.  </li>
            <li>I have medium-to-dark brown hair (not brunette by any means) but was blond when I was younger and miss it:)  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I think that if you don&#x27;t have legit blonde hair, then you are more prone to have some issues.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely can see the results!</li>
            <li>This was my first time using the lightening spray.</li>
            <li>First I used it with my curling iron.</li>
            <li>My local salon uses a hair dye that has fewer chemicals than most</li>
            <li>this just keeps it a better, brighter color than regular sunlight</li>
            <li>I got this product when it first came on the market</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I only used it at the front of my face.&lt;br /&gt;DO</li>
            <li>they ended up refunding my money and then asked me to go back and give them a better review, which of course I did not do.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for several years.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when this runs out.</li>
            <li>I started using it last Friday more then</li>
            <li>I suggest Sun-in instead because it does the same thing and smells better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suggest using this on your entire head more than maybe twice.</li>
            <li>but I was interested in making it a couple of shades lighter.  </li>
            <li>If I do start to see breakage, I will discontinue use at the first sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that 10 is waaaaay too many and likely would lead to damage.</li>
            <li>The next morning before I wash it out, I heat it once more with the hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I used to use (years ago) peroxide with no ill effects, but this spray seems to damage my hair.</li>
            <li>The more heat you use, the better the product works so if you want to lighten quickly, blow dry and straighten with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>oh well, you live and learn right!</li>
            <li>now i have a very pretty light blonde color and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to achieve your desired look the first time you use it, or you will most likely end up with really damaged hair and pretty upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is very light naturally though, and this stuff will make it near white.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am always highlighting and putting more blonde in my hair and my natural color is kind of an ashy blonde</li>
            <li>i cant stress enough how damaging this is to your hair as it leaves it dry, brittle and destroys the pigments in your hair where you use it most!!</li>
            <li>Spray generously the areas to be lightened, or if doing your entire hair, one section at a time, then either using a hair dryer, or flat iron (I had wonderful results with a flat iron) heat up the section and move to the next.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The flat iron does a better job.</li>
            <li>On my next trip to my stylist (who I have been seeing for years and is now a trusted friend who attends family events), he told me that he could sell me a professional coloring and let me pay for it, but that honestly my color looked \\&quot;fabulous\\&quot; and I should just keep doing what I was doing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they were mostly positive.  </li>
            <li>I am thoroughly convinced that anyone writing a positive review for this product has been paid by John Frieda to do so.</li>
            <li>so I could pretty much do a comb over to conceal this catastrophe.</li>
            <li>First, you really have to use heat.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with hair lightening products, but since the color of my hair can vary depending upon the season and how much sun it gets, I was interested in using this product to try to maintain the lighter tone.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed any drying out and my hair still grows long and healthy.</li>
            <li>I personally only use one bottle for all over lightening which gives me a nice summer blonde and isn&#x27;t so light I need to use it again on my roots - they lighten up naturally in the spring/summer and you can&#x27;t even tell I used a lightening product!</li>
            <li>Before John Frieda&#x27;s &amp;#34;Sheer Blonde Go Blonder Controlled Lightening Spray,&amp;#34; I had beautifully healthy, lightly treated (highlights) blonde hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is a nice dark to medium blond.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m the kind of person that will spend the extra few bucks at the store, just to play it safe.</li>
            <li>it actually smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It works even better if you blow dry your hair after you use it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you blow dry after spraying it on or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My hair is also more dry when using this product, but that could be associated with using the shampoo and conditioner along with this spray-</li>
            <li>A sun kissed look was achieved, and even with dry hair, I felt more radiant.  </li>
            <li>So after I showered, I parted my hair as I normally style it and spritzed it only on the top layer of my hair,</li>
            <li>We were sure the product didn&#x27;t touch the roots because it can really dry out the hair and didn&#x27;t use it one day after another.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this more than advised on the bottle will lead to excessively dry, brittle hair.</li>
            <li>It was healthy, natural, shiny, barely blow-dried hair.</li>
            <li>So, I started using this every couple of months and the grey hair just looks blond and make nice natural highlights.</li>
            <li>I have never written a review for any consumer product in my life, but I have SUCH strong feelings about this one that I feel it my duty to warn you all.  </li>
            <li>but I would strongly caution users not to double up on these products.  </li>
            <li>, be smart, don&#x27;t kill your hair thinking there&#x27;s a lightening</li>
            <li>I had my friend mask large sections of hair</li>
            <li>It can make your hair brassy if you repeatedly use in combination with conditioners, or certain hair products.  </li>
            <li>my roots also get the shaft because i always wear my hair up and parted a certain way therefore when i am in the sun it doesn&#x27;t get all of the spots i would like.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally dark ash blonde and it&#x27;s now a bright golden blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I need highlights to make it look dimensional, especially because it&#x27;s so fine.</li>
            <li>I do not consider the shampoo or conditioner to be very high quality or hydrating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, just spray it on and then dry hair with a hot dryer or use a drying iron.</li>
            <li>I will certainly have to highlight my hair professionally again, but hopefully not as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks John Frieda!!!</li>
            <li>Again, in certain lights I feel like its a little on the reddish/brassy side, but in natural light it looks good and blonde.  </li>
            <li>For myself on or near my previously colored hair, I was happy with initial results but experienced damage over time similar to other reviewers.</li>
            <li>Even though I saw my hair get more golden, I think a lot of it was wasted in the process of spraying it into my hair.</li>
            <li>I normally have very healthy hair, but this stuff was incredibly harsh on it.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely zero complaints about this product.</li>
            <li>This really does work.</li>
            <li>BUT it will take a while if you want to really lighten it.</li>
            <li>Literally, I would blow-dry it and my brush (and hands) would be filled with entire clumps of hair.  </li>
            <li>Since the tips of my hair are so much lighter than the roots</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 7 months with fantastic results.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It hurts SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However the highlighting instruction video was very helpful in how to apply the product.</li>
            <li>If you used it too much it made it have an orange tint to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got light brown hair and have for years lightened it up with various shampoos and citrus products.</li>
            <li>My naturally blonde hair gets extra blonde in the summer as I spend so much time in the sun, this product is great for fall/</li>
            <li>I used to be blonde when I was a kid, but when I grew up my hair turned light brown.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I used it again and my hair has really lightened.</li>
            <li>it worked very well for my hair</li>
            <li>so I absolutely freaked out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using too much ammonia/bleach on my hair, but sometimes I feel like highlighting parts of it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect too much of a difference</li>
            <li>This scared me, as I usually have very healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much bleaching and can cause damage.  </li>
            <li>you use hair products responsibly, they will work for you.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally a light mousy brown, and this spray has taken my hair to a medium blonde after about 10 uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through about a whole bottle of this, and I&#x27;m still not 100% on how I feel about it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want to have to do that</li>
            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>Here was the real reason:</li>
            <li>My hair is blonde but I like it to be really light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hit or miss for brunettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After just three uses of spraying it lightly on my roots and \\&quot;streaking\\&quot; it close to my face, I have shiny blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I remember you always being so much blonder!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After two applications; i could feel my hair was VERY upset with me.</li>
            <li>and she sprayed this on the same areas I wanted blonder using a light spray.</li>
            <li>I put it on my roots in the winter when I don&#x27;t get as much sunlight.</li>
            <li>The product worked really well on her hair.  </li>
            <li>She now has a shade lighter and really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed any change in my hair color.</li>
            <li>He cut as much of the damaged hair as he could off</li>
            <li>you will be able to lighten your hair with minimal damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you will be able to lighten your hair with minimal damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You could end up with some very damaged hair.</li>
            <li>You can control how much and how often of this spray you want to use.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks my hair looked like I had been pouring straight bleach on it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got brown hair or are trying to repeatedly lighten your whole head</li>
            <li>For a solid year, my experience with this product was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I regret using this spray so much.</li>
            <li>Not so much the case with this lightening spray.</li>
            <li>Very stubborn.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re concerned or have very processed or brittle hair, err on the side of caution and just don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>I found this product to work very well.</li>
            <li>I definitely plan to use again if I decide to go light again.</li>
            <li>I deducted a star because I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li>actually not even light brown</li>
            <li>I havnt really seen a difference.</li>
            <li>and it didnt do much,</li>
            <li>I sprayed it on lightly and stayed out in the sun for a short while.</li>
            <li>my whole life I&#x27;ve used Sun-In.  </li>
            <li>Treat your hair gently.</li>
            <li>If you fall into this category, I really think this product probably isn&#x27;t for you</li>
            <li>and i havent had much of a change since i started using this product.</li>
            <li>and I spend too much money on it to risk damage.</li>
            <li>This does lighten hair effectively but it dried my hair out quit a bit and made it brittle.</li>
            <li>I usually use some kind of hot oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally medium brown hair, but I&#x27;ve dyed it almost all shades imaginable over the last four years, so I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how my hair would handle it.</li>
            <li>this along with a blond shampoo that eliminates brassiness helped me achieve a more natural yellow blond.</li>
            <li>One does need to read directions carefully, but I have had fair enough results with this spray.  </li>
            <li>After a month of using it, my hair had become a lovely lighter blonde with natural looking highlights.</li>
            <li>I thought I would read some of the other reviews BEFORE I went too far, and am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Found this product and  WOW!!!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>Go to a professional and get it done right.</li>
            <li>I usually use sun-in but after discovering this, it&#x27;s way better!  </li>
            <li>If you use this product more than once a week to once every other week it WILL severely damage your hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sitting in the sun for an hour on a hot summer day did the trick, but my hair most definitely felt different compared to before using this product.  </li>
            <li>:)  Be careful and take your time!</li>
            <li>you are in a hurry to see extreme highlights or lightening, you are better off to buy a highlighting kit, or just dye your hair.</li>
            <li>you are in a hurry to see extreme highlights or lightening, you are better off to buy a highlighting kit, or just dye your hair.</li>
            <li>There were still pieces of the original box stuck to it, but I figured that I would pick those off later.</li>
            <li>(I used a diffuser - did not blow out straight and iron straight as suggested, just used high heat with a diffuser)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural blond and this product lightens my hair in such a way that, while my hair is much blonder after ~5-10 applications, it still looks natural :-)</li>
            <li>I have light blond hair not naturally</li>
            <li>I started with 3-4 uses all over my hair when I first got the product, and then once a month near my roots for maintenance.</li>
            <li>I only used it 3 times and got the full effect that I wanted so just pace yourself</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good luck with Suave Naturals Daily Clarifying shampoo; I use it only on my roots (where I had buildup from the Go Blonder Spray) and follow with a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>but it changed the intended lighter color much darker than both my hair and the normal color range for that wash.</li>
            <li>I have used John Frieda shampoo/conditioners in the past and really liked the results.</li>
            <li>I was about to cave and actually get some professional highlights this winter because my color was so beautiful after this past summer and</li>
            <li>I loved it at first but not my hair is dry damaged and there is so much breakage that has left me with short pieces of hair near the crown of my head.</li>
            <li>Go Blonder uses peroxide to lighten, which is nothing new and really</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a GOOD conditioner to counteract all the bad side effects.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a GOOD conditioner to counteract all the bad side effects.</li>
            <li>Using more chemicals on my hair burned half of my hair off (where I used to part my hair).  </li>
            <li>just lightly blow dry on the lowest setting and that is sufficient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural light brown/dark blonde</li>
            <li>This has been so challenging to hide all of these short spots because it&#x27;s in multiple places.  </li>
            <li>The main ingredient here is Hydrogen Peroxide, which will severely damage your damage your hair (why do you think the makers of permanent hair color brag about their ammonia-free, peroxide-free products?)</li>
            <li>Yes, it lightens hair, but at a tremendous cost to overall hair health.</li>
            <li>In the summertime it still gets super blonde.</li>
            <li>Luckily for me I only used it along my hair line and along my main part, so</li>
            <li>with just peroxide my hair went to more of a white blonde.</li>
            <li>I must say I love this product, and I still have about 2/3 of the bottle left for future use.</li>
            <li>Now, my medium brown hair will change quickly with this product, especially when I put it on and sit in the sun until it dries.</li>
            <li>I used this more multiple years not realizing what it was actually doing to my hair.</li>
            <li>and naturally it wasn&#x27;t as light of a blonde as I had hoped for</li>
            <li>Many people are stating this product ruined their hair, dried it out and made it very prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>The effects were obvious but nothing over the top because I wasn&#x27;t going for a big difference.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was only on the ends</li>
            <li>I used it all over my hair maybe 4 times initially, then sprayed only at the roots every 2 weeks before blow-drying (for the most part</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually found that the combination of clarifying shampoo and deep conditioner makes my hair softer -- I think removing the buildup allows hair to absorb more of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all mostly ignore warning labels on hair products such as hair dye, such as the \\&quot;do a test patch before use\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>While a good day at the hairdresser can make you feel like a million bucks, the unfortunate opposite is true by using this product for any length of time as it can turn your precious asset into cheap looking dull orange hair.</li>
            <li>and as I started to scrub CHUNKS started to fall into the tub, my long beautiful hair being swept down the drain!!!</li>
            <li>Thus far, I have used a full bottle of the spray and have started on a second one (though I will be going through that one much slower, as I have reached my desired tone).</li>
            <li>I highly advise anyone thinking about using this product to think twice.  </li>
            <li>If you do I would highly suggest putting a cream or leave in conditioner afterwards to avoid damage.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I use high quality shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this wonderful product for a couple years now, only in late winter to get my natural blonde hair to</li>
            <li>My hair has been pretty much the same for my entire life: naturally dark blonde, never color treated or bleached, fine, straight, and healthy.</li>
            <li>I will certainly have to highlight my hair professionally again, but hopefully not as often.    </li>
            <li>and after about four months, while the hair was certainly lightened, it started to clearly show signs of damage.  </li>
            <li>The entire crown of my head felt like I had dipped it in hot grease!</li>
            <li>My sister has very, very coarse hair, while my mom&#x27;s is fine and neither or them have reported too much damage in the last three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though I used it strictly according to directions, I&#x27;ve found that it does help lighten the hair and take some of the brassiness out of my hair, but with one major problem: it caused my hair to become very brittle, even with intense moisturizing and conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>So i bought this product because my naturally dirty blonde hair started to get darker as i got older, becoming more of a light brown.</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s paranoia, but a bad color job is on of my greatest fears.  </li>
            <li>It also turned my naturally curly hair board straight in the front.</li>
            <li>very gradual, natural looking lightening.</li>
            <li>As a natural blonde, this lightened my hair while keeping my look natural, which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>First I did the highlights and then the whole head, after ONE use, all of my friends noticed the next day at school</li>
            <li>so I used just a tiny bit of this all over her hair, just to make it fresh and summery.</li>
            <li>I normally just use my hairdryer or no heat at all</li>
            <li>golden blonde hair</li>
            <li>is just now returning to a normal length and strength.</li>
            <li>This product should not be used more then a few times because it will damage.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally golden blonde</li>
            <li>where the sun would normally hit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It all started out normal mixing up the bleach then applying it to my hair</li>
            <li>and I waited my normal amount of time.</li>
            <li>Lightening hair is just not worth the damage, I think I&#x27;ll try to find a more natural way to do it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have a split end normally.</li>
            <li>Do not use more than 10 times in between colorings.&lt;br /&gt;After just a few times of trying it, we both decided to stop.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure as with all high lighting products that are store bought, it will dry out and possibly damage your hair over time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;mite be suitable 4hair that is naturally blonde but certainly not</li>
            <li>The new growth of my hair is just as healthy as my hair used to be, and eventually I&#x27;ll be able to trim the last of the broken ends off</li>
            <li>This lightening spray is a quick and easy way to add a little \\&quot;blonde pizzazz\\&quot; to your hair style between visits to a salon.  </li>
            <li>I also only use a hair dryer because a straightening iron or a curling iron will dry it out and damage it even more (even though their instruction video says to do it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, I recommend this product to any natural blonde who wants to go a little lighter and get a nice shimmer.</li>
            <li>I donned a loose top knot that day to avoid further damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took the produt to my hair dressers who informed me that this spray is very damaging to hair, should only be used once or twice at most, and most certainly not with excessive heat applied afterwards, as the instructions say to do.</li>
            <li>As a natural dark blonde it was just lovely for the first 6 months or so of use.  </li>
            <li>and you should only trust your tresses to a trained professional if you want to bring it all the way up to full-on blonde and maintain your hair&#x27;s natural healthy and beauty.</li>
            <li>, I have never actually dyed my hair, and I must say the results that come from this little bottle of spray is just amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural darker blonde and pretty much</li>
            <li>It also colored the little bit of gray I had to a really nice blonde color.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li>This product completely destroyed my healthy long blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>at your own risk if your hair is darker than a dark blonde, NATURALLY.</li>
            <li>And I did reapply this product to not so newly washed hair followed by my hair mask and</li>
            <li>I would also not recommend using it as a root touch up as it can cause breakage to new growth.</li>
            <li>I live in the south, so the sun kissed look is always acceptable for hair.  </li>
            <li>It works very well at first but not intended for long terms use.</li>
            <li>Because of this product when i got my hair coloured at a hairdressers it turned my hair a really light blonde compared to the rest of my hair which is caramel blonde which is the colour it was supposed to turn out like!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product, especially if you naturally have a light brown to golden blonde color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several years on my naturally light reddish-brown, used to be strawberry blonde, hair.  </li>
            <li>I avoid the sun now and this product helped me lighten my hair myself and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>You can touch up your roots and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I use it about every 3 weeks or so, just on my roots, and it keeps me with a very natural looking blonde.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural looking</li>
            <li>It works wonders on the beach speacially and gives a very natural look, don&#x27;t apply it too close to the root.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to lighten my hair without the high cost of professional highlights.</li>
            <li>It brings my old color right back</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde but as I am getting older, my blonde is starting to go more towards brown.</li>
            <li>When I first bought it I only used it with my straightener and blow dryer</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure different shades of blonde would come out different colors after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 3 uses, my brown roots are completely blond!</li>
            <li>I normally keep my dark ash blonde hair highlighted but haven&#x27;t had time to get to the salon lately so most of my highlights were gone</li>
            <li>It helps if you section your hair first, so you have smaller sections to work with, and you can spray this liberally over each section.</li>
            <li>They were so short they stuck straight up in the air!</li>
            <li>The hydrogen peroxide definitely is what highlights the hair, but there are other protective oils,etc that make this product worthwhile to me.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time and immediately saw a lightening of the darker blonde in my hair.  </li>
            <li>First off, your only suppose to use this once per wash.</li>
            <li>John Frieda came out with a product that does exactly what it claims to do, lighten blonde hair up to 1-1/2 shades.</li>
            <li>If this LITERALLY burned my hands, what would it do to my (sensitive) scalp?!</li>
            <li>I then reduced using the spray to about three times a week, then again as soon as I&#x27;d see the first sign of my roots, so about four weeks later.</li>
            <li>Granted, im already pretty blonde</li>
            <li>so my hair is not lighting naturally like normal.</li>
            <li>** and give you a pretty result-BUT you will pay for it in one way or another later.</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde and this stuff gives me the extra summer blonde glow I love.</li>
            <li>I now am left with huge patches of hair about 3 inches long all over my head.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s relatively gentle; not sure how light it will go.</li>
            <li>and I rarely blow dry my hair</li>
            <li>Ever since graduating college and taking a full time 9-5 job, I&#x27;ve been concerned that I wouldn&#x27;t have enough day hours outside to get my hair to lighten up with</li>
            <li>If I would bleach my hair, I would never really do it everyday and this product is no different from doing exactly that.</li>
            <li>At first, I only wanted to use it to help go longer between professional highlighting.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to use anything strong or with harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>This little hair routine was going just fine for a year and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not certain if this product is somewhat mild because i did condition my hair</li>
            <li>I naturally have dark brunette hair, but I can&#x27;t help love how blonde brightens my face.</li>
            <li>It usually turns more blonde in the summer, but this summer it didn&#x27;t seem to change as much, so</li>
            <li>So while it works, I would hesitate to recommend it to a female blonde who wants to use this on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>Alas, I was able to brush my hair!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural dark blonde and this product lightens my hair to give it more natural looking variation.</li>
            <li>I am now having to do deep conditioning treatments to try to fix this mess that used to be healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>I can really see a difference in my hair, and I discovered it works even waaaay better when I applied it to my dry hair and laid out in the sun for a few hours while tanning and WOW is all I can say.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair a little more blonde than I like, but</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde, but it&#x27;s kind of dull</li>
            <li>I will use it very sparingly in the future, and hope the company addresses the harshness of the product.</li>
            <li>I use this year round to keep my roots light</li>
            <li>I started to use this stuff as my natural colour can be a bit \\&quot;brassy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that would look natural and I could apply myself.  </li>
            <li>and it did not look natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo &amp; conditioner for about a month now and definitely noticed a difference with them, but it wasn&#x27;t until I bought the spray that I really started noticing a substantial change.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product to lighten the ends further without using bleach because the bleach really damages my ends and this doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this product with the accompanying shampoo and conditioner for about two weeks, and i can say that it has completely destroyed my hair.</li>
            <li>My naturally soft and shiny hair has literally turned to straw.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking to get bleach blonde hair and this product works well for what I really wanted.</li>
            <li>only reason why I gave this product 4 instead of 5 stars was because I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to really notice that my hair is getting lighter.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying, my NATURAL hair color is medium brown.</li>
            <li>I am a natural blond.</li>
            <li>Now I have to go to a salon and get it fixed.  </li>
            <li>I got a lot of compliments from people asking me if it was my natural hair color.</li>
            <li>This product somehow picks up on natural highlights in hair and makes them glow and shine.</li>
            <li>Directions indicate that it should be used with dyed hair, but I used it on my natural hair and it works wonders.</li>
            <li>I do not use heated tools very often, and being in the sun helped me so this may not be overly necessary.    </li>
            <li>The product directions specify to use it with as much heat as possible.</li>
            <li>Now, with this, you don&#x27;t need to use foil or anything, just use direct heat (that&#x27;s also why Sun-In probably didn&#x27;t work for you sometimes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like putting too much bleach on your white clothes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like putting too much bleach on your white clothes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped using this product, as i am looking for something that will bring out my existing natural highlights.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally blond</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li>However, having read through the negative reviews, I will say that I probably have sturdier hair than most --</li>
            <li>I also wouldn&#x27;t use it on roots if you&#x27;re sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have not had any breakage as a direct cause of it.</li>
            <li>My hair was a darker blonde and it&#x27;s lightened up maybe a shade or two, but is very brassy looking.</li>
            <li>yeah, the stuff everyone pays 100.00 for mine is natural..</li>
            <li>If you are getting your hair lightened professionally, it&#x27;s probably being bleached.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recomend this product for natural, un-dyed blondes.</li>
            <li>Well, my fears were confirmed when I saw my grandpa few weeks ago, and he said to me &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li>I have naturally medium-dark ashy brown hair</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s been about a month</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well it works.  </li>
            <li>I completely regret using this product.</li>
            <li>* Do not use on natural brown or darker shades of hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product does have a gross smell to it, I didn&#x27;t use that much of it</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to smell this on my hair constantly, and going out in the summer sun just intensifies that scent.  </li>
            <li>It did provide some lightening, but I&#x27;d rather pay for a professional to lighten my hair.</li>
            <li>There should be a class action lawsuit against John Frieda company.</li>
            <li>Until your hair starts to frizz and break at the roots and grows out completely fried, falling off.</li>
            <li>and it did lighten considerably</li>
            <li>That being said, you do have to use your common sense as it does contain HYDROGEN PEROXIDE, one of the most damaging things to put on your har.</li>
            <li>On darker hair it will uncover the red undertones - this happens to my son, who becomes more of a copper red/dark blonde than a yellow blonde.  </li>
            <li>After the third day, I was amazed with how much lighter my hair was.  </li>
            <li>It gives a natural looking sun kissed look with out the brassy highlights.  </li>
            <li>Instead of redyeing my hair, I just decided to do a soft ombre with the John Frieda lightening spray.</li>
            <li>I think the people who have left unfavorable reviews may be expecting too much from this product and/or overusing it.</li>
            <li>This spray helps me keep it light year round</li>
            <li>and it looks natural without having to spend money on coloring my hair at the salon.</li>
            <li>and so far I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the cost or hassle of professional highlights.  </li>
            <li>and it helps to make my root to regular hair transition much easier.</li>
            <li>I used this product on my coloured hair and my hair is completely ruined....</li>
            <li>On top of my missing hair, the color correction turned my hair ashy and purple in some spots and still is the gross orange/yellow color all over.  </li>
            <li>:  Ok, so a few days have gone by since I did my 3rd treatment...</li>
            <li>Ok, so a few days have gone by since I did my 3rd treatment...</li>
            <li>Now 6 months later I have a line in my (what used to be beautiful long hair) about 4\\&quot; below my roots of completely broken fried hair.</li>
            <li>As a naturally dirty blonde the John Frieda Spray is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t change your roots from dark to super blonde and unnatural.</li>
            <li>, then jump right back in the shower to put on a deep conditioning hair masque.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem smart to flat iron hair that I just put peroxide on.</li>
            <li>(mainly the top layers) without giving me a pixie cut, which left me with extremely short and choppy layers.  </li>
            <li>I am positive that this product is not suitable for everyone, and seems to especially do terrible damage to those with dyed hair, but I have been extremely happy with the results I&#x27;ve received and would recommend it to friends who do not have dyed hair! :)</li>
            <li>As a disclaimer, I have naturally dark golden blonde hair that looks much darker indoors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a year, I started noticing the same weird breakage pattern that many other reviewers have mentioned: a fair amount of hair was breaking off into dry, frizzy,</li>
            <li>One pointer I would like to share to make the product go further is to spray SB/GB on your roots mainly and then rub product throughout your hair and follow with combing it through your hair for even distribution.</li>
            <li>Additionally-this usually retails for only about $10 at most stores</li>
            <li>Difficult to just get the roots this way, because it tends to brighten highlights more quickly than darker blonde.</li>
            <li>I do this in a well-ventilated room, as the blow drying in particular creates some gross peroxide fumes.</li>
            <li>you are trying to keep your naturally dark hair a light blonde, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>Overall my hair is probably 1/4-1/2 shade lighter (a little more on the ends where some highlighting was left), and so far, no brassiness.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally dark brown with a tint of redish brown, and this stuff really brings out the amber color in my hair!!</li>
            <li>so I would not know how it would affect hair that doesn&#x27;t regularly use high end salon brand shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>It damages your hair so badly, that over period of time, that area you sprayed gets weaker and more and more fragile.</li>
            <li>The color, however, was much brighter and even shiny - strange considering the lack of moisture in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Using this for two weeks along with their shampoo and conditioner and my normal blond locks are back.</li>
            <li>On the box, it recommends using hot tools after blowdrying, such as a flat iron or curling iron, to intensify the effects.</li>
            <li>Use it only a few times per month to ensure you keep your hair healthy and also so my hair wouldn&#x27;t become bleach blonde.</li>
            <li>It worked very well, better than the old Sun-In product of my youth!&lt;br /&gt;However the stern warnings on the box troubled me:  </li>
            <li>just right, after reading previous reviews of this product I completely changed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think it worked, took out most of the blonde I worked so hard to get, but something had to be done</li>
            <li>and I think it worked, took out most of the blonde I worked so hard to get, but something had to be done</li>
            <li>I got out and looked at my head and noticed that my hard literally MELTED off where I had applied that stuff (mostly on my part line) and what was left of the hair</li>
            <li>I  could see how if you kept using it over and over it would probably damage your hair because your hair does feel a little dry after you use it and blow dry/flat iron it, but I think that if you use it in moderation you will have no problems and love the natural color it adds to blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Since writing my review, I&#x27;ve read several new reviews about people literally losing their hair from using this product.</li>
            <li>I would kill for dark roots right about now compared to what I&#x27;ve ended up with.</li>
            <li>BUT, will say, whatever is in this, sprayed on and blow dried, this product produces amazing results, in just a few applications.</li>
            <li>and i can only say the only thing i dislike about the product itself is it is VERY drying for your hair</li>
            <li>Any lightening treatment has potential to cause damage to your hair, I see it as common sense to take care of it and make sure your hair is taken care of.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend if your looking for an easy, non-dramatic way to make your hair just a little bit lighter!</li>
            <li>My healthy long blonde hair is now brassy and breaking off due to this product and the only thing that will help it is time.</li>
            <li>I was so not ready to spend 2 1/2 hours and $150 at the salon again, so I picked this up after reading the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>My first use I applied only to my roots and did this a total of 3 different times.</li>
            <li>I could not possibly be more excited about the money and time</li>
            <li>so I just use a little less to make it more natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I have dark blonde hair and wanted to lighten it a bit for summer time and being that I am pregnant</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my toned down version, I am actually furious that products like this can still be introduced without adequate testing.</li>
            <li>With that being said: The blow dry, the spray in your face accidents, the sweat, and the extra conditioning treatments/what do I do with this later hassle MIGHT not be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My scalp is pretty sensitive, so I don&#x27;t want to mess around with all of that bleach.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>i have very thin, fragile hair and as long as you read the instructions properly, it&#x27;ll be a great product.</li>
            <li>i have a unique hair coloring because naturally it is dark blonde with platinum and red highlights..</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t count on a little spray bottle all that much, you know?&lt;br /&gt;Using too much bleach obviously would ruin your hair, but you guys know that, you just probably never thought about this as bleach.</li>

            <li>My general assessment is that - yes, this product will lighten your hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a natural blonde, you barely need to use any product to get lightening.</li>
            <li>but i guess i kept my roots light, which usually grow in darker even though im naturally blonde.</li>
            <li>I recently had my hair professionally styled for an event and</li>
            <li>After second use my roots completely blended with the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>The color is so gross and even paid $$$$ to get my hair color corrected at a professional salon.  </li>
            <li>I have natural lighter blonde hair and have been using this product for over a year.</li>
            <li>I was so scared it would turn my dark roots orange at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally a caramel blonde</li>
            <li>One of the ingredients in it is hydrogen peroxide, which doesnt really bring out the blonde, but actually just turns the hair blonde.</li>
            <li>I decided to apply my hair mask early the next morning followed by the leave-in conditioner and opted out of brushing my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have natural medium blonde hair with salon highlights.  </li>
            <li>You are no longer a natural blonde.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dark brown hair, however I do have some caramel highlights.</li>
            <li>I just wanted my natural highlights that the sun gives me, rather than total lightening all over my head.</li>
            <li>And it prevented me from starting to get professional highlights done in the salon.</li>
            <li>I have medium blonde hair naturally and use this about twice a month.</li>
            <li>only concern i have with this product is ive noticed i break out along the sides of my head, near my temple.</li>
            <li>especially how natural looking it turned out.</li>
            <li>It will probably be a solid year from when I stopped using it before it is gone completely.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product to brighten both myself and my daughter&#x27;s  natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li>For about two weeks after coloring it I started using the Go Blonder spray again (along with the tone correcting shampoo) and I am back to a natural looking medium-dark blond again.</li>
            <li>I only treat my hair on day #3 after a shampoo, so I already have some natural oils for protection.</li>
            <li>I use it to brighten my naturally medium blonde hair and add dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is a natural shade of darkish blonde</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is that it does work, and it does work well, you just cannot be in a hurry, you cannot overuse it, you cannot excessively use heat appliances, you cannot expect to get the full results in one use.&lt;br</li>

            <li>The sections of my hair along my part line (the lightest sections that had been most affected by the spray) had ALL broken off to fried, frizzed 3 INCH SECTIONS.</li>
            <li>Seemed to get worse after hair is heated (by sun or hairdryer) but gets more orange gradually.</li>
            <li>Many pieces have broken off and are standing up at my hairline.  </li>
            <li>If you want to do root areas or new growth, use the same technique - try to MIST a broad area at a time and do not totally saturate the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one day I noticed a little fried section of my hair, one of the lightest sections right along my part.</li>
            <li>oh well, you live and learn right!used to blowdrying daily, don&#x27;t use this daily.</li>
            <li>It made the hair very brittle and dry (even with conditioner left on it) and I could never tell a difference in color.</li>
            <li>(my natural hair is very light - dark blond) , with at least 4 weeks break in between.</li>
            <li>just came to Amazon to see all of these other people are having exactly the same problem.</li>
            <li>just came to Amazon to see all of these other people are having exactly the same problem.</li>
            <li>This product also did not dry out my hair!</li>
            <li>but they are definitely noticeable, so don&#x27;t be surprised if you aren&#x27;t pure blonde if you have other tones in your hair.    </li>
            <li>Ive used this product for two&lt;br /&gt;Weeks now and not a SINGLE fried hair</li>
            <li>I now mix it with a deep conditioner and then put a shower cap on, and sit under my hands free hair dryer for like a half hour, rinse out and dry, and I get the same lightening without the dryness!</li>
            <li>This stuff is mainly water &amp; hydrogen peroxide, so it can dry your hair out if it is not used properly!!</li>
            <li>Had to send it back; on-line description did not specify to use only on natural blondes...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used straight 3% peroxide in my hair as a lightening agent in the past with no negative results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always been a platinum blonde, but due to my busy schedule over the past few years i haven&#x27;t been able to spend as much time in the sun as i use to</li>
            <li>Only after one use I could see a major difference.</li>
            <li>With no other changes in my hair care routine, I can only surmise that this product is to blame.</li>
            <li>, I got a little bit of a copper colour when I first started out, but I decided to just keep using it and that went away in no time.</li>
            <li>do blow dry, but I am super careful to NOT hold the hair dryer on any spot too long.</li>
            <li>I personally had bleach blonde hair and my natural grow out is a darker blonde, so I use this only on my roots to try to blend the bleach blonde and my natural color.</li>
            <li>My hair is still very healthy and the streaks look sun-kissed rather than artificial.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally dirty blonde, and these products help keep my color bright, especially throughout the winter.</li>
            <li>I am a natural red head and my hair has progressed from a strawberry blonde to a darker red over the years.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well in a few usages.  </li>
            <li>first few times are ok-then it starts to fray your hair</li>
            <li>, so I guess I would recommend doing a test patch first for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually just wash and go and rarely use a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>This is actual bleach, just in a different application method and a bit weaker than pure extreme bleach that would whiten your hair in no time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just dry from the product if you wash if the next day it will go back to normal .</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re in for a big change and can&#x27;t wait to use it all up to get that blonde look, I&#x27;d recommend seeing a professional at least once, for that first major change.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re in for a big change and can&#x27;t wait to use it all up to get that blonde look, I&#x27;d recommend seeing a professional at least once, for that first major change.</li>
            <li>That amount of lightening should really be done professionally, just so you don&#x27;t end up with fried orange hair (lightening black or dark brown hair would cause redness, unless done professionally and, preferably, gradually)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair usually naturally air dries and the 2 days I blew it dry</li>
            <li>My hair usually naturally air dries and the 2 days I blew it dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fraction of the price of going to the salon, you have complete control over where you apply it, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like</li>
            <li>I do not use heat to dry my hair - it always dries naturally</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t a long time to go through a whole bottle and my hair didn&#x27;t lighten as much as I expected.</li>
            <li>Ok , i don&#x27;t  where alm the negative reviews are coming from, is common sense anything that u use to go blonde is going to damage your hair if u use it too much, im not naturally blonde</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thick and naturally curly (i.e., frizzy) and I have put more on it than a little peroxide spray in the past 20+ years, so this was not anything more damaging than I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>She actually begged me to stop using it, and told me if my roots bothered me that bad, I should get them professionally highlighted at the very most, 2x a year.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty blonde hair with light brown roots and this product help lighten my roots up to a dirty blonde.</li>
            <li>Turned a little brassy, but only in certain lights.</li>
            <li>No flat iron or curling iron for me, but the little bit of heat from the dryer really seems to activate the heck out of this product.    </li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair and was worried about that</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone who wants a little summer sunshine effect for their doo.</li>
            <li>In the summer, the sun really brings them out but my roots get very dark in the winter.</li>
            <li>I had a very dark blonde color, since my hair wasn&#x27;t much exposed to sunlight for the last 2 years..</li>

            <li> This is why I pay good money for a salon...</li>
            <li> After two my friends asked who lightened my hair because they loved it.    </li>
            <li> and I saw good results.</li>
            <li> Remember good ol&#x27; Sun-In?</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years with good results.  </li>
            <li> I also get complements on my color fairly often</li>
            <li> The John Frieda brand name is one that I always trust to make a good product and this product has lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Even when I am rid of it, it will take even longer to grow the layers out to a style I feel good about again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it smells really good.</li>
            <li> However, I did try it and loved it.</li>
            <li> hair is in good condition</li>
            <li> I find that it is best to use it lightly, in moderation, noting the condition of your hair as you go.  </li>
            <li> I use this once every 6-8 months and get good results.</li>
            <li> good combo</li>
            <li> all good, reviews.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I use good conditioner and shampoo and like everything in life use the spray in moderation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came on time which amazon is always good with .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using John Frieda \\&quot;Blonde\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner for a while with fairly good results.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Clairol&#x27;s Touch of Sun (no longer in production) and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I had beautiful healthy hair</li>
            <li> It was so easy to use, I loved the color it gave me, and it saved me tons of money because I didn&#x27;t have to visit the salon!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased with the results I got.   </li>
            <li> Blonder Controlled Lightening Spray as I have heard many great things about his products</li>
            <li> Very satisfying product.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been chemically treated and was very healthy.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Unless you do it in really good sun, like Florida, it kind of looks orangey.    </li>
            <li> I think this is a better alternative to the very popular sun-in spray for your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist always says my hair looks healthy!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> Hopefully, like so many Frieda products, they don&#x27;t discontinue it!</li>
            <li> (Please see my 4 before and after photos at the top!)</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments!</li>

            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Also, using hot tools isn&#x27;t best for your hair, so don&#x27;t do it all too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hope I helped, guysusing hot tools isn&#x27;t best for your hair, so don&#x27;t do it all too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally I love this product!</li>
            <li> I used to have beautiful light brown wavy hair.</li>
            <li> my head that had been sprayed lost ALL off its elasticity (the hair underneath was still healthy FYI)!</li>
            <li> IF YOU LOVE YOUR HAIR!</li>
            <li> It took me ages to grow my healthy shiny hair and now it is a disaster!</li>
            <li> Regardless, just like with any hair product, be sure to test it on a 1&amp;#34; section of hair that you can hide if you don&#x27;t like results before using all over!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> BOY am I EVER glad I did!  </li>
            <li> , so I came home and pulled this baby out of the bag and jumped in the shower (very excited!)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super sunny and bright!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of lightning products &amp; this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It has created amazing, natural-looking highlights.</li>
            <li> The results were amazing.</li>
            <li> The lightening spray is amazing and works just as advertised.</li>
            <li> After growing out my hair for 8 months and having a color process, my hair looked and felt amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing...</li>
            <li> I have a really good head of hair to begin with, healthy and lots of it.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> that has caused this kind damage...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;gradual&amp;#34;, kind of.</li>
            <li> The thing is that bleach works with heat, and that&#x27;s why in hair salons they use aluminum foils on your hair with lightening, because it traps the moisture in and creates warmth (kind of like a sauna for your strands).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it so sparingly as to ruin your own hair.</li>
            <li> kind of wish I just bleached it.</li>
            <li> cheaper way to do your own highlights</li>
            <li> She said that the color was nice, but my hair itself looked liked it had been bleached by someone who fell asleep on the job.  </li>
            <li> But for anyone with warm tones, this will turn your hair orange, so stay away.</li>
            <li> and I have some nice layered sun-looking streaks.</li>
            <li> perfect i highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> spray has a pleasant scent and sprays on as a fine mist.  </li>
            <li> And the best part is how very natural it looks.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply</li>
            <li> stopped mybe 3 months  or more and it still light !!</li>
            <li> excellent way to lighten your hair and have it look natural.</li>
            <li> When I tell them I use Blonder, they laugh and can&#x27;t believe what a great job it does.</li>
            <li> Someone else in that situation is better apt to answer that.</li>
            <li> It may not be fair to review a product after just one use but my hair is too important to me</li>
            <li> To all you girls reading the good reviews or have recently started using this product and think it is works well and is an amazing product...well think again!!</li>
            <li> I have a great colorist that does a super job with the top and sides of my hair.</li>
            <li> This product works great for me, but may not be right for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I love love love it!</li>
            <li> Like others have said, I thought it was a great purchase at first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it because I see a noticeable difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> This product may seem to work great at first</li>
            <li> I am happy that this worked so well and that it is very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> and it works just fine!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t overuse this stuff, and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> It makes it a very light blond shade.</li>
            <li> box has some very important warnings:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> but if you use a purple shampoo once a week with this it takes the orangeness out and reveals beautiful bright blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after 2 uses, I can already see a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I like it better than dying my hair</li>
            <li> One tip though, make sure to spray it throughout your hair not just on top.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> By the time I sprayed all the hairs I wanted, most of the product leaked to the ends of my hair and eventually off my hair.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for more, this product is a lot of work to get the look.</li>
            <li> People have even started asking me where I get my hair done because they love the color.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to do a test patch just like you would most any hair bleaching systems.</li>
            <li> , I now look as if I have a mullet, as I had to have the most severe parts cut out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many reviews saying this product is OK</li>
            <li> LOVE it and</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> so I still have many months ahead of me until this nightmare is over.  </li>
            <li> And as always I am pleased with John Frieda&#x27;s products.eady in it.</li>
            <li> And as always I am pleased with John Frieda&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Spritz on your hair and then style, and enjoy your day!  </li>
            <li> Overall I really loved this product!!!</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I have gotten more compliments on my hair since using this product.</li>
            <li> I love it, I&#x27;m using the shampoo, conditioner and spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> Today 2 days after my 3rd treament, my hair looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way better than going to the saloon every month and spending lots of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand why this product has so many great reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light brunette for those who are wondering!</li>
            <li> Better to use like you would if you were getting highlights</li>
            <li> so you have a more dimensional look.  </li>
            <li> It takes a couple uses to see a difference which I love because it isn&#x27;t drastic.</li>
            <li> I have ordered from Amazon many many times but never felt a need to leave a review until this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for that extra oomph to prepare for summer.</li>
            <li> It did work well on my sons hair though:)</li>
            <li> I had a cellophane and lanse-sa treatment to try to mitigate these effects and began using more hair masks.     </li>
            <li> If anyone would like a better comparison between this and</li>
            <li> the instructions say, \\&quot;the more heat you use, the greater the lightening effects.  </li>
            <li> At times I even have to wear &#x27;top piece wigs&#x27; to disguise the mohawk part/extreme breakage.  </li>
            <li> SO glad I didn&#x27;t put it in my hair, it would have wrecked it for no result.</li>
            <li> If I do, I will to the top of my hair, never the ends.</li>
            <li> This product fried my hair and it literally all broke off the top of my head.</li>
            <li> My best friend, mother, and co-worker all had the same issues!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Product out there that doesn&#x27;t MAGICALLY kill your hair.</li>
            <li> At this moment, I decided it&#x27;s best to only use this product MAYBE once a week if applied to healthy hair and all styling tools are avoided for 48 hrs.  </li>
            <li> , I can say that I&#x27;m satisfied with the color of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this product better than Sun-In, because it can be used on color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I spray it all over my hair after getting out of the shower, or if I&#x27;m touching up my roots, I just spray that area to avoid making the ends even lighter.</li>
            <li> Helps give my roots more color.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping with some toner it will look better.</li>
            <li> why go to the salon and have to pay more when you can pick and choose where and when you want them all from your home</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love how my hair color looked when it was lighter; however, not at the expense of frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I love john frieda products and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is more harmful than just going to the salon and bleaching your hair.</li>
            <li> With a clarifying shampoo and this stuff I was able to get out the purple/grey color.</li>
            <li> The spray works okay to brighten bleached hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I see more results just by going out in the sun for 1 day without having used any products.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair to be healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Any more times after that makes your hair more your hair will be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I havent been able to spend time in the sun this summer</li>
            <li> I am so incredibly glad i did.</li>
            <li> Many people have noticed and complimented on it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> An improvement sure, but I needed highlights to punch the hair up a couple of notches.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the change.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you could you</li>
            <li> but if you just want to keep up with your roots every couple of showers or so a good spritz will keep your winter roots looking summer fresh.</li>
            <li> Her hair is still healthy.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> its going to continue to get lighter and more orange.</li>
            <li> You want it to be distributed evenly through your hair and you do not want any blotches or any areas that are too saturated with it because that&#x27;s how you end up with more damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heat speeds up the process, but will also cause more damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The more exposure to heat, the more damage and guaranteed breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair dryer &#x3D; damage, but straightening iron &#x3D; EVEN MORE damage and breakage.</li>
            <li> Hair dryer &#x3D; damage, but straightening iron &#x3D; EVEN MORE damage and breakage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these more than twice in a week, nor do I use them more than 3 times a month.  </li>
            <li> Much better than sun in which had an orange tinge.</li>
            <li> For me , it is just a better alternative for bleaching or dying your hair.</li>
            <li> The reason I give it four stars is because i think it would be even a better product if it didn&#x27;t need heat.</li>
            <li> If you love your hair, do NOT, under any circumstances, buy this.</li>
            <li> At first, I was thrilled!</li>
            <li> After reading the horror stories of many fellow reviewers</li>
            <li> hesitate to recommend this product as there are many reports of hair breakage.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the accompanying</li>
            <li> I have used this on top of dying and have had no</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, love this product, smells better than putting vinegar in my hair at home to lighten, and am def buying again.</li>
            <li> I have been using John Frieda&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner for years and love them</li>
            <li> Many people also complain that it changed the texture of their hair and some</li>
            <li> Do not use more than once in between washing.</li>
            <li> Interesting to see what they added and why...    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I eventually had to cut off 5 inches of hair in order to prevent any more damage.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> After four uses, my hair is blonder in some sections but mostly just brassy and orange throughout.  </li>
            <li> This product is the best in lightning hair.&lt;br /&gt;Exclusive for blonde and medium color hair....</li>
            <li> Really, i love it.</li>
            <li> I ended up with blonde hair and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Soooo much better than using bleach</li>
            <li> , I recommend this to anyone trying to light up their hair!</li>
            <li> Then I let my hair grow out more.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better to use this product and apply heat before you shower</li>
            <li> I intend to order more of this product as the results are fantstic.</li>
            <li> But I saw this product and since I love their shampoo and cream rinse</li>
            <li> and they start to blend in better.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I personally find that three uses is the perfect amount for me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s back to perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> if used in moderation, not used with the highest heat settings and/or used for the appropriate reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this product once and did not like what it did to the texture and quality of my hair as it seemed more brittle and prone to breakage.  </li>
            <li> Most of my coworkers thought I got my hair touched up.</li>
            <li> Like it, can&#x27;t say I love it.  </li>
            <li> The product also says it should be used with heated tools like a blow dryer, curling iron or flat iron for the greatest lightening effects.</li>
            <li> I end up with great color, healthy hair, and just a tiiiiny bit more body than I would have had naturally, which is a plus for me!</li>
            <li> Even after the first use I could see a difference in how shiny and bright my hair was.</li>
            <li> Color is beautiful, and everybody thinks it&#x27;s just my natural hair color.</li>
            <li> Please, if you want to keep your long healthy hair, STAY AWAY from this product!!!!</li>
            <li> daughter use this product  for long time and is very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I first started it</li>
            <li> Its good because you can do it in a series of applications to get the exact color you want.  </li>
            <li> Loved it at first.</li>
            <li> For natural blondes, who tend to have finer and slicker hair texture, this is usually kind of good thing because you get more body after treating your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told that these kind of products on this site can sometimes come tampered with (idk how true that is)</li>
            <li> A blow dry works best, although my straightener helps too.  </li>
            <li> My hair was in lovely condition, was treated very well with good quality shampoos, conditioners and non-rinse out cobditioners.&lt;br /&gt;Without</li>
            <li> Now my hair looks the perfect light summer blonde!  </li>
            <li> A nice product mainly for warm sunny days.</li>
            <li> I can now go months between salon appointments for my ideal shade of blonde.</li>
            <li> gave me great color lift, natural looking.</li>
            <li> If it is blonde you seek, while avoiding truely dying your hair, this $10 solution is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Enjoy :-)  </li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t experienced any damage from using this spray, but I went on YouTube and saw some of the reviews there.  </li>
            <li> This was also why my naturally curly hair had become board straight in the areas of greatest use (this freaked me out the most).  </li>
            <li> but it stayed healthy and smooth after 3 applications.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my hair becoming lighter.  </li>
            <li> That is the most important part.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t, just all around nice golden streaks that even my co-workers asked if i had my hair done.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast highlights</li>
            <li> I bought this spray to attempt to keep the roots lightened before a salon visit, and mom was right!!</li>
            <li> I just tone my hair by mixing blue food dye in my shampoo and conditioner, and everything is all good again!</li>
            <li> I would never apply this more than 2 or 3 times to any fresh grow out or onto bleached hair!</li>
            <li> a lot so got to condition more and with a really rich conditioner.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lightens my hair subtley.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to saturate my hair with it,</li>
            <li> o tends to break easily.</li>
            <li> The product can be drying, but is easily corrected with weekly conditioning treatments.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to spray the product</li>
            <li> I especially love it because it&#x27;s so easy to keep up with my &amp;#34;roots&amp;#34; and such an easy, quick, cheap fix.</li>
            <li> The reason it says &amp;#34;controlled lightening&amp;#34; is because it&#x27;s not as strong as a salon.</li>
            <li> It works with hydrogen peroxide and doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell...</li>
            <li> If you are considering this product, I would strongly (STRONGLY) urge you to consider splurging at a salon.</li>
            <li> I find that this is not as strong as Sun-In.  </li>
            <li> I love my hair right now!</li>
            <li> This product goes on easily and smells fine.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my beautiful, virgin blonde hair....</li>
            <li> I liked this product the first couple times I used it</li>
            <li> So excited that I have an inexpensive and super easy way to control  my roots and color!  </li>
            <li> Would you throw bleach on your hair every day and expect it to be fine?</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is not processed at all.  </li>
            <li> Sun in has quick results and its like 8 ounces for 4 bucks) anyways !</li>
            <li> Huge chunk of it, GONE.</li>
            <li> I think they should stop selling this product all together and do everybody a HUGE favor .</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t highlight the tips like it suggested because my hair is already so light on the ends.</li>
            <li> But overall, this is great for blondes looking to go blonder.</li>
            <li> it made my hair very crunchy and kind of oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this product did lighten my hair and bring out the blonde, it can also greatly damage your hair.</li>
            <li> After a few uses it seems wonderful, but just wait!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is still a ton of product left in the bottle, so I&#x27;m really happy with the bang for my buck.  </li>
            <li> Works great for lightening hair that is already naturally blonde.</li>
            <li> After spending many hours and money in some of the top Hair Salons in Beverly Hills spending over $300 per visit, I have finally found a product to lightly lighten my roots on my own.</li>
            <li> so i figured to get my summer light hair</li>
            <li> , in order to minimize damage, is I spray LIGHTLY, so that it is just misting my hair.</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair and this spray does highlight it.</li>
            <li> The color was great; I even succeeded in fooling multiple hairdressers into believing that it was all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, this spray will lighten your hair and it looks great - initially.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead of using it on my scalp hair, as I know the product is designed for, I decided  to use it to lighten my arm hair instead (which is a light blondish brown</li>
            <li> i give it a three because it did get my roots and hair incredibly light.</li>
            <li> I bought it when I had light brown dyed hair</li>
            <li> My hair turned light mocha brown.</li>
            <li> Once I had more fresh growout</li>
            <li> After treating my hair, I also then lightly coat it with a heat styling protectant.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really a light brown.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product if you like me and truly are a non bottled blonde, it works great with moderation</li>
            <li> far all is good.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve switched to lemon juice &amp; chamomile to lighten my hair - it&#x27;s nicely non-toxic and smells nice, but definitely doesn&#x27;t work as quickly/evenly as the Frieda spray.</li>
            <li> Thanks John Frieda!!!</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use and can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li> their website it says you can use it as many times as needed to get the shade you want, but it has been my experience with these kinds of highlighters that if you do more than one to two applications a week and more than 3 to 4 a month it&#x27;s going to damage your hair, even using lots of deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after just one use and significant results after 3 uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was excited to try a product that would gradually lighten my hair to my desired lightness</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was excited that it might let me go longer between colorings.  </li>
            <li> My hair has become significantly lighter.</li>
            <li> I generally like John Frieda products and have had good results with them.</li>
            <li> FIRST, I am a woman, I&#x27;m just using my husband&#x27;s account to write this review :) -ha.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IF you have roots and no hair appointment that afternoon-it&#x27;s worth it of course!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve researched it more thoroughly since, it seems like this stuff completely dries out hair and skin and isn&#x27;t really safe.</li>
            <li> I love being able to control exactly how much I use to lighten my hair.</li>
            <li> This is Sun-in for the modern age, although it still has many of the problems of the original.  </li>
            <li> Here is the second: La Bella Lightening Gel (same effect&#x27;s, better control, better smell, better color, better consitincy, better direction&#x27;s, no heat, no</li>
            <li> Now aware of how to treat this spray and prepared for the pampering that is needed after application, I am happy with the overall results.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally bright, blonde hair, but sometimes in the winter, it darkens up a bit.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so I really like this spray, but it can be damaging.</li>
            <li> Well Its been 2 months since my last salon session and before making an appointment I decided to give this a shot, after about a good 4 uses</li>
            <li> I suppose i really should have known better..</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not too sure that it really brightens your hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, sincerely I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice, natural looking color.</li>
            <li> also with either treatment, definitely invest in a good protein based moisturizing conditioner like agadir moisture masque and this will help prevent some breakage.</li>
            <li> It should absolutely be taken off of the shelves for the damage it causes to healthy hair.</li>
            <li> This is a more modern version of Sun-In.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really my all time favorite</li>
            <li> Also tends to lighten even my real blond hair to a more orangeish shade...  </li>
            <li> I think my hair looks good and yes, very blonde.  </li>
            <li> this is going to save me, to say nothing of the access to instantly gorgeous blonde hair whenever I feel like a touch up!  </li>
            <li> The product packaging recommends about 10 uses to get the full impact.</li>
            <li> Full stop.</li>
            <li> This is not as good as the product I mentioned above</li>
            <li> :) highly reccommended!</li>
            <li> Even with dry hair, the best straightener couldn&#x27;t completely mask it.  </li>
            <li> Certainly got blonder, but never quite as much as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> once beautiful hair is now a mess.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 weeks straight in Mexico last month and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li> My hair was already blonde but more strawberry, I just spritzed it on my top layer of hair and styled 4 or 5 times</li>
            <li> Take some days off, use deep conditioner to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today 2 days after my 3rd treament, my hair looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> I began using this sporadically over the summer, and I loved how light my hair got from minimal use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the most expensive conditioners and leave-in products and doing the best I can to help it recover.</li>
            <li> Peroxide is the main ingredient in this formula, along with some more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; lightening ingredients.</li>
            <li> if it doesn&#x27;t work THAT quickly for you )</li>
            <li> If you need an immediate and quick change then buy dye</li>
            <li> ) Use a mild clarifying shampoo to remove waxy buildup.</li>
            <li> : 5) I have tried a bunch of moisturizing haircare lines, and for me, the best have been the Neutrogena Triple Moisture Shampoo and Daily Deep Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the conditioner immediately, but over the next 2-3 weeks I noticed more and more of my ends breaking and splitting UP my hair shaft, we&#x27;re talking</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am quite happy with the money I&#x27;ve saved using a box color (not too far from my natural) along with this product to get the color I like.</li>
            <li> visited salon after using this product and luckily for me my stylist realised i had been using something that was lifting my roots...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> rather my hair is becoming more golden light blonde.</li>
            <li> Blends nicely and provides just the right about of natural blond highlighting.</li>
            <li> I spritzed it pretty lightly all around my hair, and some of the spray must&#x27;ve landed on my ears.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t just read the good reviews when considering a product filled with peroxide and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I wanted to do...which was to lighten my hair in a cheap efficient way.</li>
            <li> I noticed a change after the very first use &amp; my hair has continued to get lighter with each use.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I first used this in October when my friend who has light brown hair told me she used it for highlights.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure if I sprayed a good amount on the top of my hair it would smell even worse.  </li>
            <li> Every few months, I treat my regrowth three times and end up bringing my light caramel-y tresses up to a perfect light honey blonde.</li>
            <li> Has nice smell too and does not dry my hair.</li>
            <li> :) It looks SO natural!</li>
            <li> After the first use of this product, I can already see the difference!</li>
            <li> This stuff helped so much!!</li>
            <li> Hair care 101 people: you shouldn&#x27;t use more than one lightning product at a time unless you are a professional!</li>
            <li> This worked pretty well!</li>
            <li> Not so great a lightener as it rapidly ruins hair!  </li>
            <li> to ensure the product would have a clean, consistent application on freshly washed hair.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for golden tones, yea this will do it.</li>
            <li> I rarely wore my hair up because of that before.</li>
            <li> It is SO effective, I had to stop using it because my hair was getting REALLY blonde, and not looking for a platinum effect.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t believe that John Frieda has stooped this low and produced a product like this.  </li>
            <li> Know how the sun turns your hair golden</li>
            <li> Know how the sun turns your hair golden</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I honestly don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve used it a third time - my hair is noticeably lighter.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lightening spray by far.</li>
            <li> Do not use it frequently and be sure not to spray the roots.  </li>
            <li> reason I got this is because I find it works really nicely on the darker hair that I have next to my neck-</li>
            <li> I like a more natural look</li>
            <li> Overall nice hair care product.</li>
            <li> I rarely blow-dry my hair (</li>
            <li> This product promises visible results in 3-5 uses, and since it is also a Frieda product, worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 uses</li>
            <li> A gorgeous blonde color, looks totally natural - and this smells good enough to use it any day after any shower, instead of having to take a shower after I spray it on!  </li>
            <li> I think you just have to know your hair, don&#x27;t expect to go all the way from brown to blonde without any damage, and be nice to your hair in the process.</li>
            <li> I realize having good hair isn&#x27;t everything, but for someone who has had healthy, natural, long hair her whole life, this is so upsetting for me.</li>
            <li> I have a long way to go and probably will not be able to use color of any kind on my hair until the areas I used the Go Blonder spray have completely grown</li>
            <li> I have a long way to go and probably will not be able to use color of any kind on my hair until the areas I used the Go Blonder spray have completely grown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have more fun with a FULL head of hair than with blonde hair and hair breakage.</li>
            <li> It was right before my wedding</li>
            <li> I offered to brush it out, and as I did, my hair just began to break right off.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t overdo it either, it gave me just the right amount of lightener I desired.</li>
            <li> If you are using this product DO NOT use it often, or discontinue use right away.  </li>
            <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li> so much cheaper and more natural than going to the salon!!  </li>
            <li> In which is very similar, and that seems to leave my hair in better condition, but doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as this does.</li>
            <li> I eventually noticed that the lightening spray lightened my natural highlights and brought up the color of my hair, so it looked very natural and really nice.</li>
            <li> It adds some nice, natural-looking brightness for people like me who are not interested in &amp;#34;going for it&amp;#34; and getting full salon highlights.</li>
            <li> I STRONGLY advise anyone against this spray..spend the money and see a professional stylist, Lightening should not be done at home</li>
            <li> Which makes me feel better because I was worried I had some sort of vitamin deficiency, but it also makes me feel worse because before I used this product all of the Amazon reviews were good.</li>
            <li> Which makes me feel better because I was worried I had some sort of vitamin deficiency, but it also makes me feel worse because before I used this product all of the Amazon reviews were good.</li>
            <li> I use it on the rare occasion when I heat-style my hair, but mostly when I will be outside in the sun during the day.</li>
            <li> Pretty much if your hair is naturally a cool tone brunette, it should work.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what was going on, and for a long time, I was in denial that it had anything to do with my beloved John Frieda spray -- it had worked wonderfully for such a long time, so why would it suddenly start damaging my hair?</li>
            <li> but i only used on my tips for the look , just once a week and nothing else than going outside with the sun at noon lol</li>
            <li> I am naturally a lighter medium blonde with beautiful natural highlights.</li>
            <li> I first bought the spray two years ago, right about when it first came out.</li>
            <li> Using this product with my blow dryer 1 or 2x a week keeps it super light and barely costs anything compared to the salon.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have very much of it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, and I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important to note that most of the people saying their hair started breaking off used this excessively or incorrectly.</li>
            <li> (so it is probably more technically correct to say that I used it strictly by the directions 2 times).     </li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re willing to work for it and be patient, this will work.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair with natural lighter brown highlights.</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> As a blonde, I can confidently say \\&quot;YES!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> When I first heard about this product, I decided to check it out.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t magic or some miracle product -- it&#x27;s peroxide mixed with some fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have not even finished my first bottle</li>
            <li> and then I use a hot iron on my bangs.  </li>
            <li> , she wants her 4-5 x a year $150 from me!  </li>
            <li> , she wants her 4-5 x a year $150 from me!  </li>
            <li> I have tiny hairs sticking straight up on top of my head, from the damage, and I can barely get a brush through my once healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> first noticed the breakage after my first highlight in the salon during the use of this product.</li>
            <li> I have had so many people comment on how blonde my hair has gotten.</li>
            <li> At first I was semi-pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> However, after finishing the first bottle of this product my hair began to snap off at the roots/part leaving 1-2 inch pieces.  </li>
            <li> I use ash blonde color on my hair but sometimes want to brighten it up a bit more.  </li>
            <li> And i really saw results !</li>
            <li> We have been using this a couple of years now since it first came out.</li>
            <li> I had used this for months and was very pleased that it kept my dark roots at bay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another downside of this product is that coloring hair darker will proof challenging later</li>
            <li> And you should probably try test patches to make sure your multiple coloring methods don&#x27;t do things like make your hair fall out!!  </li>
            <li> The bottle says it takes 7- 8 uses to see results, I saw results after the first time.</li>
            <li> I ONLY use it on the roots around the face and visible areas on top of my head - not on the whole head/hair!</li>
            <li> I chose this product prior to reading the many reviews that talk about how it damaged people’s hair.  </li>
            <li> I have light brown hair with too much silver but used to spray and enjoy using Sunin when I was much younger</li>
            <li> My hair is dyed blonde and I was looking for a more summer</li>
            <li> My hair is much lighter and shinier now!</li>
            <li> It brightens exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I noticed results the with the first dose.  </li>
            <li> I then did it again the next day and it got even more lighter.  </li>
            <li> I have medium-to-dark brown hair (not brunette by any means) but was blond when I was younger and miss it:)  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I think that if you don&#x27;t have legit blonde hair, then you are more prone to have some issues.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely can see the results!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using the lightening spray.</li>
            <li> First I used it with my curling iron.</li>
            <li> My local salon uses a hair dye that has fewer chemicals than most</li>
            <li> this just keeps it a better, brighter color than regular sunlight</li>
            <li> I got this product when it first came on the market</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I only used it at the front of my face.&lt;br /&gt;DO</li>
            <li> they ended up refunding my money and then asked me to go back and give them a better review, which of course I did not do.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for several years.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> I started using it last Friday more then</li>
            <li> I suggest Sun-in instead because it does the same thing and smells better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest using this on your entire head more than maybe twice.</li>
            <li> but I was interested in making it a couple of shades lighter.  </li>
            <li> If I do start to see breakage, I will discontinue use at the first sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that 10 is waaaaay too many and likely would lead to damage.</li>
            <li> The next morning before I wash it out, I heat it once more with the hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I used to use (years ago) peroxide with no ill effects, but this spray seems to damage my hair.</li>
            <li> The more heat you use, the better the product works so if you want to lighten quickly, blow dry and straighten with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> oh well, you live and learn right!</li>
            <li> now i have a very pretty light blonde color and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to achieve your desired look the first time you use it, or you will most likely end up with really damaged hair and pretty upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is very light naturally though, and this stuff will make it near white.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am always highlighting and putting more blonde in my hair and my natural color is kind of an ashy blonde</li>
            <li> i cant stress enough how damaging this is to your hair as it leaves it dry, brittle and destroys the pigments in your hair where you use it most!!</li>
            <li> Spray generously the areas to be lightened, or if doing your entire hair, one section at a time, then either using a hair dryer, or flat iron (I had wonderful results with a flat iron) heat up the section and move to the next.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The flat iron does a better job.</li>
            <li> On my next trip to my stylist (who I have been seeing for years and is now a trusted friend who attends family events), he told me that he could sell me a professional coloring and let me pay for it, but that honestly my color looked \\&quot;fabulous\\&quot; and I should just keep doing what I was doing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they were mostly positive.  </li>
            <li> I am thoroughly convinced that anyone writing a positive review for this product has been paid by John Frieda to do so.</li>
            <li> so I could pretty much do a comb over to conceal this catastrophe.</li>
            <li> First, you really have to use heat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with hair lightening products, but since the color of my hair can vary depending upon the season and how much sun it gets, I was interested in using this product to try to maintain the lighter tone.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed any drying out and my hair still grows long and healthy.</li>
            <li> I personally only use one bottle for all over lightening which gives me a nice summer blonde and isn&#x27;t so light I need to use it again on my roots - they lighten up naturally in the spring/summer and you can&#x27;t even tell I used a lightening product!</li>
            <li> Before John Frieda&#x27;s &amp;#34;Sheer Blonde Go Blonder Controlled Lightening Spray,&amp;#34; I had beautifully healthy, lightly treated (highlights) blonde hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is a nice dark to medium blond.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m the kind of person that will spend the extra few bucks at the store, just to play it safe.</li>
            <li> it actually smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It works even better if you blow dry your hair after you use it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you blow dry after spraying it on or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My hair is also more dry when using this product, but that could be associated with using the shampoo and conditioner along with this spray-</li>
            <li> A sun kissed look was achieved, and even with dry hair, I felt more radiant.  </li>
            <li> So after I showered, I parted my hair as I normally style it and spritzed it only on the top layer of my hair,</li>
            <li> We were sure the product didn&#x27;t touch the roots because it can really dry out the hair and didn&#x27;t use it one day after another.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this more than advised on the bottle will lead to excessively dry, brittle hair.</li>
            <li> It was healthy, natural, shiny, barely blow-dried hair.</li>
            <li> So, I started using this every couple of months and the grey hair just looks blond and make nice natural highlights.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review for any consumer product in my life, but I have SUCH strong feelings about this one that I feel it my duty to warn you all.  </li>
            <li> but I would strongly caution users not to double up on these products.  </li>
            <li> , be smart, don&#x27;t kill your hair thinking there&#x27;s a lightening</li>
            <li> I had my friend mask large sections of hair</li>
            <li> It can make your hair brassy if you repeatedly use in combination with conditioners, or certain hair products.  </li>
            <li> my roots also get the shaft because i always wear my hair up and parted a certain way therefore when i am in the sun it doesn&#x27;t get all of the spots i would like.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark ash blonde and it&#x27;s now a bright golden blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I need highlights to make it look dimensional, especially because it&#x27;s so fine.</li>
            <li> I do not consider the shampoo or conditioner to be very high quality or hydrating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, just spray it on and then dry hair with a hot dryer or use a drying iron.</li>
            <li> I will certainly have to highlight my hair professionally again, but hopefully not as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks John Frieda!!!</li>
            <li> Again, in certain lights I feel like its a little on the reddish/brassy side, but in natural light it looks good and blonde.  </li>
            <li> For myself on or near my previously colored hair, I was happy with initial results but experienced damage over time similar to other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Even though I saw my hair get more golden, I think a lot of it was wasted in the process of spraying it into my hair.</li>
            <li> I normally have very healthy hair, but this stuff was incredibly harsh on it.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely zero complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> This really does work.</li>
            <li> BUT it will take a while if you want to really lighten it.</li>
            <li> Literally, I would blow-dry it and my brush (and hands) would be filled with entire clumps of hair.  </li>
            <li> Since the tips of my hair are so much lighter than the roots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 7 months with fantastic results.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It hurts SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the highlighting instruction video was very helpful in how to apply the product.</li>
            <li> If you used it too much it made it have an orange tint to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got light brown hair and have for years lightened it up with various shampoos and citrus products.</li>
            <li> My naturally blonde hair gets extra blonde in the summer as I spend so much time in the sun, this product is great for fall/</li>
            <li> I used to be blonde when I was a kid, but when I grew up my hair turned light brown.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I used it again and my hair has really lightened.</li>
            <li> it worked very well for my hair</li>
            <li> so I absolutely freaked out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using too much ammonia/bleach on my hair, but sometimes I feel like highlighting parts of it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect too much of a difference</li>
            <li> This scared me, as I usually have very healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much bleaching and can cause damage.  </li>
            <li> you use hair products responsibly, they will work for you.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a light mousy brown, and this spray has taken my hair to a medium blonde after about 10 uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through about a whole bottle of this, and I&#x27;m still not 100% on how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really want to have to do that</li>
            <li> Very upset.</li>
            <li> Here was the real reason:</li>
            <li> My hair is blonde but I like it to be really light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hit or miss for brunettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After just three uses of spraying it lightly on my roots and \\&quot;streaking\\&quot; it close to my face, I have shiny blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I remember you always being so much blonder!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After two applications; i could feel my hair was VERY upset with me.</li>
            <li> and she sprayed this on the same areas I wanted blonder using a light spray.</li>
            <li> I put it on my roots in the winter when I don&#x27;t get as much sunlight.</li>
            <li> The product worked really well on her hair.  </li>
            <li> She now has a shade lighter and really likes it.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any change in my hair color.</li>
            <li> He cut as much of the damaged hair as he could off</li>
            <li> you will be able to lighten your hair with minimal damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you will be able to lighten your hair with minimal damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You could end up with some very damaged hair.</li>
            <li> You can control how much and how often of this spray you want to use.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks my hair looked like I had been pouring straight bleach on it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got brown hair or are trying to repeatedly lighten your whole head</li>
            <li> For a solid year, my experience with this product was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I regret using this spray so much.</li>
            <li> Not so much the case with this lightening spray.</li>
            <li> Very stubborn.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re concerned or have very processed or brittle hair, err on the side of caution and just don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to work very well.</li>
            <li> I definitely plan to use again if I decide to go light again.</li>
            <li> I deducted a star because I don&#x27;t really like the smell</li>
            <li> actually not even light brown</li>
            <li> I havnt really seen a difference.</li>
            <li> and it didnt do much,</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on lightly and stayed out in the sun for a short while.</li>
            <li> my whole life I&#x27;ve used Sun-In.  </li>
            <li> Treat your hair gently.</li>
            <li> If you fall into this category, I really think this product probably isn&#x27;t for you</li>
            <li> and i havent had much of a change since i started using this product.</li>
            <li> and I spend too much money on it to risk damage.</li>
            <li> This does lighten hair effectively but it dried my hair out quit a bit and made it brittle.</li>
            <li> I usually use some kind of hot oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally medium brown hair, but I&#x27;ve dyed it almost all shades imaginable over the last four years, so I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how my hair would handle it.</li>
            <li> this along with a blond shampoo that eliminates brassiness helped me achieve a more natural yellow blond.</li>
            <li> One does need to read directions carefully, but I have had fair enough results with this spray.  </li>
            <li> After a month of using it, my hair had become a lovely lighter blonde with natural looking highlights.</li>
            <li> I thought I would read some of the other reviews BEFORE I went too far, and am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li> Found this product and  WOW!!!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> Go to a professional and get it done right.</li>
            <li> I usually use sun-in but after discovering this, it&#x27;s way better!  </li>
            <li> If you use this product more than once a week to once every other week it WILL severely damage your hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sitting in the sun for an hour on a hot summer day did the trick, but my hair most definitely felt different compared to before using this product.  </li>
            <li> :)  Be careful and take your time!</li>
            <li> you are in a hurry to see extreme highlights or lightening, you are better off to buy a highlighting kit, or just dye your hair.</li>
            <li> you are in a hurry to see extreme highlights or lightening, you are better off to buy a highlighting kit, or just dye your hair.</li>
            <li> There were still pieces of the original box stuck to it, but I figured that I would pick those off later.</li>
            <li> (I used a diffuser - did not blow out straight and iron straight as suggested, just used high heat with a diffuser)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blond and this product lightens my hair in such a way that, while my hair is much blonder after ~5-10 applications, it still looks natural :-)</li>
            <li> I have light blond hair not naturally</li>
            <li> I started with 3-4 uses all over my hair when I first got the product, and then once a month near my roots for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I only used it 3 times and got the full effect that I wanted so just pace yourself</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good luck with Suave Naturals Daily Clarifying shampoo; I use it only on my roots (where I had buildup from the Go Blonder Spray) and follow with a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> but it changed the intended lighter color much darker than both my hair and the normal color range for that wash.</li>
            <li> I have used John Frieda shampoo/conditioners in the past and really liked the results.</li>
            <li> I was about to cave and actually get some professional highlights this winter because my color was so beautiful after this past summer and</li>
            <li> I loved it at first but not my hair is dry damaged and there is so much breakage that has left me with short pieces of hair near the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> Go Blonder uses peroxide to lighten, which is nothing new and really</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a GOOD conditioner to counteract all the bad side effects.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a GOOD conditioner to counteract all the bad side effects.</li>
            <li> Using more chemicals on my hair burned half of my hair off (where I used to part my hair).  </li>
            <li> just lightly blow dry on the lowest setting and that is sufficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural light brown/dark blonde</li>
            <li> This has been so challenging to hide all of these short spots because it&#x27;s in multiple places.  </li>
            <li> The main ingredient here is Hydrogen Peroxide, which will severely damage your damage your hair (why do you think the makers of permanent hair color brag about their ammonia-free, peroxide-free products?)</li>
            <li> Yes, it lightens hair, but at a tremendous cost to overall hair health.</li>
            <li> In the summertime it still gets super blonde.</li>
            <li> Luckily for me I only used it along my hair line and along my main part, so</li>
            <li> with just peroxide my hair went to more of a white blonde.</li>
            <li> I must say I love this product, and I still have about 2/3 of the bottle left for future use.</li>
            <li> Now, my medium brown hair will change quickly with this product, especially when I put it on and sit in the sun until it dries.</li>
            <li> I used this more multiple years not realizing what it was actually doing to my hair.</li>
            <li> and naturally it wasn&#x27;t as light of a blonde as I had hoped for</li>
            <li> Many people are stating this product ruined their hair, dried it out and made it very prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> The effects were obvious but nothing over the top because I wasn&#x27;t going for a big difference.</li>
            <li> Luckily it was only on the ends</li>
            <li> I used it all over my hair maybe 4 times initially, then sprayed only at the roots every 2 weeks before blow-drying (for the most part</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually found that the combination of clarifying shampoo and deep conditioner makes my hair softer -- I think removing the buildup allows hair to absorb more of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all mostly ignore warning labels on hair products such as hair dye, such as the \\&quot;do a test patch before use\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> While a good day at the hairdresser can make you feel like a million bucks, the unfortunate opposite is true by using this product for any length of time as it can turn your precious asset into cheap looking dull orange hair.</li>
            <li> and as I started to scrub CHUNKS started to fall into the tub, my long beautiful hair being swept down the drain!!!</li>
            <li> Thus far, I have used a full bottle of the spray and have started on a second one (though I will be going through that one much slower, as I have reached my desired tone).</li>
            <li> I highly advise anyone thinking about using this product to think twice.  </li>
            <li> If you do I would highly suggest putting a cream or leave in conditioner afterwards to avoid damage.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I use high quality shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this wonderful product for a couple years now, only in late winter to get my natural blonde hair to</li>
            <li> My hair has been pretty much the same for my entire life: naturally dark blonde, never color treated or bleached, fine, straight, and healthy.</li>
            <li> I will certainly have to highlight my hair professionally again, but hopefully not as often.    </li>
            <li> and after about four months, while the hair was certainly lightened, it started to clearly show signs of damage.  </li>
            <li> The entire crown of my head felt like I had dipped it in hot grease!</li>
            <li> My sister has very, very coarse hair, while my mom&#x27;s is fine and neither or them have reported too much damage in the last three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though I used it strictly according to directions, I&#x27;ve found that it does help lighten the hair and take some of the brassiness out of my hair, but with one major problem: it caused my hair to become very brittle, even with intense moisturizing and conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> So i bought this product because my naturally dirty blonde hair started to get darker as i got older, becoming more of a light brown.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s paranoia, but a bad color job is on of my greatest fears.  </li>
            <li> It also turned my naturally curly hair board straight in the front.</li>
            <li> very gradual, natural looking lightening.</li>
            <li> As a natural blonde, this lightened my hair while keeping my look natural, which is important to me.  </li>
            <li> First I did the highlights and then the whole head, after ONE use, all of my friends noticed the next day at school</li>
            <li> so I used just a tiny bit of this all over her hair, just to make it fresh and summery.</li>
            <li> I normally just use my hairdryer or no heat at all</li>
            <li> golden blonde hair</li>
            <li> is just now returning to a normal length and strength.</li>
            <li> This product should not be used more then a few times because it will damage.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally golden blonde</li>
            <li> where the sun would normally hit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It all started out normal mixing up the bleach then applying it to my hair</li>
            <li> and I waited my normal amount of time.</li>
            <li> Lightening hair is just not worth the damage, I think I&#x27;ll try to find a more natural way to do it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have a split end normally.</li>
            <li> Do not use more than 10 times in between colorings.&lt;br /&gt;After just a few times of trying it, we both decided to stop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure as with all high lighting products that are store bought, it will dry out and possibly damage your hair over time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;mite be suitable 4hair that is naturally blonde but certainly not</li>
            <li> The new growth of my hair is just as healthy as my hair used to be, and eventually I&#x27;ll be able to trim the last of the broken ends off</li>
            <li> This lightening spray is a quick and easy way to add a little \\&quot;blonde pizzazz\\&quot; to your hair style between visits to a salon.  </li>
            <li> I also only use a hair dryer because a straightening iron or a curling iron will dry it out and damage it even more (even though their instruction video says to do it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, I recommend this product to any natural blonde who wants to go a little lighter and get a nice shimmer.</li>
            <li> I donned a loose top knot that day to avoid further damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took the produt to my hair dressers who informed me that this spray is very damaging to hair, should only be used once or twice at most, and most certainly not with excessive heat applied afterwards, as the instructions say to do.</li>
            <li> As a natural dark blonde it was just lovely for the first 6 months or so of use.  </li>
            <li> and you should only trust your tresses to a trained professional if you want to bring it all the way up to full-on blonde and maintain your hair&#x27;s natural healthy and beauty.</li>
            <li> , I have never actually dyed my hair, and I must say the results that come from this little bottle of spray is just amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural darker blonde and pretty much</li>
            <li> It also colored the little bit of gray I had to a really nice blonde color.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li> This product completely destroyed my healthy long blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> at your own risk if your hair is darker than a dark blonde, NATURALLY.</li>
            <li> And I did reapply this product to not so newly washed hair followed by my hair mask and</li>
            <li> I would also not recommend using it as a root touch up as it can cause breakage to new growth.</li>
            <li> I live in the south, so the sun kissed look is always acceptable for hair.  </li>
            <li> It works very well at first but not intended for long terms use.</li>
            <li> Because of this product when i got my hair coloured at a hairdressers it turned my hair a really light blonde compared to the rest of my hair which is caramel blonde which is the colour it was supposed to turn out like!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product, especially if you naturally have a light brown to golden blonde color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years on my naturally light reddish-brown, used to be strawberry blonde, hair.  </li>
            <li> I avoid the sun now and this product helped me lighten my hair myself and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> You can touch up your roots and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I use it about every 3 weeks or so, just on my roots, and it keeps me with a very natural looking blonde.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very natural looking</li>
            <li> It works wonders on the beach speacially and gives a very natural look, don&#x27;t apply it too close to the root.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to lighten my hair without the high cost of professional highlights.</li>
            <li> It brings my old color right back</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde but as I am getting older, my blonde is starting to go more towards brown.</li>
            <li> When I first bought it I only used it with my straightener and blow dryer</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure different shades of blonde would come out different colors after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 3 uses, my brown roots are completely blond!</li>
            <li> I normally keep my dark ash blonde hair highlighted but haven&#x27;t had time to get to the salon lately so most of my highlights were gone</li>
            <li> It helps if you section your hair first, so you have smaller sections to work with, and you can spray this liberally over each section.</li>
            <li> They were so short they stuck straight up in the air!</li>
            <li> The hydrogen peroxide definitely is what highlights the hair, but there are other protective oils,etc that make this product worthwhile to me.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time and immediately saw a lightening of the darker blonde in my hair.  </li>
            <li> First off, your only suppose to use this once per wash.</li>
            <li> John Frieda came out with a product that does exactly what it claims to do, lighten blonde hair up to 1-1/2 shades.</li>
            <li> If this LITERALLY burned my hands, what would it do to my (sensitive) scalp?!</li>
            <li> I then reduced using the spray to about three times a week, then again as soon as I&#x27;d see the first sign of my roots, so about four weeks later.</li>
            <li> Granted, im already pretty blonde</li>
            <li> so my hair is not lighting naturally like normal.</li>
            <li> ** and give you a pretty result-BUT you will pay for it in one way or another later.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde and this stuff gives me the extra summer blonde glow I love.</li>
            <li> I now am left with huge patches of hair about 3 inches long all over my head.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s relatively gentle; not sure how light it will go.</li>
            <li> and I rarely blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> Ever since graduating college and taking a full time 9-5 job, I&#x27;ve been concerned that I wouldn&#x27;t have enough day hours outside to get my hair to lighten up with</li>
            <li> If I would bleach my hair, I would never really do it everyday and this product is no different from doing exactly that.</li>
            <li> At first, I only wanted to use it to help go longer between professional highlighting.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use anything strong or with harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> This little hair routine was going just fine for a year and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain if this product is somewhat mild because i did condition my hair</li>
            <li> I naturally have dark brunette hair, but I can&#x27;t help love how blonde brightens my face.</li>
            <li> It usually turns more blonde in the summer, but this summer it didn&#x27;t seem to change as much, so</li>
            <li> So while it works, I would hesitate to recommend it to a female blonde who wants to use this on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> Alas, I was able to brush my hair!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural dark blonde and this product lightens my hair to give it more natural looking variation.</li>
            <li> I am now having to do deep conditioning treatments to try to fix this mess that used to be healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in my hair, and I discovered it works even waaaay better when I applied it to my dry hair and laid out in the sun for a few hours while tanning and WOW is all I can say.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair a little more blonde than I like, but</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde, but it&#x27;s kind of dull</li>
            <li> I will use it very sparingly in the future, and hope the company addresses the harshness of the product.</li>
            <li> I use this year round to keep my roots light</li>
            <li> I started to use this stuff as my natural colour can be a bit \\&quot;brassy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would look natural and I could apply myself.  </li>
            <li> and it did not look natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo &amp; conditioner for about a month now and definitely noticed a difference with them, but it wasn&#x27;t until I bought the spray that I really started noticing a substantial change.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to lighten the ends further without using bleach because the bleach really damages my ends and this doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this product with the accompanying shampoo and conditioner for about two weeks, and i can say that it has completely destroyed my hair.</li>
            <li> My naturally soft and shiny hair has literally turned to straw.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking to get bleach blonde hair and this product works well for what I really wanted.</li>
            <li> only reason why I gave this product 4 instead of 5 stars was because I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to really notice that my hair is getting lighter.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying, my NATURAL hair color is medium brown.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blond.</li>
            <li> Now I have to go to a salon and get it fixed.  </li>
            <li> I got a lot of compliments from people asking me if it was my natural hair color.</li>
            <li> This product somehow picks up on natural highlights in hair and makes them glow and shine.</li>
            <li> Directions indicate that it should be used with dyed hair, but I used it on my natural hair and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I do not use heated tools very often, and being in the sun helped me so this may not be overly necessary.    </li>
            <li> The product directions specify to use it with as much heat as possible.</li>
            <li> Now, with this, you don&#x27;t need to use foil or anything, just use direct heat (that&#x27;s also why Sun-In probably didn&#x27;t work for you sometimes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like putting too much bleach on your white clothes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like putting too much bleach on your white clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using this product, as i am looking for something that will bring out my existing natural highlights.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally blond</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li> However, having read through the negative reviews, I will say that I probably have sturdier hair than most --</li>
            <li> I also wouldn&#x27;t use it on roots if you&#x27;re sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have not had any breakage as a direct cause of it.</li>
            <li> My hair was a darker blonde and it&#x27;s lightened up maybe a shade or two, but is very brassy looking.</li>
            <li> yeah, the stuff everyone pays 100.00 for mine is natural..</li>
            <li> If you are getting your hair lightened professionally, it&#x27;s probably being bleached.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recomend this product for natural, un-dyed blondes.</li>
            <li> Well, my fears were confirmed when I saw my grandpa few weeks ago, and he said to me &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li> I have naturally medium-dark ashy brown hair</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s been about a month</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> I completely regret using this product.</li>
            <li> * Do not use on natural brown or darker shades of hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product does have a gross smell to it, I didn&#x27;t use that much of it</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to smell this on my hair constantly, and going out in the summer sun just intensifies that scent.  </li>
            <li> It did provide some lightening, but I&#x27;d rather pay for a professional to lighten my hair.</li>
            <li> There should be a class action lawsuit against John Frieda company.</li>
            <li> Until your hair starts to frizz and break at the roots and grows out completely fried, falling off.</li>
            <li> and it did lighten considerably</li>
            <li> That being said, you do have to use your common sense as it does contain HYDROGEN PEROXIDE, one of the most damaging things to put on your har.</li>
            <li> On darker hair it will uncover the red undertones - this happens to my son, who becomes more of a copper red/dark blonde than a yellow blonde.  </li>
            <li> After the third day, I was amazed with how much lighter my hair was.  </li>
            <li> It gives a natural looking sun kissed look with out the brassy highlights.  </li>
            <li> Instead of redyeing my hair, I just decided to do a soft ombre with the John Frieda lightening spray.</li>
            <li> I think the people who have left unfavorable reviews may be expecting too much from this product and/or overusing it.</li>
            <li> This spray helps me keep it light year round</li>
            <li> and it looks natural without having to spend money on coloring my hair at the salon.</li>
            <li> and so far I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the cost or hassle of professional highlights.  </li>
            <li> and it helps to make my root to regular hair transition much easier.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my coloured hair and my hair is completely ruined....</li>
            <li> On top of my missing hair, the color correction turned my hair ashy and purple in some spots and still is the gross orange/yellow color all over.  </li>
            <li> :  Ok, so a few days have gone by since I did my 3rd treatment...</li>
            <li> Ok, so a few days have gone by since I did my 3rd treatment...</li>
            <li> Now 6 months later I have a line in my (what used to be beautiful long hair) about 4\\&quot; below my roots of completely broken fried hair.</li>
            <li> As a naturally dirty blonde the John Frieda Spray is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t change your roots from dark to super blonde and unnatural.</li>
            <li> , then jump right back in the shower to put on a deep conditioning hair masque.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem smart to flat iron hair that I just put peroxide on.</li>
            <li> (mainly the top layers) without giving me a pixie cut, which left me with extremely short and choppy layers.  </li>
            <li> I am positive that this product is not suitable for everyone, and seems to especially do terrible damage to those with dyed hair, but I have been extremely happy with the results I&#x27;ve received and would recommend it to friends who do not have dyed hair! :)</li>
            <li> As a disclaimer, I have naturally dark golden blonde hair that looks much darker indoors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a year, I started noticing the same weird breakage pattern that many other reviewers have mentioned: a fair amount of hair was breaking off into dry, frizzy,</li>
            <li> One pointer I would like to share to make the product go further is to spray SB/GB on your roots mainly and then rub product throughout your hair and follow with combing it through your hair for even distribution.</li>
            <li> Additionally-this usually retails for only about $10 at most stores</li>
            <li> Difficult to just get the roots this way, because it tends to brighten highlights more quickly than darker blonde.</li>
            <li> I do this in a well-ventilated room, as the blow drying in particular creates some gross peroxide fumes.</li>
            <li> you are trying to keep your naturally dark hair a light blonde, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> Overall my hair is probably 1/4-1/2 shade lighter (a little more on the ends where some highlighting was left), and so far, no brassiness.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark brown with a tint of redish brown, and this stuff really brings out the amber color in my hair!!</li>
            <li> so I would not know how it would affect hair that doesn&#x27;t regularly use high end salon brand shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> It damages your hair so badly, that over period of time, that area you sprayed gets weaker and more and more fragile.</li>
            <li> The color, however, was much brighter and even shiny - strange considering the lack of moisture in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Using this for two weeks along with their shampoo and conditioner and my normal blond locks are back.</li>
            <li> On the box, it recommends using hot tools after blowdrying, such as a flat iron or curling iron, to intensify the effects.</li>
            <li> Use it only a few times per month to ensure you keep your hair healthy and also so my hair wouldn&#x27;t become bleach blonde.</li>
            <li> It worked very well, better than the old Sun-In product of my youth!&lt;br /&gt;However the stern warnings on the box troubled me:  </li>
            <li> just right, after reading previous reviews of this product I completely changed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think it worked, took out most of the blonde I worked so hard to get, but something had to be done</li>
            <li> and I think it worked, took out most of the blonde I worked so hard to get, but something had to be done</li>
            <li> I got out and looked at my head and noticed that my hard literally MELTED off where I had applied that stuff (mostly on my part line) and what was left of the hair</li>
            <li> I  could see how if you kept using it over and over it would probably damage your hair because your hair does feel a little dry after you use it and blow dry/flat iron it, but I think that if you use it in moderation you will have no problems and love the natural color it adds to blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Since writing my review, I&#x27;ve read several new reviews about people literally losing their hair from using this product.</li>
            <li> I would kill for dark roots right about now compared to what I&#x27;ve ended up with.</li>
            <li> BUT, will say, whatever is in this, sprayed on and blow dried, this product produces amazing results, in just a few applications.</li>
            <li> and i can only say the only thing i dislike about the product itself is it is VERY drying for your hair</li>
            <li> Any lightening treatment has potential to cause damage to your hair, I see it as common sense to take care of it and make sure your hair is taken care of.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend if your looking for an easy, non-dramatic way to make your hair just a little bit lighter!</li>
            <li> My healthy long blonde hair is now brassy and breaking off due to this product and the only thing that will help it is time.</li>
            <li> I was so not ready to spend 2 1/2 hours and $150 at the salon again, so I picked this up after reading the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> My first use I applied only to my roots and did this a total of 3 different times.</li>
            <li> I could not possibly be more excited about the money and time</li>
            <li> so I just use a little less to make it more natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I have dark blonde hair and wanted to lighten it a bit for summer time and being that I am pregnant</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my toned down version, I am actually furious that products like this can still be introduced without adequate testing.</li>
            <li> With that being said: The blow dry, the spray in your face accidents, the sweat, and the extra conditioning treatments/what do I do with this later hassle MIGHT not be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My scalp is pretty sensitive, so I don&#x27;t want to mess around with all of that bleach.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> i have very thin, fragile hair and as long as you read the instructions properly, it&#x27;ll be a great product.</li>
            <li> i have a unique hair coloring because naturally it is dark blonde with platinum and red highlights..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t count on a little spray bottle all that much, you know?&lt;br /&gt;Using too much bleach obviously would ruin your hair, but you guys know that, you just probably never thought about this as bleach.</li>

            <li> My general assessment is that - yes, this product will lighten your hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a natural blonde, you barely need to use any product to get lightening.</li>
            <li> but i guess i kept my roots light, which usually grow in darker even though im naturally blonde.</li>
            <li> I recently had my hair professionally styled for an event and</li>
            <li> After second use my roots completely blended with the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> The color is so gross and even paid $$$$ to get my hair color corrected at a professional salon.  </li>
            <li> I have natural lighter blonde hair and have been using this product for over a year.</li>
            <li> I was so scared it would turn my dark roots orange at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally a caramel blonde</li>
            <li> One of the ingredients in it is hydrogen peroxide, which doesnt really bring out the blonde, but actually just turns the hair blonde.</li>
            <li> I decided to apply my hair mask early the next morning followed by the leave-in conditioner and opted out of brushing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have natural medium blonde hair with salon highlights.  </li>
            <li> You are no longer a natural blonde.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dark brown hair, however I do have some caramel highlights.</li>
            <li> I just wanted my natural highlights that the sun gives me, rather than total lightening all over my head.</li>
            <li> And it prevented me from starting to get professional highlights done in the salon.</li>
            <li> I have medium blonde hair naturally and use this about twice a month.</li>
            <li> only concern i have with this product is ive noticed i break out along the sides of my head, near my temple.</li>
            <li> especially how natural looking it turned out.</li>
            <li> It will probably be a solid year from when I stopped using it before it is gone completely.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product to brighten both myself and my daughter&#x27;s  natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li> For about two weeks after coloring it I started using the Go Blonder spray again (along with the tone correcting shampoo) and I am back to a natural looking medium-dark blond again.</li>
            <li> I only treat my hair on day #3 after a shampoo, so I already have some natural oils for protection.</li>
            <li> I use it to brighten my naturally medium blonde hair and add dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is a natural shade of darkish blonde</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is that it does work, and it does work well, you just cannot be in a hurry, you cannot overuse it, you cannot excessively use heat appliances, you cannot expect to get the full results in one use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is that it does work, and it does work well, you just cannot be in a hurry, you cannot overuse it, you cannot excessively use heat appliances, you cannot expect to get the full results in one use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sections of my hair along my part line (the lightest sections that had been most affected by the spray) had ALL broken off to fried, frizzed 3 INCH SECTIONS.</li>
            <li> Seemed to get worse after hair is heated (by sun or hairdryer) but gets more orange gradually.</li>
            <li> Many pieces have broken off and are standing up at my hairline.  </li>
            <li> If you want to do root areas or new growth, use the same technique - try to MIST a broad area at a time and do not totally saturate the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one day I noticed a little fried section of my hair, one of the lightest sections right along my part.</li>
            <li> oh well, you live and learn right!used to blowdrying daily, don&#x27;t use this daily.</li>
            <li> It made the hair very brittle and dry (even with conditioner left on it) and I could never tell a difference in color.</li>
            <li> (my natural hair is very light - dark blond) , with at least 4 weeks break in between.</li>
            <li> just came to Amazon to see all of these other people are having exactly the same problem.</li>
            <li> just came to Amazon to see all of these other people are having exactly the same problem.</li>
            <li> This product also did not dry out my hair!</li>
            <li> but they are definitely noticeable, so don&#x27;t be surprised if you aren&#x27;t pure blonde if you have other tones in your hair.    </li>
            <li> Ive used this product for two&lt;br /&gt;Weeks now and not a SINGLE fried hair</li>
            <li> I now mix it with a deep conditioner and then put a shower cap on, and sit under my hands free hair dryer for like a half hour, rinse out and dry, and I get the same lightening without the dryness!</li>
            <li> This stuff is mainly water &amp; hydrogen peroxide, so it can dry your hair out if it is not used properly!!</li>
            <li> Had to send it back; on-line description did not specify to use only on natural blondes...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used straight 3% peroxide in my hair as a lightening agent in the past with no negative results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always been a platinum blonde, but due to my busy schedule over the past few years i haven&#x27;t been able to spend as much time in the sun as i use to</li>
            <li> Only after one use I could see a major difference.</li>
            <li> With no other changes in my hair care routine, I can only surmise that this product is to blame.</li>
            <li> , I got a little bit of a copper colour when I first started out, but I decided to just keep using it and that went away in no time.</li>
            <li> do blow dry, but I am super careful to NOT hold the hair dryer on any spot too long.</li>
            <li> I personally had bleach blonde hair and my natural grow out is a darker blonde, so I use this only on my roots to try to blend the bleach blonde and my natural color.</li>
            <li> My hair is still very healthy and the streaks look sun-kissed rather than artificial.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally dirty blonde, and these products help keep my color bright, especially throughout the winter.</li>
            <li> I am a natural red head and my hair has progressed from a strawberry blonde to a darker red over the years.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well in a few usages.  </li>
            <li> first few times are ok-then it starts to fray your hair</li>
            <li> , so I guess I would recommend doing a test patch first for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually just wash and go and rarely use a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> This is actual bleach, just in a different application method and a bit weaker than pure extreme bleach that would whiten your hair in no time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just dry from the product if you wash if the next day it will go back to normal .</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re in for a big change and can&#x27;t wait to use it all up to get that blonde look, I&#x27;d recommend seeing a professional at least once, for that first major change.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re in for a big change and can&#x27;t wait to use it all up to get that blonde look, I&#x27;d recommend seeing a professional at least once, for that first major change.</li>
            <li> That amount of lightening should really be done professionally, just so you don&#x27;t end up with fried orange hair (lightening black or dark brown hair would cause redness, unless done professionally and, preferably, gradually)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair usually naturally air dries and the 2 days I blew it dry</li>
            <li> My hair usually naturally air dries and the 2 days I blew it dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fraction of the price of going to the salon, you have complete control over where you apply it, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like</li>
            <li> I do not use heat to dry my hair - it always dries naturally</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t a long time to go through a whole bottle and my hair didn&#x27;t lighten as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> Ok , i don&#x27;t  where alm the negative reviews are coming from, is common sense anything that u use to go blonde is going to damage your hair if u use it too much, im not naturally blonde</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick and naturally curly (i.e., frizzy) and I have put more on it than a little peroxide spray in the past 20+ years, so this was not anything more damaging than I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> She actually begged me to stop using it, and told me if my roots bothered me that bad, I should get them professionally highlighted at the very most, 2x a year.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty blonde hair with light brown roots and this product help lighten my roots up to a dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> Turned a little brassy, but only in certain lights.</li>
            <li> No flat iron or curling iron for me, but the little bit of heat from the dryer really seems to activate the heck out of this product.    </li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and was worried about that</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone who wants a little summer sunshine effect for their doo.</li>
            <li> In the summer, the sun really brings them out but my roots get very dark in the winter.</li>
            <li> I had a very dark blonde color, since my hair wasn&#x27;t much exposed to sunlight for the last 2 years..</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll still have to bleach now and again, but this probably cuts that down to a third of what you&#x27;d normally do.</li>
            <li> When I read the label, I realized that it&#x27;s basically the same thing as Sun-In, which has been around forever (and costs a whole lot less!).  </li>
            <li> I used it every few days and my dark blonde hair quickly became lighter and brighter.  </li>
            <li> In the beginning, It did lighten my hair, but was similar to, but a little more subtle than &#x27;sun in&#x27;s&#x27; orangish tone.  </li>
            <li> If you spray it on dry hair and then straighten or blow dry, don&#x27;t be surprised when your hair falls out - no joke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was a mistake due to lack of natural oils as protection.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers have said that it dries up there hair, but I thought it kept my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> If possible, just let the sun do the job rather than a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The second time I tried it with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> (I put the oil down first to protect my hair because it&#x27;s pretty thin).</li>
            <li> Plus, for people with thick long hair, this small bottle lasts AT MOST 3 times, and for me, the third use was pretty small</li>
            <li> It has lightened my dark blonde/light brown hair to a blonde shade that looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have natural medium to dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Now that her hair is actually lighter, she&#x27;s not sure she likes it as much as she thought she would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am natural dark blonde and hoped that this product will help me to lighten my hair without having to go to the salon too often.</li>
            <li> You may have been a blonde child, and you&#x27;ve been coloring you hair for so long that you don&#x27;t realize you aren&#x27;t a blonde anymore, but face reality.</li>
            <li> have naturally dirty blonde hair, with natural light blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> feel like a lot of the negative reviews reporting brassiness and breakage might come from people who say or perhaps really think that they are a natural blonde, or were one when they were a bit younger, but their blonde is so dark</li>
            <li> I would caution against this, as repeatedly doing this left my hair so dry, it broke off just above my ear in a one inch section.</li>
            <li> I spray/soak my hair thoroughly with the lightener, air dry for a few minutes, gently blow dry, and wash it gently and deep-condition after a few hours.</li>
            <li> It creates such natural highlights that blend in with my hair color, its hard to tell if its natural or highlighted.</li>
            <li> Just know that eventually, your hair will feel like straw or sandpaper, and will probably end up badly damaged (and if your hair is darker to begin with, don&#x27;t be surprised if your hair is more orange than blonde!)</li>
            <li> Do not use on natural brown or dark shades of hair.</li>
            <li> The problem is is that the product actually contains Hydrogen Peroxide, and is not natural at all.</li>
            <li> I do one to two applications a month on myself to keep my blonde looking blonde, especially in the winter when there is minimal sun.</li>
            <li> Yes it works well at the beginning but the long term side effects are horrendous, especially if you are planning on colouring over it!</li>
            <li> but it works so well that one bottle should last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> In terms of use, I sprayed it after towel drying my hair and followed by blow drying and straightening my hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> the bottle doesn&#x27;t last too long, but I could buy nine of these (from Wal-mart) for one salon visit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you are not a natural blonde as it lightens quite well.</li>
            <li> Cut off some of my hair since I was going from long to short hair.</li>
            <li> and I recently used an ash blond toner and my hair turned grey.</li>
            <li> I visit my stylist numerous times a year to color my grey hair and add in blond highlights.  </li>
            <li> You might want to lower temperature of your flat iron or use it not too often.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and dark blonde with natural highlights that I get from the sun every summer.  </li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re done blow drying and flat ironing it in</li>
            <li> I spray it pretty heavily, concentrating on the roots and don&#x27;t have any issues with breakage or smell like some other products.</li>
            <li> All I do is blow dry (no flat irons--</li>
            <li> Do not totally soak your hair with it and then excessively blow dry or straight iron</li>
            <li> After a good 3 months of that, my hair has simply broken off where the product was used (which if you&#x27;re like me, you spray it on your roots so this breakage is less than 1&amp;#34; away from your scalp, not cute).  </li>
            <li> just dont go crazy using it :), not 5 stars only because i think the bottle is too small haha</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very thick and \\&quot;takes abuse well\\&quot;, according to my hair dresser who rarely finds damage from me blow drying or straightening my hair on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> If it were in a creme or gel format, I wouldn&#x27;t mind; but having to spray hair sections individually, brush through to evenly spread everything, and then blow dry the hair</li>
            <li> That being said, I only use a hair dryer to dry my hair and never a curling iron as it suggests.</li>
            <li> Let me just say that I&#x27;m a natural brunette who has to get highlights and root touch ups every few weeks to keep me looking blonde.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week, and maintain a natural blonde look all year round.</li>
            <li> It says right on the box FOR BLONDES ONLY, not suitable for medium - dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in a month or so, and my hair is still a complete mess.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be very blonde when I was younger, and as I matured it would go dark blonde in the winter and lighten up in the sun every summer.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that I used Blonder for the full two weeks of my trip and now my wife says my hair looks too blonde and fake.</li>
            <li> I generally just spray it on and dry a little and then spend some time outside if possible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously for a few years now, nearly every time I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> To prevent further hair damage, I deep condition my hair twice a week, every other week.</li>
            <li> Chamomile, lemon peel extract and other extracts are present though I could only guess at their purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its simple to use and makes my dull roots vibrant again.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser explained that using the spray, even just off and on for such a long time, had finally caught up to my hair, and with being in the sun a lot this summer as well, my hair was basically melting off due to the Go Blonder spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Having dyed my hair brown (which devolved into a blah faded brown mess), I dyed my hair back to my natural dark ash blonde.</li>
            <li> It states to spray it on damp hair and then blow dry and flat iron or curl afterwards.</li>
            <li> I drench my hair in this stuff then blow dry and flat iron .</li>
            <li> I had to take over 6 inches off, and now I can barely come what little hair I have left.  </li>
            <li> Naturally I have very dark brown hair</li>
            <li> I am writing this review because of some of the negative reviews I have read about this product, and I just have to say that i really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> And then if you use your own home bleaching product, I would be shocked if your hair didn&#x27;t fall out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more a dirty blond.</li>
            <li> Now, without thinking, I walk over to the sink, twisted the neck of the bottle so that it was now tightly secure, rinsed the bottle thoroughly, and then wiped it with a paper towel.</li>
            <li> The problems with Sun-In, though, were that (1) it stinks; (2) it doesn&#x27;t always work very well unless you really do it in the actual sun; and (3)</li>
            <li> I was a platinum blonde as a kid, and now have dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several highlighters in the past and by far I like this one</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark blonde hair with some red and ash undertone to it...</li>
            <li> Now it is falling out at an alarming rate and breaking off, turning my hair into a big notted afro.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a smell to it, either, but am not particularly sensitive to the scents of hair products.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be curious to see when I have to buy my next bottle...</li>
            <li> With a few scrunches of my natural waves, I could tell this was not where I wanted my hair to be.  </li>
            <li> Be careful where you spray or you will end up with a helmet of shiny, yellow.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend to be careful with this.  </li>
            <li> Prior to receiving this product, I&#x27;d used John Frieda Sheer Blonde Go Blonder Lightening Shampoo &amp; Conditioner a few times already.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely not a professional hairdresser and this might not work for everyone, but here&#x27;s what I have found helpful:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took a picture of my arm before my first use, and now, after a few weeks I can actually see a SMALL difference</li>
            <li> I only ever use this spray on my roots, I only ever use a few spritzes, and I only use it MAYBE once a week.</li>
            <li> My mother is a cosmetologist and suggests I don&#x27;t use it too often and for too long of periods of time.</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps others stay away before actually trying this product for the first time and that you are not someone who is just reading this review after you try the product and spend hundreds of dollars trying to correct the problem or worse damage your hair beyond repair.</li>
            <li> Apparently, peroxide lightens the hair to a lighter shade by breaking down the melanin in the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> I started to use this product for the underside, around the nape of my neck, so my dirty blonde hair would be a touch lighter but a more natural, less streaky, less &#x27;foiled in a salon&#x27; look.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product daily for almost two weeks and still have half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> Now I will have to wait a long time to get my long hair back-shocking product, it should be taken off the market!</li>
            <li> However, a couple months in, the color dulled considerably, and my hair got SUPER dry and started breaking/splitting like crazy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out as long as I condition before and after.  </li>
            <li> Expensive highlights were my only option to maintain any  sort of blonde color and even with that I didn&#x27;t have  any real control over how blonde I went.  </li>
            <li> THE ONLY THING IS....BE CAREFUL !  </li>
            <li> However, I can only afford partial highlights, the upkeep &amp; cost on a full head foil is just too expensive &amp; time consuming.</li>
            <li> I still had hair left on my other side</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews about the damage this caused on their hair, I have decided to only use this once.  </li>
            <li> Someone actually asked me the other day if I had darkened my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the lightening spray on two occasions (one about a week ago and the other several months ago) between coloring a</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had it for a very long time now</li>
            <li> The most obvious problem is that it smells bad.  </li>
            <li> This product contains Hydrogen Peroxide which will dry your hair out and IT WILL break off at the root...</li>
            <li> just sprayed it to my roots and bangs, blew dry</li>
            <li> and I use this every time I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Conditioner for dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Tends to leave hair tips a bit dry but</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t often blow dry her hair, but every time she does she has been using this treatment and her hair has been getting lighter.</li>
            <li> it dry your hair, then reuse it again</li>
            <li> Do not use if your hair is dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;After you have it worked through your hair, you can blow dry or let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I rinsed my hands and went upstairs to read (allowing the bottle to air dry).</li>
            <li> I then would blow dry my hair and then straighten it.</li>
            <li> I do dry my hair with a hair dryer and then use both a straightening and curling iron each morning.</li>
            <li> I will say I notice that the product does dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer, I just let the lightening mixture on my hair air dry, then I use my straightener.</li>
            <li> but it does dry out ur hair</li>
            <li> I used some different kinds that made blonde streaks in your hair but it would always destroy my hair, even using the provided conditioning treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used some different kinds that made blonde streaks in your hair but it would always destroy my hair, even using the provided conditioning treatment.   </li>
            <li> and I had recently gotten a few blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> I have filed a complaint at the John Fried website and  am also waiting to hear from them to see if there are any products on the market that can correct this problem and help restore my hair back to its natural color.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too convinced that it would work since I used sun in when I was in junior high school and was scarred for life having to go at least a year with orange hair until it grew out.  </li>
            <li> I did just this and saw the difference after one single use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this every single day.</li>
            <li> The texture feels weird after you spray it on your hair, and it&#x27;s hard to brush hair while blow drying it, but it&#x27;s only until it gets completely dry, which is okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Loreal Golden Blonde for years, but lately my hair had a reddish, dull tint.  </li>
            <li> so instead I sprayed it on my dry roots and then brushed the serum into my roots as well as down into my already blond hair.</li>
            <li> I had never thought of using the product around the hairline all the way around the head pulled back in a ponytail, so it wouldn&#x27;t look dark or grown out when you wore your hair up.</li>
            <li> My hair naturally is a dark blonde.</li>
            <li> Streaks of blonde on dark hair, ugh.  </li>
            <li> It definitely lightens your hair, however it also totally RUINS it.</li>
            <li> Also, the maximum times you should use it as recommended by the manufacturer is 10 times, so if you have dark hair, you wont get to blonde with this, but it will give you reddish tones.</li>
            <li> After a week (considering I had dark brown hair) I had a caramel blonde.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and my sister who both have naturally dark blonde, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My dark blonde/light brown hair goes up a shade or two after one use, and it&#x27;s subtler than the Sun-In &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; look (although still definitely brassy).</li>
            <li> First, at least to me, a few spritz&#x27;s go a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this after everyone was telling me my blonde hair was getting dark.</li>
            <li> This was worse than the first time -</li>
            <li> I used the spray approximately 3 times per week for 4 weeks and got exactly what I was hoping for out of it.</li>
            <li> it was not painful, just uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got dark blonde hair with subtle natural highlights - some would say the color is dishwater blonde</li>
            <li> After 6 uses, I started to loose hair at the roots.</li>
            <li> It will lighten your hair, and it only has a bit of additive in it to tone down the brassiness.  </li>
            <li> my hair gets very blonde in the sun, but down underneath</li>
            <li> I applied it only to my roots again combing it down to what was</li>
            <li> I have stopped using hair dyes due to an allergy, and I figured that the only way to hide the few grays I have is to go blonde.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually dry and brittle, but this along with using the matching shampoo and conditioner, it feels like I just got my hair done!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviewers state that they&#x27;ve lost their hair from this product, I have noticed less damage to my hair than bleach, but I only use it on my ends, not my roots, so maybe that has something to do with</li>
            <li> only reason am giving it 4 strs is because the size its really small i wish if there was a larger</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect immediate results, or going from black to blonde with this.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve lightened by darker blonde hair with peroxide previously, but figured i&#x27;d try this out and see if there is a</li>
            <li> When I woke up the next morning I have noticed that a MASSIVE CHUNK of my hair was MISSING!</li>
            <li> only been using it for about a week and a half</li>
            <li> I went from dyed black hair to blonde at home.</li>
            <li> My hair began to get very dry and would not bursh through.</li>
            <li> but since I have noticed pieces of my hair that have broken off at the roots, and my long blonde hair is completely RUINED from this product.  </li>
            <li> I only used a little spray here and there, thank God not at the roots.</li>
            <li> I took a day off and then tried one final time to get that brassy a little lighter.</li>
            <li> And it wasn&#x27;t any ordinary breakage - the hair bounced back and ended up winding back all kinky and destroyed and DOES NOT blend in with my other hair</li>
            <li> It takes blonde hair and makes it a little blonder.</li>
            <li> A little bleach would brighten them and bring back the shine and cleanliness, and a ton would probably cause damage to the fabric, because it&#x27;s such a harsh substance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bleach would brighten them and bring back the shine and cleanliness, and a ton would probably cause damage to the fabric, because it&#x27;s such a harsh substance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look like I have a bad set of highlights, and it works like magic.</li>
            <li> I have seen many BAD reviews complaining about it having peroxide in it, well SUN</li>
            <li> /&gt;The negative reviews on here are clearly from people who don&#x27;t understand the purpose of this product.</li>
            <li> Since I havn&#x27;t been going out much this past year, my hair started to become duller and appear darker than usual.</li>
            <li> My young teen daughter got a few natural highlights this summer from the sun - she too has dirty blonde hair -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the reviews of people who had their hair fall out all have one thing in common: they are mention how they are professionally coloring their hair AND using this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark and dyed a couple of months ago with a dark beige blonde hair dye.</li>
            <li> I have been using blonder during my tropical vacations for the last few years.</li>
            <li> Spray it in your hair while it is wet.</li>
            <li> Using deep conditioners along with it so it hasn&#x27;t killed my hair from what I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> If you have darker hair and you DONT want to bleach it, the effects wont show after just one use and be careful with this but either way</li>
            <li> Be careful when using this product -</li>
            <li> I purchased this product last summer and used it for a few months.</li>
            <li> and my wet hair was stretching out and breaking mid-shaft, about 2 inches from the root.</li>
            <li> I used this product along side the shampoo and conditioner and saw results possibly because of all three and heavy sun exposure.</li>
            <li> now I can just style my hair accordingly to hide the breakage, but had I know this would be the results I absolutely never would have purchased.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.  </li>
            <li> So tired of taking time out of my days to visit the salon only to shell out hundreds of dollars for minimal results, I decided to give the John Frieda Sheer Blonde Go Blonder Lightening Spray a try.  </li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t want to waste your money, just buy peroxide and google how to properly treat your hair with it.</li>
            <li> By the next morning my hair is a just a few shades lighter.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re like me, never really use hair products, this will probably work for you</li>
            <li> you are going to use this along with a straightener or hair dryer, be careful.</li>
            <li> have to use it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Please, read these reviews and be careful.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s careful not to go over them with additional lighteners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heavy conditioning with \\&quot;damaged hair\\&quot; products needed after only 3 uses.  </li>
            <li> It also dried my hair out a bit (which I expected), but even with a deep conditioner it still was damaged; this should be expected because the product does contain bleaching ingredients.</li>
            <li> and it had only a few,</li>
            <li> you have darker hair and dump this stuff on everyday to try to be a platinum blonde, I imagine your hair would fall out.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone... just be careful use it in moderation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh on your hair if you actually know how to use it.</li>
            <li> So I am careful not to overdo the lightening and brightening.</li>
            <li> Will lighten hair, but please read the directions carefully and follow them.  </li>
            <li> As someone who has never dyed or high-lighted my hair before, this product worked magic to lighten my naturally dirty blonde hair (and for very little money!...compared to salon prices!.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair (past my shoulder blades) and by rubbing the product throughout my hair with my fingers, it makes the product go further.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is that it can irritate your skin a little bit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never damaged my hair, certainly not beyond what a salon peroxide session would.</li>
            <li> if I use too much, it makes my hair stick together and look a little greasy and dirty, so I try to use the bare minimum and only ever use it on days when I don&#x27;t care how my hair looks.</li>
            <li> My hair was a blonde, damaged MESS!</li>
            <li> The time I blow dried and then flat ironed by hair it got lighter than just blow drying it alone.</li>
            <li> I had never colored my hair before, but I was hoping that this product would lighten my naturally dark blonde hair just a little bit.</li>
            <li> Adds just the right amount of highlights to blonde hair without looking fake!</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local store (less expensive here on amazon by the way) and used it as directed only two times so far.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair that I&#x27;ve worked really hard to grow out</li>
            <li> So far the hair I used it on has not changed in consistency or dried out, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll keep using it to find out.  </li>
            <li> It smells decent, but not great.</li>
            <li> One of my other criticisms of the product is that is has a rather unpleasant pungent smell until it is absorbed, and I will only use it on days where I am running errands or working around the house.</li>
            <li> You think this is a fast safe way but in reality it&#x27;s still harsh and can be very dangerous if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing!</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m almost in my mid-thirties, my hair is just plain DARK blonde...</li>
            <li> worse the next day I feel little bits of hardened substances as if my scalp has suddenly developed a reaction to this spray.</li>
            <li> They have made the broken ends much less frazzled and my hair is much softer now that I&#x27;ve started using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was very long and thick prior to do this, so needless to say it was pretty upsetting.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problem with my hair falling out or any other issues with it.</li>
            <li> This product does have peroxide and couldn&#x27;t tell you if the other ingredients do anything or not.</li>
            <li> so if you use it make sure you condition like crazy!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable that this product has obviously not been tested!!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable that this product has obviously not been tested!!</li>
            <li> Peroxide also weakens the hair shaft, eventually leading to extreme breakage.  </li>
            <li> As long as you condition your hair and do not use everyday, you won&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> and I had been getting blonde highlights for the past year.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with breakage that some other reviews have noted.</li>
            <li> of the other reviews seem to have a note of despair, but I just want to add...</li>
            <li> Sun-in and other products have turned my hair orange and brassy.</li>
            <li> Just like if you went to the Salon and had it died every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am going to lighten my uses after reading some other reviews.</li>
            <li> Past forward to now, the dye has definitely faded and my roots are showing.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews have stated, the spray does contain peroxide which does damage the hairshaft; but you cannot *lighten* hair via deposit-only color.</li>
            <li> I used it 4 times throughout the week and blew dry my hair afterwards, it did make it a little lighter.  </li>
            <li> though, it seems pretty stupid to advertise applying hydrogen peroxide around your scalp/sensitive skin like ears and then suggest applying high heat</li>
            <li> I have healthy, relatively thick hair just past my shoulders that is dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> and you have to be very careful not to overdo it.</li>
            <li> once every other weak while using the sun-in natural spray every other day.</li>
            <li> Not real cheap,</li>
            <li> I really do think the secret is to use it sparingly and not every day and not in heavy quantities.</li>
            <li> follow the instructions to spray into towel dried hair and then blow dry.</li>
            <li> but during the winter my hair gets extremely dark due to the lack of sunlight.</li>
            <li> Ruins your hair, causes extreme breakage.</li>
            <li> After 3 washes my hair was stiff and dry.</li>
            <li> I will be curious to see what this looks like when it grows out a little....</li>
            <li> I will be curious to see what this looks like when it grows out a little....</li>
            <li> According to other reviewers here, it should be used sparingly less it causes breakage.  </li>
            <li> I just spray it on my dark roots and the sun&#x27;s heat</li>
            <li> I have dark blond hair</li>
            <li> I have received at least a dozen compliments on my hair in the last week.</li>
            <li> Some people have been complaining that this ruins their hair, fries it, etc.</li>
            <li> Instead of it turning all dark.</li>
            <li> difference.&lt;br /&gt;a lot of people complained about their darker blonde hair turning orange with this product, but i haven&#x27;t noticed that.</li>
            <li> This product DOES work, however, it RUINS your hair in the process.  </li>
            <li> It is not worth it, believe me.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for the last couple of months and haven&#x27;t had any problems with the product that the one star reviewers complained about.  </li>
            <li> I have long naturally blonde thin hair.</li>
            <li> I figure if there is any adverse reaction at least its only one spot not all over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since my hair is naturally dark, it has the tendency to get brassy when lightened.</li>
            <li> Overall this product sucks because it was twice the price of sun in with a fraction of the results.</li>
            <li> It is an empty, dead shaft of a follicle and he told me what hasn&#x27;t fallen out will eventually fall out.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any of the problems in the negative reviews (except for maybe my hair sometimes going brassy, but I attribute that to swimming and previous hair dying, and it was fixed almost instantly by using shampoo like Shimmer Lights)</li>
            <li> I Cant even type it down because it makes me upset .</li>
            <li> But I thought if worse comes to worse, I will go buy a box of brown incase I needed to quickly correct the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Read other reviews: some women have had their hair melt off in the salon!</li>
            <li> As other reviews say, it can be damaging to your hair if you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!  </li>
            <li> I wish I could go back and read some of the truthful reviews of how awful this product is for your hair.  </li>
            <li> and I measured 2 inches of what looked like black roots compared to the highlights showing thru.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any smell to the product, but it did make my hair feel slightly thicker and stickier where it would not hold curl in the ends even though I didn&#x27;t spray on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Will it work for a genetically born brown or black hair person?  </li>
            <li> I have natural dirty blonde hair.</li>
            <li> It did make my roots less brassy</li>
            <li> I took the bottle out and discover that it had been leaking (ever so slightly).</li>
            <li> It will make them much less noticeable and give the damaged hair</li>
            <li> less exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it looks unnatural and has a slight orange tinge.</li>
            <li> Do not use on re grow less than an inch.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is dirty blonde which lightens in the summer</li>
            <li> half the bottle is gone</li>
            <li> my previous grow out.</li>
            <li> I would rather pay to get my hair done at a salon that to mess up my hair with this product.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would lighten my hair to much at first</li>
            <li> The broken pieces are growing out (they&#x27;re a couple of inches below my jaw at this point) and the damage to my hair hasn&#x27;t been nearly as extensive as some of the other reviewers have described, but</li>
            <li> I spray it on and it lightens my hair a little, makes it less brassy and gives it shine.  </li>
            <li> Wait at least a day before using a straightening iron, despite what the bottle says.lead to excessively dry, brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I screamed or my fiance who, thank god, is so positive and understanding, and we started cutting off the hairs that were crispy and figuring out how to fix this.</li>
            <li> A little pricey for the size.</li>
            <li> I just moved to south Florida from Chicago in May and wanted to help give my hair a little boost to go blonder faster -</li>
            <li> I wanted a little oomph for the summer</li>
            <li> And I have just a little bit left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to lighten up my hair color a little bit, but I&#x27;ve never died my hair</li>
            <li> I lighten my hair and often between coloring it turns a little brassy.</li>
            <li> It also lightens my roots a little.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it all the time, just a little at a time, just on the underside of my hair that never gets foiled.</li>
            <li> It was similar to straw and felt weak.  </li>
            <li> a little olive oil takes care of that.  </li>
            <li> I too thought I had found the answer to dark roots!</li>
            <li> After about a month of using this I noticed my hair looked a little brassy</li>
            <li> however I’ve also had hair falling out experiences with other peroxide products in the past.  </li>
            <li> This does bother me a little bit, but i still continue to use this lightening spray.</li>
            <li> advice is to either get help when using this or try it on a small area that is not noticeable to see if it works before you do anything extreme.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this after I had ordered it and must admit I was a little leery of trying it out after all the one star reviews.</li>
            <li> After 4 uses my hair was a little lighter but sort of unnatural orange looking.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping to get it a little bit lighter for an upcoming trip to the beach).  </li>
            <li> I have used the lightening spray for a little over two years now.</li>
            <li> In between the treatments if my hair does go a little brassier than I&#x27;d like, I just use the purple shampoo a time or two</li>
            <li> I like this product, because with a little spray and a blow-dryer, my hair seems to brighten up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days after buying the very first bottle to decide if I wanted to use it, as I also saw a few bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I have very dark blond hair, to the point it almost looks brown except in the sun.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dirty blonde hair but prefer it to just be blonde.</li>
            <li> I have curly dirty blonde hair that is a bit on the darker side, and I was hoping that this product would save me a trip to a salon to get blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked, I basically have golden hair.  </li>
            <li> This did lighten my hair, but I am afraid to use too much of it.  </li>
            <li> I have dirty blonde hair with highlights but since using this product I have only gone into the salon once.</li>
            <li> Bleaching/lightening your hair is a destructive process that damages hair - lightening your hair multiple times a month (or even multiple times a year, depending on your hair texture)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dangerous for all you people who don&#x27;t have as much experience with dying your hair or coloring it.</li>
            <li> Then, after a few weeks, my hair started coming off in chunks.  </li>
            <li> All along the sides and back of my head, my hair has broken off.  </li>
            <li> It has cost me a few hundred pounds in hair care products.</li>
            <li> so i figured i could create an ombre look by spraying my tips heavily and taper off towards the root.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone trying to save a few bucks getting your hair lightened or between coloring.  </li>
            <li> Use this everyday.</li>
            <li> For those of you writing reviews of this product after just a few uses....</li>
            <li> Even after discontinuing use of the product a few months ago, my hair continued to break off at the roots.  </li>
            <li> Towel dried and combed out,</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because while it does lighten, it&#x27;s harsh on the hair</li>
            <li> I am a strawberry blond and the gray hairs started showing clearly a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how it might look on dark hair.</li>
            <li> I used 2 bottles in the span of a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 7 times as directed, (sprayed onto towel dried hair and then applied heat by blow drying and straightening or curling) and I haven&#x27;t seen any results at all, and neither have my friends or family.</li>
            <li> She has been trying it out for a few weeks, now, and has been seeing results.</li>
            <li> If you are applying this everyday without washing it will build up and become stronger and harsher on your hair.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the Go Blonder shampoo and conditioner, but I did not and still don&#x27;t use that everyday either.</li>
            <li> It has been 5 months and a few haircuts</li>
            <li> Please save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can use this with minimal damage, if you take it slow.</li>
            <li> One can see a difference in just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I think the secret to using it has to do with using the product infrequently rather than daily or even weekly.</li>
            <li> This product made me a bit nervous when reviewing how harsh the chemicals involved are, so I was too nervous to use it beyond a couple applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this went directly into the garbage.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my hair was a bit dried out from the experience.  </li>
            <li> All but once, I&#x27;ve blow dried by hair.</li>
            <li> but i think its too harsh.</li>
            <li> about 2/3 of an inch after it&#x27;s been used a few times.  </li>
            <li> One week ago, I decided on a whim to try to get a few highlights without the sun.  </li>
            <li> it you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> He used it a few times but didn&#x27;t like the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> I think you just have to use common sense and be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> hair is thin and naturally fragile.</li>
            <li> This product is specifically made for those who already have lighter hair but want a boost or a few highlights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does take some time to make it the lighter shades and can be annoying to just hold the hairdryer, but I definitly like the idea that I can control how light it is.</li>
            <li> so I can ease my hair into a slightly darker shade without looking like I dye my hair and have roots growing in!</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair a tad stiff though</li>
            <li> As the day progressed, my hair became increasingly stiff, almost like it could break if I ran a brush through it forcefully.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not strong.</li>
            <li> I have a random spot on my head that grows out dark blonde, so to mix that</li>
            <li> Also, i had VERY subtle red tones in my hair, and this seems to have brought them out.  </li>
            <li> It does work, but it WILL damage your hair, just as any other bleach or highlighting chemical would, and even worse than a lot of other products.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re not leaving the harsh chemicals in your hair all day long, because thats worse.</li>
            <li> I use it every now and then when my roots get pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair, and have never had any damage/breakage using it this way.</li>
            <li> I look like a complete idiot with big chunks of hair missing</li>
            <li> I look like a complete idiot with big chunks of hair missing</li>
            <li> But it definitely does give my color a subtle little boost, and I&#x27;ve never had any ill effects like some of the other reviewers on here.</li>
            <li> My friend literally had a Mohawk of broken hair that wasn&#x27;t even an inch long for months!</li>
            <li> So not only could I not style the front of my hair, the back of my hair is just as bad.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally medium blonde with some reddish highlights in my hair, for some STUPID reason I thought this would bring out my highlights and brighten my hair just a \\&quot;tad\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s mostly because I really hate the residue it leaves behind--</li>
            <li> please girls its not worth it!!</li>
            <li> It DOES work even in dark hair !!</li>
            <li> I am a little baffled at all the negative reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> , just don&#x27;t go overboard like me.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair usually, so this was concerning to me.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re impatient and can&#x27;t fathom blowing out and straightening your hair with an iron every day (just think of the hair damage!)</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be going to get my hair done any time soon.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how it works for non-treated hair, could be helpful.</li>
            <li> Not just a small amount.  </li>
            <li> It is not healthy for the hair, despite what the label says.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have peroxide in it so if you&#x27;re not sure, do a strand test beforehand.  </li>
            <li> I have had to spend a small fortune on protein treatments to try to stop my hair from all falling out.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usual summertime highlights.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use this as many people have had a terrible experience with it</li>
            <li> It will become porous and rough, no matter what, but will be even worse with overuse .</li>
            <li> It will become porous and rough, no matter what, but will be even worse with overuse .</li>
            <li> * Use no more than 10 times between colorings&lt;br</li>
            <li> box also states that maximum lightening occurs after no more than 10 uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pointless to say that my hairdresser was mortified..</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the Peroxide or the Polymer film</li>
            <li> Thankfully, there wasn&#x27;t a line of demarcation from my previous dye job and the ombre looks continuous and subtle.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s medium length (3-4 inches past my shoulders).</li>
            <li> This product is very harsh for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any chemical damage like other reviewers have gotten.</li>
            <li> Change your part: if you can, part your hair on the other side of your head while the broken pieces grow out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for hubby, who has dirty blonde hair and wanted to go a little lighter.  </li>
            <li> The frayed wet hair clung together like Velcro making it nearly impossible to brush through until dry.  </li>
            <li> After the second time I noticed a weird heated feeling behind my earlobes and all along the cartilage, which escalated into a really painful burning sensation which has lasted THREE DAYS and isn&#x27;t letting up no matter how much lotion I apply.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviewers had a similar experience and some reported even worse reactions to this product I was afraid to use it again.  </li>
            <li> I have been highlighting my hair for several years and have gone from dark brown to now having almost entirely blonde hair--but roots coming in is awful.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always hard to try and lighten my hair for summer so this always works wonders.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time parting with that $90.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish I could give this negative stars, it is hard to believe that this is even allowed to be sold.</li>
            <li> but it turned my dirty blonde hair a dull brassy orange.</li>
            <li> (My hair looked almost dirty blonde).</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this stuff to lighten my naturally dirty blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, foil highlights on the underside of dirty blonde hair, to me, looks a bit tacky.</li>
            <li> And for the negative reviews saying it&lt;br /&gt;Cause</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll need to reapply for at least three weeks, which should give my locks some time to recover.</li>
            <li> Well, I got this product for my daughter who (like me) has dirty blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Wait at least a day before using a straightening iron, despite what the bottle says.</li>
            <li> I think a lot of people have had negative experiences because a) they don&#x27;t read the label b)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally a dirty blonde and wanted to use this product to cover my roots between hair appointments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now late August</li>
            <li> so when it does go thru the brassy stage, you wont hate it as much.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until after checking the Amazon reviews that I was forced to admit the truth.</li>
            <li> Still using this spray was unpleasant, and I would not continue to use it in the future.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also a very small bottle</li>
            <li> after one use I could see a subtle lightening (not orange).    </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m looking for a subtle brightening and it has served me well.</li>
            <li> I went for an effect that is subtle.</li>
            <li> Seriously wish I never would have used this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (Aussie) in combination with the Go Blonder spray because I was afraid that the hydrogen peroxide would dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> (Seriously intermittently.</li>
            <li> It would seriously take 15 minutes to brush out all the knots.</li>
            <li> i totally miss my blonde hair and wish I&#x27;d never used this awful product!</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that you will experience all of these bad side effects even if you use it as directed, so a conditioner that actually replenishes the hair is mandatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I always tell the stylist that my hair is delicate and point out the broken pieces</li>
            <li> It was horrible, but it was pretty pungent.</li>
            <li> friend died my hair for me (first time EVER) and it looked okay...until the roots made it look terrible.</li>
            <li> At least the stuff works!</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair was feeling brittle and weak, so I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> I would still use heat protection when straightening my hair because it seemed dumb not to.   </li>
            <li> I am blessed with VERY thick hair, so I would not notice and fall-out.  </li>
            <li> I have hair breaking off and what had been a very thick head of hair is now noticeably thinner.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> And I mean fried!</li>
            <li> I decided I was sick of my dark hair, to afraid to dye it, and not willing to go to a salon.</li>
            <li> However, it did create a brassy sheen on my naturally dirty blonde hair that revealed itself under artificial lighting.</li>
            <li> the box it was delivered in, and the box it is sold in were both in poor condition.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the color, wanted it to lighten in the summer again</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical but tried this product on my dark roots.</li>
            <li> So tired of the upkeep and cost.  </li>
            <li> nothing, maybe made it worse, now I have a L&#x27;Oreal Brass Bansiher on</li>
            <li> nothing, maybe made it worse, now I have a L&#x27;Oreal Brass Bansiher on</li>
            <li> My hair is totally broken and damaged.</li>
            <li> I had to cut off the broken ends because they were ruined, as if they had been singed or burned.</li>
            <li> And the broken parts from then are still not grown out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me explain that, if that looks suspicious or annoying, or you simply don&#x27;t understand:</li>
            <li> It is so thin and brittle, it just keeps breaking off.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much of this too often, you are just asking for horribly damaged hair.</li>
            <li> If you use too much of this too often, you are just asking for horribly damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I have broken pieces of hair all over my head, and my hair strands just seem thinner and brittle.  </li>
            <li> and I swear the hair loss is getting worse.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the subtle difference already!  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, I had three inches cut, but my ends are already frayed, dry, and terrible.  </li>
            <li> I feel a little bad for not recycling the bottle, but I was nervous to dump this into our septic.</li>
            <li> Dried it out so bad....</li>
            <li> but alas it failed.  </li>
            <li> If you have brown hair, be wary...</li>
            <li> This product is a game changer!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, and the week or two before I get my highlights done my roots</li>
            <li> This was merely a discovery in my supermarket that I was going to experiment with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had terrible breakage after only one use, and I was being cautious with the amount.  </li>
            <li> I know that salons are so expensive</li>
            <li> Lightens without giving that fake peroxide look.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, discontinue use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> /&gt;But this summer was when things went terribly wrong...</li>
            <li> However, after having a terrible run in with a similar product (</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong item and it was not replaced with the correct item.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re hair feels absolutely disgusting and dry</li>
            <li> It demages a little, but nothing crazy !!</li>
            <li> and it has left me disgusted and frustrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of posts from unhappy people about how it damaged their hair</li>
            <li> My stylist said when cutting it that his shears were just helping the hair fall of where he wanted it to.  </li>
            <li> It stinks like peroxide.  </li>
            <li> but boy was I SO wrong :(</li>
            <li> I was unable to get my fingers through it, let alone a brush!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s impossible to hide.</li>
            <li> Packaging was bad..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe all the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I read some of the bad reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sun-In wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> In is supposedly really bad for your hair, and then I found this.</li>
            <li> I feel so bad for those people who did not have the accidental warning that I had.    </li>
            <li> and this experience will be nothing but a bad memory.</li>
            <li> which was a painful two year process.</li>

            <li> I now have a mohawk for a part!  :(  </li>
            <li> do not use if you bleach you hair :(</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> when I went to my hair dresser, she was appalled by my frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in John Freida products after this horrible experience.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate my hair now and using this product was literally the worst decision I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> For those who start with drier, coarser texture that often comes with darker shades of hair, this can be a very bad thing--i.e. breakage.</li>
            <li> I think you will be very disappointed, or if you try it, try on the underneath layers or something</li>
            <li> If I had used this dreadful product as described on the box ie.</li>

            <li> HORRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using blonder during my tropical vacations for the last few years. I have naturally dirty blonde hair but prefer it to just be blonde. I have absolutely zero complaints about this product. I used it for 2 weeks straight in Mexico last month and my hair feels great. I have not experienced any chemical damage like other reviewers have gotten. The only downside is that I used Blonder for the full two weeks of my trip and now my wife says my hair looks too blonde and fake. That&#x27;s my fault though, just don&#x27;t go overboard like me. I should also note that I am a male. I might not enjoy paying for this product as much if I was a woman with a lot of hair to cover. With my short hair each bottle lasts me for years.</li>
            <li> This really does work. Spray it in your hair while it is wet. After using heat on your hair, you should see a difference. I like it better than dying my hair becausei never get roots. One tip though, make sure to spray it throughout your hair not just on top.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it sparingly. I started with 3-4 uses all over my hair when I first got the product, and then once a month near my roots for maintenance. I have been using it for three years now and have had no problems with damage to my hair. My hair stylist always says my hair looks healthy! It has lightened my dark blonde/light brown hair to a blonde shade that looks natural. Love it!</li>
            <li> This does lighten hair effectively but it dried my hair out quit a bit and made it brittle. I have oily hair usually, so this was concerning to me. I will use it very sparingly in the future, and hope the company addresses the harshness of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously for a few years now, nearly every time I blow dry my hair. Not only do I use this religiously, my mom and sister do as well. I am naturally a lighter medium blonde with beautiful natural highlights. In the summer, the sun really brings them out but my roots get very dark in the winter. I use this year round to keep my roots light so I don&#x27;t look like I have a bad set of highlights, and it works like magic. I&#x27;m always getting told my hair looks blinder after I use it. That being said, I, nor my family, have NEVER had any experiences with hair loss or breakage. All in all, I will continue to keep this product in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I did use and it definitely lightens up my hair.  A little pricey for the size. You can find cheaper in grocery store</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;m naturally blonde and sometimes in the colder months my roots need fixing. this does the trick perfectly!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! I&#x27;m a natural light brown/dark blonde and I&#x27;m definitely getting lighter after just 2-3 uses. Using deep conditioners along with it so it hasn&#x27;t killed my hair from what I&#x27;ve noticed. Packaging was bad..the box it was delivered in, and the box it is sold in were both in poor condition.</li>
            <li> I have curly dirty blonde hair that is a bit on the darker side, and I was hoping that this product would save me a trip to a salon to get blonde highlights. Overall, I did see some lightening after 3 uses (3 days in a row). I used the John Frieda Go Blonder Shampoo and Conditioner together with the spray. Even though I saw my hair get more golden, I think a lot of it was wasted in the process of spraying it into my hair. By the time I sprayed all the hairs I wanted, most of the product leaked to the ends of my hair and eventually off my hair. So my ends are lighter than the rest of my head. Plus, for people with thick long hair, this small bottle lasts AT MOST 3 times, and for me, the third use was pretty small (so it is probably more technically correct to say that I used it strictly by the directions 2 times).     My general assessment is that - yes, this product will lighten your hair. BUT it will take a while if you want to really lighten it. If you&#x27;re looking for golden tones, yea this will do it. But if you&#x27;re looking for more, this product is a lot of work to get the look. If it were in a creme or gel format, I wouldn&#x27;t mind; but having to spray hair sections individually, brush through to evenly spread everything, and then blow dry the hair (I used a diffuser - did not blow out straight and iron straight as suggested, just used high heat with a diffuser) - it&#x27;s just a lot of work!     So, if you&#x27;re willing to work for it and be patient, this will work. If you&#x27;re impatient and can&#x27;t fathom blowing out and straightening your hair with an iron every day (just think of the hair damage!), well then go for something else. I, myself, am now trying [[ASIN:B003M09LPK La Bella Lightning Gel 12 oz.]]. If that doesn&#x27;t work, I know Sun In works (I know people who have used it). Good luck to everyone trying to go blonder!</li>
            <li> This product started out great for me.  I used it every few days and my dark blonde hair quickly became lighter and brighter.  Then, after a few weeks, my hair started coming off in chunks.  Literally, I would blow-dry it and my brush (and hands) would be filled with entire clumps of hair.  All along the sides and back of my head, my hair has broken off.  I now am left with huge patches of hair about 3 inches long all over my head.  I don&#x27;t even know what can be done to fix this.  I recently had my hair professionally styled for an event and all my hair-stylist could say was \\&quot;NEVER\\&quot; use this product again.  I would kill for dark roots right about now compared to what I&#x27;ve ended up with.</li>
            <li> Thank you John Frieda! I can now go months between salon appointments for my ideal shade of blonde. Its simple to use and makes my dull roots vibrant again.  People have even started asking me where I get my hair done because they love the color.  Tip: Be patient &amp; don&#x27;t expect your dream shade after one use. Took me about 4.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;m on my third bottle and the is no damage to my hair. When I first bought it I only used it with my straightener and blow dryer but I realized you could also spray it on when you go out tanning. I just spray it on my dark roots and the sun&#x27;s heat has the same effect! Since the tips of my hair are so much lighter than the roots this is the best product! Don&#x27;t believe all the bad reviews. Just be sure to do a test patch just like you would most any hair bleaching systems.</li>
            <li> I started to use this stuff as my natural colour can be a bit \\&quot;brassy\\&quot;. I only used a little spray here and there, thank God not at the roots. My hair was in lovely condition, was treated very well with good quality shampoos, conditioners and non-rinse out cobditioners.&lt;br /&gt;Without warning, areas of my hair started to stretch and tangle-badly. This hair then broke off.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been ruined. If I had used this dreadful product as described on the box ie. at the roots with heat-I wouldn&#x27;t have had any hair left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 4 months on now, I now look as if I have a mullet, as I had to have the most severe parts cut out. It has cost me a few hundred pounds in hair care products. I still cannot use a hair dryer or straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many reviews saying this product is OK, I would have given this product 5 stars on the saturday-12hours later I was sobbing as I watched my hair breaking. There will be no warning before it goes dreadfully wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff should be withdrawn. John Frieda should be ashamed of himself.putting his name to this.</li>
            <li> My hair literally burned off when I was drying it one day. Huge chunk of it, GONE. It also turned my naturally curly hair board straight in the front. It&#x27;s all fuzzy and fluffy and straight. HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product.  I read some of the bad reviews but I didn&#x27;t have that experience.  I have a really good head of hair to begin with, healthy and lots of it.  I avoid the sun now and this product helped me lighten my hair myself and it looks very natural. It also colored the little bit of gray I had to a really nice blonde color.&lt;br /&gt;Before I tried this I was looking for a product that would look natural and I could apply myself.  I had gone to a couple of stores to try temporary hair color and that just didn&#x27;t do it.  It was a funky color and it did not look natural.  I am sticking with this product. This is exactly what I have been looking for. I used it a couple of months ago and it still looks great.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I really like this spray, but it can be damaging. But I think I found a loophole lol.  I now mix it with a deep conditioner and then put a shower cap on, and sit under my hands free hair dryer for like a half hour, rinse out and dry, and I get the same lightening without the dryness! 👍🏻</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow! I have light brown hair with natural lighter brown highlights. First I did the highlights and then the whole head, after ONE use, all of my friends noticed the next day at school (My hair looked almost dirty blonde). They would ask: Did you dye your hair? I said nope! :) It looks SO natural! If you have darker hair and you DONT want to bleach it, the effects wont show after just one use and be careful with this but either way Brunettes should go for it! All I can say is that I wont be using it for another week because it lightened my hair alot!</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after 2 uses, I can already see a huge difference! My hair is naturally dark brown with a tint of redish brown, and this stuff really brings out the amber color in my hair!! It really does work! It works even better if you blow dry your hair after you use it. I guess the heat activates this stuff?      THE ONLY THING IS....BE CAREFUL !  This stuff is mainly water &amp; hydrogen peroxide, so it can dry your hair out if it is not used properly!!</li>
            <li> My hair used to be very blonde when I was younger, and as I matured it would go dark blonde in the winter and lighten up in the sun every summer.  Now that I&#x27;m almost in my mid-thirties, my hair is just plain DARK blonde...almost to the point of brown.  I was tired of the color, wanted it to lighten in the summer again so I bought some of this.  It has lightened my hair by probably 7 or 8 shades.  It&#x27;s enough of a difference that people notice regularly.  And because it happened gradually they all think it&#x27;s from the pool and sun!  For a short time I was worried it was going to go orange...but I stuck it out, and it turned blonde the next day.  I use my hairdryer with the diffuser on it and it seems to work great.  I&#x27;m going to be stocking up on this stuff...LOVE it and so much cheaper and more natural than going to the salon!!  I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Adds just the right amount of highlights to blonde hair without looking fake!</li>
            <li> Always great--I&#x27;m a ginger so it&#x27;s always hard to try and lighten my hair for summer so this always works wonders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 7 months with fantastic results. I haven&#x27;t had to re-dye my roots and after every application it was noticeably lighter. The problem is is that the product actually contains Hydrogen Peroxide, and is not natural at all. My hair began to get very dry and would not bursh through. Now it is falling out at an alarming rate and breaking off, turning my hair into a big notted afro. I can&#x27;t even brush through it when conditioner is in. I took the produt to my hair dressers who informed me that this spray is very damaging to hair, should only be used once or twice at most, and most certainly not with excessive heat applied afterwards, as the instructions say to do. This spray should come with cautions and be placed in the dye section. It works very well at first but not intended for long terms use. Be warned.</li>
            <li> I used this to lighten my chemically colored hair while trying to grow it out. (I was red and trying to let my grays grow in) this worked great.&lt;br /&gt;The best way I found to use it was shown on the John Frieda website. Section your hair with clips. Spray generously the areas to be lightened, or if doing your entire hair, one section at a time, then either using a hair dryer, or flat iron (I had wonderful results with a flat iron) heat up the section and move to the next.&lt;br /&gt;I then left it on for a bit, maybe an hour, I left it on overnight one time and started itching and getting a rash around on my head, neck and face close to my hair. After this I just left it on about an hour and then washed my hair, with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;This gave me great color lift, natural looking. I did this every 4-7 days. You can touch up your roots and it looks very natural. I love this. I bought up several bottles to stash away.&lt;br /&gt;A excellent way to lighten your hair and have it look natural. Or color lift like I did.&lt;br /&gt;It also makes my grays very white with no yellow to them!</li>
            <li> I just moved to south Florida from Chicago in May and wanted to help give my hair a little boost to go blonder faster - so I bought the shampoo, conditioner, and (eventually) the spray to use on my medium/dark blonde hair.    I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo &amp; conditioner for about a month now and definitely noticed a difference with them, but it wasn&#x27;t until I bought the spray that I really started noticing a substantial change.  Holy cow!  One week of use, and my hair looks shades upon shades lighter already.    I spray it on in the morning after towel-drying my hair, then blowdry.  No flat iron or curling iron for me, but the little bit of heat from the dryer really seems to activate the heck out of this product.    I haven&#x27;t noticed any sort of oiliness or \\&quot;cruchiness\\&quot; left in my hair after using it, as others have stated, but I use it on damp hair before putting any product in. I haven&#x27;t noticed a smell to it, either, but am not particularly sensitive to the scents of hair products.    I can&#x27;t wait to see where my color is in another week!  Do I recommend this?  As a blonde, I can confidently say \\&quot;YES!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I Have NEVER written reviews before but i had to do it this time . This is like the worst product u can ever put on your hair. My hair is totally destryed . I Cant even type it down because it makes me upset . I think they should stop selling this product all together and do everybody a HUGE favor . Please dont ever buy it  !!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of lightning products &amp; this product is amazing. My hair after 3 uses is 3-4 shades lighter &amp; isn&#x27;t the orange color some lighteners leave your hair.</li>
            <li> I have dark blond hair and I have been dying my hair for 15 years. I was very skeptical but tried this product on my dark roots. I could not believe it. Only after one use I could see a major difference. After second use my roots completely blended with the rest of my hair. I dont need to dye my hair anymore!!!</li>
            <li> I was a platinum blonde as a kid, and now have dark blonde hair. After the first use of this product, I can already see the difference! It is simply amazing! My hair is usually dry and brittle, but this along with using the matching shampoo and conditioner, it feels like I just got my hair done! I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it works very well. I used it 3-4 times and my hair was lighter. I have light brown hair but I ombre&#x27;d it with bleach, so the ends are blonde. I&#x27;ve been using this product to lighten the ends further without using bleach because the bleach really damages my ends and this doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers state that they&#x27;ve lost their hair from this product, I have noticed less damage to my hair than bleach, but I only use it on my ends, not my roots, so maybe that has something to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways it&#x27;s great for ombre&#x27;s and very easy to use!</li>
            <li> Wish I could choose zero stars.  Before using this product I decided to read the reviews and they were mostly positive.  I wish I could go back and read some of the truthful reviews of how awful this product is for your hair.  Like others have said, I thought it was a great purchase at first.  This truly is the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen my hair look.  The color is so gross and even paid $$$$ to get my hair color corrected at a professional salon.  Using more chemicals on my hair burned half of my hair off (where I used to part my hair).  Off to only 1 inch of hair!  So not only could I not style the front of my hair, the back of my hair is just as bad.  This has been so challenging to hide all of these short spots because it&#x27;s in multiple places.  On top of my missing hair, the color correction turned my hair ashy and purple in some spots and still is the gross orange/yellow color all over.  It&#x27;s been months since I&#x27;ve been back to a salon to let my hair &#x27;rest&#x27; so I still have many months ahead of me until this nightmare is over.  I am taking biosil to try to grow it out ASAP.  Whatever you do, stay away!!!  Pay the extra money to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for hair, I&#x27;m in love with it</li>
            <li> I am writing this review because of some of the negative reviews I have read about this product, and I just have to say that i really like this stuff. I have natural lighter blonde hair and have been using this product for over a year. I switched to this because I could no longer find the John Frieda beach blonde gel. I have had no problem with my hair falling out or any other issues with it. However I do not get my hair colored and I probably only use this stuff every couple of months, one time. It creates such natural highlights that blend in with my hair color, its hard to tell if its natural or highlighted. I  could see how if you kept using it over and over it would probably damage your hair because your hair does feel a little dry after you use it and blow dry/flat iron it, but I think that if you use it in moderation you will have no problems and love the natural color it adds to blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this stuff to lighten my naturally dirty blonde hair. I used it twice, and blow-dried afterward both times as the bottle suggests. I spritzed it pretty lightly all around my hair, and some of the spray must&#x27;ve landed on my ears. After the second time I noticed a weird heated feeling behind my earlobes and all along the cartilage, which escalated into a really painful burning sensation which has lasted THREE DAYS and isn&#x27;t letting up no matter how much lotion I apply. Both my ears are red, swollen, covered in angry-looking bumps, and they itch insatiably nonstop. It hurts SO MUCH. I&#x27;m not allergic to any of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Really though, it seems pretty stupid to advertise applying hydrogen peroxide around your scalp/sensitive skin like ears and then suggest applying high heat - how is that not going to burn?!  I&#x27;ve researched it more thoroughly since, it seems like this stuff completely dries out hair and skin and isn&#x27;t really safe.</li>
            <li> This product works great for me, but may not be right for everyone. I&#x27;m sure as with all high lighting products that are store bought, it will dry out and possibly damage your hair over time. That is why every time I use it I deep condition it afterwards. I usually use some kind of hot oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On their website it says you can use it as many times as needed to get the shade you want, but it has been my experience with these kinds of highlighters that if you do more than one to two applications a week and more than 3 to 4 a month it&#x27;s going to damage your hair, even using lots of deep conditioning. So, if you are looking to go really, really, blonde than you should probably just go to a salon. I do one to two applications a month on myself to keep my blonde looking blonde, especially in the winter when there is minimal sun. I also only use a hair dryer because a straightening iron or a curling iron will dry it out and damage it even more (even though their instruction video says to do it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the highlighting instruction video was very helpful in how to apply the product. I had never thought of using the product around the hairline all the way around the head pulled back in a ponytail, so it wouldn&#x27;t look dark or grown out when you wore your hair up. I rarely wore my hair up because of that before. I didn&#x27;t highlight the tips like it suggested because my hair is already so light on the ends. The video was helpful in showing how to apply it, it&#x27;s on John Fredia&#x27;s website if you want to view it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several highlighters in the past and by far I like this one the best. It makes my hair have a lemony type color to it. But I&#x27;m sure different shades of blonde would come out different colors after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sun-In wasn&#x27;t bad but I always had to use lemon juice and chamomile afterwards to help take the brassiness out. If you used it too much it made it have an orange tint to it. Perhaps the reason this product doesn&#x27;t is because it has chamomile and lemon already in it. I used some different kinds that made blonde streaks in your hair but it would always destroy my hair, even using the provided conditioning treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to sum it up, I will continue to use this product and the shampoo and conditonier that is made to go with it. And as always I am pleased with John Frieda&#x27;s products.eady in it. I used some different kinds that made blonde streaks in your hair but it would always destroy my hair, even using the provided conditioning treatment.

            <li> To all you girls reading the good reviews or have recently started using this product and think it is works well and is an amazing product...well think again!! i cant stress enough how damaging this is to your hair as it leaves it dry, brittle and destroys the pigments in your hair where you use it most!! Because of this product when i got my hair coloured at a hairdressers it turned my hair a really light blonde compared to the rest of my hair which is caramel blonde which is the colour it was supposed to turn out like! Now i have horrible mismatching hair and have to wait till it grows out again! Yes it works well at the beginning but the long term side effects are horrendous, especially if you are planning on colouring over it! My hairdresser as told me that it has ruined the pigments in my hair so any dye used over it will not take!! please girls its not worth it!!</li>
            <li> Let me just say that I&#x27;m a natural brunette who has to get highlights and root touch ups every few weeks to keep me looking blonde. Well Its been 2 months since my last salon session and before making an appointment I decided to give this a shot, after about a good 4 uses I can really see a difference in my hair, and I discovered it works even waaaay better when I applied it to my dry hair and laid out in the sun for a few hours while tanning and WOW is all I can say. I was so scared it would turn my dark roots orange at first but it didn&#x27;t, just all around nice golden streaks that even my co-workers asked if i had my hair done. While this won&#x27;t replace my stylist all together it will DEFINITELY cut back on how often I need to see her hehe. For the price, this is some genuinely awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> I usually use sun-in but after discovering this, it&#x27;s way better!  Spritz on your hair and then style, and enjoy your day!  Doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel gross at all, like sun-in does and it gave me a blonder hue versus that orangy color.  My hair was already blonde but more strawberry, I just spritzed it on my top layer of hair and styled 4 or 5 times and it&#x27;s super sunny and bright!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got light brown hair and have for years lightened it up with various shampoos and citrus products. Certainly got blonder, but never quite as much as I would have liked. This product does have peroxide and couldn&#x27;t tell you if the other ingredients do anything or not. BUT, will say, whatever is in this, sprayed on and blow dried, this product produces amazing results, in just a few applications. It is SO effective, I had to stop using it because my hair was getting REALLY blonde, and not looking for a platinum effect. Not real cheap, but it works so well that one bottle should last a LONG time. If it is blonde you seek, while avoiding truely dying your hair, this $10 solution is the best I&#x27;ve tried. Hopefully, like so many Frieda products, they don&#x27;t discontinue it!</li>
            <li> very gradual, natural looking lightening.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about this product, I decided to check it out.  When I read the label, I realized that it&#x27;s basically the same thing as Sun-In, which has been around forever (and costs a whole lot less!).  The main ingredient here is Hydrogen Peroxide, which will severely damage your damage your hair (why do you think the makers of permanent hair color brag about their ammonia-free, peroxide-free products?) I honestly can&#x27;t believe that John Frieda has stooped this low and produced a product like this.  I&#x27;ve used their color enhancing shampoos and conditioners for a while, with excellent results, and I thought this was something that would supplement those two products, but I&#x27;d never use this because I remember what Sun-In did to my hair!  This isn&#x27;t magic or some miracle product -- it&#x27;s peroxide mixed with some fragrance.  If that&#x27;s the result you desire, save your money &amp; buy a bottle of peroxide and mix it with some water -- you&#x27;ll get the same results!  Just know that eventually, your hair will feel like straw or sandpaper, and will probably end up badly damaged (and if your hair is darker to begin with, don&#x27;t be surprised if your hair is more orange than blonde!)</li>
            <li> Blends nicely and provides just the right about of natural blond highlighting.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product with the accompanying shampoo and conditioner for about two weeks, and i can say that it has completely destroyed my hair. I&#x27;m naturally a caramel blonde so i figured i could create an ombre look by spraying my tips heavily and taper off towards the root. My naturally soft and shiny hair has literally turned to straw. I STRONGLY advise anyone against this spray..spend the money and see a professional stylist, Lightening should not be done at home</li>
            <li> This product contains Hydrogen Peroxide which will dry your hair out and IT WILL break off at the root...I know, because I had it happen..DO NOT spray this stuff on your head!!!</li>
            <li> I have natural medium to dark blonde hair. Since I havn&#x27;t been going out much this past year, my hair started to become duller and appear darker than usual. Even after the first use I could see a difference in how shiny and bright my hair was. I wasn&#x27;t looking to get bleach blonde hair and this product works well for what I really wanted. I used it 5 times and I have achieved my desired color. I think I will continue to use it once a month to maintain my hair.  In terms of use, I sprayed it after towel drying my hair and followed by blow drying and straightening my hair with a flat iron. Works Great. I think this is a better alternative to the very popular sun-in spray for your hair. If you have brown hair, be wary... It advises to not use it on any brown hair, but I know that it does work on some lighter shades. But overall, this is great for blondes looking to go blonder. Enjoy :-)  Edit: Since writing my review, I&#x27;ve read several new reviews about people literally losing their hair from using this product. If I had read about that before buying, I probably would have reconsidered. I personally have not had any problems with this product, but I guess it depends on the individual. Also, I have not even finished my first bottle and I&#x27;ve had it for a very long time now; I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my hair and I try not to overdo it when spraying. Anyway, beware.... don&#x27;t just read the good reviews when considering a product filled with peroxide and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> Overall I really loved this product!!! It did exactly what I wanted to do...which was to lighten my hair in a cheap efficient way. I have naturally blonde hair...but during the winter my hair gets extremely dark due to the lack of sunlight. I noticed results after just one use and significant results after 3 uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I gave this product 4 instead of 5 stars was because I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of the product. It was horrible, but it was pretty pungent. Also, I recommend not using this product before you&#x27;re planning to have a night on the town...it made my hair very crunchy and kind of oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product though!!! Gets the job done!</li>
            <li> This product is a MUST have for summer. I am a natural red head and my hair has progressed from a strawberry blonde to a darker red over the years. I wanted a little oomph for the summer so I grabbed this off the store shelf and gave it a shot. After 3 consecutive uses, BAM, I have my strawberry blonde back. One pointer I would like to share to make the product go further is to spray SB/GB on your roots mainly and then rub product throughout your hair and follow with combing it through your hair for even distribution. I have very long hair (past my shoulder blades) and by rubbing the product throughout my hair with my fingers, it makes the product go further. The smell is nice too. :)  The more heat you use, the better the product works so if you want to lighten quickly, blow dry and straighten with a flat iron.  I have gotten more compliments on my hair since using this product. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a little summer sunshine effect for their doo.</li>
            <li> I love it, I&#x27;m using the shampoo, conditioner and spray. It&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job!!! I&#x27;m starting to really notice that my hair is getting lighter. I have very dark blond hair, to the point it almost looks brown except in the sun. After 2 weeks of this stuff, my hair is really becoming getting blonder without the sun!!!</li>
            <li> (Please see my 4 before and after photos at the top!) Let me start off by saying, my NATURAL hair color is medium brown.I have a random spot on my head that grows out dark blonde, so to mix that in, I highlight. I&#x27;ve been doing this basically since I graduated higschool 20 years ago!  So tired of the upkeep and cost.  My last highlight was 6 weeks ago and I measured 2 inches of what looked like black roots compared to the highlights showing thru. Looked TERRIBLE! I was so not ready to spend 2 1/2 hours and $150 at the salon again, so I picked this up after reading the positive reviews.  It says right on the box FOR BLONDES ONLY, not suitable for medium - dark brown hair. I was so nervous, I didn&#x27;t want orange hair! But I thought if worse comes to worse, I will go buy a box of brown incase I needed to quickly correct the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just sprayed it to my roots and bangs, blew dry and then I use a hot iron on my bangs.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the subtle difference already!  I didn&#x27;t notice any smell to the product, but it did make my hair feel slightly thicker and stickier where it would not hold curl in the ends even though I didn&#x27;t spray on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;I conditioned with a deep conditioner the next day and did it again.  Turned a little brassy, but only in certain lights. I def. wouldn&#x27;t call it orange.  I took a day off and then tried one final time to get that brassy a little lighter. I&#x27;m shocked, I basically have golden hair.  Again, in certain lights I feel like its a little on the reddish/brassy side, but in natural light it looks good and blonde.  My hair feels great. I cont. to use a deep conditioner and I never sprayed it on my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to try this, I would NEVER recommend it for brunettes that have no blonde at all in their hair. I think you will be very disappointed, or if you try it, try on the underneath layers or something so when it does go thru the brassy stage, you wont hate it as much.  I would also not recommend if your hair is not used to blowdrying daily, don&#x27;t use this daily. My hair usually naturally air dries and the 2 days I blew it dry, my ends took a toll and I didn&#x27;t even use anything on the ends, it is simply from the blow dryer.  Don&#x27;t over do it, you WILL see a difference.  Take some days off, use deep conditioner to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today 2 days after my 3rd treament, my hair looks and feels great! When I went back and looked at my before picture, I was floored! I can&#x27;t believe I walked around like that for weeks. Yuck~! My hairdresser I&#x27;m sure will show her displeasure over it, of course she will...she will prob tell me its terrible for your hair or whatever, she wants her 4-5 x a year $150 from me!  I will be curious to see what this looks like when it grows out a little....I will certainly have to highlight my hair professionally again, but hopefully not as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks John Frieda!!! You Rock!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Ok, so a few days have gone by since I did my 3rd treatment...several trips to the pool..not thinking to wear a hat only a visor..MISTAKE! Know how the sun turns your hair golden..guess what it does for this stuff when you don&#x27;t realy want it to? ORANGE-RED-BRASS! yucko. I&#x27;m devastated...doesn&#x27;t change my review for the product, just note to others...protect your hair in the sun if you are out.  I&#x27;ve tried purple shampoo..nothing, maybe made it worse, now I have a L&#x27;Oreal Brass Bansiher on and I think it worked, took out most of the blonde I worked so hard to get, but something had to be done so I didn&#x27;t look like a rodeo clown!  This is why I pay good money for a salon...so things like this don&#x27;t happen, oh well, you live and learn right!used to blowdrying daily, don&#x27;t use this daily. My hair usually naturally air dries and the 2 days I blew it dry, my ends took a toll and I didn&#x27;t even use anything on the ends, it is simply from the blow dryer.

            <li> I only used this TWO TIMES. And I have just a little bit left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I honestly don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve used it a third time - my hair is noticeably lighter. I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend died my hair for me (first time EVER) and it looked okay...until the roots made it look terrible. After a while, I couldn&#x27;t take looking at it &amp; went to the salon. For nothing but highlights (no styling), I paid $90. I had a hard time parting with that $90.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have this, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be going to get my hair done any time soon. My hair is naturally dark ash blonde and it&#x27;s now a bright golden blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, though...the bottle doesn&#x27;t last too long, but I could buy nine of these (from Wal-mart) for one salon visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be curious to see when I have to buy my next bottle...</li>
            <li> My blonde hair gradually turned to brown after having kids.  Expensive highlights were my only option to maintain any  sort of blonde color and even with that I didn&#x27;t have  any real control over how blonde I went.  Found this product and  WOW!!! after one use I could see a subtle lightening (not orange).    After two my friends asked who lightened my hair because they loved it.    So excited that I have an inexpensive and super easy way to control  my roots and color!  I took the risk b/c my hair is brown  but it worked perfectly!  Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I am a natural blond. Over the years my hair has gotten a bit darker. Using this for two weeks along with their shampoo and conditioner and my normal blond locks are back.</li>
            <li> My naturally blonde hair gets extra blonde in the summer as I spend so much time in the sun, this product is great for fall/winter so I can ease my hair into a slightly darker shade without looking like I dye my hair and have roots growing in!</li>
            <li> I began using this sporadically over the summer, and I loved how light my hair got from minimal use.  However, a couple months in, the color dulled considerably, and my hair got SUPER dry and started breaking/splitting like crazy.  I immediately stopped using it, but the damage was already done.  I haven&#x27;t used it in a month or so, and my hair is still a complete mess. I have tiny hairs sticking straight up on top of my head, from the damage, and I can barely get a brush through my once healthy hair.  I highly advise anyone thinking about using this product to think twice.  Yes, it lightens hair, but at a tremendous cost to overall hair health.</li>
            <li> I used to be blonde when I was a kid, but when I grew up my hair turned light brown. I&#x27;ve always wanted to lighten up my hair color a little bit, but I&#x27;ve never died my hair cause I don&#x27;t want to damage it. Sun In is supposedly really bad for your hair, and then I found this. In just one application it went a lot blonder, but blonde enough. I spray every 3 weeks or so and my hair is perfect! Color is beautiful, and everybody thinks it&#x27;s just my natural hair color. I get so many compliments! Don&#x27;t hesitate and do it. Way better than going to the saloon every month and spending lots of money.</li>
            <li> This product is a game changer!  It really works. I lighten my hair and often between coloring it turns a little brassy. I spray it on and it lightens my hair a little, makes it less brassy and gives it shine.  It also lightens my roots a little.</li>
            <li> My hair naturally is a dark blonde. In the summertime it still gets super blonde. However I go to a salon every 5 weeks to get blonde highlights. It&#x27;s expensive, and the week or two before I get my highlights done my roots need a boost. I bought this spray to attempt to keep the roots lightened before a salon visit, and mom was right!! it turned my hair ORANGE!! Be careful when using this product - it contains peroxide which can result in orange locks. I am not sure how it works for non-treated hair, could be helpful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand why this product has so many great reviews.  I&#x27;m a darker blonde and I was excited to try a product that would gradually lighten my hair to my desired lightness but alas it failed.  I found it to be just like Sun-in in that it would make my hair an orange color.  Now I have to go to a salon and get it fixed.  I would not recommend this product to anyone trying to save a few bucks getting your hair lightened or between coloring.  Go to a professional and get it done right.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. However, I didn&#x27;t use it as the directions instructed. I applied argon oil to the places I wanted lightened, then I sprayed where I put the oil. (I put the oil down first to protect my hair because it&#x27;s pretty thin). Then I sat out in the sun for about an hour and I saw good results. I used it again and my hair has really lightened. I&#x27;m a light brunette for those who are wondering!</li>
            <li> I saw results after two uses.  I got a lot of compliments from people asking me if it was my natural hair color. I wouldnt use it all over because that gives you an unnatural look.  Better to use like you would if you were getting highlights so you have a more dimensional look.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> perfect i highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it didnt turn my hair orange unlike the others&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only reason am giving it 4 strs is because the size its really small i wish if there was a larger</li>
            <li> I have healthy, relatively thick hair just past my shoulders that is dirty blonde. Which is perfect for salon highlights. However, I can only afford partial highlights, the upkeep &amp; cost on a full head foil is just too expensive &amp; time consuming. Not to mention, foil highlights on the underside of dirty blonde hair, to me, looks a bit tacky. Streaks of blonde on dark hair, ugh.  I have a great colorist that does a super job with the top and sides of my hair. I started to use this product for the underside, around the nape of my neck, so my dirty blonde hair would be a touch lighter but a more natural, less streaky, less &#x27;foiled in a salon&#x27; look. This product worked perfectly for that. I don&#x27;t use it all the time, just a little at a time, just on the underside of my hair that never gets foiled. My young teen daughter got a few natural highlights this summer from the sun - she too has dirty blonde hair - so I used just a tiny bit of this all over her hair, just to make it fresh and summery. Turned out perfect. They key is to use it in moderation and not on processed hair.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday. Keeps my level 5 brown roots at bay between coloring.</li>
            <li> I agree, this product should only be used once or twice.  John Frieda should be ashamed of this product.  After 6 uses, I started to loose hair at the roots. Not just a small amount.  Months after I have stopped using it, my hair is still damaged and I am left with a sticky film where I had sprayed it. (my roots) Nothing is removing the sticky film.  Horrible product and I have told everyone that i know NOT to use it. A one star rating is too generous.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde and this stuff gives me the extra summer blonde glow I love. It takes a couple uses to see a difference which I love because it isn&#x27;t drastic. Heat makes a difference. Make sure you blow dry after spraying it on or it won&#x27;t work. Would def recommend.</li>
            <li> it worked very well for my hair and i can only say the only thing i dislike about the product itself is it is VERY drying for your hair so if you use it make sure you condition like crazy! my hair felt like straw after each use. i used alot of conditioner and added leave it treatment afterwards also</li>
            <li> I purchased this product last summer and used it for a few months. It definitely lightens your hair, however it also totally RUINS it. I am still severely paying for it 9 months later. My hair is totally broken and damaged. My  hairstylist said that she has never seen anything like it. I&#x27;m using the most expensive conditioners and leave-in products and doing the best I can to help it recover. I have ordered from Amazon many many times but never felt a need to leave a review until this product. There is not a product out there, hair, skin, face, etc.. that has caused this kind damage...</li>
            <li> I have brown hair and before using this product, I had been coloring my hair to blond every month. Because of the constant coloring, my hair dried out really fast. My brown roots were starting to show about 1 inch! It looked terrible so I decided to try this spray. After one use my hair was noticeably lighter and you could no longer see the obvious line in my hair. After 3 uses, my brown roots are completely blond! I didn&#x27;t want to use a hair straightener on my already damaged hair so instead I sprayed it on my dry roots and then brushed the serum into my roots as well as down into my already blond hair. Then I went over it with a blow dryer. Even though I didn&#x27;t use a strong heat, the spray still worked perfectly. This product also did not dry out my hair! I no longer have to deal with damage to have great looking blond hair. I will definitely be using this product in the future!</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark blonde hair with some red and ash undertone to it... so basically every color in my hair. I&#x27;m always skeptical.to use any lightening products for fear of going that horrid brassy color. I bought this at a local store (less expensive here on amazon by the way) and used it as directed only two times so far. I have received at least a dozen compliments on my hair in the last week. This product somehow picks up on natural highlights in hair and makes them glow and shine. It&#x27;s amazing. It also smells great! Directions indicate that it should be used with dyed hair, but I used it on my natural hair and it works wonders. Perfect for that extra oomph to prepare for summer. Love it!</li>
            <li> I began using this product around November 2011 and LOVED it! It was so easy to use, I loved the color it gave me, and it saved me tons of money because I didn&#x27;t have to visit the salon! I went from November to February without highlighting my hair. And then...my hair started FALLING OUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first noticed the breakage after my first highlight in the salon during the use of this product. It was right before my wedding so I absolutely freaked out. I have long blonde hair that I&#x27;ve worked really hard to grow out and my wet hair was stretching out and breaking mid-shaft, about 2 inches from the root. And it wasn&#x27;t any ordinary breakage - the hair bounced back and ended up winding back all kinky and destroyed and DOES NOT blend in with my other hair so it&#x27;s impossible to hide. I blamed my hairstylist for all of this. I had to cut off the broken ends because they were ruined, as if they had been singed or burned. So I got a mullet. 2 weeks before my wedding. And the broken parts from then are still not grown out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the go blonder spray after that and I changed up my shampoo but I did cheat maybe once and use the spray about 4 weeks after my highlight debacle. Then I went to a completely different, super-expensive fancy salon and told them to take my hair darker because I had had some breakage after my last highlight and I didn&#x27;t want it to be bleached out anymore. Low and behold, after dying my hair with darker hair color, the breakage began happening en masse. This was worse than the first time - it MELTED away in my hands. I could take the strands of my hair and stretch them like rubber bands. I went to a hair specialist and told him what had happened and he informed me that the Go Blonder Spray was the problem. It had stripped my hair of not only the pigment, but all of the protein as well. There is nothing left of the hair that I used it on. It is an empty, dead shaft of a follicle and he told me what hasn&#x27;t fallen out will eventually fall out. I look like a complete idiot with big chunks of hair missing and I have to use pins to hold it back every day. I have a long way to go and probably will not be able to use color of any kind on my hair until the areas I used the Go Blonder spray have completely grown out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just came to Amazon to see all of these other people are having exactly the same problem. Which makes me feel better because I was worried I had some sort of vitamin deficiency, but it also makes me feel worse because before I used this product all of the Amazon reviews were good. I guess time DID tell what actually happens. Unbelievable that this product has obviously not been tested!! It should be recalled immediately! Please heed this warning and don&#x27;t use it!y fall out. I look like a complete idiot with big chunks of hair missing and I have to use pins to hold it back every day.

            <li> I LOVE this product! I noticed a change after the very first use &amp; my hair has continued to get lighter with each use. I have had so many people comment on how blonde my hair has gotten. It is super easy to use and can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li> This product fried my hair. I can&#x27;t even brush through it! If you have ever colored or bleached your hair I would not use this product!!! It did work well on my sons hair though:)</li>
            <li> Love this product! Very easy to apply and it lightens my hair perfectly. I&#x27;m a natural blond and this product lightens my hair in such a way that, while my hair is much blonder after ~5-10 applications, it still looks natural :-) Definitely recommend if your looking for an easy, non-dramatic way to make your hair just a little bit lighter!</li>
            <li> I used Sun-In after Clairol stopped making the liquid gold formula Touch Of Sun. Sun-In was one of the worst things you can use on your hair and didn&#x27;t come out until I grew my hair and cut it all off-which was a painful two year process. I used this product along side the shampoo and conditioner and saw results possibly because of all three and heavy sun exposure. My hair was noticeably lighter and not brassy-it was not straw like-the way my hair used to get when using Sun-In.     There are some issues with it. Peroxide is the main ingredient in this formula, along with some more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; lightening ingredients. The product also says it should be used with heated tools like a blow dryer, curling iron or flat iron for the greatest lightening effects. I do not use heated tools very often, and being in the sun helped me so this may not be overly necessary.    My hair is also more dry when using this product, but that could be associated with using the shampoo and conditioner along with this spray-I do not consider the shampoo or conditioner to be very high quality or hydrating. I had a cellophane and lanse-sa treatment to try to mitigate these effects and began using more hair masks.     My advice is to try it but talk to a hair stylist/colorist before doing so. Additionally-this usually retails for only about $10 at most stores I have been to, so shop around before you buy here.    If anyone would like a better comparison between this and Sun-In-just leave a comment and I will try to help!</li>
            <li> For those of you writing reviews of this product after just a few uses....I bought this product because I was excited that it might let me go longer between colorings.  I also trusted john frieda products because I&#x27;ve used the sheer blonde shampoo and conditioner for years. In the beginning, It did lighten my hair, but was similar to, but a little more subtle than &#x27;sun in&#x27;s&#x27; orangish tone.  At first I was semi-pleased with the results.  However, after finishing the first bottle of this product my hair began to snap off at the roots/part leaving 1-2 inch pieces.  I suppose i really should have known better..the instructions say, \\&quot;the more heat you use, the greater the lightening effects.  Plus it contains hydrogen peroxide.  Apparently, peroxide lightens the hair to a lighter shade by breaking down the melanin in the hair shaft. Peroxide also weakens the hair shaft, eventually leading to extreme breakage.  This product completely destroyed my healthy long blonde hair.  Even after discontinuing use of the product a few months ago, my hair continued to break off at the roots.  I now have a mohawk for a part!  :(  At times I even have to wear &#x27;top piece wigs&#x27; to disguise the mohawk part/extreme breakage.  I wish I never would have bought/trusted this product!  I hope my review helps others to not make the mistake of buying it, like I did.  Please, if you want to keep your long healthy hair, STAY AWAY from this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak highly enough of this product. I have naturally medium brown hair, but I&#x27;ve dyed it almost all shades imaginable over the last four years, so I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how my hair would handle it. I use it on the rare occasion when I heat-style my hair, but mostly when I will be outside in the sun during the day. It has created amazing, natural-looking highlights. It&#x27;s a fraction of the price of going to the salon, you have complete control over where you apply it, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like traditional salon highlights do. I love love love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already blonde, but I use this stuff to maintain my summer hair.  It works pretty well in a few usages.  My main complaint is that it can irritate your skin a little bit.  Not a ton, but if you get it on your hands, I would recommend washing it off immediately to avoid any discomfort.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my scalp, just my hands.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lightens my hair subtley.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you are not a natural blonde as it lightens quite well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using too much ammonia/bleach on my hair, but sometimes I feel like highlighting parts of it. My scalp is pretty sensitive, so I don&#x27;t want to mess around with all of that bleach.&lt;br /&gt;In comes Go Blonder Lightening Spray.&lt;br /&gt;Now, a couple of things you should know:&lt;br /&gt;• Remember good ol&#x27; Sun-In? (I know, it&#x27;s still around) It&#x27;s like that. Don&#x27;t expect too much of a difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The product directions specify to use it with as much heat as possible. Let me explain that, if that looks suspicious or annoying, or you simply don&#x27;t understand: This is actual bleach, just in a different application method and a bit weaker than pure extreme bleach that would whiten your hair in no time. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;gradual&amp;#34;, kind of. The thing is that bleach works with heat, and that&#x27;s why in hair salons they use aluminum foils on your hair with lightening, because it traps the moisture in and creates warmth (kind of like a sauna for your strands). Now, with this, you don&#x27;t need to use foil or anything, just use direct heat (that&#x27;s also why Sun-In probably didn&#x27;t work for you sometimes — it&#x27;s a bit of a gamble when you&#x27;re just &amp;#34;going out in the sun&amp;#34;, how would you know how scorching it&#x27;s going to be?)&lt;br /&gt;So remember, using heat is just like they do at the salon, just.. Simpler, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The reason it says &amp;#34;controlled lightening&amp;#34; is because it&#x27;s not as strong as a salon. Don&#x27;t expect immediate results, or going from black to blonde with this. That amount of lightening should really be done professionally, just so you don&#x27;t end up with fried orange hair (lightening black or dark brown hair would cause redness, unless done professionally and, preferably, gradually)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Some people have been complaining that this ruins their hair, fries it, etc. Once again, guys, THIS IS BLEACH. Don&#x27;t use it so sparingly as to ruin your own hair. Would you throw bleach on your hair every day and expect it to be fine? Think about that. Also, using hot tools isn&#x27;t best for your hair, so don&#x27;t do it all too much.&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve mentioned before, if you&#x27;re in for a big change and can&#x27;t wait to use it all up to get that blonde look, I&#x27;d recommend seeing a professional at least once, for that first major change. Don&#x27;t count on a little spray bottle all that much, you know?&lt;br /&gt;Using too much bleach obviously would ruin your hair, but you guys know that, you just probably never thought about this as bleach. It&#x27;s like putting too much bleach on your white clothes. A little bleach would brighten them and bring back the shine and cleanliness, and a ton would probably cause damage to the fabric, because it&#x27;s such a harsh substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this product, with all considerations included in my recommendations.

            <li> Cut off some of my hair since I was going from long to short hair. Experimented with that. It made the hair very brittle and dry (even with conditioner left on it) and I could never tell a difference in color. SO glad I didn&#x27;t put it in my hair, it would have wrecked it for no result.</li>
            <li> So i bought this product because my naturally dirty blonde hair started to get darker as i got older, becoming more of a light brown. Although this product did lighten my hair and bring out the blonde, it can also greatly damage your hair. One of the ingredients in it is hydrogen peroxide, which doesnt really bring out the blonde, but actually just turns the hair blonde. It is not healthy for the hair, despite what the label says. I&#x27;ve stopped using this product, as i am looking for something that will bring out my existing natural highlights. If you still want to try this product, beware: it will damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Ruins your hair, causes extreme breakage. Wish I could give this negative stars, it is hard to believe that this is even allowed to be sold. I will never trust any john frieda products again!!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally blond and I use this every time I blow dry my hair. It makes me feel like my hair maintains the color that I have. However, I&#x27;m not too sure that it really brightens your hair.</li>
            <li> I applied 2 times this product in my hair and I can see the difference. It is lighter.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  The directions say use 10x between colorings which for me averages out to about once per week.  On that timeline, I saw no results. If you use this product more than once a week to once every other week it WILL severely damage your hair.  I was using every third washing (wash my hair 3-4x per week) and after about four months, while the hair was certainly lightened, it started to clearly show signs of damage.  The best way I can describe it is how a cotton ball looks and feels when you stretch it, that plying and breaking.  After a good 3 months of that, my hair has simply broken off where the product was used (which if you&#x27;re like me, you spray it on your roots so this breakage is less than 1&amp;#34; away from your scalp, not cute).  Luckily for me I only used it along my hair line and along my main part, so now I can just style my hair accordingly to hide the breakage, but had I know this would be the results I absolutely never would have purchased.</li>
            <li> I must admit that had I read the reviews on this product prior to purchase, I don&#x27;t think I would have bought it.  It was a spur of the moment purchase and I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  However, having read through the negative reviews, I will say that I probably have sturdier hair than most -- it&#x27;s thick and naturally curly (i.e., frizzy) and I have put more on it than a little peroxide spray in the past 20+ years, so this was not anything more damaging than I have tried in the past. I normally keep my dark ash blonde hair highlighted but haven&#x27;t had time to get to the salon lately so most of my highlights were gone and my hair was a lot darker than I&#x27;d like.  Overall my hair is probably 1/4-1/2 shade lighter (a little more on the ends where some highlighting was left), and so far, no brassiness.  It does leave my hair a tad stiff though so I will probably wash it again tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I use this every day?  Absolutely not.  It&#x27;s something I would use on occasion (maybe 1 time a month) while I&#x27;m between salon appointments.  Yes, it does have peroxide in it so if you&#x27;re not sure, do a strand test beforehand.  I also wouldn&#x27;t use it on roots if you&#x27;re sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li> Personally I love this product! I have not had any breakage as a direct cause of it. I will say I have learned not to use a straightner after using the product. If I do, I will to the top of my hair, never the ends. I normally just use my hairdryer or no heat at all and it works just fine! Even then I never spray it on the ends of my hair. If you do I would highly suggest putting a cream or leave in conditioner afterwards to avoid damage. Any lightening treatment has potential to cause damage to your hair, I see it as common sense to take care of it and make sure your hair is taken care of. If you do that this product should work wonders!</li>
            <li> This product is awful! After a few uses it seems wonderful, but just wait! This product fried my hair and it literally all broke off the top of my head. It has been over a year since I stopped using this product and my hair has not fully recover. My best friend, mother, and co-worker all had the same issues! My friend literally had a Mohawk of broken hair that wasn&#x27;t even an inch long for months! Please please do not use this.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years with good results.  I never use it too often and I have not noticed any damage caused by the product.  It adds some nice, natural-looking brightness for people like me who are not interested in &amp;#34;going for it&amp;#34; and getting full salon highlights.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, sincerely I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter use this product  for long time and is very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This product did the job! And for the negative reviews saying it&lt;br /&gt;Cause their hair to fall out or break, I say this... This is a BLEACHING&lt;br /&gt;Product. You HAVE to use a deep conditioner after every use or of&lt;br /&gt;COURSE your hairs gonna get damaged! I recommend Redken&lt;br /&gt;Deep Conditioner for dry, damaged hair. Ive used this product for two&lt;br /&gt;Weeks now and not a SINGLE fried hair and I&#x27;m almost done. So&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, be smart, don&#x27;t kill your hair thinking there&#x27;s a lightening&lt;br /&gt;Product out there that doesn&#x27;t MAGICALLY kill your hair. Condition it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got dark blonde hair with subtle natural highlights - some would say the color is dishwater blonde/mousey, which is obviously not the look I&#x27;ve been longing for.  So tired of taking time out of my days to visit the salon only to shell out hundreds of dollars for minimal results, I decided to give the John Frieda Sheer Blonde Go Blonder Lightening Spray a try.  *Note: I did not read the reviews prior to purchasing.  This was merely a discovery in my supermarket that I was going to experiment with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I came home and pulled this baby out of the bag and jumped in the shower (very excited!) to ensure the product would have a clean, consistent application on freshly washed hair.  Towel dried and combed out, I began spritzing my entire head of hair with this stuff, even flipping my head over to get the underside, and followed with a brush to get rid of any chance of \\&quot;spotting\\&quot;..maybe it&#x27;s paranoia, but a bad color job is on of my greatest fears.  Not wanting to over-process, I decided not to use a blow dryer or straightener and headed outdoors for the heating method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting in the sun for an hour on a hot summer day did the trick, but my hair most definitely felt different compared to before using this product.  It was similar to straw and felt weak.  Perhaps I over did it on the spray initially.  Also, I do not wash my hair daily, so maybe the shampoo mixed with using this stuff was a mistake due to lack of natural oils as protection.  The color, however, was much brighter and even shiny - strange considering the lack of moisture in my hair.  A sun kissed look was achieved, and even with dry hair, I felt more radiant.  As the day progressed, my hair became increasingly stiff, almost like it could break if I ran a brush through it forcefully.  This scared me, as I usually have very healthy hair.  Second trip to the store to buy It&#x27;s a 10 leave-in conditioner and hair mask left me feeling like there was hope, like maybe this product could work for me if the necessary precautions were taken.  I decided to apply my hair mask early the next morning followed by the leave-in conditioner and opted out of brushing my hair.  With a few scrunches of my natural waves, I could tell this was not where I wanted my hair to be.  I donned a loose top knot that day to avoid further damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another day had passed, and another application of It&#x27;s a 10 hair mask was applied followed by the leave-in conditioner.  Alas, I was able to brush my hair!  Still no blow dryer usage, as I was not back to 100% yet.  At this moment, I decided it&#x27;s best to only use this product MAYBE once a week if applied to healthy hair and all styling tools are avoided for 48 hrs.  Once achieved color is reached, I&#x27;d suggest only using once every 3-4 weeks.  Anyhow, my hair did recover.  And I did reapply this product to not so newly washed hair followed by my hair mask and leave-in the following morning, also avoiding all hair styling accessories for 24 hrs.  This helped a lot, and by the third application (took three weeks to get there!), I can say that I&#x27;m satisfied with the color of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is still a ton of product left in the bottle, so I&#x27;m really happy with the bang for my buck.  Now aware of how to treat this spray and prepared for the pampering that is needed after application, I am happy with the overall results.  This is a great spray if you know how to read signs of damaged hair and take precautionary measures.  I don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll need to reapply for at least three weeks, which should give my locks some time to recover. :)  Be careful and take your time!</li>
            <li> Never use this product. I used to have beautiful light brown wavy hair. After one bottle of this, my hair is horribly frizzy and out of control curly. I absolutely hate my hair now and using this product was literally the worst decision I&#x27;ve ever made. I wish that I could reverse it...</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works very well.  Tends to leave hair tips a bit dry but a little olive oil takes care of that.  Nice, natural looking color.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than Sun-In, because it can be used on color-treated hair.  I use ash blonde color on my hair but sometimes want to brighten it up a bit more.  Sun-In cannot be used on color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the reviewers who say a warning should appear on the bottle, cautioning against using it too often.  So far, I haven&#x27;t experienced any damage from using this spray, but I went on YouTube and saw some of the reviews there.  All the girls who posted their reviews said the same thing.  DO NOT use too often or your hair will suffer damage.  Use it gradually, like once or twice a month, not a week.  And, keep your hair well conditioned to prevent breakage and damage.  Another word of caution.  I wouldn&#x27;t use \\&quot;Go Blonder\\&quot; shampoo, conditioner, and the lightening spray, together.  It&#x27;s too much bleaching and can cause damage.  Use a different shampoo and conditioner when using the lightening spray.  If you&#x27;re trying for platinum blonde, go to a salon where there are professionals who know what they are doing.  Sure, it&#x27;s expensive, but wigs cost a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use hair products responsibly, they will work for you.  Especially color and bleaching products.  Otherwise, they will work against you and the results can be devastating.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using hair dyes due to an allergy, and I figured that the only way to hide the few grays I have is to go blonde. My hair is naturally a light mousy brown, and this spray has taken my hair to a medium blonde after about 10 uses. It works with hydrogen peroxide and doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell...it actually smells clean and fresh. I spray it all over my hair after getting out of the shower, or if I&#x27;m touching up my roots, I just spray that area to avoid making the ends even lighter. It helps if you section your hair first, so you have smaller sections to work with, and you can spray this liberally over each section. Then, with the heat of the blowdryer, your hair gets lighter! On the box, it recommends using hot tools after blowdrying, such as a flat iron or curling iron, to intensify the effects. I would caution against this, as repeatedly doing this left my hair so dry, it broke off just above my ear in a one inch section. It has since grown back, but if your hair is already damaged, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this.  Also, the maximum times you should use it as recommended by the manufacturer is 10 times, so if you have dark hair, you wont get to blonde with this, but it will give you reddish tones. I have also used Sun-In which is very similar, and that seems to leave my hair in better condition, but doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as this does. I gave this 3 stars because while it does lighten, it&#x27;s harsh on the hair and you have to be very careful not to overdo it.</li>
            <li> Helps give my roots more color. Instead of it turning all dark. Has nice smell too and does not dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It DOES work even in dark hair !! My hair is medium brown and i used the John Frieda shampoo and the spray (once a week or every 2 weeks) it took 2 or 3 months for me to finish the spray bottle !! And i really saw results ! Ppl start to aks if i dye my hair ...&lt;br /&gt;I stopped mybe 3 months  or more and it still light !! It demages a little, but nothing crazy !!</li>
            <li> I am a strawberry blond and the gray hairs started showing clearly a few years ago.  So, I started using this every couple of months and the grey hair just looks blond and make nice natural highlights.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve lightened by darker blonde hair with peroxide previously, but figured i&#x27;d try this out and see if there is a difference.&lt;br /&gt;a lot of people complained about their darker blonde hair turning orange with this product, but i haven&#x27;t noticed that. rather my hair is becoming more golden light blonde. with just peroxide my hair went to more of a white blonde. if you don&#x27;t want to waste your money, just buy peroxide and google how to properly treat your hair with it. also with either treatment, definitely invest in a good protein based moisturizing conditioner like agadir moisture masque and this will help prevent some breakage. don&#x27;t over do the heat thing, it&#x27;s not really necessary. just lightly blow dry on the lowest setting and that is sufficient.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great for lightening hair that is already naturally blonde. Not sure how it might look on dark hair. Great product. We have been using this a couple of years now since it first came out. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through about a whole bottle of this, and I&#x27;m still not 100% on how I feel about it. It smells decent, but not great. The spray bottle works well and it&#x27;s easy to saturate my hair with it, but it&#x27;s also a very small bottle and I have a lot of hair. It didn&#x27;t a long time to go through a whole bottle and my hair didn&#x27;t lighten as much as I expected. Has it lightened some? Yes. I&#x27;ve gotten a couple comments. My hair was a darker blonde and it&#x27;s lightened up maybe a shade or two, but is very brassy looking. I&#x27;m hoping with some toner it will look better. I didn&#x27;t really want to have to do that which is why I did this instead of bleaching it, kind of wish I just bleached it. I haven&#x27;t noticed any damage from it, and use the shampoo and conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I looked in store for this EVERY WHERE. The day after I ordered it, I finally found it at Target! I will probably buy from there if I decide to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have natural medium blonde hair with salon highlights.  I had terrible breakage after only one use, and I was being cautious with the amount.  I wish I had seen the reviews earlier.  Very upset.</li>
            <li> cheaper way to do your own highlights why go to the salon and have to pay more when you can pick and choose where and when you want them all from your home</li>
            <li> I have the standard (not dyed) golden blonde hair and I have been using this product for a while just to lighten my roots (which always seem to be darker than the rest of my hair).  It works wonders and it makes my hair look just the perfect color I was wanting; however I did start to notice that my hair was getting frizzier (but I attributed it to Alabama humidity). Here was the real reason: when I went to my hair dresser, she was appalled by my frizzy hair.  She said that the color was nice, but my hair itself looked liked it had been bleached by someone who fell asleep on the job.  She actually begged me to stop using it, and told me if my roots bothered me that bad, I should get them professionally highlighted at the very most, 2x a year.  She told me my hair was frizzy because of the damage this had done to it, that this product literally made my hair look fried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love how my hair color looked when it was lighter; however, not at the expense of frizzy hair.  I would hesitate to recommend this to my friend, and would definitely tell her about my experience with it.  Everyone should talk to their hairdresser/stylist/salon before using this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is blonde but I like it to be really light.  Using this product with my blow dryer 1 or 2x a week keeps it super light and barely costs anything compared to the salon.  I also get complements on my color fairly often and I say &amp;#34;Thanks it costs about $7, it&#x27;s the best beauty secret.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Naturally I have very dark brown hair and I had recently gotten a few blonde highlights. I decided I was sick of my dark hair, to afraid to dye it, and not willing to go to a salon. So I purchased this. The results were amazing. After a week (considering I had dark brown hair) I had a caramel blonde. No yellow or orange at all. It worked faster when blow drying and straightening my hair because the heat made it activate quicker. I paired it with the Go Blonder shampoo and conditioner by John Frieda and it worked so well! I definitely recommend this product, especially if you naturally have a light brown to golden blonde color.</li>
            <li> Had to send it back; on-line description did not specify to use only on natural blondes...</li>
            <li> I have seen many BAD reviews complaining about it having peroxide in it, well SUN IN has the same thing and as a child I used peroxide and lemon juice to lighten my hair! i have a unique hair coloring because naturally it is dark blonde with platinum and red highlights..yeah, the stuff everyone pays 100.00 for mine is natural..I love john frieda products and I will continue to use this product. As long as you condition your hair and do not use everyday, you won&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> I had used this for months and was very pleased that it kept my dark roots at bay. After one bottle was gone, I bought another. I used 2 bottles in the span of a few months. One day I woke up and  my beautiful face framing bangs were gone! They were so short they stuck straight up in the air! They has probably been breaking off for weeks and I just hadn&#x27;t noticed. The entire crown of my head felt like I had dipped it in hot grease! My hair was burnt, crunchy, and literally snapped with the slightest touch. I had TONS of breakage all over my shoulders anytime I brush my hair. When I went in to her my hair retouched, my stylist wouldn&#x27;t even color my hair because it was so damaged! It&#x27;s been a year since my last bottle and my hair is just now returning to a normal length and strength. I had no idea the breakage was from this product until I picked up a box in the store today and it now said &amp;#34;10 USES MAXIMUM&amp;#34;. That warning was not on there before! This stuff is more harmful than just going to the salon and bleaching your hair. Beware!</li>
            <li> stay away from this! first few times are ok-then it starts to fray your hair then it just crumbles off! Like it has been singed by a match! I too thought I had found the answer to dark roots! Now I will have to wait a long time to get my long hair back-shocking product, it should be taken off the market!</li>
            <li> Yes this has hydrogen peroxide in it and lemons which are both known to damage hair! For those that have experience coloring/bleaching their hair and are trying to attain a great blond color. This product should not be used more then a few times because it will damage. I would also not recommend using it as a root touch up as it can cause breakage to new growth. I have light blond hair not naturally and I recently used an ash blond toner and my hair turned grey. This stuff helped so much!! With a clarifying shampoo and this stuff I was able to get out the purple/grey color. Gave me a beautiful blond color!</li>
            <li> I had my hair coloured and highlighted in April 2013.  I decided to use Go Blonder to touch up my routes and blend them into my coloured hair.  At first, I was thrilled with the results.  Last week, I went to my hair dress to have my highlights touched up.  After she washed out the colour, she was having a lot of difficulty trying to comb through my hair.  I offered to brush it out, and as I did, my hair just began to break right off.  It was as though someone had rubbed Nair Cream all over my head.  It was like chewing gum, and just disintegrated as I touched it.  I don&#x27;t think I have ever been so horrified, and I just sat there and wept in the salon.  I had to take over 6 inches off, and now I can barely come what little hair I have left.  I have had to spend a small fortune on protein treatments to try to stop my hair from all falling out.  It is so thin and brittle, it just keeps breaking off.  PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GAWD, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> The spray works okay to brighten bleached hair.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it. (To me it smelled like citrus and cat pee)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another downside of this product is that coloring hair darker will proof challenging later on.&lt;br /&gt;The areas that I treaded with this product couldn&#x27;t hold any permanent hair color.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It takes blonde hair and makes it a little blonder. Every time I get my hair cut, the stylist always looks at my hair and then asks me whether I color. When I tell them I use Blonder, they laugh and can&#x27;t believe what a great job it does. I use it about every 3 weeks or so, just on my roots, and it keeps me with a very natural looking blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative reviews on here are clearly from people who don&#x27;t understand the purpose of this product. It&#x27;s meant for blondes who want to be blonder. If it turns your hair orange, you aren&#x27;t blonde. You may have been a blonde child, and you&#x27;ve been coloring you hair for so long that you don&#x27;t realize you aren&#x27;t a blonde anymore, but face reality. You are no longer a natural blonde. This will not turn blonde hair orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will work on some brunettes.  Pretty much if your hair is naturally a cool tone brunette, it should work. But for anyone with warm tones, this will turn your hair orange, so stay away. It&#x27;s really hit or miss for brunettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the reviews of people who had their hair fall out all have one thing in common: they are mention how they are professionally coloring their hair AND using this product. Hair care 101 people: you shouldn&#x27;t use more than one lightning product at a time unless you are a professional! And you should probably try test patches to make sure your multiple coloring methods don&#x27;t do things like make your hair fall out!!  If you are getting your hair lightened professionally, it&#x27;s probably being bleached. And then if you use your own home bleaching product, I would be shocked if your hair didn&#x27;t fall out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product about every 3 weeks, just on my roots and have being doing so for years. I have never had any damage whatsoever from this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Loreal Golden Blonde for years, but lately my hair had a reddish, dull tint.  After just three uses of spraying it lightly on my roots and \\&quot;streaking\\&quot; it close to my face, I have shiny blonde hair.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I do not have blonde hair. I have pretty dark brown hair, however I do have some caramel highlights. I decided to try this on the sections of hair that are highlighted. I followed the instructions on the bottle closely. It states to spray it on damp hair and then blow dry and flat iron or curl afterwards. I did just this and saw the difference after one single use. It didn&#x27;t overdo it either, it gave me just the right amount of lightener I desired. I love being able to control exactly how much I use to lighten my hair. The bottle says it takes 7- 8 uses to see results, I saw results after the first time. This is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> This lightening spray is a quick and easy way to add a little \\&quot;blonde pizzazz\\&quot; to your hair style between visits to a salon.  The John Frieda brand name is one that I always trust to make a good product and this product has lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally golden blonde and I&#x27;ve never dyed or highlighted it in my life. I&#x27;ve used this product 7 times as directed, (sprayed onto towel dried hair and then applied heat by blow drying and straightening or curling) and I haven&#x27;t seen any results at all, and neither have my friends or family. I see more results just by going out in the sun for 1 day without having used any products. I wouldn&#x27;t recomend this product for natural, un-dyed blondes.</li>
            <li> Ever since graduating college and taking a full time 9-5 job, I&#x27;ve been concerned that I wouldn&#x27;t have enough day hours outside to get my hair to lighten up with it&#x27;s usual summertime highlights. Well, my fears were confirmed when I saw my grandpa few weeks ago, and he said to me &amp;#34;did you dye your hair? I remember you always being so much blonder!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s when I purchased this product. I just wanted my natural highlights that the sun gives me, rather than total lightening all over my head. So after I showered, I parted my hair as I normally style it and spritzed it only on the top layer of my hair, where the sun would normally hit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 4 uses, I noticed the highlights starting to show up. I used it a total of 7-8 times over a 2 week period and it got my hair to just the color I&#x27;m used to in the summer. I must say I love this product, and I still have about 2/3 of the bottle left for future use. And it prevented me from starting to get professional highlights done in the salon. Great!</li>
            <li> It works for me - then again, I was born a tow-head blond as a kid and stayed that way until my 40&#x27;s. Now, my medium brown hair will change quickly with this product, especially when I put it on and sit in the sun until it dries. It makes it a very light blond shade. I ONLY use it on the roots around the face and visible areas on top of my head - not on the whole head/hair! Will it work for a genetically born brown or black hair person?  Probably not!...without it turning red or brassy. Someone else in that situation is better apt to answer that. But for me, it does work.</li>
            <li> i use it along with Klorane Shampoo and got great results after about a week i used it. I had a very dark blonde color, since my hair wasn&#x27;t much exposed to sunlight for the last 2 years.. now i have a very pretty light blonde color and couldn&#x27;t be happier! The texture feels weird after you spray it on your hair, and it&#x27;s hard to brush hair while blow drying it, but it&#x27;s only until it gets completely dry, which is okay.</li>
            <li> Great product to lighten hair.</li>
            <li> I naturally have dark brunette hair, but I can&#x27;t help love how blonde brightens my face. I have only used this product once and noticed a lightening in my roots already. ( I have been told that my hair grabs on to color well -Just FYI if it doesn&#x27;t work THAT quickly for you ) If you go to the John Frieda Website, they have a great tutorial about how to use this product. My hairdresser is gonna lose money, but I will be saving a lot. The hydrogen peroxide definitely is what highlights the hair, but there are other protective oils,etc that make this product worthwhile to me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two years and am very happy with the results. I have medium blonde hair naturally and use this about twice a month. I spray it pretty heavily, concentrating on the roots and don&#x27;t have any issues with breakage or smell like some other products. I think it&#x27;s relatively gentle; not sure how light it will go. But I&#x27;m looking for a subtle brightening and it has served me well.</li>
            <li> Well, I got this product for my daughter who (like me) has dirty blonde hair. She has been trying it out for a few weeks, now, and has been seeing results. She doesn&#x27;t often blow dry her hair, but every time she does she has been using this treatment and her hair has been getting lighter. Now that her hair is actually lighter, she&#x27;s not sure she likes it as much as she thought she would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well! At least the stuff works!</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. If you want your hair to be healthy. DO NOT USE. I used this more multiple years not realizing what it was actually doing to my hair. I loved it at first but not my hair is dry damaged and there is so much breakage that has left me with short pieces of hair near the crown of my head. My hair is thin and looks horrible. I had to get several treatments to try and reverse some of the damage but nothing has worked. My hair dresser wanted to give me a bob because of how damaged my hair was. Please do yourself and me a favor and DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> I saw a commercial for this on tv and knew that I had to try it for myself.  I wasn&#x27;t too convinced that it would work since I used sun in when I was in junior high school and was scarred for life having to go at least a year with orange hair until it grew out.  I have naturally medium-dark ashy brown hair and I had been getting blonde highlights for the past year.  Last week I finally got root to tip color and naturally it wasn&#x27;t as light of a blonde as I had hoped for (obviously didn&#x27;t want my hair to fry off).  I have a darker strawberry blonde color now and I can&#x27;t wait to get it to to my goal of platinum blonde.  I tried this for the first time and immediately saw a lightening of the darker blonde in my hair.  I used it for the second time last night and my hair is even lighter yet.  The different blonde shades are starting to even out as well.  I love this stuff.  My hair also takes well to color so everyone&#x27;s results may not be the same.</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I first started it I had beautiful healthy hair, I thought I would never have to dye my hair again but boy was I SO wrong :( After about a month of using this I noticed my hair looked a little brassy so I told my fiance that I need to pick up some bleach for my hair. It all started out normal mixing up the bleach then applying it to my hair and I waited my normal amount of time. Then I hopped into the shower to wash it out and as I started to scrub CHUNKS started to fall into the tub, my long beautiful hair being swept down the drain!!! I got out and looked at my head and noticed that my hard literally MELTED off where I had applied that stuff (mostly on my part line) and what was left of the hair o n my head that had been sprayed lost ALL off its elasticity (the hair underneath was still healthy FYI)! I screamed or my fiance who, thank god, is so positive and understanding, and we started cutting off the hairs that were crispy and figuring out how to fix this. I still had hair left on my other side so I could pretty much do a comb over to conceal this catastrophe. But TRUST me it has been 6 months, an extremely short bob hair cut and lots of trims and my hair in places still feels crispy! I can not believe that John Frieda doesn&#x27;t state a warning on the bottle do not use if you bleach you hair :( I wrote this so noo girl or women has there hair melt off like mine did! TRUST ME IF YOU LOVE YOUR HAIR! Thank you for reading this!</li>
            <li> I chose this product prior to reading the many reviews that talk about how it damaged people’s hair.  I’m too leery to try it.  I have light brown hair with too much silver but used to spray and enjoy using Sunin when I was much younger however I’ve also had hair falling out experiences with other peroxide products in the past.  I couldn’t force myself to try this product after reading the dire warnings.</li>
            <li> After spending many hours and money in some of the top Hair Salons in Beverly Hills spending over $300 per visit, I have finally found a product to lightly lighten my roots on my own. I still go to the salon to get my hair high-lightened but now I only go every 3 months. I don&#x27;t use the product as directed. I actually put it on my hair at night before I go to bed. By the next morning my hair is a just a few shades lighter. Great way to save money and time.</li>
            <li> Follow directions closely. I only used it 3 times and got the full effect that I wanted so just pace yourself</li>
            <li> I am a little baffled at all the negative reviews on this product. Many people are stating this product ruined their hair, dried it out and made it very prone to breakage. Im guessing people are not reading the directions on the packaging before using. First off, your only suppose to use this once per wash. If you are applying this everyday without washing it will build up and become stronger and harsher on your hair. Also the packaging states to only use 10 times! Any more times after that makes your hair more your hair will be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally dirty blonde hair, with natural light blonde highlights. I havent been able to spend time in the sun this summer so i figured to get my summer light hair i would try this. I am so incredibly glad i did. My hair has become significantly lighter. Many people have noticed and complimented on it. It does tend to turn a bit orange but if you use a purple shampoo once a week with this it takes the orangeness out and reveals beautiful bright blonde hair. I havent noticed any damage with this product but i do deep condition twice a week so that might also help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only concern i have with this product is ive noticed i break out along the sides of my head, near my temple. This has only started when i began using this. This does bother me a little bit, but i still continue to use this lightening spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product. As a disclaimer, I have naturally dark golden blonde hair that looks much darker indoors. I have never dyed my hair before.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product intermittently about 8-9 uses now. I&#x27;m pretty happy with it because I see a noticeable difference in my hair. That being said, I only use a hair dryer to dry my hair and never a curling iron as it suggests. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of posts from unhappy people about how it damaged their hair but if you&#x27;re like me, never really use hair products, this will probably work for you</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it once a week, and maintain a natural blonde look all year round.</li>
            <li> I have natural dirty blonde hair. This product turned my hair yellow, not blonde. Be careful where you spray or you will end up with a helmet of shiny, yellow. I would go for the hi-lights if anything at all.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product along with the shampoo and conditioner. My hair is dyed blonde and I was looking for a more summer kissed look. After two applications; i could feel my hair was VERY upset with me. Following the instructions, I was amazed at how damaging this product is. I returned all three products. I would rather pay to get my hair done at a salon that to mess up my hair with this product.</li>
            <li> I had a color change recently. Having dyed my hair brown (which devolved into a blah faded brown mess), I dyed my hair back to my natural dark ash blonde. An improvement sure, but I needed highlights to punch the hair up a couple of notches.&lt;br /&gt;This is a spray on/stay on product. I went for an effect that is subtle. I had my friend mask large sections of hair and she sprayed this on the same areas I wanted blonder using a light spray. The effects were obvious but nothing over the top because I wasn&#x27;t going for a big difference. I&#x27;m stopping after four days and I am pleased with the change.&lt;br /&gt;As for the condition of my hair, the treated areas aren&#x27;t coarse, frizzy, or fried. I&#x27;m not certain if this product is somewhat mild because i did condition my hair every day.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to either get help when using this or try it on a small area that is not noticeable to see if it works before you do anything extreme.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described. Great!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lightening spray by far. I put it on my roots in the winter when I don&#x27;t get as much sunlight. As a naturally dirty blonde the John Frieda Spray is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t change your roots from dark to super blonde and unnatural. After a shower I spritz some on and use my hairdryer and after about 3 separate sets of that I can get my roots to match identically to the rest of my hair. I&#x27;m sure you could you it dry your hair, then reuse it again but I don&#x27;t want to fry my hair out. If you need an immediate and quick change then buy dye but if you just want to keep up with your roots every couple of showers or so a good spritz will keep your winter roots looking summer fresh.</li>
            <li> Jumped at this John Frieda product. After selecting this item I did further research and found issues with hair breakage. I made the choice I&#x27;d have more fun with a FULL head of hair than with blonde hair and hair breakage. I chose NOT to use this product after all.</li>
            <li> This did lighten my hair, but I am afraid to use too much of it.  After reading the other reviews about the damage this caused on their hair, I have decided to only use this once.  I have very fine hair and I don&#x27;t have very much of it.  I don&#x27;t want to damage or lose any of it.  But, it did work, so that is why I gave it 3 stars.  It does what it promises to do, it lightens your hair well.</li>
            <li> After my teen daughter experimented with some non permanent color, she decided to give this a try.  Her hair is a medium brown, curly, and short.  We sprayed this product on her hair about 5 times in two weeks.  We were sure the product didn&#x27;t touch the roots because it can really dry out the hair and didn&#x27;t use it one day after another.  The product worked really well on her hair.  She now has a shade lighter and really likes it.  Her hair is still healthy.  I definitely recommend to be careful with this.  Do not use it frequently and be sure not to spray the roots.  If possible, just let the sun do the job rather than a flat iron.  Do not use if your hair is dry o tends to break easily.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any change in my hair color. I&#x27;ve tried it multiple times</li>
            <li> Everyone at work compliments me on my hair color. I was born a platinum blond but as time goes by I&#x27;m more a dirty blond. A recent at home dye job left me a strawberry blond. (I was trying to go platinum)  this along with a blond shampoo that eliminates brassiness helped me achieve a more natural yellow blond. I was hesitant to use this as many people have had a terrible experience with it but so far it&#x27;s been about a month and I love it. Just don&#x27;t over use it!</li>
            <li> This product should be banned.  I recently dyed my hair blonde, and thought i&#x27;d try this product out between touch ups for my roots.  This product DOES work, however, it RUINS your hair in the process.  After using it for about 3 weeks I noticed my hair was feeling brittle and weak, so I stopped using it.  It was also turning my roots an orangey brassy color, which I went into the salon to have corrected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While at the salon the hairstylist asked what I had been using on my roots and when I told him he said putting bleach on this product would essentially make my hair break off at the roots, so instead he tried lifting the color with a toner instead of bleach.  It did make my roots less brassy but since I have noticed pieces of my hair that have broken off at the roots, and my long blonde hair is completely RUINED from this product.  Ask ANY hair stylist and they will tell you mixing this product with bleach will BREAK off your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There should be some type of warning on the bottle about this for those of us who get our blonde color from a box or salon.  I called the company to complain and the lady told me this product should only be used about 4-12 times because of the harsh chemicals used (it is basically straight peroxide) But it says this NOWHERE on the bottle.  If you are using this product DO NOT use it often, or discontinue use right away.  Seriously wish I never would have used this product.  My healthy long blonde hair is now brassy and breaking off due to this product and the only thing that will help it is time.</li>
            <li> As someone who has never dyed or high-lighted my hair before, this product worked magic to lighten my naturally dirty blonde hair (and for very little money!...compared to salon prices!. Thus far, I have used a full bottle of the spray and have started on a second one (though I will be going through that one much slower, as I have reached my desired tone). I have gotten a number of compliments from others on the results...especially how natural looking it turned out. My hair is much lighter and shinier now! I know that some customers have had complaints about their hair breaking off or being damaged, but I have been using it for about a month now and have experienced no negatives. My hair is naturally very thick and \\&quot;takes abuse well\\&quot;, according to my hair dresser who rarely finds damage from me blow drying or straightening my hair on a daily basis. In addition, I do not use this product every day. I used the spray approximately 3 times per week for 4 weeks and got exactly what I was hoping for out of it. I also purchased the Go Blonder shampoo and conditioner, but I did not and still don&#x27;t use that everyday either. I have been using a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (Aussie) in combination with the Go Blonder spray because I was afraid that the hydrogen peroxide would dry out my hair. I am positive that this product is not suitable for everyone, and seems to especially do terrible damage to those with dyed hair, but I have been extremely happy with the results I&#x27;ve received and would recommend it to friends who do not have dyed hair! :)</li>
            <li> This will literally fry your hair. I used this on my beautiful, virgin blonde hair.... Definitely lightened it but RUINED my hair. Dried it out so bad.... Again, I had virgin hair, not over processed hair. Don&#x27;t use this. You&#x27;ll regret it. Fork up the money and go to a salon and get some highlights where they can do damage control.</li>
            <li> i have been through two bottles in a couple of years. It brightens exactly as advertised. Difficult to just get the roots this way, because it tends to brighten highlights more quickly than darker blonde.</li>
            <li> This product is great for after washing your hair and then applying. You can use a hairdryer, curling iron or the sun and the results help keep your blonde hair radiant.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review for any consumer product in my life, but I have SUCH strong feelings about this one that I feel it my duty to warn you all.  Please believe me when I say (as others have said below me) that this product will RUIN your hair. As a natural dark blonde it was just lovely for the first 6 months or so of use.  I thought I&#x27;d found the solution to never having roots again.  After that time, however, my hair had had enough.  The texture started to completely unravel and it became rough and frayed, like it had been put through a paper shredder.  The frayed wet hair clung together like Velcro making it nearly impossible to brush through until dry.  Even with dry hair, the best straightener couldn&#x27;t completely mask it.  I stopped using it at this point, but even so, the damage was done.  I know now, after consulting with a stylist/colorist, that the product had basically destroyed almost all of the bonds in my hair and it was literally hanging by a thread.  This was also why my naturally curly hair had become board straight in the areas of greatest use (this freaked me out the most).  My hair had been stripped of all of its hair-like properties and was essentially mush.  My stylist said when cutting it that his shears were just helping the hair fall of where he wanted it to.  He cut as much of the damaged hair as he could off (mainly the top layers) without giving me a pixie cut, which left me with extremely short and choppy layers.  My hair was very long and thick prior to do this, so needless to say it was pretty upsetting.  It has been 5 months and a few haircuts and I am still not rid of the damaged hair.  It will probably be a solid year from when I stopped using it before it is gone completely.  Even when I am rid of it, it will take even longer to grow the layers out to a style I feel good about again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story - PLEASE do not use this product.  It is not worth it, believe me.  It should absolutely be taken off of the shelves for the damage it causes to healthy hair. I can&#x27;t believe John Frieda would continue to sell a product that is this severely damaging.</li>
            <li> This stuff works awesome I have dark blonde hair and wanted to lighten it a bit for summer time and being that I am pregnant I didn&#x27;t want to use anything strong or with harsh chemicals so I tried this out.  It worked great I noticed results the with the first dose.  I then did it again the next day and it got even more lighter.  I was surprised at how well it works.  Its good because you can do it in a series of applications to get the exact color you want.  I was afraid it would lighten my hair to much at first but it didn&#x27;t. And it wont fry you hair I have thin fine hair and was worried about that but it stayed healthy and smooth after 3 applications.  PLUS it smells really good.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical but for the price I went for it.  I have medium-to-dark brown hair (not brunette by any means) but was blond when I was younger and miss it:)  This took a week or two but has DEFINITELY lightened my hair.  it&#x27;s gradual so you don&#x27;t have to worry about overdoing it.  I&#x27;m not platinum for any means but wasn&#x27;t looking for that.  My hair is a nice dark to medium blond.  A couple things to know:  First, you really have to use heat. A blow dry works best, although my straightener helps too.  Also, i had VERY subtle red tones in my hair, and this seems to have brought them out.  It&#x27;s very natural looking but they are definitely noticeable, so don&#x27;t be surprised if you aren&#x27;t pure blonde if you have other tones in your hair.    Overall, I am very pleased and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have naturally medium blonde with some reddish highlights in my hair, for some STUPID reason I thought this would bring out my highlights and brighten my hair just a \\&quot;tad\\&quot;. I liked this product the first couple times I used it and it did lighten it a bit. HOWEVER 3 weeks after I stopped using it, I found that my hair was continuing to lighten and was starting to look orange. Come to find out-the hydrogen peroxide stays in your hair and since it is heat activated, anytime you blow-dry/straighten/etc its going to continue to get lighter and more orange. I just purchased Paul Mitchel Clarifying Shampoo 2 in hopes that it will strip the chemicals from my hair and stop it from lightening. Looks like I&#x27;m air-drying for the next couple of weeks.... I completely regret using this product. Please save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and my sister who both have naturally dark blonde, curly hair. Up to this point, they had been highlighting at home to lighten their hair, but now they are both hooked on this product. It&#x27;s great for the hairline and roots and does not turn hair orange or brassy. Brunette or red hair would probably be different, but if you are in the blonde to medium brown category, I would recommend this product. My sister has very, very coarse hair, while my mom&#x27;s is fine and neither or them have reported too much damage in the last three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll still have to bleach now and again, but this probably cuts that down to a third of what you&#x27;d normally do.</li>
            <li> This is a more modern version of Sun-In. It does work, but it WILL damage your hair, just as any other bleach or highlighting chemical would, and even worse than a lot of other products. Go Blonder uses peroxide to lighten, which is nothing new and really no surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this with minimal damage, if you take it slow. Don&#x27;t try to achieve your desired look the first time you use it, or you will most likely end up with really damaged hair and pretty upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to use this along with a straightener or hair dryer, be careful. Do not totally soak your hair with it and then excessively blow dry or straight iron - that is asking for trouble!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use it on wet hair. If you spray it on dry hair and then straighten or blow dry, don&#x27;t be surprised when your hair falls out - no joke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use it, in order to minimize damage, is I spray LIGHTLY, so that it is just misting my hair. Do not hold the bottle too close to your hair, or else you will end up with lightened blotches. Think of it as using hairspray, where you want to mist to cover a lot of area at once. If you want to do root areas or new growth, use the same technique - try to MIST a broad area at a time and do not totally saturate the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you mist, run your fingers through your hair several times to eliminate any over concentrated areas and then also comb through several times. You want it to be distributed evenly through your hair and you do not want any blotches or any areas that are too saturated with it because that&#x27;s how you end up with more damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you have it worked through your hair, you can blow dry or let it air dry. Heat speeds up the process, but will also cause more damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do blow dry, but I am super careful to NOT hold the hair dryer on any spot too long. The more exposure to heat, the more damage and guaranteed breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this more than advised on the bottle will lead to excessively dry, brittle hair. It will become porous and rough, no matter what, but will be even worse with overuse . Be sure to use a GOOD conditioner to counteract all the bad side effects. I&#x27;d recommend a salon brand, but if you have to use a store brand, go with Infusium 23 or Loreal EverPure. Keep in mind that you will experience all of these bad side effects even if you use it as directed, so a conditioner that actually replenishes the hair is mandatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in a hurry to see extreme highlights or lightening, you are better off to buy a highlighting kit, or just dye your hair. If you use too much of this too often, you are just asking for horribly damaged hair. If you take your time with it, use it maybe twice a week (several days apart!) you will be able to lighten your hair with minimal damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that it does work, and it does work well, you just cannot be in a hurry, you cannot overuse it, you cannot excessively use heat appliances, you cannot expect to get the full results in one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT recommend using a straightening iron at all, after using the spray. Hair dryer &#x3D; damage, but straightening iron &#x3D; EVEN MORE damage and breakage.

            <li> John Frieda came out with a product that does exactly what it claims to do, lighten blonde hair up to 1-1/2 shades.One can see a difference in just a few uses. However, this comes with a lot of warnings and at a cost - potential damage to your hair since this product uses peroxide (along with citrus and chamomile) and is heat activated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box has some very important warnings:&lt;br /&gt;* Do not use on natural brown or darker shades of hair.&lt;br /&gt;* Do not use on intensively bleached hair (lightened 4-8 shades)&lt;br /&gt;* Do not use on platinum or white shades of blonde hair&lt;br /&gt;* Use no more than 10 times between colorings&lt;br /&gt;* Only use once between washings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box also states that maximum lightening occurs after no more than 10 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this product does work, but use with caution. You could end up with some very damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this after I had ordered it and must admit I was a little leery of trying it out after all the one star reviews. However, I did try it and loved it. I put it on my hair for streaks and used it twice over a four day period and I have some nice layered sun-looking streaks. My hair is still very healthy and the streaks look sun-kissed rather than artificial. I think the secret to using it has to do with using the product infrequently rather than daily or even weekly. Very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 29, 2014: I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for the last couple of months and haven&#x27;t had any problems with the product that the one star reviewers complained about.  I really do think the secret is to use it sparingly and not every day and not in heavy quantities.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with hair lightening products, but since the color of my hair can vary depending upon the season and how much sun it gets, I was interested in using this product to try to maintain the lighter tone.  This product made me a bit nervous when reviewing how harsh the chemicals involved are, so I was too nervous to use it beyond a couple applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, take note the product warns that it is meant ONLY for blondes, so if you have darker hair you are looking to lighten, I would try another method.</li>
            <li> On time and looooooove the product. It&#x27;s really my all time favorite and I will stock it at home. It works wonders on the beach speacially and gives a very natural look, don&#x27;t apply it too close to the root.</li>
            <li> This arrived in a well-packed Amazon box. But, when I went to remove the John Frieda box, it was damp. I took the bottle out and discover that it had been leaking (ever so slightly). I examined the Amazon box, there were no crush injuries, so it appears that this was not the fault of Amazon, but maybe of John Frieda for not using a removable plastic tamper-proof collar on the neck of the bottle. Now, without thinking, I walk over to the sink, twisted the neck of the bottle so that it was now tightly secure, rinsed the bottle thoroughly, and then wiped it with a paper towel. There were still pieces of the original box stuck to it, but I figured that I would pick those off later. I rinsed my hands and went upstairs to read (allowing the bottle to air dry). About three minutes later, my hands began to burn ... it was not painful, just uncomfortable. For a second, I literally did not make the connection. Then, it hit me! I washed my hands twice ... but there was still a stinging sensation and some burning under my nails.    Needless to say, this went directly into the garbage. If this LITERALLY burned my hands, what would it do to my (sensitive) scalp?! What would it do to my hair? Of course, then I saw the reviews here ... and the pictures here. My heart sunk. I feel so bad for those people who did not have the accidental warning that I had.    I feel a little bad for not recycling the bottle, but I was nervous to dump this into our septic. I would rather not take the risk.    If you are considering this product, I would strongly (STRONGLY) urge you to consider splurging at a salon. I know that salons are so expensive (believe me, I get it), but it&#x27;s even more expensive to have repairs made to your hair (or extensions added). Please, read these reviews and be careful.</li>
            <li> Prior to receiving this product, I&#x27;d used John Frieda Sheer Blonde Go Blonder Lightening Shampoo &amp; Conditioner a few times already.  I live in the south, so the sun kissed look is always acceptable for hair.  I was happy to try the spray but I would strongly caution users not to double up on these products.  As with all things, moderation is key.  I don&#x27;t use these more than twice in a week, nor do I use them more than 3 times a month.  Just enough to lighten up and brighten up my hair and not enough to degrade the condition of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the spray application because you can control where you put the treatment.  It stinks like peroxide.  I noticed a difference after the first use.  I also noticed that my hair was a bit dried out from the experience.  I&#x27;ll be giving it a moisturizing treatment before I use anything else on my hair.  I&#x27;ll update this review if my experience changes.</li>
            <li> John Frieda products offer great quality and this is no exception.  You can control how much and how often of this spray you want to use.  And it couldn&#x27;t be easier.  As a natural blonde, this lightened my hair while keeping my look natural, which is important to me.  John Frieda does not test on animals, and that is also why I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is not processed at all.  It usually turns more blonde in the summer, but this summer it didn&#x27;t seem to change as much, so I thought I would try this.  Since I was hesitant to try it after the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I put it on the underside of my hair just in case I did have the problems others have had.  I used it 4 times throughout the week and blew dry my hair afterwards, it did make it a little lighter.  The product does have a gross smell to it, I didn&#x27;t use that much of it and I noticed, I&#x27;m sure if I sprayed a good amount on the top of my hair it would smell even worse.  So far the hair I used it on has not changed in consistency or dried out, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll keep using it to find out.  Lightening hair is just not worth the damage, I think I&#x27;ll try to find a more natural way to do it.</li>
            <li> One does need to read directions carefully, but I have had fair enough results with this spray.  I have light brown hair and this spray does highlight it.</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price! Lightens without giving that fake peroxide look.</li>
            <li> This stuff fried my hair. And I mean fried! It does work to lighten but I don&#x27;t know how. Is their bleach in the bottle or what? After a couple of weeks my hair looked like I had been pouring straight bleach on it. I don&#x27;t even have a split end normally. Luckily it was only on the ends and I could just cut it.</li>
            <li> Mixed review. For myself on or near my previously colored hair, I was happy with initial results but experienced damage over time similar to other reviewers. ever, absolutely perfect to lighten front sections of the front of my son&#x27;s healthy hair. Much better than sun in which had an orange tinge.</li>
            <li> I have long naturally blonde thin hair. My hair would be considered blonde even if I never used this product. I first used this in October when my friend who has light brown hair told me she used it for highlights. It looked great on her. So I just wanted blonder and prettier hair. I would take a shower then I would apply it where I wanted it. I then would blow dry my hair and then straighten it. I would still use heat protection when straightening my hair because it seemed dumb not to.   I used the bottle up in about 10 days.   I bought my next bottle at thanksgiving. I did the same as before and I was very pleased with the results I got.   Now, in January I bought it again. Reading some of these reviews scare me though. I have never had any problems with this product though. For me , it is just a better alternative for bleaching or dying your hair. I think that if you don&#x27;t have legit blonde hair, then you are more prone to have some issues. But I have never had any problems. The reason I give it four stars is because i think it would be even a better product if it didn&#x27;t need heat.</li>
            <li> This product is the best gradual-blinding spray on the market. Only buy it if you have a hair dryer/heat-product because it only activates with heat.</li>
            <li> The lightening spray is amazing and works just as advertised. I&#x27;ve used this about 2 times a month for the last three months. I&#x27;ve used it on my roots, to blend in summer highlights. I section off 2 in. sections of my hair and only spray the roots. Then I massage the product into my scalp. All but once, I&#x27;ve blow dried by hair. The time I blow dried and then flat ironed by hair it got lighter than just blow drying it alone. I also used another review&#x27;s tip to create highlights by spraying product on a cotton ball and saturating select strands of hair by my face. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with breakage that some other reviews have noted. If you&#x27;re a natural blonde, you barely need to use any product to get lightening. I still have a LOT left. I almost didn&#x27;t buy this after reading some reviews about hair melting; while the product has peroxide in order to work, I can&#x27;t image your hair melting if used sparingly. If you&#x27;ve got brown hair or are trying to repeatedly lighten your whole head I&#x27;d definitely NOT use this, but instead go to a pro.</li>
            <li> I am natural dark blonde and hoped that this product will help me to lighten my hair without having to go to the salon too often. I have used this product once a week following the instructions and blow drying my hair as described. After 4 uses my hair was a little lighter but sort of unnatural orange looking. Last time I have used this product I have made the crucial mistake of straightening my hair. When I woke up the next morning I have noticed that a MASSIVE CHUNK of my hair was MISSING! And it has since been breaking off at the ends and falling out. I am so gutted! It took me ages to grow my healthy shiny hair and now it is a disaster! I have contacted John Frieda adn will update once I have a response but doubt that they would do anythiang about it. It is going to take me ages to grow my hair back and it has left me disgusted and frustrated. I WISH I READ THE REVIEWS about this  before I tried it!! PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT if you care about your hair and don&#x27;t want to ruin it!!</li>
            <li> My hair has been pretty much the same for my entire life: naturally dark blonde, never color treated or bleached, fine, straight, and healthy. I&#x27;ve never used styling tools and I rarely blow dry my hair (maybe once every 2-3 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Go Blonder Spray two years ago to brighten my hair in the winter without the streaky-ness and expense of salon highlights. For a solid year, my experience with this product was fantastic. I used it all over my hair maybe 4 times initially, then sprayed only at the roots every 2 weeks before blow-drying (for the most part, these were the only times I blow-dried my hair). The color was great; I even succeeded in fooling multiple hairdressers into believing that it was all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year, I started noticing the same weird breakage pattern that many other reviewers have mentioned: a fair amount of hair was breaking off into dry, frizzy, 3-inch pieces around my part. I had no idea what was going on, and for a long time, I was in denial that it had anything to do with my beloved John Frieda spray -- it had worked wonderfully for such a long time, so why would it suddenly start damaging my hair? It wasn&#x27;t until after checking the Amazon reviews that I was forced to admit the truth. The broken pieces are growing out (they&#x27;re a couple of inches below my jaw at this point) and the damage to my hair hasn&#x27;t been nearly as extensive as some of the other reviewers have described, but I figured I would let others know what has worked for me to recover from my Go Blonder experience. I am definitely not a professional hairdresser and this might not work for everyone, but here&#x27;s what I have found helpful:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Needless to say, discontinue use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Avoid coloring, lightening, straightening, or otherwise placing stress on the parts of your hair that have been lightened with the spray. Read other reviews: some women have had their hair melt off in the salon! Since I&#x27;ve stopped using the spray, I&#x27;ve had the roots of my hair (the darker parts that grew in after I stopped using the spray) highlighted at an Aveda salon twice with no additional damage. I always tell the stylist that my hair is delicate and point out the broken pieces and she&#x27;s careful not to go over them with additional lighteners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Change your part: if you can, part your hair on the other side of your head while the broken pieces grow out. It will make them much less noticeable and give the damaged hair less exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Use a mild clarifying shampoo to remove waxy buildup. I&#x27;ve had good luck with Suave Naturals Daily Clarifying shampoo; I use it only on my roots (where I had buildup from the Go Blonder Spray) and follow with a deep conditioner. Clarifying shampoo can be drying and that&#x27;s the opposite of what damaged hair needs, so use sparingly. I&#x27;ve actually found that the combination of clarifying shampoo and deep conditioner makes my hair softer -- I think removing the buildup allows hair to absorb more of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 5) I have tried a bunch of moisturizing haircare lines, and for me, the best have been the Neutrogena Triple Moisture Shampoo and Daily Deep Conditioner. They have made the broken ends much less frazzled and my hair is much softer now that I&#x27;ve started using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the other reviews seem to have a note of despair, but I just want to add...your hair WILL recover from this. The new growth of my hair is just as healthy as my hair used to be, and eventually I&#x27;ll be able to trim the last of the broken ends off and this experience will be nothing but a bad memory.</li>
            <li> Remember Sun-in?  This is Sun-in for the modern age, although it still has many of the problems of the original.  The most obvious problem is that it smells bad.  I really don&#x27;t want to smell this on my hair constantly, and going out in the summer sun just intensifies that scent.  This is also drying.  My hair felt yucky after using it, with a sort of straw-like feel.  Yuck.  I have seen that others reported that their hair fell out when using this product.  I am blessed with VERY thick hair, so I would not notice and fall-out.  Still using this spray was unpleasant, and I would not continue to use it in the future.  It did provide some lightening, but I&#x27;d rather pay for a professional to lighten my hair.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! There should be a class action lawsuit against John Frieda company. Yes, this spray will lighten your hair and it looks great - initially. Until your hair starts to frizz and break at the roots and grows out completely fried, falling off. There is not even point in saying do not use it too often. I used it about twice on my roots (my natural hair is very light - dark blond) , with at least 4 weeks break in between. It damages your hair so badly, that over period of time, that area you sprayed gets weaker and more and more fragile. Now 6 months later I have a line in my (what used to be beautiful long hair) about 4\\&quot; below my roots of completely broken fried hair. I used colors before, I never seen my hair in such pitiful state. Pointless to say that my hairdresser was mortified.. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you love your hair, do NOT, under any circumstances, buy this. I first bought the spray two years ago, right about when it first came out. I had never colored my hair before, but I was hoping that this product would lighten my naturally dark blonde hair just a little bit. At first, I was thrilled! After a month of using it, my hair had become a lovely lighter blonde with natural looking highlights. It was amazing! I thought I&#x27;d found the solution to lightening my hair without having to commit to regular salon colorings and highlights. I then reduced using the spray to about three times a week, then again as soon as I&#x27;d see the first sign of my roots, so about four weeks later. This little hair routine was going just fine for a year and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this summer was when things went terribly wrong...one day I noticed a little fried section of my hair, one of the lightest sections right along my part. I had never seen my hair look like that before, but I ignored it, thinking I had over straightened it. Then, the next day, I noticed another section...and another. The sections of my hair along my part line (the lightest sections that had been most affected by the spray) had ALL broken off to fried, frizzed 3 INCH SECTIONS. I could NOT believe it! My hair was a blonde, damaged MESS! My hairdresser explained that using the spray, even just off and on for such a long time, had finally caught up to my hair, and with being in the sun a lot this summer as well, my hair was basically melting off due to the Go Blonder spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately stopped using it. I haven&#x27;t used the spray in over three months, but my hair is still so damaged from it and continues breaking off. My hairdresser flipped my part to try to disguise all the damage, and she trims the damaged sections for me once a month. I&#x27;ve been using intensive keratin conditioners and limiting heat styling, but she tells me that it&#x27;s just going to take time for all these sections to grow out. Her guess is about a YEAR. I regret using this spray so much. Even if you&#x27;ve used it for a while, please know that it WILL catch up to you and damage your hair eventually. I&#x27;m so disappointed in John Freida products after this horrible experience. I realize having good hair isn&#x27;t everything, but for someone who has had healthy, natural, long hair her whole life, this is so upsetting for me.</li>
            <li> Made my hair orangish and brassy. only been using it for about a week and a half and it did lighten considerably but it looks unnatural and has a slight orange tinge.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year and it has saved me tons of money on salon visits! I have dirty blonde hair with highlights but since using this product I have only gone into the salon once. I have not noticed any drying out and my hair still grows long and healthy. I only use about twice a week and it gives me beautiful color, I would&#x27;t overdo it!</li>
            <li> I visit my stylist numerous times a year to color my grey hair and add in blond highlights.  After reading the horror stories of many fellow reviewers I was hesitant to put this stuff in my hair, however I agreed to try and review this and that is what I will do.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use a test strip on the side of my head so I could see the change if any.  I figure if there is any adverse reaction at least its only one spot not all over.&lt;br /&gt;So far all is good.  This product goes on easily and smells fine.  I am taking pictures and will add these as I progress.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is in good condition and I plan to keep it that way!</li>
            <li> I selected the John Frieda Sheer  Blonde Go Blonder Controlled Lightening Spray as I have heard many great things about his products and I hoped that it would help me go longer between colorings at my salon.  However, after having a terrible run in with a similar product (Sun In) I thought I would read some of the other reviews BEFORE I went too far, and am I glad I did!  As someone who spends ~$150 to get my hair colored just right, after reading previous reviews of this product I completely changed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of using it on my scalp hair, as I know the product is designed for, I decided  to use it to lighten my arm hair instead (which is a light blondish brown but I was hoping to get it a little bit lighter for an upcoming trip to the beach).  I took a picture of my arm before my first use, and now, after a few weeks I can actually see a SMALL difference and I don&#x27;t have to worry about chunks of hair falling out.  The product contains hydrogen peroxide for the lightening and uses heat to intensify its effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitate to recommend this product as there are many reports of hair breakage. One of my other criticisms of the product is that is has a rather unpleasant pungent smell until it is absorbed, and I will only use it on days where I am running errands or working around the house.</li>
            <li> I borrowed it from friend of mine &amp;#34;to try before buy&amp;#34;. It does its work but i think its too harsh. You might want to lower temperature of your flat iron or use it not too often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this wonderful product for a couple years now, only in late winter to get my natural blonde hair to it&#x27;s summer blonde. That being said, you do have to use your common sense as it does contain HYDROGEN PEROXIDE, one of the most damaging things to put on your har. I use the product as directed before I shower so the chemicals aren&#x27;t sitting in my hair all day. I also use a deep conditioning treatment after each use because it is so drying. I think a lot of people have had negative experiences because a) they don&#x27;t read the label b) use it on color treated hair c) use 3 bottles. I personally only use one bottle for all over lightening which gives me a nice summer blonde and isn&#x27;t so light I need to use it again on my roots - they lighten up naturally in the spring/summer and you can&#x27;t even tell I used a lightening product! All in all, I recommend this product to any natural blonde who wants to go a little lighter and get a nice shimmer.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the accompanying John Frida shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I follow the instructions to spray into towel dried hair and then blow dry. I don&#x27;t use a straightening/curling iron or anything because that alone causes hair damage, and causes my hair to break off even without ever using this product. I&#x27;m a natural dark blonde and this product lightens my hair to give it more natural looking variation. I have used this on top of dying and have had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all mostly ignore warning labels on hair products such as hair dye, such as the \\&quot;do a test patch before use\\&quot;. I have not experienced any of the problems in the negative reviews (except for maybe my hair sometimes going brassy, but I attribute that to swimming and previous hair dying, and it was fixed almost instantly by using shampoo like Shimmer Lights), so I guess I would recommend doing a test patch first for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, love this product, smells better than putting vinegar in my hair at home to lighten, and am def buying again.</li>
            <li> I find that this is not as strong as Sun-In.  It&#x27;s a lot like it though, no matter what they claim.  It will lighten your hair, and it only has a bit of additive in it to tone down the brassiness.  On darker hair it will uncover the red undertones - this happens to my son, who becomes more of a copper red/dark blonde than a yellow blonde.  My hair is very light naturally though, and this stuff will make it near white.&lt;br /&gt;It can also fry it.  It is peroxide based and it can cause split ends and dryness.  I find that it is best to use it lightly, in moderation, noting the condition of your hair as you go.  I don&#x27;t use it with a blow dryer- I use it with a drying/straightening iron and I have always made it a point to trim whoever&#x27;s hair uses it - mine or his- about 2/3 of an inch after it&#x27;s been used a few times.  This helps with the split ends, of course it works for coloring too, though I don&#x27;t color mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I got this is because I find it works really nicely on the darker hair that I have next to my neck- my hair gets very blonde in the sun, but down underneath it will be a darker shade.  This works to even out the color in my hair.  It&#x27;s easy to use, just spray it on and then dry hair with a hot dryer or use a drying iron.</li>
            <li> I generally like John Frieda products and have had good results with them. Not so much the case with this lightening spray. Even though I used it strictly according to directions, I&#x27;ve found that it does help lighten the hair and take some of the brassiness out of my hair, but with one major problem: it caused my hair to become very brittle, even with intense moisturizing and conditioning treatments. I normally have very healthy hair, but this stuff was incredibly harsh on it. It may work for you, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> This product may seem to work great at first but it turned my dirty blonde hair a dull brassy orange. Seemed to get worse after hair is heated (by sun or hairdryer) but gets more orange gradually. Tried to get it out at salon. After several washes the orange tone still there. Very stubborn. What gives? Is it the hydrogen peroxide or the polymer? Also, we even tried adjusting the color at the salon with a color wash but it changed the intended lighter color much darker than both my hair and the normal color range for that wash. I have never used a dye or highlight on my hair before so we are not talking damaged hair here until this product was used. It was healthy, natural, shiny, barely blow-dried hair. I have been using John Frieda&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner for years and love them so I thought this would be a trusted brand. I am so disappointed. That&#x27;s my toned down version, I am actually furious that products like this can still be introduced without adequate testing. While a good day at the hairdresser can make you feel like a million bucks, the unfortunate opposite is true by using this product for any length of time as it can turn your precious asset into cheap looking dull orange hair. I have filed a complaint at the John Fried website and  am also waiting to hear from them to see if there are any products on the market that can correct this problem and help restore my hair back to its natural color. Many people also complain that it changed the texture of their hair and some even that it makes their hair fall out. I hope this review helps others stay away before actually trying this product for the first time and that you are not someone who is just reading this review after you try the product and spend hundreds of dollars trying to correct the problem or worse damage your hair beyond repair. I will check back here after I hear back from John Frieda&#x27;s organization to let you know how they respond and if they offer any solutions.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to brighten both myself and my daughter&#x27;s  natural blonde hair. It worked very well, better than the old Sun-In product of my youth!&lt;br /&gt;However the stern warnings on the box troubled me:  Do not use on natural brown or dark shades of hair. Do not use more than once in between washing. Do not use on re grow less than an inch. Do not use more than 10 times in between colorings.&lt;br /&gt;After just a few times of trying it, we both decided to stop. Just about then, I began to notice some breakage of my hair. With no other changes in my hair care routine, I can only surmise that this product is to blame.</li>
            <li> Very satisfying product.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly convinced that anyone writing a positive review for this product has been paid by John Frieda to do so. Before John Frieda&#x27;s &amp;#34;Sheer Blonde Go Blonder Controlled Lightening Spray,&amp;#34; I had beautifully healthy, lightly treated (highlights) blonde hair. After? My hair is breaking off everywhere. I have only used this product three times since purchasing it a couple weeks ago and my hair is breaking AT EVERY POINT. I should have read these reviews instead of entrusting my hair&#x27;s health and wellbeing to the scoundrels at John Frieda. What a horrific product.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair a little more blonde than I like, but definitely works.  I like a more natural look so I just use a little less to make it more natural looking.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I am always highlighting and putting more blonde in my hair and my natural color is kind of an ashy blonde so when my roots start to show I immediately want to go to the salon and get a touch up on my blonde! However, it can be quite pricey to go so often so I sought out a product that would help prolong my color and help in between salon visits and I stumbled upon this product. I also purchased the &amp;#34;Go Blonder&amp;#34; Shampoo and Conditioner to use all three products together and I absolutely can see the results! I am happy that this worked so well and that it is very inexpensive! I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important to note that most of the people saying their hair started breaking off used this excessively or incorrectly. It&#x27;s a hair bleaching spray with peroxide in it, for pete&#x27;s sake. Bleaching/lightening your hair is a destructive process that damages hair - lightening your hair multiple times a month (or even multiple times a year, depending on your hair texture) is obviously not going to turn out well. Regardless, just like with any hair product, be sure to test it on a 1&amp;#34; section of hair that you can hide if you don&#x27;t like results before using all over!  I use this once every 6-8 months and get good results. It&#x27;s never damaged my hair, certainly not beyond what a salon peroxide session would. My dark blonde/light brown hair goes up a shade or two after one use, and it&#x27;s subtler than the Sun-In &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; look (although still definitely brassy). When it dries it feels really sticky and gross, so I don&#x27;t do this when I have anywhere to be for a few hours. I spray/soak my hair thoroughly with the lightener, air dry for a few minutes, gently blow dry, and wash it gently and deep-condition after a few hours. I do this in a well-ventilated room, as the blow drying in particular creates some gross peroxide fumes. I have long, thin hair, and have never had any damage/breakage using it this way. If you&#x27;re concerned or have very processed or brittle hair, err on the side of caution and just don&#x27;t use it.  FYI: I&#x27;ve switched to lemon juice &amp; chamomile to lighten my hair - it&#x27;s nicely non-toxic and smells nice, but definitely doesn&#x27;t work as quickly/evenly as the Frieda spray.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde but as I am getting older, my blonde is starting to go more towards brown. I wanted something to lighten my hair without the high cost of professional highlights. I have used John Frieda shampoo/conditioners in the past and really liked the results. This was my first time using the lightening spray. First, at least to me, a few spritz&#x27;s go a long way. I have been using the product daily for almost two weeks and still have half a bottle left. I do dry my hair with a hair dryer and then use both a straightening and curling iron each morning. After the third day, I was amazed with how much lighter my hair was.  And the best part is how very natural it looks. The product can be drying, but is easily corrected with weekly conditioning treatments.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Definitely lightens, Seems to ruin hair at an equal rate.  Heavy conditioning with \\&quot;damaged hair\\&quot; products needed after only 3 uses.  Using Go Blonder shampoo and conditioner too.  Not sure if it&#x27;s the Peroxide or the Polymer film added to provide restorative feel and transparency.    Also tends to lighten even my real blond hair to a more orangeish shade...  (all the 1 star reviews are correct.)    You can look at the patent application KAO Brands Co., the parent of John Frieda, has filed in the US for this.  It is \\&quot;Pub. No.: US 2011/0104090 A1\\&quot;  and can be found at the www(dot)USPTO(dot)gov website.  Interesting to see what they added and why...    Not so great a lightener as it rapidly ruins hair!  I will try a different lightener.</li>
            <li> I found this product to work very well. I used it two different ways. First I used it with my curling iron. I sprayed it on. And it actually made my hair color seem brighter. The second time I tried it with my flat iron. I sprayed it on my hair evenly. The flat iron does a better job. It also leaves a sheen over your hair. The scent is not strong. It&#x27;s ok. Overall nice hair care product.</li>
            <li> I found this product to have an immediate effect on my hair. After one use, my hair was noticeably lighter. However, it did create a brassy sheen on my naturally dirty blonde hair that revealed itself under artificial lighting. It also dried my hair out a bit (which I expected), but even with a deep conditioner it still was damaged; this should be expected because the product does contain bleaching ingredients.</li>
            <li> I had the coolest ombre &#x27;do! My local salon uses a hair dye that has fewer chemicals than most and I&#x27;ve always trusted my stylist to do whats best for my hair. After growing out my hair for 8 months and having a color process, my hair looked and felt amazing. It was bouncy and had body and volume. To further lighten the ends of my hair I purchased ONLY the conditioner and began using it about 2 weeks AFTER my color process. After 3 washes my hair was stiff and dry. I was unable to get my fingers through it, let alone a brush! I stopped using the conditioner immediately, but over the next 2-3 weeks I noticed more and more of my ends breaking and splitting UP my hair shaft, we&#x27;re talking 4 inch split ends! It proceeded to get GUMMY, like it was melting my hair and the ends looked like the end of a broom! I eventually had to cut off 5 inches of hair in order to prevent any more damage. I tried everything to save my mane, and NOTHING worked, that&#x27;s how AWFUL this product is.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  I don&#x27;t do &amp;#34;upkeep&amp;#34; and refuse to spend a ton of $$ on my hair, but I have lighter blond hair already....this just keeps it a better, brighter color than regular sunlight does.  It&#x27;s inexpensive, and I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this intermittently since it came out, in conjunction with the Go Blonder shampoo and conditioner. (Seriously intermittently. I got two bottles of this in combo packs, and they&#x27;ve lasted YEARS.) I&#x27;m naturally dirty blonde, and these products help keep my color bright, especially throughout the winter. I only ever use this spray on my roots, I only ever use a few spritzes, and I only use it MAYBE once a week. That&#x27;s mostly because I really hate the residue it leaves behind--if I use too much, it makes my hair stick together and look a little greasy and dirty, so I try to use the bare minimum and only ever use it on days when I don&#x27;t care how my hair looks. But it definitely does give my color a subtle little boost, and I&#x27;ve never had any ill effects like some of the other reviewers on here. Just don&#x27;t overuse this stuff, and you&#x27;ll be fine!</li>
            <li> just like sun in. Great way to speed up the summer hair highlights</li>
            <li> i give it a three because it did get my roots and hair incredibly light. the problem was that after a while, it started to burn. so i cut it back to once every other weak while using the sun-in natural spray every other day. good combo but know that it will damage hair a bit so i would just not heat it at all.</li>
            <li> I got this product when it first came on the market and it had only a few, all good, reviews.&lt;br /&gt;My once beautiful hair is now a mess. I&#x27;m naturally a dirty blonde and wanted to use this product to cover my roots between hair appointments. Loved it at first. Then my hair started to get a gummy film and curled up like Christmas ribbon when I brushed it. It would seriously take 15 minutes to brush out all the knots. After I stopped using it, my hair started to break off. I&#x27;m so glad I only used it at the front of my face.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE PRODUCT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE!!</li>
            <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong item and it was not replaced with the correct item.  The company America RX they ended up refunding my money and then asked me to go back and give them a better review, which of course I did not do.</li>
            <li> I have used the lightening spray for a little over two years now. I always great great results with out bronzing or orange effects.  Sun-in and other products have turned my hair orange and brassy. I will say I notice that the product does dry my hair out.  I use good conditioner and shampoo and like everything in life use the spray in moderation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have darker hair and dump this stuff on everyday to try to be a platinum blonde, I imagine your hair would fall out.  Just like if you went to the Salon and had it died every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I myself have lightened my hair using the product one or two beach days a month with great results. I have had no breakage or loss of hair at all.  It gives a natural looking sun kissed look with out the brassy highlights.  I would recommend this product to anyone... just be careful use it in moderation.</li>
            <li> I bought this after everyone was telling me my blonde hair was getting dark. I noticed a difference after 2 days! Now my hair looks the perfect light summer blonde!  I am going to lighten my uses after reading some other reviews.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It can make your hair brassy if you repeatedly use in combination with conditioners, or certain hair products.  Use it after you shampoo on a day when you can get away without conditioner.</li>
            <li> Reading the ingredients, you&#x27;ll see that it has hydrogen peroxide. It is the thing mixed with bleaching powder to make the batch. So, spraying this in your hair, you are basically leaving a weaker version of bleach in your hair but for a day.  A day. Compared to 40-60 min of processing time for a bleaching session.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for several years. It is the only product like this that doesn&#x27;t turn my hair orange (like sun-in).</li>
            <li> My hair is long and dark blonde with natural highlights that I get from the sun every summer.  One week ago, I decided on a whim to try to get a few highlights without the sun.  My hair has never been chemically treated and was very healthy.  I usually just wash and go and rarely use a blow dryer.  THIS PRODUCT HAS DESTROYED MY HAIR&#x27;S QUALITY!!!  After four uses, my hair is blonder in some sections but mostly just brassy and orange throughout.  I have broken pieces of hair all over my head, and my hair strands just seem thinner and brittle.  Many pieces have broken off and are standing up at my hairline.  This has never happened to me before, and I am horrified.  A few weeks ago, I had three inches cut, but my ends are already frayed, dry, and terrible.  Please do not buy this product.  I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this last week.  I am now having to do deep conditioning treatments to try to fix this mess that used to be healthy hair.  Either wait for summer to lighten your hair or go see your hairdresser.</li>
            <li> This product is the best in lightning hair.&lt;br /&gt;Exclusive for blonde and medium color hair.... Really, i love it. I love my hair right now! is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It works amazingly! I bought it when I had light brown dyed hair and I was looking to lighten it up a bit without dying it again. It did exactly what I wanted. I ended up with blonde hair and it was perfect. It worked well at getting all the my hair lighter so it was splotchy. Other reviewers have said that it dries up there hair, but I thought it kept my hair shiny and soft. I definitely plan to use again if I decide to go light again. Soooo much better than using bleach, I recommend this to anyone trying to light up their hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is dark and dyed a couple of months ago with a dark beige blonde hair dye. My hair turned light mocha brown. Past forward to now, the dye has definitely faded and my roots are showing. Instead of redyeing my hair, I just decided to do a soft ombre with the John Frieda lightening spray. This worked pretty well! Now my hair is lightened at the ends. Thankfully, there wasn&#x27;t a line of demarcation from my previous dye job and the ombre looks continuous and subtle. I didn&#x27;t use this every single day. I used this twice a month at different weeks. I read how this product damaged people&#x27;s hair. This thing is basically bleach. If I would bleach my hair, I would never really do it everyday and this product is no different from doing exactly that. Also, whenever I spray this on my hair, I only use one heating tool. I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer, I just let the lightening mixture on my hair air dry, then I use my straightener. To prevent further hair damage, I deep condition my hair twice a week, every other week. I deducted a star because I don&#x27;t really like the smell, it&#x27;s tolerable but I don&#x27;t like it. I stopped using this altogether since I already reached the lightness I wanted. Since my hair is naturally dark, it has the tendency to get brassy when lightened. I just tone my hair by mixing blue food dye in my shampoo and conditioner, and everything is all good again!</li>
            <li> I think the people who have left unfavorable reviews may be expecting too much from this product and/or overusing it. Last summer I bleached my medium brown hair to platinum (at a salon). It wasn&#x27;t quite there - had a bit of a yellow tint, so I used this product along with John Freida&#x27;s Tone correcting shampoo which brought my hair gradually to the platinum I was looking for in a couple of weeks. Never was my hair falling out or damaged. I stopped using it every day when it reached the shade/tone I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This summer I am using a box color on my hair (current color is a medium blond) and it was a touch brassy. For about two weeks after coloring it I started using the Go Blonder spray again (along with the tone correcting shampoo) and I am back to a natural looking medium-dark blond again. No damage to speak of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am quite happy with the money I&#x27;ve saved using a box color (not too far from my natural) along with this product to get the color I like. I will definitely buy more when this runs out. (note that I bought this bottle over a year ago and I still have plenty left - hint: I have not overused it and damaged my hair).</li>
            <li> Ok , i don&#x27;t  where alm the negative reviews are coming from, is common sense anything that u use to go blonde is going to damage your hair if u use it too much, im not naturally blonde actually not even light brown but this product its been wondercul for me no orage at all but i only used on my tips for the look , just once a week and nothing else than going outside with the sun at noon lol, it works and my hair has no damage at all just dont go crazy using it :), not 5 stars only because i think the bottle is too small haha</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year or so and like it. As other reviews say, it can be damaging to your hair if you use it everyday. My natural hair color is dirty blonde which lightens in the summer and it&#x27;s medium length (3-4 inches past my shoulders). This spray helps me keep it light year round and it looks natural without having to spend money on coloring my hair at the salon. I rarely blow-dry my hair (probably twice per month) but when I do, I use the spray. Use it only a few times per month to ensure you keep your hair healthy and also so my hair wouldn&#x27;t become bleach blonde. Just like any coloring product (even this lightening spray) you will damage your hair it you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I used to dye my hair with sun in (suggest this over this product. Sun in has quick results and its like 8 ounces for 4 bucks) anyways ! It came on time which amazon is always good with . I started using it last Friday more then half the bottle is gone I&#x27;ve yet to see lightening . Someone actually asked me the other day if I had darkened my hair. So it&#x27;s not just me not seeing the results and trust me I drench my hair in this stuff then blow dry and flat iron . As for damage I don&#x27;t see any . When you&#x27;re done blow drying and flat ironing it in like it advises you to ... You&#x27;re hair feels absolutely disgusting and dry a lot of people mistake this for damage . No. It&#x27;s just dry from the product if you wash if the next day it will go back to normal . Overall this product sucks because it was twice the price of sun in with a fraction of the results. Side bar: I also got it on my hands and arm and my skin started to bleach . WHY COULDN&#x27;T IT DO THAT TO MY HAIR !? Lol . I do not recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I havnt really seen a difference. Granted, im already pretty blonde but I wanted to be blonder and it didnt do much, but i guess i kept my roots light, which usually grow in darker even though im naturally blonde. It smells awful too. I suggest Sun-in instead because it does the same thing and smells better.</li>
            <li> This product is very harsh for your hair. I personally had bleach blonde hair and my natural grow out is a darker blonde, so I use this only on my roots to try to blend the bleach blonde and my natural color. My first use I applied only to my roots and did this a total of 3 different times. Then I let my hair grow out more. Once I had more fresh growout I applied it only to my roots again combing it down to what was my previous grow out. I would never apply this more than 2 or 3 times to any fresh grow out or onto bleached hair! This is working well to \\&quot;ombré\\&quot; my hair so eventually my roots will just fade to my bleach blonde ends and I will stop applying to my growout eventually. I don&#x27;t suggest using this on your entire head more than maybe twice. Also I&#x27;ve gotten a suggestion from a hair dresser friend of mine it&#x27;s better to use this product and apply heat before you shower so you&#x27;re not leaving the harsh chemicals in your hair all day long, because thats worse. Treat it like you would hair dye, people! I do see great color payoff with this product and I like it I just this it&#x27;s dangerous for all you people who don&#x27;t have as much experience with dying your hair or coloring it. You think this is a fast safe way but in reality it&#x27;s still harsh and can be very dangerous if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing!</li>
            <li> This item works well but it does dry out ur hair a lot so got to condition more and with a really rich conditioner.</li>
            <li> Yep, my hair is falling out too. I thought I was being careful, used this four times over about a month, the last time in early July. It&#x27;s now late August and I swear the hair loss is getting worse. Terrifying. Please, please do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair but I was interested in making it a couple of shades lighter.  When this product came along I thought I would give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using John Frieda \\&quot;Blonde\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner for a while with fairly good results.  This product promises visible results in 3-5 uses, and since it is also a Frieda product, worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 uses I noticed my hair becoming lighter.  After 5 uses the effect was noticeable enough that a coworker asked me if I changed something about my hair and that \\&quot;It looks lighter.\\&quot;  The product definitely does lighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is basically a combination of hydrogen peroxide in a delivery medium designed to maximize exposure.  Chamomile, lemon peel extract and other extracts are present though I could only guess at their purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray has a pleasant scent and sprays on as a fine mist.  It is easy to spray the product but I do notice the bottle tends to leak around the nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any breakage or hair damage from using this but then again I&#x27;ve used it 6, maybe 7 times total (daily usage).  I&#x27;ve used straight 3% peroxide in my hair as a lightening agent in the past with no negative results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - despite reading some horror story reviews, I have yet to experience side effects from using this product.  I like how it lightens my hair and so far I have no complaints.  If I do start to see breakage, I will discontinue use at the first sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/28/14:  I have used the entire bottle with no damaging effects on my hair.  I do not use heat to dry my hair - it always dries naturally and I use high quality shampoos and conditioners.  I intend to order more of this product as the results are fantstic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting on to fall now but before summer left us, I used this product to further lighten my hair. I sprayed it on lightly and stayed out in the sun for a short while. I think my hair looks good and yes, very blonde.  A nice product mainly for warm sunny days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural darker blonde and pretty much my whole life I&#x27;ve used Sun-In.  I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on my hair and I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the cost or hassle of professional highlights.  The problems with Sun-In, though, were that (1) it stinks; (2) it doesn&#x27;t always work very well unless you really do it in the actual sun; and (3) Unless you do it in really good sun, like Florida, it kind of looks orangey.    I was about to cave and actually get some professional highlights this winter because my color was so beautiful after this past summer and Sun-In just couldn&#x27;t have done it justice.  But I saw this product and since I love their shampoo and cream rinse I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  BOY am I EVER glad I did!  After just one use - with JUST a hair dryer - my hair once again looks like I just got back from Florida!  A gorgeous blonde color, looks totally natural - and this smells good enough to use it any day after any shower, instead of having to take a shower after I spray it on!  I could not possibly be more excited about the money and time this is going to save me, to say nothing of the access to instantly gorgeous blonde hair whenever I feel like a touch up!  WOW!!!  Forever grateful for this product.</li>
            <li> Works lie promise ...</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for hubby, who has dirty blonde hair and wanted to go a little lighter.  He used it a few times but didn&#x27;t like the smell of it.  According to other reviewers here, it should be used sparingly less it causes breakage.  As a man with short hair, he isn&#x27;t concerned with this problem but doesn&#x27;t want to go bald, either. So while it works, I would hesitate to recommend it to a female blonde who wants to use this on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working great!</li>
            <li> I use it every now and then when my roots get pretty bad. About three uses and they start to blend in better. It says to use heat to intensify the color change, but I do not do it. Doesn&#x27;t seem smart to flat iron hair that I just put peroxide on. Still lightens it just enough. I have been highlighting my hair for several years and have gone from dark brown to now having almost entirely blonde hair--but roots coming in is awful. I&#x27;ve used the lightening spray on two occasions (one about a week ago and the other several months ago) between coloring a and it helps to make my root to regular hair transition much easier. My mother is a cosmetologist and suggests I don&#x27;t use it too often and for too long of periods of time. My hair has always been well taken care of so I would not know how it would affect hair that doesn&#x27;t regularly use high end salon brand shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> FIRST, I am a woman, I&#x27;m just using my husband&#x27;s account to write this review :) -ha. Anyway, I have been using this product for about two years now and I love it. At first, I only wanted to use it to help go longer between professional highlighting. I am a natural blonde, but it&#x27;s kind of dull and I need highlights to make it look dimensional, especially because it&#x27;s so fine. I started by trying to match the color of my roots to my grown-out highlights. I eventually noticed that the lightening spray lightened my natural highlights and brought up the color of my hair, so it looked very natural and really nice. On my next trip to my stylist (who I have been seeing for years and is now a trusted friend who attends family events), he told me that he could sell me a professional coloring and let me pay for it, but that honestly my color looked \\&quot;fabulous\\&quot; and I should just keep doing what I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW..for how I actually use it. The product packaging recommends about 10 uses to get the full impact. I think that 10 is waaaaay too many and likely would lead to damage. I personally find that three uses is the perfect amount for me. Every few months, I treat my regrowth three times and end up bringing my light caramel-y tresses up to a perfect light honey blonde. I think you just have to use common sense and be careful with this product. Treat your hair gently. I only treat my hair on day #3 after a shampoo, so I already have some natural oils for protection. After treating my hair, I also then lightly coat it with a heat styling protectant. All I do is blow dry (no flat irons--I feel that&#x27;s a bit risky), then jump right back in the shower to put on a deep conditioning hair masque. I end up with great color, healthy hair, and just a tiiiiny bit more body than I would have had naturally, which is a plus for me! In between the treatments if my hair does go a little brassier than I&#x27;d like, I just use the purple shampoo a time or two and it&#x27;s back to perfect. Butonce I&#x27;ve reached my three times, the brassiness is totally gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like a lot of the negative reviews reporting brassiness and breakage might come from people who say or perhaps really think that they are a natural blonde, or were one when they were a bit younger, but their blonde is so dark it&#x27;s really a light brown. If you fall into this category, I really think this product probably isn&#x27;t for you and you should only trust your tresses to a trained professional if you want to bring it all the way up to full-on blonde and maintain your hair&#x27;s natural healthy and beauty. Like other reviews have stated, the spray does contain peroxide which does damage the hairshaft; but you cannot *lighten* hair via deposit-only color. Even your pro colorist will tell you that. If you&#x27;re lightening your hair, you&#x27;re damaging it. Full stop. For natural blondes, who tend to have finer and slicker hair texture, this is usually kind of good thing because you get more body after treating your hair. For those who start with drier, coarser texture that often comes with darker shades of hair, this can be a very bad thing--i.e. breakage. I think you just have to know your hair, don&#x27;t expect to go all the way from brown to blonde without any damage, and be nice to your hair in the process. I guess I should also mention that in daily life, I use heat styling sparingly and only use sulfate-free products on my hair.</li>
            <li> I went from dyed black hair to blonde at home. So you can imagine lots of brassy! I started using this spray in hopes of trying to lighten it up without bleaching everytime. It lifted my hair about 2 levels to all one shade. Love this stuff. It&#x27;s not too harsh on your hair if you actually know how to use it. A blonde necessity</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I use it to brighten my naturally medium blonde hair and add dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin and naturally fragile. So I am careful not to overdo the lightening and brightening. I also do deep conditioning treatments. My hair is in great shape even after years of using this product. Also, I don&#x27;t use a lot of styling tools on a regular basis so that helps keep my hair healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great if used in moderation, not used with the highest heat settings and/or used for the appropriate reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to keep your naturally dark hair a light blonde, this is not the product for you. This product is specifically made for those who already have lighter hair but want a boost or a few highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use medium or low heat.&lt;br /&gt;Use once a month, maximum.&lt;br /&gt;Deep condition weekly.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use if you are a regular heat-styler.&lt;br /&gt;Use at your own risk if your hair is darker than a dark blonde, NATURALLY.</li>
            <li> It did not give the results for blending my roots even after ten uses and using the recommended shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my coloured hair and my hair is completely ruined....i had coloured blonde hair and got roots done every 6weeks at my salon....visited salon after using this product and luckily for me my stylist realised i had been using something that was lifting my roots...when i told her she informed me that another girl had used this product an her hair started snapping off...i could no longer get bleach put through my hair and went brunette...i have been brunette 4over a year and my hair is still so damaged i have 2let it grow out before risking putting bleach through it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mite be suitable 4hair that is naturally blonde but certainly not 4hair that is coloured and using 4top up between colour....do not do it...leave it to professionals...i totally miss my blonde hair and wish I&#x27;d never used this awful product!</li>
            <li> I have always been a platinum blonde, but due to my busy schedule over the past few years i haven&#x27;t been able to spend as much time in the sun as i use to so my hair is not lighting naturally like normal. my roots also get the shaft because i always wear my hair up and parted a certain way therefore when i am in the sun it doesn&#x27;t get all of the spots i would like. I started using this product a couple months ago. I dont use it everyday, and have always had split ends and breakage my whole life and i havent had much of a change since i started using this product. I do recommend this product if you like me and truly are a non bottled blonde, it works great with moderation it works great.</li>
            <li> I have naturally bright, blonde hair, but sometimes in the winter, it darkens up a bit.  I like this product, because with a little spray and a blow-dryer, my hair seems to brighten up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> this is a great product. i have very thin, fragile hair and as long as you read the instructions properly, it&#x27;ll be a great product. I get a lot of compliments on my hair now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years on my naturally light reddish-brown, used to be strawberry blonde, hair.  It brings my old color right back so I&#x27;m very pleased.  I generally just spray it on and dry a little and then spend some time outside if possible.  The next morning before I wash it out, I heat it once more with the hair dryer.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out as long as I condition before and after.  If you haven&#x27;t ever had blondish hair, I would never use something like this.  My husbands hair is medium brown and it turns his hair orange.</li>
            <li> for anyone who is unsure about this product. I have been using it for about 4 years now, I have never actually dyed my hair, and I must say the results that come from this little bottle of spray is just amazing. Mind you, I got a little bit of a copper colour when I first started out, but I decided to just keep using it and that went away in no time. I especially love it because it&#x27;s so easy to keep up with my &amp;#34;roots&amp;#34; and such an easy, quick, cheap fix. BUT.. I have never bought off Amazon.. I&#x27;ve been told that these kind of products on this site can sometimes come tampered with (idk how true that is) but I&#x27;m the kind of person that will spend the extra few bucks at the store, just to play it safe. Here&#x27;s a picture of my hair before using sheer blonde, and a photo of my hair currently. It&#x27;s amazing... I highly recommend :) and I hope this helps anyone on the fence about the product, believe me... It took me a few days after buying the very first bottle to decide if I wanted to use it, as I also saw a few bad reviews. Just gotta use it properly</li>
            <li> Since I started using this I have noticed a lot of hair in my hairbrush and in the shower drain. I have followed the instructions, used conditioner also. My hair is a natural shade of darkish blonde and I used to use (years ago) peroxide with no ill effects, but this spray seems to damage my hair. I have hair breaking off and what had been a very thick head of hair is now noticeably thinner.&lt;br /&gt;Even worse the next day I feel little bits of hardened substances as if my scalp has suddenly developed a reaction to this spray.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and did not like what it did to the texture and quality of my hair as it seemed more brittle and prone to breakage.  After reading other reviewers had a similar experience and some reported even worse reactions to this product I was afraid to use it again.  I don&#x27;t think I did any lasting damage to my hair with one use this product but I am going to stick to what my hairdresser applies every five weeks to keep my hair blonde.  It may not be fair to review a product after just one use but my hair is too important to me and I spend too much money on it to risk damage.</li>
            <li> Will lighten hair, but please read the directions carefully and follow them.  Don&#x27;t overuse this product.</li>
            <li> This product works. That is the most important part. Here is the second: La Bella Lightening Gel (same effect&#x27;s, better control, better smell, better color, better consitincy, better direction&#x27;s, no heat, no damage)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does lighten your hair and to lengths you might not have assumed a spray could take your hair too. With that being said: The blow dry, the spray in your face accidents, the sweat, and the extra conditioning treatments/what do I do with this later hassle MIGHT not be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you have roots and no hair appointment that afternoon-it&#x27;s worth it of course! This is not as good as the product I mentioned above BUT IT WORKS FASTER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your head is up s**** creek (literally) this spray will save your a** and give you a pretty result-BUT you will pay for it in one way or another later.</li>
            <li> Most of my coworkers thought I got my hair touched up. I have pretty blonde hair with light brown roots and this product help lighten my roots up to a dirty blonde. Enough to where it can get extend a couple weeks until I need to get my hair done again. :) highly reccommended!</li>
            <li> Good product, fast highlights</li>
            <li> Like it, can&#x27;t say I love it.  I used to use Clairol&#x27;s Touch of Sun (no longer in production) and loved it.  Sun-In turned my hair a coppery gross color.  It makes my dirty-blonde hair the color I want, varying from very very blonde and darker for different sections.  Does take some time to make it the lighter shades and can be annoying to just hold the hairdryer, but I definitly like the idea that I can control how light it is.</li>
