            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Fabulous!!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>This product is my favorite conditioner and shampoo brand!</li>
            <li>I imagine it would be just great for someone with hair not quite so fine.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, conditions well, and no build up over time.  </li>
            <li>but I really think PTR  is the best especial for the price!</li>
            <li>My husband has very curly  hair and thought this was the best conditioner he&#x27;s ever tried.</li>
            <li>It also smells nice.</li>
            <li>Ran into this at a HIlton and really liked it.</li>
            <li>I read so many good comments about this product plus I tried at the Hilton Hotel how come now</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS - I&#x27;ve NEVER done a review before but just wanted to let annnnnnnnnnnyone else to know that the $$ on this is well worth the investment, your hair will thank you!!!</li>
            <li>Start your grooming routine right!!!</li>
            <li>.also has a nice light scent to it!</li>
            <li>I used it all and decided I couldn&#x27;t live without it and found it on here :) very happy with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Very fine conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have definitely noticed a wonderful difference in my otherwise undamaged hair, which I never thought needed more!  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and excellent cream rinse to go along with their Mega Rich Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>i love it and recommend it my hair was thinning so everybody buy it</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I prefer a conditioner that promotes vitamin enriched qualities rather than exotic oils no one has ever heard of.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>LOVE this PRODUCT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it ..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like most conditioners, because I feel like I have to wash my hair again after using them, not so with this one.</li>
            <li>in love with PTR products because Hilton Hotels uses them as samples.</li>
            <li>And I ordered more when I got home.  </li>
            <li>and I will buy more when my supply runs out</li>
            <li>but my husband likes it and plans on buying more when this tube runs out</li>
            <li>I would love to order it again, but I read PTR now tests on animals because they ship to China and it is required for import.</li>
            <li>I found it just to be ok.</li>
            <li>Drug store brands work better</li>
            <li>hair looks healthy ...</li>
            <li>The plastic spring mechanism in the top breaks off.  </li>
            <li>I likely wont buy it again, and will keep looking for the perfect conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really love this conditioner, along with the PTR shampoo.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It filled all my expectations!</li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels after using this product.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>After about two weeks I got the lovely shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and affect this has on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become my favorite.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love both products.</li>
            <li>Love how my hair looks</li>
            <li>you combine the shampoo and conditioner from PTR, it really does an amazing job at treating your hair and scalp to an exhilarating experience.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and shampoo.</li>
            <li>It seems my hair is softer and in better condition</li>
            <li>Love, love it.</li>
            <li>but it smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love the Peter Thomas Roth lotion, so I gave the conditioner a shot, but it really didn&#x27;t make my hair feel great.</li>
            <li>and I found myself having to use more and more of it just to get through the tangles in my hair.</li>
            <li>I feel like BedHead conditioner works way better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it until I find something better, anyway.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the product and the service.</li>
            <li>I love how it softens my hair.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I just love this conditioner and the shampoo now.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is much better than the retail store.</li>
            <li>Definitely all excellent results!</li>
            <li>After they ran out, I ordered more online.  </li>
            <li>You must try the shampoo too :)</li>
            <li>i purchased both the shampoo and conditioner and love both of them.  </li>
            <li>My hair is more managable and shinner.</li>
            <li>I just felt that a cheaper brand of conditioner could have done the job way better than this one .</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;m less concerned with whether or not the packaging is great -- my priority is how great my hair looks each day.  </li>
            <li>Would probably be great for someone with fine to normal hair.</li>
            <li>The best thing about it though, and the reason that I keep using it is that it leaves absolutely no residue on your hair, so no build up over time.</li>
            <li>But this conditioner smooths the frizz considerably and does a great job of defining my \\&quot;sort of\\&quot; curls.</li>
            <li>This conditioner feels great and leaves my hair feeling soft, but manageable.  </li>
            <li>I first tried the mega rich shampoo and conditioner while staying at a Hilton Hotel and loved it.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how full my hair was after sleeping all night!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this line of hair products, they make my hair super soft and silky, plus they smell good!</li>
            <li>If I found out that this product was color-safe, I would strongly consider purchasing it and the shampoo again.</li>
            <li>It was the first sample size at a hotel I ever liked.</li>
            <li>I have always liked Peter Thomas Roth products, but this is the first time I have bought the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I have fine and oily hair.  </li>
            <li>If you just need a switch, this works just fine.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my hair incredible, but does feel a bit lighter when I dry it.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner works well for my fine but voluminous hair.  </li>
            <li>It has a mild smell that mostly washes out, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>smells so good and leaves my hair feeling very soft</li>
            <li>Just wish it was cruelty free.</li>
            <li>found out about it from a hotel stay &amp; liked it so much, decided to order it!&lt;br /&gt;luv</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC</li>
            <li>It works as a great daily conditioner</li>
            <li>There are plenty of cruelty free options to try.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this product is genuine.</li>
            <li>Hair does not feel smooth or conditioned .</li>
            <li>The shampoo is foam-rich and the conditioner makes my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>and it works and keeps hair smooth all day.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>So upon returning home I ordered the products from Amazon, even though they are not so cheap.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Love this product - worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much and wanted to buy it.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>Many higher end shampoos can easily go for $30 a bottle.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo but the conditioner just doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel right.</li>
            <li>I just love them right away.</li>
            <li>I also love the fresh, clean scent and full lather.</li>
            <li>I use it along with the PTR Mega Rich Shampoo.</li>
            <li>It smells good but barely has any effects on my hair.</li>
            <li>I first used Peter Thomas Roth hair care products in a hotel in Florida and discovered they are fabulous!</li>
            <li>I received a sample of the mega rich shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>Feel clean and silk</li>
            <li>My hair seems to drink it up, and it rinses cleanly from my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, clean smell and rinses out easily, leaving hair easy to comb out but not weighted down.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast that was the only good thing!</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a nice clean scent and is not heavy on your hair.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and makes your hair so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It works really well and has a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I have thick wavy/curly hair and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Have tried many of the store bought brands and really prefer the Peter Thomas Roth hair products.</li>
            <li>My Girlfriend loved it and wants more at a later date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how this smells sooooooooo much.</li>
            <li>My husband likes it too and it makes our hair really nice and soft.</li>
            <li>my hair, which is medium length &amp; color treated to cover grays, feels soft and has a nice shine.</li>
            <li>My hair is much smoother and more shiny.</li>
            <li>I should have known not to buy something that is primarily given complimentary at hotels</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this is that it has a pleasing fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This works best for my thin fine hair.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and fresh, not perfume like at all.</li>
            <li>It might work well for someone with super oily hair.</li>
            <li>Super shampoo and conditioner -</li>
            <li>I like many reviewers sampled this at a high end</li>
            <li>I love to try new products.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo and condition ..good for dry hairs..</li>
            <li>It smelled good and refreshing, and it left your hair feel extra clean.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s very creamy!), but it works wonders if you have frizz, waves or curls!</li>
            <li>First tried this when we were in Hawaii and have been using it since!</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair and this stuff gives body and shine, and my blow dry-round brush style holds all day.</li>
            <li>Fine hair is so much more finicky - especially in heat and humidity.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and really healthy.  </li>
            <li>I color my hair professionally and Purology just works so much better for me.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the pain and suffering done to animals for cosmetic research.</li>
            <li>hair feels soft and more manageable ...</li>
            <li>This makes my hair feel soft and healthy</li>
            <li>Rinse it out right away, even as you&#x27;re applying it.</li>
            <li>If you want to treat your scalp right, get this product, gentlemen.  </li>
            <li>right away I ordered some.  </li>
            <li>This Peter Thomas Roth conditioner is hands down the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried on my hair (and I&#x27;ve tried countless brands over the years).</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner more than any other I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Great fragrance, just not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li>The good news:  my hair is not weighed down by the South Florida humidity.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much that I never did make that trip to the store for my regular brand.</li>
            <li>The conditioner of the Hotel was very light yellow</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li>I first used this product at The Hilton in&lt;br /&gt;Santa Fe.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it brings back my shine and manages my hair exactly the way I like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite after years of wishing for just such a conditioner.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s thick and smells great.</li>
            <li>, the price is higher than your mass market hair products but in all reality, this is a mid-range price.</li>
            <li>It really helps to protected colored hair!</li>
            <li>I first used this shampoo when I stayed at&lt;br /&gt;the Hilton Hotel.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product when I stayed at Hilton hotel.</li>
            <li>more then likely going to get more after using current bottle.</li>
            <li>I received delivery of this product right when promised, and I appreciated it that the conditioner was shrink wrapped, so not a drop was lost during shipment.  </li>
            <li>After the samples ran out I continued to use up the rest of my regular products and then ordered a full size bottle of mega rich shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>This smelled so good and helped tame my mane.</li>
            <li>But the one that I received from Amazon had pretty much no smell/perfumed to it</li>
            <li>Crappy hotel shampoo and conditioner is not professional, and I should have known better.  </li>
            <li>My hair is color treated and highlighted and this leaves my hair soft, shiny and full of volume.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended ... a little pricey but good product</li>
            <li>The scent, clean ginger, is amazing but the formula is not moisturizing enough for my very dry hair.</li>
            <li>This brought it back to smooth, shiny and bouncy with the first use.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty important that my conditioner go the extra mile</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than I&#x27;d normally pay, but since I only use the combination a couple of times a week, it evens out.</li>
            <li>Love it, it leaves my hair shinny, soft, I will never buy other conditioners but Thomas Roth Mega Rich Conditioner...</li>
            <li>Having fine colored hair -- I alternate shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>This is a thick conditioner that is okay for my fine hair</li>
            <li>As mentioned in another review I really like Peter Thomas Roth products.  </li>
            <li>this product works very well for my hair type.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my beard.</li>
            <li>thanks Peter Thomas roth.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner - it does everything you&#x27;d expect from a conditioner...</li>
            <li>But I guess there is no way I can really tell...</li>
            <li>also wants to say thank</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t splurge a lot on items like this, but my hair always thanks me.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to put too much conditioner.</li>
            <li>but once I opened the conditioner in the shower...it almost all fell out of the bottle because there&#x27;s soooo much water in this product.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I found them at Amazon.com when I came back to China.</li>
            <li>Everything arrived fast and convenientl.</li>
            <li>The conditioner makes your hair really glamorous.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>My hair is much easier to deal with.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic hair product, especially for curly or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>And the scent is subtle yet pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have enough product in my bathroom I could open my own store....</li>
            <li>I have been pretty lucky to stay at some nice hotels such as Hilton, Intercontinental, Hyatt Regency, Resistance, Andaz, Indigo and a few others.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice that it&#x27;s soo much better than other conditioners that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I first tried this at a Hilton Hotel while on a recent vacation and really could not believe the difference this conditioner made in my hair!!</li>
            <li>somedays it&#x27;s my favorite and other days</li>
            <li>The same product that I have brought from other places smells great (similar to the shampoo) does wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than my previous conditioner.</li>
            <li>and this was just too &amp;#34;weighty&amp;#34; for my particular hair.  </li>
            <li>The lucky thing is, I found it after staying in a hotel that offered it as its daily freebie!</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner and have had numerous compliments since using the Peter Thomas Roth hair products on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>This conditioner from Amazon its more yellow and contains yellow 5 and 6 in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and although the price might seem a little high for some it is a good value, a quality product and actually lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>First it takes quite a bit of conditioner for each use, and I find myself using 2 bottles of conditioner for every bottle of shampoo, which makes this quite expensive, It is certainly not the best detangler on the market either.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this conditioner, actually just expected to because I love the shampoo so much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them and the body lotion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone with thicker hair-</li>
            <li>I am African American and chose to go natural and one of the hardest things is finding a really good mosturizing conditioner, not only do i use the shampoo</li>
            <li>I tried this when I stayed at a hilton hotel and it made my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li>soft and gently gives hair body.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra price.</li>
            <li>This was the complimentary conditioner  at a hotel where I stayed recently</li>
            <li>It works well on thin hair-it&#x27;s not heavy but still rich for easy styling.</li>
            <li>the way it makes hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li>I have definitely tried other conditioners that I like more.</li>
            <li>incredibly soft, silky and shiny!</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft for a couple of days!</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel so silky and soft!</li>
            <li>It felt pulled down rather than light.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair from coloring once a month, and this product really softened my hair and made it feel very moisturized.</li>
            <li>It rinses out squeaky clean and does not weigh down your hair at all.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft , shiny and very manageable,  it is a little pricey, but it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I am 55 years old.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I could NOT get a comb through my long locks after using this product just once for the first time.  </li>
            <li>The second day I shampooed and conditioned my hair, I noticed it felt very silky.</li>
            <li>I use this on my daughters hair and makes it soft, supple and the brush just glides thorough it after we use it.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my curls but tames my wild hair.</li>
            <li>If you have lovely thick hair -- you could use it every time you shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I had used tiny bottles obtained in hotels before, and finally broke down and ordered more.</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life that actually visibly improved my hair from Day 1.</li>
            <li>The aroma isn&#x27;t overwhelming and we only need to use a small amount of the product.</li>
            <li>I honestly think the lowest of the low Suave or Pantene conditioners probably feel better than this because this stuff is crap...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just noticed my hair has a tendency to be straight and doesn&#x27;t hold curls as long after using the curling iron.</li>
            <li>I get the same volume I normally do using a volumizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel thick and full of body!</li>
            <li>Shortly after that my wife and I took a tour to Australia and New Zealand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only very little of it made my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;slippery feel&amp;#34; of some conditioners, but it&#x27;s the only brand I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out so much that it&#x27;s completely frizzy after towel drying.</li>
            <li>Just received and used right away in excitement, and according to past reviews by other users, I thought my long blonde, color treated hair would be so soft and smooth after using it...</li>
            <li>but I know the PTR name and generally like his products.</li>
            <li>It left a lot of buildup on my scalp and after I washed it out my hair didn&#x27;t feel detangled or that soft, even.</li>
            <li>- THEY DO NOT DRY OUT MY HAIR OR CAUSE ANY BUILDUP!&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money because a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for deep-conditioning, thick cream or fairly quick results, don&#x27;t look here.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and on-time, however the bottle was not sealed tight so there was some leakage upon delivery.</li>
            <li>and I have blonde, fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>My hair is is starting to get a little bit frizzy and this really seems to help with that.</li>
            <li>I rate this 5 stars my hair was soft and had a nice shine a little expensive</li>

            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite conditioner and shampoo brand!</li>
            <li> I imagine it would be just great for someone with hair not quite so fine.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, conditions well, and no build up over time.  </li>
            <li> but I really think PTR  is the best especial for the price!</li>
            <li> My husband has very curly  hair and thought this was the best conditioner he&#x27;s ever tried.</li>
            <li> It also smells nice.</li>
            <li> Ran into this at a HIlton and really liked it.</li>
            <li> I read so many good comments about this product plus I tried at the Hilton Hotel how come now</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS - I&#x27;ve NEVER done a review before but just wanted to let annnnnnnnnnnyone else to know that the $$ on this is well worth the investment, your hair will thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Start your grooming routine right!!!</li>
            <li> .also has a nice light scent to it!</li>
            <li> I used it all and decided I couldn&#x27;t live without it and found it on here :) very happy with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> Very fine conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a wonderful difference in my otherwise undamaged hair, which I never thought needed more!  </li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and excellent cream rinse to go along with their Mega Rich Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> i love it and recommend it my hair was thinning so everybody buy it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I prefer a conditioner that promotes vitamin enriched qualities rather than exotic oils no one has ever heard of.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> LOVE this PRODUCT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it ..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like most conditioners, because I feel like I have to wash my hair again after using them, not so with this one.</li>
            <li> in love with PTR products because Hilton Hotels uses them as samples.</li>
            <li> And I ordered more when I got home.  </li>
            <li> and I will buy more when my supply runs out</li>
            <li> but my husband likes it and plans on buying more when this tube runs out</li>
            <li> I would love to order it again, but I read PTR now tests on animals because they ship to China and it is required for import.</li>
            <li> I found it just to be ok.</li>
            <li> Drug store brands work better</li>
            <li> hair looks healthy ...</li>
            <li> The plastic spring mechanism in the top breaks off.  </li>
            <li> I likely wont buy it again, and will keep looking for the perfect conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner, along with the PTR shampoo.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It filled all my expectations!</li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels after using this product.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks I got the lovely shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and affect this has on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become my favorite.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I love both products.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair looks</li>
            <li> you combine the shampoo and conditioner from PTR, it really does an amazing job at treating your hair and scalp to an exhilarating experience.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and shampoo.</li>
            <li> It seems my hair is softer and in better condition</li>
            <li> Love, love it.</li>
            <li> but it smells lovely.  </li>
            <li> I love the Peter Thomas Roth lotion, so I gave the conditioner a shot, but it really didn&#x27;t make my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> and I found myself having to use more and more of it just to get through the tangles in my hair.</li>
            <li> I feel like BedHead conditioner works way better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it until I find something better, anyway.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the product and the service.</li>
            <li> I love how it softens my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I just love this conditioner and the shampoo now.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is much better than the retail store.</li>
            <li> Definitely all excellent results!</li>
            <li> After they ran out, I ordered more online.  </li>
            <li> You must try the shampoo too :)</li>
            <li> i purchased both the shampoo and conditioner and love both of them.  </li>
            <li> My hair is more managable and shinner.</li>
            <li> I just felt that a cheaper brand of conditioner could have done the job way better than this one .</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m less concerned with whether or not the packaging is great -- my priority is how great my hair looks each day.  </li>
            <li> Would probably be great for someone with fine to normal hair.</li>
            <li> The best thing about it though, and the reason that I keep using it is that it leaves absolutely no residue on your hair, so no build up over time.</li>
            <li> But this conditioner smooths the frizz considerably and does a great job of defining my \\&quot;sort of\\&quot; curls.</li>
            <li> This conditioner feels great and leaves my hair feeling soft, but manageable.  </li>
            <li> I first tried the mega rich shampoo and conditioner while staying at a Hilton Hotel and loved it.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how full my hair was after sleeping all night!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this line of hair products, they make my hair super soft and silky, plus they smell good!</li>
            <li> If I found out that this product was color-safe, I would strongly consider purchasing it and the shampoo again.</li>
            <li> It was the first sample size at a hotel I ever liked.</li>
            <li> I have always liked Peter Thomas Roth products, but this is the first time I have bought the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have fine and oily hair.  </li>
            <li> If you just need a switch, this works just fine.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair incredible, but does feel a bit lighter when I dry it.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner works well for my fine but voluminous hair.  </li>
            <li> It has a mild smell that mostly washes out, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> smells so good and leaves my hair feeling very soft</li>
            <li> Just wish it was cruelty free.</li>
            <li> found out about it from a hotel stay &amp; liked it so much, decided to order it!&lt;br /&gt;luv</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC</li>
            <li> It works as a great daily conditioner</li>
            <li> There are plenty of cruelty free options to try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this product is genuine.</li>
            <li> Hair does not feel smooth or conditioned .</li>
            <li> The shampoo is foam-rich and the conditioner makes my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> and it works and keeps hair smooth all day.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> So upon returning home I ordered the products from Amazon, even though they are not so cheap.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Love this product - worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much and wanted to buy it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> Many higher end shampoos can easily go for $30 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo but the conditioner just doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel right.</li>
            <li> I just love them right away.</li>
            <li> I also love the fresh, clean scent and full lather.</li>
            <li> I use it along with the PTR Mega Rich Shampoo.</li>
            <li> It smells good but barely has any effects on my hair.</li>
            <li> I first used Peter Thomas Roth hair care products in a hotel in Florida and discovered they are fabulous!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the mega rich shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> Feel clean and silk</li>
            <li> My hair seems to drink it up, and it rinses cleanly from my hair.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, clean smell and rinses out easily, leaving hair easy to comb out but not weighted down.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast that was the only good thing!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a nice clean scent and is not heavy on your hair.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, and makes your hair so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It works really well and has a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy/curly hair and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Have tried many of the store bought brands and really prefer the Peter Thomas Roth hair products.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend loved it and wants more at a later date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how this smells sooooooooo much.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it too and it makes our hair really nice and soft.</li>
            <li> my hair, which is medium length &amp; color treated to cover grays, feels soft and has a nice shine.</li>
            <li> My hair is much smoother and more shiny.</li>
            <li> I should have known not to buy something that is primarily given complimentary at hotels</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this is that it has a pleasing fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This works best for my thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> Smells clean and fresh, not perfume like at all.</li>
            <li> It might work well for someone with super oily hair.</li>
            <li> Super shampoo and conditioner -</li>
            <li> I like many reviewers sampled this at a high end</li>
            <li> I love to try new products.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and condition ..good for dry hairs..</li>
            <li> It smelled good and refreshing, and it left your hair feel extra clean.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s very creamy!), but it works wonders if you have frizz, waves or curls!</li>
            <li> First tried this when we were in Hawaii and have been using it since!</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and this stuff gives body and shine, and my blow dry-round brush style holds all day.</li>
            <li> Fine hair is so much more finicky - especially in heat and humidity.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and really healthy.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair professionally and Purology just works so much better for me.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth the pain and suffering done to animals for cosmetic research.</li>
            <li> hair feels soft and more manageable ...</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel soft and healthy</li>
            <li> Rinse it out right away, even as you&#x27;re applying it.</li>
            <li> If you want to treat your scalp right, get this product, gentlemen.  </li>
            <li> right away I ordered some.  </li>
            <li> This Peter Thomas Roth conditioner is hands down the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried on my hair (and I&#x27;ve tried countless brands over the years).</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner more than any other I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, just not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> The good news:  my hair is not weighed down by the South Florida humidity.</li>
            <li> I liked them so much that I never did make that trip to the store for my regular brand.</li>
            <li> The conditioner of the Hotel was very light yellow</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li> I first used this product at The Hilton in&lt;br /&gt;Santa Fe.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it brings back my shine and manages my hair exactly the way I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite after years of wishing for just such a conditioner.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thick and smells great.</li>
            <li> , the price is higher than your mass market hair products but in all reality, this is a mid-range price.</li>
            <li> It really helps to protected colored hair!</li>
            <li> I first used this shampoo when I stayed at&lt;br /&gt;the Hilton Hotel.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product when I stayed at Hilton hotel.</li>
            <li> more then likely going to get more after using current bottle.</li>
            <li> I received delivery of this product right when promised, and I appreciated it that the conditioner was shrink wrapped, so not a drop was lost during shipment.  </li>
            <li> After the samples ran out I continued to use up the rest of my regular products and then ordered a full size bottle of mega rich shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> This smelled so good and helped tame my mane.</li>
            <li> But the one that I received from Amazon had pretty much no smell/perfumed to it</li>
            <li> Crappy hotel shampoo and conditioner is not professional, and I should have known better.  </li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and highlighted and this leaves my hair soft, shiny and full of volume.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended ... a little pricey but good product</li>
            <li> The scent, clean ginger, is amazing but the formula is not moisturizing enough for my very dry hair.</li>
            <li> This brought it back to smooth, shiny and bouncy with the first use.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty important that my conditioner go the extra mile</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than I&#x27;d normally pay, but since I only use the combination a couple of times a week, it evens out.</li>
            <li> Love it, it leaves my hair shinny, soft, I will never buy other conditioners but Thomas Roth Mega Rich Conditioner...</li>
            <li> Having fine colored hair -- I alternate shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> This is a thick conditioner that is okay for my fine hair</li>
            <li> As mentioned in another review I really like Peter Thomas Roth products.  </li>
            <li> this product works very well for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my beard.</li>
            <li> thanks Peter Thomas roth.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner - it does everything you&#x27;d expect from a conditioner...</li>
            <li> But I guess there is no way I can really tell...</li>
            <li> also wants to say thank</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t splurge a lot on items like this, but my hair always thanks me.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to put too much conditioner.</li>
            <li> but once I opened the conditioner in the shower...it almost all fell out of the bottle because there&#x27;s soooo much water in this product.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I found them at Amazon.com when I came back to China.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived fast and convenientl.</li>
            <li> The conditioner makes your hair really glamorous.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> My hair is much easier to deal with.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic hair product, especially for curly or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> And the scent is subtle yet pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have enough product in my bathroom I could open my own store....</li>
            <li> I have been pretty lucky to stay at some nice hotels such as Hilton, Intercontinental, Hyatt Regency, Resistance, Andaz, Indigo and a few others.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice that it&#x27;s soo much better than other conditioners that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I first tried this at a Hilton Hotel while on a recent vacation and really could not believe the difference this conditioner made in my hair!!</li>
            <li> somedays it&#x27;s my favorite and other days</li>
            <li> The same product that I have brought from other places smells great (similar to the shampoo) does wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better than my previous conditioner.</li>
            <li> and this was just too &amp;#34;weighty&amp;#34; for my particular hair.  </li>
            <li> The lucky thing is, I found it after staying in a hotel that offered it as its daily freebie!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and have had numerous compliments since using the Peter Thomas Roth hair products on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This conditioner from Amazon its more yellow and contains yellow 5 and 6 in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and although the price might seem a little high for some it is a good value, a quality product and actually lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> First it takes quite a bit of conditioner for each use, and I find myself using 2 bottles of conditioner for every bottle of shampoo, which makes this quite expensive, It is certainly not the best detangler on the market either.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this conditioner, actually just expected to because I love the shampoo so much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them and the body lotion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone with thicker hair-</li>
            <li> I am African American and chose to go natural and one of the hardest things is finding a really good mosturizing conditioner, not only do i use the shampoo</li>
            <li> I tried this when I stayed at a hilton hotel and it made my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li> soft and gently gives hair body.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> This was the complimentary conditioner  at a hotel where I stayed recently</li>
            <li> It works well on thin hair-it&#x27;s not heavy but still rich for easy styling.</li>
            <li> the way it makes hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li> I have definitely tried other conditioners that I like more.</li>
            <li> incredibly soft, silky and shiny!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft for a couple of days!</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel so silky and soft!</li>
            <li> It felt pulled down rather than light.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair from coloring once a month, and this product really softened my hair and made it feel very moisturized.</li>
            <li> It rinses out squeaky clean and does not weigh down your hair at all.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft , shiny and very manageable,  it is a little pricey, but it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I am 55 years old.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I could NOT get a comb through my long locks after using this product just once for the first time.  </li>
            <li> The second day I shampooed and conditioned my hair, I noticed it felt very silky.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughters hair and makes it soft, supple and the brush just glides thorough it after we use it.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my curls but tames my wild hair.</li>
            <li> If you have lovely thick hair -- you could use it every time you shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I had used tiny bottles obtained in hotels before, and finally broke down and ordered more.</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life that actually visibly improved my hair from Day 1.</li>
            <li> The aroma isn&#x27;t overwhelming and we only need to use a small amount of the product.</li>
            <li> I honestly think the lowest of the low Suave or Pantene conditioners probably feel better than this because this stuff is crap...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just noticed my hair has a tendency to be straight and doesn&#x27;t hold curls as long after using the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I get the same volume I normally do using a volumizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel thick and full of body!</li>
            <li> Shortly after that my wife and I took a tour to Australia and New Zealand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only very little of it made my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;slippery feel&amp;#34; of some conditioners, but it&#x27;s the only brand I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out so much that it&#x27;s completely frizzy after towel drying.</li>
            <li> Just received and used right away in excitement, and according to past reviews by other users, I thought my long blonde, color treated hair would be so soft and smooth after using it...</li>
            <li> but I know the PTR name and generally like his products.</li>
            <li> It left a lot of buildup on my scalp and after I washed it out my hair didn&#x27;t feel detangled or that soft, even.</li>
            <li> - THEY DO NOT DRY OUT MY HAIR OR CAUSE ANY BUILDUP!&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money because a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for deep-conditioning, thick cream or fairly quick results, don&#x27;t look here.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and on-time, however the bottle was not sealed tight so there was some leakage upon delivery.</li>
            <li> and I have blonde, fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> My hair is is starting to get a little bit frizzy and this really seems to help with that.</li>
            <li> I rate this 5 stars my hair was soft and had a nice shine a little expensive</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t particularly dry, normally I don&#x27;t have a problem with dryness at all, but this conditioner is really not working well.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft, but not weighed down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive than I usually pay, but I think worth it.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> feels dry after same with condtioner</li>
            <li> If you want to invest in a non-professional conditioner, just go to your local grocery/drug store and buy the same size (8.5 oz) hair shampoo and conditioner in another well-known brand for half the price of this, as you&#x27;ll get the same effect!</li>
            <li> Not only is this conditioner hydrating (I have very dry, frizzy hair)</li>
            <li> I am going to use them in a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very wavy, thick and long hair</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem getting a comb through my long, color treated hair, which is always on the slightly dry side, but I have always used &amp;#34;PROFESSIONAL&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have long hair which I color, so it can get quite dry at times.</li>
            <li> I color my hair and blow dry it almost every day.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels dry after using</li>
            <li> Helps you, if your Hair is dry.</li>
            <li> shampoo have made a total difference to my hair (which is naturally curly and  thick</li>
            <li> You go from dull and dry to shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> It was not available locally</li>
            <li> well not really,</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s about it not very nourishing to hair</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all and as long as I blow dry my hair upside down</li>
            <li> I have dry, dry, thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will buy again as well as other PTR products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten rid of all the other conditioners and shampoo collecting dust under my counter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go to any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other brands.</li>
            <li> We stumbled onto them while staying in several upscale hotels over the past year.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling either slippery, heavy, or limp.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair dry, brittle, and stiff.</li>
            <li> He has thick curly coarse hair</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down nor leave a film</li>
            <li> This results in a waste of the product due to the conditioner pouring out.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy on top/curly underneath hair</li>
            <li> It is poor hair conditioner, the hair are still tangled and difficult to manage, it has no aroma of the true Peter Thomas product.</li>
            <li> I have thick dry hair and this helps.</li>
            <li> When visiting our son in San Diego, we stayed at a hotel that provided little containers of Peter Thomas Roth shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I had a little sample of this from Sephora I think</li>
            <li> Just a little dab will do ya...</li>
            <li> I tried it at Hilton few months ago, then decided to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair is dull, sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product isn&#x27;t working for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I use it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and no better than anything I can buy locally</li>
            <li> It takes just a small amount to de-tangle your hair</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> My hair is hard to manage and sticks out all over when I use this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> Her hair looks opaque and dull.</li>
            <li> and I hate to brag to much on it because sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s probably a bit too heavy for thin hair</li>
            <li> Its actually not rich at all and rather thin and lame.  </li>
            <li> Always use this, but the last one I received has no perfume smell..very disappointed</li>
            <li> Overall disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> I tired this during a hotel stay  </li>
            <li> Ihave even wondered if it is fake.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> It was expensive.</li>
            <li> , it is way toooooooooooooo expensive a price for this non-professional, drying hair product.  </li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> Is this conditioner a fake!.</li>
            <li> Thus, I do not feel bad about paying the asking price for Peter Thomas Roth hair products.</li>
            <li> my hair is ugly.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment this was!  </li>
            <li> So disappointing!</li>
            <li> it was broken and all my books were in this wondeful conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> This was for my husband whose hair was misbehaving terribly.</li>

            <li> Love my hair since I started using this stuff! Just wish it was cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Great Product!! Excellent size!! Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> found out about it from a hotel stay &amp; liked it so much, decided to order it!&lt;br /&gt;luv the way it makes hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair feel soft and really healthy.  I color my hair and blow dry it almost every day.  I&#x27;ve been using Aveda products which are also very good, but the Peter Thomas Roth products are awesome. I noticed a difference the first time I used them.  I highly reccomend them.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner you will ever use.</li>
            <li> Hair is gathered up with moisture. The smell is good, too</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Leaves hair shiny, nourished, and manageable.</li>
            <li> I would not use anything else, have used peter Thomas conditioner for sometime now. I&#x27;ve never had any problems with residue left over,.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in another review I really like Peter Thomas Roth products.  This works as advertised. I will buy again as well as other PTR products.</li>
            <li> Hooked on product after using at hotel</li>
            <li> i love it and recommend it my hair was thinning so everybody buy it and you will not regret it .</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product isn&#x27;t working for me.  I&#x27;m a purology girl and thought I would try something different.. I color my hair professionally and Purology just works so much better for me.</li>
            <li> I love all their produt!!! I would keep buying</li>
            <li> Good stuff for colored hair!</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair dry, brittle, and stiff. I have definitely tried other conditioners that I like more. My hair isn&#x27;t particularly dry, normally I don&#x27;t have a problem with dryness at all, but this conditioner is really not working well. It might work well for someone with super oily hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I will ever use. Absolutely love it. I have used this brand since I tried a sample at a Hilton hotel and will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> As noted, a good product.  But the tube will not snap shut, so the conditioner leaks, especially during travel.  For me, that&#x27;s a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I ever use. It works well on thin hair-it&#x27;s not heavy but still rich for easy styling.</li>
            <li> smells so good and leaves my hair feeling very soft</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product while staying at a Hilton resort in Tucson.  I have fine and oily hair.  It works really well and has a lovely fragrance.  I do not use it every time I shampoo.  I only use it when I use the PTR matching shampoo.Having fine colored hair -- I alternate shampoos and conditioners.  If you have lovely thick hair -- you could use it every time you shampoo.  Fine hair is so much more finicky - especially in heat and humidity.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome.  My hair was getting out of control.  This brought it back to smooth, shiny and bouncy with the first use.</li>
            <li> I prefer a conditioner that promotes vitamin enriched qualities rather than exotic oils no one has ever heard of. this product works very well for my hair type.</li>
            <li> excellent hair conditioner</li>
            <li> I first used this product at The Hilton in&lt;br /&gt;Santa Fe.  I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my beard.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this was just too &amp;#34;weighty&amp;#34; for my particular hair.  I imagine it would be just great for someone with hair not quite so fine.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it brings back my shine and manages my hair exactly the way I like it. thanks Peter Thomas roth.</li>
            <li> I first tried this at a Hilton Hotel while on a recent vacation and really could not believe the difference this conditioner made in my hair!! I am African American and chose to go natural and one of the hardest things is finding a really good mosturizing conditioner, not only do i use the shampoo but I leave the conditioner in my hair as a leave in conditioner and need no further hair supplies!!! I&#x27;ve gotten rid of all the other conditioners and shampoo collecting dust under my counter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this PRODUCT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - I&#x27;ve NEVER done a review before but just wanted to let annnnnnnnnnnyone else to know that the $$ on this is well worth the investment, your hair will thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Hair feels dry after using</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this line of hair products, they make my hair super soft and silky, plus they smell good!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!  Makes my hair feel thick and full of body!</li>
            <li> I love it ..good .. Feel clean and silk I recomende to user . Good shampoo and condition ..good for dry hairs..</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo but the conditioner just doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel right. My hair is hard to manage and sticks out all over when I use this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is a thick conditioner that is okay for my fine hair but my daughter loves it and she has coarse, somewhat curly hair.</li>
            <li> Like others, I used this conditioner (and the shampoo) at a Hilton Hotel.  It works great, and is very light.  I don&#x27;t like most conditioners, because I feel like I have to wash my hair again after using them, not so with this one.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling either slippery, heavy, or limp. My hair seems to drink it up, and it rinses cleanly from my hair. It&#x27;s my favorite after years of wishing for just such a conditioner. The lucky thing is, I found it after staying in a hotel that offered it as its daily freebie! Thank you, whichever hotel you were.</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this product...somedays it&#x27;s my favorite and other days I&#x27;m not sure why I use it...Great fragrance, just not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE COMPARED TO THE SALON PRICE - LOVE THIS BRAND AND THE HAIR PRODUCTS SMELL FANTASTIC - THEY DO NOT DRY OUT MY HAIR OR CAUSE ANY BUILDUP!&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!</li>
            <li> Def recommend to anybody.  Does a great job :-)&lt;br /&gt;Fell in love with PTR products because Hilton Hotels uses them as samples.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from drying out</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner - it does everything you&#x27;d expect from a conditioner...but it is definitely not a &amp;#34;Mega-Rich&amp;#34; conditioner, whatsoever.  It works as a great daily conditioner but if you&#x27;re looking for deep-conditioning, thick cream or fairly quick results, don&#x27;t look here.  If you just need a switch, this works just fine.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner!  Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go to any other conditioner. This works best for my thin fine hair. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other brands.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product as a guest in a hotel on extended stay.  Since I would be there for a while, I opted not to pack my regular shampoo and conditioner, but planned to pick some up when I got to my destination.  As does happen, I didn&#x27;t make the trip to the store upon arrival, and used the hotel supplied products.  I liked them so much that I never did make that trip to the store for my regular brand. And I ordered more when I got home.  It has a nice smell, conditions well, and no build up over time.  The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; about this product is that it does not indicate whether it is color-safe.  I used this product for almost a year, and then switched when I suspected it (or the shampoo) might be interfering with the longevity of my color application (but this might just be the changing texture of my hair).  If I found out that this product was color-safe, I would strongly consider purchasing it and the shampoo again.</li>
            <li> Only very little of it made my hair smooth and soft. And the scent is subtle yet pleasant. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. It has met and exceeded my expectations and I will buy more when my supply runs out</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner I rate this 5 stars my hair was soft and had a nice shine a little expensive but my husband likes it and plans on buying more when this tube runs out .also has a nice light scent to it!</li>
            <li> This smelled so good and helped tame my mane. I would love to order it again, but I read PTR now tests on animals because they ship to China and it is required for import. I wish they didn&#x27;t, this may have been in my regimen for years to come. It isn&#x27;t worth the pain and suffering done to animals for cosmetic research. There are plenty of cruelty free options to try.</li>
            <li> Enriches, moisturizes. Smells great:fresh, but not flowery.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this conditioner, actually just expected to because I love the shampoo so much. I found it just to be ok. First it takes quite a bit of conditioner for each use, and I find myself using 2 bottles of conditioner for every bottle of shampoo, which makes this quite expensive, It is certainly not the best detangler on the market either. The best thing about it though, and the reason that I keep using it is that it leaves absolutely no residue on your hair, so no build up over time. It rinses out squeaky clean and does not weigh down your hair at all. Smells clean and fresh, not perfume like at all.</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo and conditioner is the best! I have tried a lot of different products but I really think PTR  is the best especial for the price!</li>
            <li> I started using this conditioner (and shampoo) after trying it at a Hilton Hotel. It was the first sample size at a hotel I ever liked. I have been using it since. I have thick wavy/curly hair and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I had tried a sample of the conditioner while visiting a friend.  I loved it.  It was not available locally so I ordered it.  It does not seem to be the same product.  I will not buy this product again.  It&#x27;s expensive and no better than anything I can buy locally</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this product is genuine. I tried it at Hilton few months ago, then decided to find it on Amazon. It is poor hair conditioner, the hair are still tangled and difficult to manage, it has no aroma of the true Peter Thomas product. Will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> dont use too often.  Think it drys out hair.</li>
            <li> I tried these products at a hotel I was staying at in San Diego and just had to order them. They truly have a wonderful scent and give my hair tons of body and it just looks great after I use the shampoo and conditioner. Highly recommend them and the body lotion. I&#x27;ve never tried a cream like this that truly hydrates, is not greasy at all and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Remarkable difference!  You go from dull and dry to shiny and soft.  Love this conditioner more than any other I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and excellent cream rinse to go along with their Mega Rich Shampoo.  Have tried many of the store bought brands and really prefer the Peter Thomas Roth hair products.</li>
            <li> Smells good , I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s fine... Hair does not feel smooth or conditioned . Good smell that&#x27;s about all . Drug store brands work better</li>
            <li> Great product ...hair looks healthy ... hair feels soft and more manageable ... highly recommended ... a little pricey but good product</li>
            <li> The same product that I have brought from other places smells great (similar to the shampoo) does wonders for my hair. But the one that I received from Amazon had pretty much no smell/perfumed to it and  my hair also feels different after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know why or if it is a newer formulation. Ihave even wondered if it is fake. But I guess there is no way I can really tell...</li>
            <li> We used this brand at the Hilton in Barbados. My husband has very curly  hair and thought this was the best conditioner he&#x27;s ever tried. Now we order it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Had a beneficial effect on my scalp/hair;&lt;br /&gt;could be priced 20% lower. That would move it&lt;br /&gt;from 4 to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend loved it and wants more at a later date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also wants to say thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kurt</li>
            <li> When visiting our son in San Diego, we stayed at a hotel that provided little containers of Peter Thomas Roth shampoo and conditioner.  They are terrific products!  I don&#x27;t splurge a lot on items like this, but my hair always thanks me.  I received delivery of this product right when promised, and I appreciated it that the conditioner was shrink wrapped, so not a drop was lost during shipment.  I&#x27;ll order this again!</li>
            <li> The Peter Thomas Roth Mega Rich Conditioner is a very good product. I went on vacation and they had it at the hotel we stayed and I desided to order it here on Amazon.I found it here and it was a great price and very good and fast service. I am very happy with product and service.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product!  I used a sample in a hotel and have been purchasing online ever since!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and have had numerous compliments since using the Peter Thomas Roth hair products on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair soft and silky.  The only drawback is the container in which the conditioner is stored.  The plastic spring mechanism in the top breaks off.  This results in a waste of the product due to the conditioner pouring out.</li>
            <li> Love it, it leaves my hair shinny, soft, I will never buy other conditioners but Thomas Roth Mega Rich Conditioner...</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel soft and healthy</li>
            <li> .I have found that Peter Thomas Roth Mega Rich Conditioner to be a very effective treatment for my hair in addiiton to having a wonderful fragrence</li>
            <li> Made in China. Still good product though. Will not use anymore.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair incredible, but does feel a bit lighter when I dry it.  I likely wont buy it again, and will keep looking for the perfect conditioner.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old. This is the first shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life that actually visibly improved my hair from Day 1. I had used tiny bottles obtained in hotels before, and finally broke down and ordered more. I have fine, straight hair and this stuff gives body and shine, and my blow dry-round brush style holds all day. Smells good too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner, along with the PTR shampoo.  Both products are great.  Personally, I&#x27;m less concerned with whether or not the packaging is great -- my priority is how great my hair looks each day.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Always use this, but the last one I received has no perfume smell..very disappointed</li>
            <li> This is a great volumizing  conditioner, love it.</li>
            <li> It filled all my expectations!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a nice clean scent and is not heavy on your hair. My hair is color treated and highlighted and this leaves my hair soft, shiny and full of volume.  It does not weigh my hair down nor leave a film and I find that my hair holds my style longer. I use it along with the PTR Mega Rich Shampoo. Love!</li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels after using this product. Price is way cheaper on amazon than buying it at Macys. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the tube like others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I had a sample at a hotel and I loved the way my hair looked and felt. Great fragrance. Leaves my hair shiny and manageable. You don&#x27;t need to put too much conditioner. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love how this smells sooooooooo much. I had a little sample of this from Sephora I think and I fell in love. I used it all and decided I couldn&#x27;t live without it and found it on here :) very happy with this conditioner. My husband likes it too and it makes our hair really nice and soft. He has thick curly coarse hair and I have blonde, fine, thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all and as long as I blow dry my hair upside down I get the same volume I normally do using a volumizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> The scent, clean ginger, is amazing but the formula is not moisturizing enough for my very dry hair. Would probably be great for someone with fine to normal hair.</li>
            <li> Just got this today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it so I could have &amp;#34;Mega Rich&amp;#34; beautiful hair...but once I opened the conditioner in the shower...it almost all fell out of the bottle because there&#x27;s soooo much water in this product. Its actually not rich at all and rather thin and lame.  I honestly think the lowest of the low Suave or Pantene conditioners probably feel better than this because this stuff is crap...I&#x27;m going to call Amazon and return it tomorrow if I can....</li>
            <li> I have enough product in my bathroom I could open my own store....well not really, but I have a TON of stuff. I love to try new products. I knew the Peter Thomas Roth name, but I had not tried any products from this line. I have dry hair from coloring once a month, and this product really softened my hair and made it feel very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I used these Peter Thomas Roth Mega-Rich Shampoo and Conditioner when I stayed in Hilton Hotel in Boston. They smell wonderful. The shampoo is foam-rich and the conditioner makes my hair smooth. I just love them right away.I tried to buy them at Macy&#x27;s, Sephora, DUANEreade but they are not sold in these places. Fortunately I found them at Amazon.com when I came back to China. After about two weeks I got the lovely shampoo and conditioner. I bought two pairs. I am going to use them in a long time.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and affect this has on my hair.  It&#x27;s become my favorite. I had used it on a hotel stay over that had it in the rooms. Glad I found it on Amazon. Great compliment to the shampoo.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and is a most wonderful conditioner for my hair.  I absolutely love it.  The conditioner with the shampoo is perfect for my hair.  I love both products.</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner - smells good.  Good price for the product.  I used to use WEN but it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> Overall I like this conditioner, it&#x27;s thick and smells great. I don&#x27;t really notice that it&#x27;s soo much better than other conditioners that I&#x27;ve used but I know the PTR name and generally like his products.</li>
            <li> This works beautifully with the shampoo. I was given a sample of the conditioner and loved it and will continue to order both products.</li>
            <li> I tired this during a hotel stay  - I had not brought my shampoo and conditioner - so I used whatever was there.  Now we all buy it.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair looks</li>
            <li> This conditioner adds softness and shine to my hair. It&#x27;s a little more expensive than I usually pay, but I think worth it.  It has a mild smell that mostly washes out, which I appreciate. I have thick dry hair and this helps.</li>
            <li> Very fine conditioner.  I had recieved a sample at the Hilton Resort in Honolulu and knew it was good.  Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Conditioner is great. It takes just a small amount to de-tangle your hair and I recommend you do not leave it in. Rinse it out right away, even as you&#x27;re applying it. It also smells nice. I have coarse and somewhat wavy hair and it works and keeps hair smooth all day. Works esp well when used w/the shampoo. The delivery was fast and on-time, however the bottle was not sealed tight so there was some leakage upon delivery.</li>
            <li> If you want to treat your scalp right, get this product, gentlemen.  Start your grooming routine right!!!</li>
            <li> I have been pretty lucky to stay at some nice hotels such as Hilton, Intercontinental, Hyatt Regency, Resistance, Andaz, Indigo and a few others. All of them give you mini bottles of shampoo and conditioner. The best shampoo and conditioner that I have used have come from the Hilton and were from the Peter Thomas Roth collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you combine the shampoo and conditioner from PTR, it really does an amazing job at treating your hair and scalp to an exhilarating experience. With extended use, your hair becomes stronger, thicker, and softer. The scent is also lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the price is higher than your mass market hair products but in all reality, this is a mid-range price. Many higher end shampoos can easily go for $30 a bottle. Thus, I do not feel bad about paying the asking price for Peter Thomas Roth hair products.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and shampoo. Used it at at Hilton Hotel and had to buy some for myself. Worth the extra price.</li>
            <li> Super shampoo and conditioner -</li>
            <li> I tried this when I stayed at a hilton hotel and it made my hair so soft!! I love it!</li>
            <li> Was received timely and was what I wanted.  Would recommend to others if they need conditioner and do not mind ordering.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t really like this conditioner. It left a lot of buildup on my scalp and after I washed it out my hair didn&#x27;t feel detangled or that soft, even. I have bleached, 3b/3c curly hair so it&#x27;s pretty important that my conditioner go the extra mile and this one just didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I first tried the mega rich shampoo and conditioner while staying at a Hilton Hotel and loved it. I have since ordered on Amazon and just placed my second order. It seems my hair is softer and in better condition everytime I use it. Highly recommended and although the price might seem a little high for some it is a good value, a quality product and actually lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> Love, love it. One of the best product I have found in awhile fort hair. ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> This was the complimentary conditioner  at a hotel where I stayed recently and it smelled so  wonderful that I immediately ran to amazon and bought the full size bottle.  It smells amazing, and makes your hair so soft and shiny.  Love it, even if it IS expensive.</li>
            <li> Not only is this conditioner hydrating (I have very dry, frizzy hair) but it smells lovely.  I have always liked Peter Thomas Roth products, but this is the first time I have bought the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I like this conditioner.  The aroma isn&#x27;t overwhelming and we only need to use a small amount of the product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these products.  We stumbled onto them while staying in several upscale hotels over the past year.  They have a wonderful smell that is very distinct.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have found.  Friends and family remark on how good mg hair looks and it feels great.</li>
            <li> I love the Peter Thomas Roth lotion, so I gave the conditioner a shot, but it really didn&#x27;t make my hair feel great. It felt pulled down rather than light. I have very wavy, thick and long hair and I found myself having to use more and more of it just to get through the tangles in my hair. I feel like BedHead conditioner works way better. Good smell though..</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and compliment to the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth is a great product and I hate to brag to much on it because sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get. The conditioner is every thing you want in a product. It keeps your hair shiney and manageable.</li>
            <li> Bought this with the shampoo, and it&#x27;s been great to my hair. It&#x27;s more than I&#x27;d normally pay, but since I only use the combination a couple of times a week, it evens out. This doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;slippery feel&amp;#34; of some conditioners, but it&#x27;s the only brand I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out so much that it&#x27;s completely frizzy after towel drying. I&#x27;ll keep using it until I find something better, anyway.</li>
            <li> Used the conditioner in conjunction with the shampoo in Hawaii so tried it at home.  It really helps to protected colored hair!</li>
            <li> I also discovered this product at Hilton hotel. I was literally amazed how even after 1 wash this conditioner + shampoo have made a total difference to my hair (which is naturally curly and  thick and I straighten it every day) - incredibly soft, silky and shiny! Unbelievable. So upon returning home I ordered the products from Amazon, even though they are not so cheap. Everything arrived fast and convenientl. I have already ordered them for my sister too. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The conditioner makes your hair really glamorous. for styling its no longer tangled, the finish is shiny. Helps you, if your Hair is dry.</li>
            <li> soft and gently gives hair body. i bought extra for friends who have the same problem as I do. thanks</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditioner I have ever used.  I use the shampoo also and I will probably never switch to another brand.  I washed my hair the day before and when I woke up the next morning I could not believe how full my hair was after sleeping all night! Fabulous!!</li>
            <li> This Peter Thomas Roth conditioner is hands down the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried on my hair (and I&#x27;ve tried countless brands over the years). I have long, thick, wavy on top/curly underneath hair and it&#x27;s a bit on the frizzy side too. Ugh. But this conditioner smooths the frizz considerably and does a great job of defining my \\&quot;sort of\\&quot; curls. I highly recommend this product for anyone with thicker hair- it&#x27;s probably a bit too heavy for thin hair (it&#x27;s very creamy!), but it works wonders if you have frizz, waves or curls! I won&#x27;t use anything else now- it&#x27;s worth the money because a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the product and the service. Everything went well. I am happy with my purchase and with purchase again.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smooth and silky. I love how it softens my hair. Definitely a must. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This conditioner feels great and leaves my hair feeling soft, but manageable.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I just love this conditioner and the shampoo now.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft for a couple of days! I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair daily! I love this!</li>
            <li> Love this product - worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I also use the shampoo to start than use the conditioner.  Just a little dab will do ya...The good news:  my hair is not weighed down by the South Florida humidity.</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite conditioner and shampoo brand! Both make my hair feel so great!  First tried this when we were in Hawaii and have been using it since!</li>
            <li> Overall disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY love this amazing product!!! Smells great!!</li>
            <li> It smells good but barely has any effects on my hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful service and product</li>
            <li> I first used this shampoo when I stayed at&lt;br /&gt;the Hilton Hotel. I liked it so much and wanted to buy it. It gives my hair body and doesn&#x27;t build up. It is hard to find in the store. I finally found it in the beauty supply store. It was expensive. Amazon&#x27;s price is much better than the retail store.</li>
            <li> This lasts longer than the shampoo, feels great, smells amazing, and deserves the 5 thumbs up</li>
            <li> I first used Peter Thomas Roth hair care products in a hotel in Florida and discovered they are fabulous! When I got back home, I ordered both shampoo and conditioner and used them at home now.  I have definitely noticed a wonderful difference in my otherwise undamaged hair, which I never thought needed more!  My hair is softer, shinier, springier and has a thicker feel to it.  Definitely all excellent results!</li>
            <li> I took the samples home from my hotel.  After they ran out, I ordered more online.  I think it&#x27;s better than my previous conditioner.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the mega rich shampoo &amp; conditioner. It made my hair feel so silky and soft! After the samples ran out I continued to use up the rest of my regular products and then ordered a full size bottle of mega rich shampoo &amp; conditioner. The switch has been great- my hair, which is medium length &amp; color treated to cover grays, feels soft and has a nice shine. I would recommend these products &amp; will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works well for my fine but voluminous hair.  It has a pleasant, clean smell and rinses out easily, leaving hair easy to comb out but not weighted down.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product when I stayed at Hilton hotel. It smelled good and refreshing, and it left your hair feel extra clean.  good stuff. more then likely going to get more after using current bottle.</li>
            <li> it was broken and all my books were in this wondeful conditioner!!!:(((((((((((((((</li>
            <li> Ran into this at a HIlton and really liked it. I decided to try a bigger bottle and it did not disapoint. My hair is is starting to get a little bit frizzy and this really seems to help with that. My hair is much smoother and more shiny. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment this was!  Just received and used right away in excitement, and according to past reviews by other users, I thought my long blonde, color treated hair would be so soft and smooth after using it...WRONG!  I could NOT get a comb through my long locks after using this product just once for the first time.  I have never had a problem getting a comb through my long, color treated hair, which is always on the slightly dry side, but I have always used &amp;#34;PROFESSIONAL&amp;#34; salon products, so what a mistake I made buying this stuff.  I should have known not to buy something that is primarily given complimentary at hotels...shame on me.  Crappy hotel shampoo and conditioner is not professional, and I should have known better.  The only good thing about this is that it has a pleasing fragrance.  Other than that, it is way toooooooooooooo expensive a price for this non-professional, drying hair product.  If you want to invest in a non-professional conditioner, just go to your local grocery/drug store and buy the same size (8.5 oz) hair shampoo and conditioner in another well-known brand for half the price of this, as you&#x27;ll get the same effect!</li>
            <li> I have dry, dry, thick, coarse hair. And this shampoo conditioner delivers. My hair IS conditioned. I also love the fresh, clean scent and full lather. You must try the shampoo too :)</li>
            <li> I like many reviewers sampled this at a high end Hilton resort while on vacation in San Diego, and  I fell in love with both the  shampoo and the conditioner!!! It makes my hair feel soft , shiny and very manageable,  it is a little pricey, but it is well worth the money.  I will continue to order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> i purchased both the shampoo and conditioner and love both of them.  Leaves my hair very soft, but not weighed down.</li>
            <li> I use this at a hotel and loved it! I found it on Amazon at a very good price so I bought it. My hair is more managable and shinner.I also use the conditioner as well but I use them togther at the same time. Very happy!!</li>
            <li> PETER THOMAS ROTH  Shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylus said I should be using a conditioner.  Shortly after that my wife and I took a tour to Australia and New Zealand.&lt;br /&gt;While there I used  the Roth shampoo and conditioner that was supplied in some of the hotels.  It is great and right away I ordered some.  I like it and so did by stylus.  My hair is much easier to deal with.  I&#x27;ll continue using it.  On the market there are all kinds of shampoos and conditioners that I have used, but for me, I&#x27;ll stay with the PETER THOMAS ROTH brand.</li>
            <li> Just the opposite effect from the conditioner I tried at the Hilton Hotel. This conditioner from Amazon its more yellow and contains yellow 5 and 6 in the ingredients. The conditioner of the Hotel was very light yellow almost cream color and fragrant. Is this conditioner a fake!. My hair is dull, sticky and heavy. I just felt that a cheaper brand of conditioner could have done the job way better than this one . So disappointing! I read so many good comments about this product plus I tried at the Hilton Hotel how come now my hair is ugly. I tried it in my daughter&#x27;s hair and the same result. Her hair looks opaque and dull. I am not going to order it ever again! The delivery was fast that was the only good thing!</li>
            <li> Very good. I recommend!</li>
            <li> This was for my husband whose hair was misbehaving terribly. He loves this!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great but that&#x27;s about it not very nourishing to hair feels dry after same with condtioner</li>
            <li> This was in our condo at the resort. The second day I shampooed and conditioned my hair, I noticed it felt very silky. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to order it. I&#x27;ve just noticed my hair has a tendency to be straight and doesn&#x27;t hold curls as long after using the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughters hair and makes it soft, supple and the brush just glides thorough it after we use it.  Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft without weighing it down.  I have long hair which I color, so it can get quite dry at times.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic hair product, especially for curly or frizzy hair. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found. It keeps my curls but tames my wild hair.</li>
