            <li>New product for me, so far does an amazing job, but still kind of new for a review, but the five stars are for customer service!</li>
            <li>I used this last week: exercised then took a long shower, scrubbed off a layer of my skin, then used the St Thomas self tanning foam, and I still have a great tan!  </li>
            <li>WORTH EVERY $$$</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this based on the reviews and didn&#x27;t even care about the high price.</li>
            <li>so I had very smooth and even skin for my next tan session.  </li>
            <li>my tan has been more even &amp; longer lasting.</li>
            <li>My first time I did on my arms</li>
            <li>Finally, I don&#x27;t have to walk around embarrassed anymore! :)</li>
            <li>My arms look better, I used to have the keratosis pilaris bumps, and tried the creams, the baiden mottos the only thought cleared them up.  </li>
            <li>The 2nd time it worked much better</li>
            <li>It made my skin silky soft after the first use!  </li>
            <li>so my legs didn&#x27;t get exposed to the sun that much</li>
            <li>and I do think it went on much smoother and streak-free.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I has read so many reviews on other sites, all positive and finally made the purchase.</li>
            <li>What I was not expecting, was the owner to reach right back and explain what was happening...</li>
            <li>I used it at the end of showers to scrub my legs and get any old tanning product off</li>

            <li>As a tanning industry professional this product does work.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t remove old tan residue</li>
            <li>I rinse it out with really hot water when I&#x27;m done then hang it outside to dry.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about a loofah mitt that cost this much, however justified it by the company&#x27;s money back guarantee as well as a two year life span.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It really works great. I use it specifically to get rid of fading spray tan and to prep my skin for the next spray. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Very interesting product. My skin was never sensitive to the mitt so I was very lucky. I used it at the end of showers to scrub my legs and get any old tanning product off and boy did this thing work! After I got the mitt in the mail I received numerous follow up emails from the maker of the product giving me great tips and checking on my satisfaction. I use the mitt all the time and my skin feels softer and smoother. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I love my Tan Mitt - it is one of the best purchases I have made for my skin. I do spray tan and since I started using the mitten my tan has been more even &amp; longer lasting. I have been recommending this to all of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> These things are wonderful.  I have used others that were way, way too rough, and I do not have particularly sensitive skin.  I use it on my face, including lips, every day.  I heartily recommend this product!</li>
            <li> very effective!  removed my self tanner completely so I had very smooth and even skin for my next tan session.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a filipino and hispanic male, both these races can be fairly dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up I was left in the sun with a tan on my arms and face, which is known as a farmers tan. I didn&#x27;t wear shorts so my legs didn&#x27;t get exposed to the sun that much, they&#x27;re a different tone from my arms. This gives me my insecurity of wearing shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing how this says it removes tan, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. My first time I did on my arms I noticed the dead skin rolling off, i also used it on my legs. When I went to go tan (covering my arms and wearing a hat), I did notice my legs got a nice tan 2-3 days into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use the mitten for the second time on my arms the dead skin rolled off, but the next day my arms barely looked lighter. It&#x27;s true it gives you a nice tan, but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people with farmers tans. It also leaves your skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST exfoliating item I&#x27;ve ever used! Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> As a tanning industry professional this product does work. however you can buy the same thing for $10 (korean body scrub mitt).</li>
            <li> GOT MY SPLOTCHY SPRAY TAN OFF! :) Finally, I don&#x27;t have to walk around embarrassed anymore! :)</li>
            <li> I love this mitten!  It made my skin silky soft after the first use!  Work&#x27;s great to take off sunless tanning product too!! I love it!  I use it twice a week for best results. Anyone who spray tans should use this! It makes your tan so much more even and it lasts alot longer too!! I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Hands down the absolute BEST exfoliation product on the market!  I was skeptical about a loofah mitt that cost this much, however justified it by the company&#x27;s money back guarantee as well as a two year life span. And the customer service and support from this seller was top notcg, unlike any you experience with most. WORTH EVERY $$$</li>
            <li> I has read so many reviews on other sites, all positive and finally made the purchase. I was so excited to try this based on the reviews and didn&#x27;t even care about the high price. What I was not expecting was for my body break into bumps all over, it looked like I had chicken poxs and freaked out!  I wrote a terrible review and reached out to the seller.  What I was not expecting, was the owner to reach right back and explain what was happening...with my body releasing toxins and I should give it time.  She was so professional that I calmed down.  In a few days my skin completely cleared up and I tried it again a week later and had great results.  While I did not have layers of skin come off, my skin was very smooth and felt great.  I am going to keep it up and bet I will think it is 5 star worthy!</li>
            <li> This is the best exfoliation ever and my tan is totally even. I used this the night before a spray tan and usually my legs get splotchy, but not this time.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!  My arms look better, I used to have the keratosis pilaris bumps, and tried the creams, the baiden mottos the only thought cleared them up.  The skin on my face is so clear and smooth now, much better than when I was using the Clairisonic Mia 2.  I used this last week: exercised then took a long shower, scrubbed off a layer of my skin, then used the St Thomas self tanning foam, and I still have a great tan!  I rinse it out with really hot water when I&#x27;m done then hang it outside to dry.  This mitt is going to save me a lot of money, I can already tell :)</li>
            <li> I have only used the Baiden mitt twice but I think it&#x27;s a keeper!  The first time I was afraid to rub too hard thinking it would irritate and I also left the shower running so didn&#x27;t get the best results.  The 2nd time I pressed harder (not to the point it was painful, just firm pressure) and I turned off the shower while doing it. The 2nd time it worked much better and my skin felt very smooth. I immediately followed it with self-tanning and I do think it went on much smoother and streak-free.  I will continue to use the Baiden mitt and fully expect to see improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li> New product for me, so far does an amazing job, but still kind of new for a review, but the five stars are for customer service! The Baiden Mitt people have sent me detailed emails regarding the use of their product, very enlightening! Spot on customer service!</li>
            <li> I cannot explain how much one little mitt can change the way you see your skin!!!! Just keep it out of the dryer and don&#x27;t let your husband accidentally bleach it and it will last you eons..... I don&#x27;t soak in a tub so I just use it at the end of my showers and get amazing results. I promise you will, too, don&#x27;t hesitate to spend the cash, think of all the other wasted money that did nothing for your skin....THIS PRODUCT DELIVERS!!!!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t remove old tan residue</li>
            <li> Am using the Baiden Tan Mitten  as guided. I started seeing difference .Baiden Tan Mitten is tremendous!!!! I am glad that I got Baiden Tan Mitten .</li>
