            <li>A few drops in the tub smells refreshing :)</li>
            <li>Love essential oils.</li>
            <li>more red and patchy looking</li>
            <li>I am in my 30s, but I have more problems with Acne now than I did as a teen.  </li>

            <li>Helping my daughter skin clear up!!!</li>
            <li>My husband used it this past weekend and agreed that it is effective.</li>
            <li>Both of these work fairly quickly, but they dry out all the skin around the breakout and make it very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I was so pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>I have been a long-time dermatology patient and in spite of my relatively minor case of acne, the doctor never did help me very much.</li>
            <li>Prescription and over-the-counter medications, both topical and pill form, just didn&#x27;t really work all that well.</li>
            <li>and wow, I am so amazed.</li>
            <li>After only a week, my skin is so much clearer, and the sores I had on my face are drying up and disappearing.</li>
            <li>First off, I am not one to sit down and write reviews.</li>
            <li>The red spots I have are starting to dry up and for the first time</li>

            <li> The red spots I have are starting to dry up and for the first time</li>
            <li> My son has extreme acne on his face and back - and it is slowly/consistently disappearing after only 3 weeks of use!!!  </li>
            <li> We purchased this for our 11 year old in order to help fight acne without a harsh chemical.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> , I am less self-conscious about not wearing foundation in public.</li>
            <li> I mixed a few drops with a Tablespoon of a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li> Not sure on how to use this properly yet, so no fabulous results to report!</li>
            <li> I have been using Acne Fighter for a few days now</li>
            <li> I saw this oil and thought I would give it a try, expecting it would be another waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I usually treat my breakouts with Benzol peroxide cream or Salicylic acid cream.  </li>
            <li> I rub a small amount of this mixture on my breakouts once or twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Although I thankfully never had a severe acne problem, I continue to have breakouts in my mid-20s, which is extremely frustrating to me.</li>

            <li> Great Product helps with skin issues and redness- Love it!</li>
            <li> We purchased this for our 11 year old in order to help fight acne without a harsh chemical.  It has definitely helped.  We feel that it has made the her condition very manageable and we aren&#x27;t dealing with a medication which can cause depression or suicide.  That&#x27;s a big plus!  I would encourage you to try this before you take more drastic steps.</li>
            <li> Seems to work. Love essential oils.</li>
            <li> Excellent product -effective and gentle for acnegenic and aging skin. Also the aroma is very soothing and calming. Love it!</li>

            <li> Works better than any medicines I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> the smell is eww!!! did not work on the acne, for me it actually made my skin become more red and patchy looking</li>
            <li> I use this topically when I have breakouts.  Seems to decrease the amount of time it takes to heal.  My husband used it this past weekend and agreed that it is effective.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30s, but I have more problems with Acne now than I did as a teen.  I usually treat my breakouts with Benzol peroxide cream or Salicylic acid cream.  Both of these work fairly quickly, but they dry out all the skin around the breakout and make it very sensitive. So I decided to try this blend.  I mixed a few drops with a Tablespoon of a carrier oil.  I rub a small amount of this mixture on my breakouts once or twice a day.  After letting it &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; for several minutes, I put an oil-free moisturizer all over my face and neck. The breakouts are fading, without coming to a head &amp; without drying out my face!</li>
            <li> First off, I am not one to sit down and write reviews. But I would like to comment about how incredible this product has been. Although I thankfully never had a severe acne problem, I continue to have breakouts in my mid-20s, which is extremely frustrating to me. I have been a long-time dermatology patient and in spite of my relatively minor case of acne, the doctor never did help me very much. Prescription and over-the-counter medications, both topical and pill form, just didn&#x27;t really work all that well. Finally, I thought I would give essential oils a chance and wow, I am so amazed. I have been using Acne Fighter for a few days now and I already see a difference. The red spots I have are starting to dry up and for the first time, I am less self-conscious about not wearing foundation in public. Thank you, Plant Therapy Essential Oils, for your amazing product!</li>
            <li> I NEVER write reviews.  This time, I felt I had to.  I am a grandmother who has suffered for years with rosacea.  I have tried everything from over the counter meds to all the prescription stuff my dermatologist gave me.  Nothing has really helped.  I saw this oil and thought I would give it a try, expecting it would be another waste of money.  I was so pleasantly surprised!  After only a week, my skin is so much clearer, and the sores I had on my face are drying up and disappearing. The best part is, I am not getting new ones!!! Two thumbs way up for this amazing oil blend.</li>
            <li> This really works to get rid of acne. A great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Like the product and how it works but the smell is really off putting!</li>
            <li> My son has extreme acne on his face and back - and it is slowly/consistently disappearing after only 3 weeks of use!!!  Thank u for bringing him peace of mind ;) - at an affordable cost!</li>
            <li> I was using on my face. Felt nice. Didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. However, I did not feel it was making any difference. I am now using it as bath oil. A few drops in the tub smells refreshing :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she really liked what it did for her face. Will definetly purchase again. Thanks</li>
            <li> I like their synergy blend.  Wanted to have my son to try oil cleansing with it but didn&#x27;t succeed having him to try itl&lt;br /&gt;If you ever tried it and have success, please let me know :)</li>
