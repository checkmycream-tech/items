            <li>I use it in my hair as well as my 2 daughters (4 &amp; 7) and they get so many compliments at school on how wonderful their hair</li>
            <li>Not as good as I need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found nothing that is as good (and inexpensive) on the market.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I then will straighten my hair with my Chi and my hair is gorgeous with full volume!</li>
            <li>Lovely, Smooth Silky Feeling With Lots Of Bounce !!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product for volume I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Could use one that is firmer than this one, but for first time usage, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Most give me rashes or crappy hair.  </li>
            <li>Love that there&#x27;s no alcohol--</li>
            <li>the tip makes it look like frosting for cupcakes :)  </li>
            <li>and I love how it makes my hair feel and smell</li>
            <li>and I have been asked many times what perfume I&#x27;m wearing because people love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Alcohol free!  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, so it helps give my hair more body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t add a huge amt.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s available here on Amazpn.  </li>
            <li>First, my daughters and I love the way it comes out of the can...</li>
            <li>I use this mousse regularly and it looks great the first day.  </li>
            <li>Credit card was billed immediately after order was placed, but it took 3 full weeks for item to arrive, with delivery dates changed twice.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>I love the non alcohol product because I have sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This starts out wonderful, but after an hour my hair is flat again unless I fluff t with my hands.  </li>
            <li>Usually mousse that isn&#x27;t \\&quot;designer\\&quot; type and cost over fifteen dollars a bottle leaves our hair so crunchy and sticky, this is soft and wonderful!</li>
            <li>Love this mousse, I find my hair easily styled with this brand than any other I have used.</li>
            <li>it did add great volume and it does last even the next day.</li>
            <li>Hold is great without being stiff and sticky!  </li>
            <li>Used to be able to find this at my local drugstore and/or Walmart...</li>
            <li>This is the only mousse I have tried that gives my hair volume and keeps it in place, without giving my scalp a rash (I seem to be allergic to most of them).</li>
            <li>Eventually, possibly 2/3 of the way through, turns to more of a liquid and is no longer usable.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and smooth going on, doesn&#x27;t flake once hair is dry, definitely gives my flat fine hair some volume and it has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>have pretty straight hair and this really gives me a lot of volume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Favorite mousse hands down...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Other mousse&#x27;s work far better if looking for volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this L&#x27;Oreal Mousse for a few months now and just really love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Keeps my natural curls and waves bouncy!</li>
            <li>I think that it is the exact same quality of the Brazilian Blow out</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>it is a fluid and there was no option to get my money back for a defective on.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy and not fair.</li>
            <li>soft at a touch.</li>
            <li>An email to the seller, after using the tracking info, got a one-line sarcastic reply: &amp;#34;check tracking information - your order has already shipped&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have above the shoulder length hair and this can lasted me four months - it doesn&#x27;t take much to work.  </li>
            <li>main complaint is that it seems like I am never able to get full use of the container as the product goes \\&quot;flat\\&quot; quickly and requires a lot of shaking and doesn&#x27;t come out right away.  </li>
            <li>and I unfortunately cannot get it very many places anymore</li>
            <li>I love the product and only ordered it on line because I have been trouble finding it locally - maybe L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued it??</li>
            <li>My only complaint is when the bottle was almost empty, I could shake it and it felt like there was a good amt.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff, but it does make styling fast and consistent and definitely pumps up the volume.  </li>
            <li>I generally can go 2-3 days without washing my hair without this product.</li>
            <li>Mine came and the plastic top was broken</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t dry out my color-treated hair, leaves it soft, shiny, and with lots of body!  </li>
            <li>Also, other readers had complained about the strong odor.</li>

            <li> I generally wash my hair every other day and find that it doesn&#x27;t hold shape for that second day</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because I hated the fragrance, it is too strong!!!</li>
            <li> Only issue is that, near the bottom of the can, the remainder won&#x27;t come out so some is wasted.</li>
            <li> so apparently the issue was corrected from the time I purchased this from the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> For others who have dry hair you will like it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair or scalp out.</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s dry or almost dry flip your hair over and Bam your hair is so volumized like Cheryl Coles</li>
            <li> NO ALCOHO in it to dry hair!</li>
            <li> The price was great - I should have been leery about that, as the &amp;#34;service&amp;#34; was terrible, as was their attitude.  </li>
            <li> I picked this up a few months ago at our local walmart (check around for prices, it is cheaper in stores!)</li>
            <li> put the mousse in your roots and all over your hair blow dry and brush upside down then</li>
            <li> I expected much better from this brand and was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> This gives a little hold and can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> my other mousse bottles.</li>
            <li> Does the job without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> Remember to shake well and turn upside down to dispense.</li>
            <li> and I have tried a lot of products after you shower flip your damp hair upside down</li>
            <li> Had to throw one I had ordered previously</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick long hair with bangs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too sticky for me.</li>
            <li> like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy on my hair either.</li>
            <li> , that usually doesn&#x27;t happen w/</li>
            <li> Provides volume without being hard or sticky.</li>
            <li> I had never used mousse, in my life, but decided to try this to see if I could get some volume - lift in my limp thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I ran out and had to use some left over other brand mousse for a few days and hated it</li>
            <li> Oh, I almost forgot, it does NOT leave your hair hard and sticky!</li>
            <li> no more, unfortunately,</li>
            <li> and I am sick and tired of buying other crap that doesn&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li> In addition, it makes my hair feel dirty.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this mousse, I find my hair easily styled with this brand than any other I have used. For others who have dry hair you will like it.</li>
            <li> Great product not sticky and I saw great results with my hair it did add great volume and it does last even the next day.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for me. Does the job without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too sticky for me.</li>
            <li> NO ALCOHO in it to dry hair!</li>
            <li> Wanted a mousse without alcohol so tried this product.  Works well with my hair type, curly.</li>
            <li> I like it. soft at a touch.</li>
            <li> I like it because it does seem to add some volume and there is no fragrance. Only issue is that, near the bottom of the can, the remainder won&#x27;t come out so some is wasted.</li>
            <li> The price was great - I should have been leery about that, as the &amp;#34;service&amp;#34; was terrible, as was their attitude.  Credit card was billed immediately after order was placed, but it took 3 full weeks for item to arrive, with delivery dates changed twice.  An email to the seller, after using the tracking info, got a one-line sarcastic reply: &amp;#34;check tracking information - your order has already shipped&amp;#34;.  Obviously, my message had not even been read.  This was sent UPS from CA to FL, but did not even leave CA until 2 1/2 weeks after ordered/credit card billed.  BEWARE OF USING THIS SELLER!  I love the product and only ordered it on line because I have been trouble finding it locally - maybe L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued it??</li>
            <li> Not as good as I need.</li>
            <li> Best mousse ever!  Most give me rashes or crappy hair.  This is awesome!  I can no longer find it in stores and I am sick and tired of buying other crap that doesn&#x27;t work!  So I&#x27;ll be ordering it from here</li>
            <li> It works well, but leaves a sticky residue in my hair. Also, other readers had complained about the strong odor. I have to agree with them that the fragrance is overpowering. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Lovely, Smooth Silky Feeling With Lots Of Bounce !!</li>
            <li> For me, this mousse is perfect. I have medium to thick long hair with bangs. This stuff controls my bangs just enough to where it doesn&#x27;t look greasy or clumpy. It smells amazing and a little goes a long way. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Used to be able to find this at my local drugstore and/or Walmart...no more, unfortunately, but it&#x27;s available here on Amazpn.  Love that there&#x27;s no alcohol--doesn&#x27;t dry out my color-treated hair, leaves it soft, shiny, and with lots of body!  Please never discontinue this product...I&#x27;ve found nothing that is as good (and inexpensive) on the market.</li>
            <li> Works well. Smells like coconuts and baby powder. The smell lingers.  Ick.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for me.  Not sticky, holds the style.  Remember to shake well and turn upside down to dispense.</li>
            <li> I love this mousse!!  I wish I could get it in a local store instead of ordering it online, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  This is the only mousse I have tried that gives my hair volume and keeps it in place, without giving my scalp a rash (I seem to be allergic to most of them).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this L&#x27;Oreal Mousse for a few months now and just really love it!&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty straight hair and this really gives me a lot of volume.&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent it has too and get compliments on how wonderful my hair smells!&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy on my hair either. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I picked this up a few months ago at our local walmart (check around for prices, it is cheaper in stores!) First, my daughters and I love the way it comes out of the can...the tip makes it look like frosting for cupcakes :)  Then the wonderful smell hit us! Usually I am VERY sensitive to smells and fragrances and hate them in make up and hair products, but there is something about the smell of this mousse we all love! I use it in my hair as well as my 2 daughters (4 &amp; 7) and they get so many compliments at school on how wonderful their hair smells!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t add a huge amt. of volume, but I can definitely tell a difference when I do not use it. I ran out and had to use some left over other brand mousse for a few days and hated it, I could not wait to buy more L&#x27;Oreal!!! I hope they never discontinue this stuff. My only complaint is when the bottle was almost empty, I could shake it and it felt like there was a good amt. still left in the bottle..but it wouldn&#x27;t build up enough pressure to come out, so I felt like I was throwing money away, that usually doesn&#x27;t happen w/my other mousse bottles. Oh, I almost forgot, it does NOT leave your hair hard and sticky! Usually mousse that isn&#x27;t \\&quot;designer\\&quot; type and cost over fifteen dollars a bottle leaves our hair so crunchy and sticky, this is soft and wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is the 1st time I&#x27;ve used this product and I like it.  It&#x27;s light and smooth going on, doesn&#x27;t flake once hair is dry, definitely gives my flat fine hair some volume and it has a nice fragrance.  I have above the shoulder length hair and this can lasted me four months - it doesn&#x27;t take much to work.  I&#x27;ve used the entire can with no problems so apparently the issue was corrected from the time I purchased this from the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> Works great and I love how it makes my hair feel and smell</li>
            <li> I use this mousse regularly and it looks great the first day.  I generally wash my hair every other day and find that it doesn&#x27;t hold shape for that second day (this could simply be my hair and others may not have this issue).  However, it smells wonderful and I have been asked many times what perfume I&#x27;m wearing because people love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is that it seems like I am never able to get full use of the container as the product goes \\&quot;flat\\&quot; quickly and requires a lot of shaking and doesn&#x27;t come out right away.  Eventually, possibly 2/3 of the way through, turns to more of a liquid and is no longer usable.</li>
            <li> I wish they would sell this in stores again!  I can&#x27;t seem to get enough of it.  It has THE best scent to it.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give the volume that I was hoping for. Other mousse&#x27;s work far better if looking for volume. In addition, it makes my hair feel dirty. I expected much better from this brand and was highly disappointed. Can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I had never used mousse, in my life, but decided to try this to see if I could get some volume - lift in my limp thin hair.  It does&lt;br /&gt;help, but not quite enough.  Could use one that is firmer than this one, but for first time usage, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Favorite mousse hands down...and I have tried everything.  Provides volume without being hard or sticky.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best volume mousses I&#x27;ve ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff, but it does make styling fast and consistent and definitely pumps up the volume.  I wish it came in a larger can--this size doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Love it!  great volume</li>
            <li> Alcohol free!  Hold is great without being stiff and sticky!  Keeps my natural curls and waves bouncy!</li>
            <li> Mine came and the plastic top was broken so I went to get a return set up.  Well you cannot return this item&lt;br /&gt;because it is a fluid and there was no option to get my money back for a defective on.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy and not fair.</li>
            <li> This gives a little hold and can be used wet or dry.  It isn&#x27;t crusty or flaky and it hasn&#x27;t damaged my blow out.  I find ALL products liek this to be very similar.  I think that it is the exact same quality of the Brazilian Blow out Root lifter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This starts out wonderful, but after an hour my hair is flat again unless I fluff t with my hands.  By the end of the day my hair feels greasy and I need to wash it.  I generally can go 2-3 days without washing my hair without this product.</li>
            <li> The best mousse ever and I unfortunately cannot get it very many places anymore</li>
            <li> I like the product itself, but have had problems with the spraying mechanism. Had to throw one I had ordered previously&lt;br /&gt;away, as the spray did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. My hair is fine, so it helps give my hair more body.I love the non alcohol product because I have sensitive scalp. Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair or scalp out.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product for volume I have very fine hair and I have tried a lot of products after you shower flip your damp hair upside down put the mousse in your roots and all over your hair blow dry and brush upside down then when it&#x27;s dry or almost dry flip your hair over and Bam your hair is so volumized like Cheryl Coles ;) I then will straighten my hair with my Chi and my hair is gorgeous with full volume! I highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because I hated the fragrance, it is too strong!!! However it holds hair curles well.</li>
