            <li>Very satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li>I love my Oyster 76 clippers and all of the wonderful blade selections that are available.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product cuts hair very smooth and clean great for all levels of expertise of use .</li>
            <li>Great fit for sure!  </li>
            <li>I love it .itis</li>
            <li>I really like them, because they are great for blending.</li>
            <li>I also have the Oster comb-blade attachments which work nicely, however you get a much closer, better looking cut with the metal blades.</li>
            <li>This is a really smooth, easy to maintain product.</li>
            <li>Far superior to any home haircut kit.</li>
            <li>Would rate this transaction a zero since I didn&#x27;t get the right item.</li>
            <li>: not sure this is a happy ending</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Better than the plastic clippers that left my hair looking all nappy.</li>
            <li>sure enough a service person confirms that they stopped making Agion blades a year ago.</li>
            <li>These are very high-quality blades.</li>
            <li>But avoid the hassle and order elsewhere unless you don&#x27;t care and want to pay too much for a non-Agion blade.</li>
            <li>He loves it, he is pleased with the performance, it arrived on time and works as it is expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>These are really precise and strong for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>So, long story is you get the currently available blade and not what you thought you ordered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet.</li>
            <li>This came in today and they all came in there cases new and oiled up!</li>
            <li>High quality!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Oster and high quality.  </li>
            <li>If this fits your trimmer and is the size you need,  I highly recommend the Oster blades.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and good for constant daily use  in my profession</li>
            <li>Not a single seller on here, nor amazon has updated the pictures.</li>
            <li>Stay away from BYPLE and Beauty Shine - Both sellers were hardly customer friendly when contacted about receiving different blades than pictured.</li>

            <li> I love it .itis the best</li>
            <li> This came in today and they all came in there cases new and oiled up! I&#x27;m very happy and now Im just waiting for The actual clipper to come get delivered.</li>
            <li> These are very high-quality blades. I would definitely buy them again. But I do not think I will need to buy them for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I dont always get in to the barber, so I use this number two blade on the weeks i dont get to the barber. Far superior to any home haircut kit. This is a really smooth, easy to maintain product. Oster clippers and blades are what my barber uses. He (and all of the other guys at the shop) swear by Oster products. I also have the Oster comb-blade attachments which work nicely, however you get a much closer, better looking cut with the metal blades.</li>
            <li> Not a single seller on here, nor amazon has updated the pictures. These blades are not agION Oster blades. Oster no longer makes them. Bought 2 blades. Each from a different seller; both advertised as agION blades, neither were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW. Stay away from BYPLE and Beauty Shine - Both sellers were hardly customer friendly when contacted about receiving different blades than pictured. Treated me like an idiot not realizing I use these blades in a professional salon setting; not just for home cuts.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Exactly what I needed. Oster makes the best of the best. Would recommend for anyone cutting hair.</li>
            <li> I like the item to go with my Oster clippers. Recommended for the barber in you. Great buy for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet. These are really precise and strong for my thick hair. Better than the plastic clippers that left my hair looking all nappy.</li>
            <li> I love my Oyster 76 clippers and all of the wonderful blade selections that are available.  This size blade worked just perfect for the sides of my hair.</li>
            <li> Works well! High quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tired of cheap clippers so I bought a oster 76 with this blade! Best purchase in years!</li>
            <li> this is a great product cuts hair very smooth and clean great for all levels of expertise of use .</li>
            <li> Recommended if you cut your hair at home as we cut everyone&#x27;s hair.  Great fit for sure!  Do buy it</li>
            <li> Buyer beware, seller sent non-Agion blade, not what is shown in the picture and his description. I&#x27;ve filed a complaint, will update when I get resolution. But avoid the hassle and order elsewhere unless you don&#x27;t care and want to pay too much for a non-Agion blade. Would rate this transaction a zero since I didn&#x27;t get the right item. But hope for a happy ending!&lt;br /&gt;More: not sure this is a happy ending but the seller emails that Oster no longer makes Agion blades and provides Oster&#x27;s phone number. I call and sure enough a service person confirms that they stopped making Agion blades a year ago. I ask why they&#x27;d have a listing showing something no longer made--the service person said \\&quot;why don&#x27;t you ask the seller because we get a lot of calls like yours.\\&quot; So, long story is you get the currently available blade and not what you thought you ordered. So the seller knows their listing is incorrect, then why don&#x27;t they fix it? Strange isn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist and train barber and have been using these blades on a daily basis. I really like them, because they are great for blending. They are sharp and good for constant daily use  in my profession</li>
            <li> Very satisfied customer.  Amazon,  you have me as customer forever!</li>
            <li> He loves it, he is pleased with the performance, it arrived on time and works as it is expected. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Oster and high quality.  If this fits your trimmer and is the size you need,  I highly recommend the Oster blades.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Thanks.</li>
