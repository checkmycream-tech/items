            <li>So, this might be perfect for the summer for that beachy look, and I will continue to use it in the summer.</li>
            <li>Works great@!</li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and would use it again.</li>
            <li>A really good product!</li>
            <li>foam smells great.</li>
            <li>Great curls.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a great foam in moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was really happy with this product for my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good product that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it is great at controlling frizz, but it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it the best shot possible to win me over.</li>
            <li>My curls are maintained and look nice throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt nice.</li>
            <li>This did give my hair nice volume but it made it feel like straw</li>
            <li>This product smelled really nice, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair, and it didn&#x27;t provide any additional moisture for my hair.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Instead it kind of &amp;#34;stickys</li>
            <li>hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the product easy and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>Its a light hold and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Made my hair soft, shiny and smell great!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a product I would ever need to use, but I would recommend it to people who have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a good leave in!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Still, when used on its own, it did give my fine medium length hair a bit of a boost and a very light hold and that is an improvement.</li>
            <li>Very good product for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Just three pumps massaged into hair makes it much more manageable and stylable.</li>
            <li>I was able to compare this to another leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been pleased with their brand.  </li>
            <li>Also the scent is lovely.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its magical.</li>
            <li>Okay, Dove, you scored here.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and while I can smell it through out the day, it&#x27;s a nice clean scent, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfume scent.</li>
            <li>and I look like I have more hair.</li>
            <li>thing I have noticed as the days grow warmer and more humid, is that my hair seems to lose its volume.</li>
            <li>It made my hair look healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>This is so easy, just run a pump through my hair after a shower and it adds volume.</li>
            <li>/&gt;MAYBE if you have a color of hair that doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; easily, then this would work, but even then I doubt it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell strong either</li>
            <li>I also tried it on my daughter&#x27;s fine and semi-curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This foam is light and airy and can be combed easily through hair.</li>
            <li>However, it does seem to encourage my wavy hair to curl more in these hotter and humid days, but not be super frizzy.</li>
            <li>This leave in foam is fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great addition to any hair product collection, especially on those days when you want to throw something in for some body and &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; without having to spend a lot of time or worrying that your hair will have that crunchy look/feel.</li>
            <li>It serves as a leave in conditioner and a light styling aid.</li>
            <li>While the smell is amazing (I want everything now to smell like this stuff), the product itself doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>She has been experimenting with it and seems to have some success with it in giving her hair more volume.</li>
            <li>tried it on freshly washed damp hair and it worked a lot better, the foam itself</li>
            <li>I love the Dove curl activating mousse, so I thought this would be similar and be good for making hair feel smooth and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product right now.  </li>
            <li>The white foam pumps easily and has a pleasant light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I was excited but a bit trepidatious about trying a &amp;#34;Moisturizing</li>
            <li>foam leaves a light hold that helps create a nice bounce on my naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>: This is really great for dry hair.</li>
            <li>This foam has a moderate and relatively pleasant floral scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m quite pleased with Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam and would certainly recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you are looking for a simple, one-step product that add just a bit of volume, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>The Leave in Foam worked a lot better than the Oxygen Moisture Conditioner did, but not by much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for a good leave-in moisturizing foam, Hello Hydration is next on the list.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a light mousse that does a good job providing some volume and body and light moisturizing, without weighing down the hair.</li>
            <li>I feel lucky to have found it.</li>
            <li>And, while it did add volume, I had that distinct &amp;#34;there&#x27;s something in my hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The hold isn&#x27;t anything that will last for hours and hours, but it&#x27;s a nice option on low-maintenance days.</li>
            <li>This obviously isn&#x27;t a leave-in conditioner, but it was great at keeping my hair looking soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead it helped keep away the frizz and made the most of my natural waves.</li>
            <li>Mostly the benefit here is that it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave things exceptionally stiff.</li>
            <li>It worked best when I used it out of the shower on damp hair rather than dry (didn&#x27;t like how it felt with dry hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When she ran out we picked a bottle up a the store without checking the price on amazon first.</li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>After I would get out of the shower the next day after using it my hair would take forever to comb out thereby causing more hair to come out.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty much helped solve that problem with hair spray, but there are those days that the humidity wins no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and since I like leaving it natural I am picky about how clean my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>I think she may have better success if she would just take a bit more time with her hair (and overall appearance), but that is a whole other topic.</li>
            <li>It seems like the product works better for those people who blow dry their hair.</li>
            <li>I use mousse everyday and though this pumps out well and has a great smell, I did not see any better of a result than my typical Garnier Fructis mousse that has almost 2 oz more for half the price.</li>
            <li>I have really straight hair</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that tends to get very frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it quite as well as my normal product, but it does work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some leave in conditioners, it did not add too much weight.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>When I use this, I don&#x27;t have to use much hair spray when styling my hair -</li>
            <li>It just leaves too much of a &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much its a pain to rub it all in.</li>
            <li>I do not have fine or flat hair...</li>
            <li>It gives me better curls than without or with other products.</li>
            <li>You can probably find similarly effective stuff for a little less money (or more per container) if you want, but on the other hand this seems to do a little better for softness and scent than most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for something to make my thin, fine hair look fuller and have more body.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend it highly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other conditioner leave my hair heavy; however, this one did a great job and left my hair feeling soft, clean and airy.  </li>
            <li>I do need a little more than the directed 2 pumps, though.  </li>
            <li>I color, chemically process and generally abuse my hair pretty bad-so my stylist insist I condition, condition and condition</li>
            <li>vote that if you are seeking a product that provides volume, this is worth a try (especially since it is so inexpensive)!</li>
            <li>It is very light, which is good for me because I hate wearing product in my hair.</li>
            <li>A little goes quite a long way and it definitely has a pleasant floral scent that gently fades as the day goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I really like the product and its reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and typically use Paul Mitchell Extra Body Sculpting Foam, which I like.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not usually there.</li>
            <li>Works better for me than a lot of the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li>This is a unique product - not exactly a mousse, but not a typical leave-in.</li>
            <li>It stayed nice for a few days (because my hair is dry</li>
            <li>it looked like it wasn&#x27;t going to comb in well into my damp hair, but it was fine and invisible once dried (</li>
            <li>Seems to do just as described so far</li>
            <li>I guess I prefer products that leave hair feeling completely natural.</li>
            <li>It is soft and well contained without lots of flyaways.  </li>
            <li>It gives me soft bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky at all, and leaves my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li>This product works like a mousse but gives hair a natural look and feel.</li>
            <li>It retains that wave and looks like I have some natural waves in my hair.</li>
            <li>I will keep working with it to see if I can find just the right amount, but it is not what I expected.</li>
            <li>Although the bottle says it is for fine flat hair, she has pretty thick wavy hair</li>
            <li>It seemed to hold it pretty well at first, but any part of my hair that wasn&#x27;t tied up still wandered almost as much as it usually did.</li>
            <li>It smelled nice, and I put a lot in, but it didn&#x27;t weight down my hair or make it feel stiff or clumpy.</li>
            <li>When using on dry hair, I don&#x27;t find I get as much volume</li>
            <li>It is foamy and not light like mousse, but more like shampoo in wet hair....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on both wet and dry hair and found it works better on wet hair for me.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter started using this recently and loves it.</li>
            <li>I can even use it on day or two old hair and it bumps my hair back</li>
            <li>There was no wet chemical or product look or smell.  </li>
            <li>In Foam&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;ve been looking so long for a hold styling product I had to try this new wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding this to be pretty similar in effectiveness to other styling products.</li>
            <li>It became so tangled and stiff that I had to wash it out right after.</li>

            <li> Okay, Dove, you scored here.</li>

            <li> If you use too much its a pain to rub it all in.</li>
            <li> I do not have fine or flat hair...</li>
            <li> It gives me better curls than without or with other products.</li>
            <li> You can probably find similarly effective stuff for a little less money (or more per container) if you want, but on the other hand this seems to do a little better for softness and scent than most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for something to make my thin, fine hair look fuller and have more body.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend it highly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other conditioner leave my hair heavy; however, this one did a great job and left my hair feeling soft, clean and airy.  </li>
            <li> I do need a little more than the directed 2 pumps, though.  </li>
            <li> I color, chemically process and generally abuse my hair pretty bad-so my stylist insist I condition, condition and condition</li>
            <li> vote that if you are seeking a product that provides volume, this is worth a try (especially since it is so inexpensive)!</li>
            <li> It is very light, which is good for me because I hate wearing product in my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes quite a long way and it definitely has a pleasant floral scent that gently fades as the day goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I really like the product and its reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and typically use Paul Mitchell Extra Body Sculpting Foam, which I like.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not usually there.</li>
            <li> Works better for me than a lot of the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li> This is a unique product - not exactly a mousse, but not a typical leave-in.</li>
            <li> It stayed nice for a few days (because my hair is dry</li>
            <li> it looked like it wasn&#x27;t going to comb in well into my damp hair, but it was fine and invisible once dried (</li>
            <li> Seems to do just as described so far</li>
            <li> I guess I prefer products that leave hair feeling completely natural.</li>
            <li> It is soft and well contained without lots of flyaways.  </li>
            <li> It gives me soft bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky at all, and leaves my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li> This product works like a mousse but gives hair a natural look and feel.</li>
            <li> It retains that wave and looks like I have some natural waves in my hair.</li>
            <li> I will keep working with it to see if I can find just the right amount, but it is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Although the bottle says it is for fine flat hair, she has pretty thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> It seemed to hold it pretty well at first, but any part of my hair that wasn&#x27;t tied up still wandered almost as much as it usually did.</li>
            <li> It smelled nice, and I put a lot in, but it didn&#x27;t weight down my hair or make it feel stiff or clumpy.</li>
            <li> When using on dry hair, I don&#x27;t find I get as much volume</li>
            <li> It is foamy and not light like mousse, but more like shampoo in wet hair....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on both wet and dry hair and found it works better on wet hair for me.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter started using this recently and loves it.</li>
            <li> I can even use it on day or two old hair and it bumps my hair back</li>
            <li> There was no wet chemical or product look or smell.  </li>
            <li> In Foam&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;ve been looking so long for a hold styling product I had to try this new wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding this to be pretty similar in effectiveness to other styling products.</li>
            <li> It became so tangled and stiff that I had to wash it out right after.</li>
            <li> I usually use about 3-4 pumps to really work into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know the Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave in was designed to provide lift to flat hair, but it still missed one of its stated goals, to provide moisture to hair.</li>
            <li> : This was my personal experience, but it did seem tricky with a long style.</li>
            <li> I have been eying Dove&#x27;s new Oxygen Moisture product line for a little while now.</li>
            <li> I found this foam to (thankfully) do a great job lifting and adding some volume (hard for long hair) but it also left it dirty looking</li>
            <li> When my hair is really dry on colder days, I need something extra.</li>
            <li> I find not combing it and letting it air dry the key to making this</li>
            <li> also tried it on my hair when it was dry and it just left my hair sticky.  </li>
            <li> I was not a big fan of putting this into my hair while it was dry - it did not distribute well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick and wavy hair and my big problem is that it gets very frizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives body without weight but not so much as to make your hair feel hard or like it has a lot of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of mousse - it makes my hair feel almost sticky and doesn&#x27;t look as natural as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I actually have a ton of curly hair, so I&#x27;m not exactly &amp;#34;fine.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We always let her hair air dry because of her curls, and her hair was \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; with this.  </li>
            <li> I allow it to air dry.</li>
            <li> It may be applied to either damp or dry</li>
            <li> Then I just let it dry.</li>
            <li> If I blow it dry</li>
            <li> know for a fact that it does not work well on dry hair...</li>
            <li> I have applied it both on wet and dry hair and recommend putting it on wet hair; it left my hair looking greasy when I applied it on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It left my hair feeling dried out, not moisturized, but it did give it some lift and improve the overall texture.</li>
            <li> I styled as usual, and several hours later, there is still some bounce in my hair</li>
            <li> Other times when it&#x27;s wet, I&#x27;ll just comb it back, put a little wave in it and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I use this on wet</li>
            <li> I put it in wet hair and comb with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> this give just enough hold without leaving my hair heavy or crunchy.  </li>
            <li> When I put my hair up it&#x27;s usually a simple bun or ponytail, what I need hold with is a half up/half down style I do.</li>
            <li> wet hair Dove makes quality items at a few price.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair with very little frizz and my curls looks shiny not crispy and dry.</li>
            <li> Without any product it is just a mess of flyaways.  </li>
            <li> I have long, dyed, thick hair.</li>
            <li> When dry the touch is hard.</li>
            <li> I found to be quite thick, so use sparingly because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> works well to add a little hold to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried this Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam for a few days.  </li>
            <li> My hair had noticeable volume when I dried it and throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I typically buy a styling product from Toni &amp; Guy that hold a style in place without making the hair hard, crunchy, or heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on damp hair, and then blow dried my hair like usual.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a leave-in conditioner creme, but I thought I would give this foam</li>
            <li> but I have used Dove shampoo in the past and</li>

            <li> I usually like Dove products, but I can&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>

            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky and hard.</li>

            <li> I have waist length dirty blonde hair...</li>
            <li> at least not mine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and limp and frizzy, and any attempts to &amp;#34;volumize&amp;#34; usually fail miserably.</li>
            <li> My hair suffers from me dying it like mad, flat ironing AND living in the dry desert.</li>
            <li> and I purchased this to moisturize my very dry hair - extremely bad idea.</li>
            <li> After trying it, I have to say I am quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used about 1-2 pumps of the product and it started to foam like crazy, to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t settle into the strands!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good product for naturally curly hair.  When dry the touch is hard.</li>
            <li> It is very light, which is good for me because I hate wearing product in my hair. I can&#x27;t say it is great at controlling frizz, but it is better than nothing. When my hair is really dry on colder days, I need something extra. However, it does seem to encourage my wavy hair to curl more in these hotter and humid days, but not be super frizzy. So, this might be perfect for the summer for that beachy look, and I will continue to use it in the summer.</li>
            <li> Seems to do just as described so far</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter started using this recently and loves it. When she ran out we picked a bottle up a the store without checking the price on amazon first. It was 1/2 price on Amazon compared to the grocery store! Although the bottle says it is for fine flat hair, she has pretty thick wavy hair and she loves this product.</li>
            <li> Works great@! Just three pumps massaged into hair makes it much more manageable and stylable. I have really straight hair and this helps a lot!</li>
            <li> I used this product with the matching shampoo and conditioner. I wanted to give it the best shot possible to win me over. The smell (like all of Dove&#x27;s products) was enticing. And, while it did add volume, I had that distinct &amp;#34;there&#x27;s something in my hair&amp;#34; feeling. I guess I prefer products that leave hair feeling completely natural. It&#x27;s a quirk, I guess. (I know lots of people who use hairspray and have sticky, hard hair ... and they never seem to mind. So, I may be in the minority here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I vote that if you are seeking a product that provides volume, this is worth a try (especially since it is so inexpensive)!</li>
            <li> I have long, dyed, thick hair. This leave in foam is fantastic. A little goes quite a long way and it definitely has a pleasant floral scent that gently fades as the day goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives body without weight but not so much as to make your hair feel hard or like it has a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great addition to any hair product collection, especially on those days when you want to throw something in for some body and &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; without having to spend a lot of time or worrying that your hair will have that crunchy look/feel.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that tends to get very frizzy.  Without any product it is just a mess of flyaways.  I usually use a leave-in conditioner creme, but I thought I would give this foam a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty well on my hair.  It is soft and well contained without lots of flyaways.  My curls are maintained and look nice throughout the day.  I do need a little more than the directed 2 pumps, though.  I usually use about 3-4 pumps to really work into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is easy to apply and has a nice smell. It seems to help control my hair. I have applied it both on wet and dry hair and recommend putting it on wet hair; it left my hair looking greasy when I applied it on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to compare this to another leave in conditioner.  The other conditioner leave my hair heavy; however, this one did a great job and left my hair feeling soft, clean and airy.  I don&#x27;t have the shampoo to pair this with but I have used Dove shampoo in the past and I&#x27;ve always been pleased with their brand.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and typically use Paul Mitchell Extra Body Sculpting Foam, which I like.  I tried this Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam for a few days.  I don&#x27;t like it quite as well as my normal product, but it does work pretty well.  It improves the body of my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t have any holding power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on damp hair, and then blow dried my hair like usual.  I also tried it on my daughter&#x27;s fine and semi-curly hair.  We always let her hair air dry because of her curls, and her hair was \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; with this.  It seems like the product works better for those people who blow dry their hair.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Made my hair soft, shiny and smell great! This is something that I would buy and use! I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a good leave in!</li>
            <li> I think of and use this as a mousse. I have thick,dry,curly hair so I need the moisture this product provides. I use this on wet&lt;br /&gt;hair. I use 3 to 4  pumps and just work it through my hair. I then fingerstyle my hair. I allow it to air dry. This product leaves my hair with very little frizz and my curls looks shiny not crispy and dry. I find not combing it and letting it air dry the key to making this work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my hair when it was dry and it just left my hair sticky.  Overall I really like the product and its reasonably priced. Also the scent is lovely. The scent lasts all day but its not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definite must try!</li>
            <li> This is a hybrid product. It serves as a leave in conditioner and a light styling aid. The white foam pumps easily and has a pleasant light fragrance. Pump one or two dollops into your hands, rub between palms and apply evenly through hair from roots to tips. Style as usual. It may be applied to either damp or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the product easy and pleasant to use. Unlike some leave in conditioners, it did not add too much weight. There was an increase in volume. My hair felt nice. Unlike some styling aids, it didn&#x27;t make it sticky or crunchy.  It is, however, not a replacement for hair spray, root lift, styling wands, curlers or straighteners. Still, when used on its own, it did give my fine medium length hair a bit of a boost and a very light hold and that is an improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding this to be pretty similar in effectiveness to other styling products. Mostly the benefit here is that it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave things exceptionally stiff. You can probably find similarly effective stuff for a little less money (or more per container) if you want, but on the other hand this seems to do a little better for softness and scent than most.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I feel lucky to have found it. I cannot recommend it highly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foam smells great. I put it in wet hair and comb with a wide tooth comb. Then I just let it dry. It gives me soft bouncy curls. Great curls. It gives me better curls than without or with other products. I just love it.  I can even use it on day or two old hair and it bumps my hair back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its magical.</li>
            <li> This did give my hair nice volume but it made it feel like straw and it got so tangled.  After I would get out of the shower the next day after using it my hair would take forever to comb out thereby causing more hair to come out.  I would not recommend for this reason.</li>
            <li> This foam has a moderate and relatively pleasant floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a light mousse that does a good job providing some volume and body and light moisturizing, without weighing down the hair.</li>
            <li> If you want crunchy hair buy this. I typically buy a styling product from Toni &amp; Guy that hold a style in place without making the hair hard, crunchy, or heavy. I do not like this product and will not be getting it again.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. My hair is fine and limp and frizzy, and any attempts to &amp;#34;volumize&amp;#34; usually fail miserably. But this did make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair feeling dried out, not moisturized, but it did give it some lift and improve the overall texture. It is foamy and not light like mousse, but more like shampoo in wet hair.... it looked like it wasn&#x27;t going to comb in well into my damp hair, but it was fine and invisible once dried (no flakes). I styled as usual, and several hours later, there is still some bounce in my hair that&#x27;s not usually there. Okay, Dove, you scored here.</li>
            <li> I color, chemically process and generally abuse my hair pretty bad-so my stylist insist I condition, condition and condition Dove Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam delicately moisturizes hair. Its a light hold and pleasant smell. I prefer to use it on wet hair Dove makes quality items at a few price.</li>
            <li> This is a unique product - not exactly a mousse, but not a typical leave-in. I actually have a ton of curly hair, so I&#x27;m not exactly &amp;#34;fine.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works well if I put it in while my hair is still damp, and they blow-dry the hair in an upwards motion (I use a air-brush). The hold isn&#x27;t anything that will last for hours and hours, but it&#x27;s a nice option on low-maintenance days. I was not a big fan of putting this into my hair while it was dry - it did not distribute well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for a simple, one-step product that add just a bit of volume, this is a good choice. But if you have high-maintenance hair, this may not be enough.</li>
            <li> I have been eying Dove&#x27;s new Oxygen Moisture product line for a little while now. After trying it, I have to say I am quite disappointed. While the smell is amazing (I want everything now to smell like this stuff), the product itself doesn&#x27;t do much for me. The Leave in Foam worked a lot better than the Oxygen Moisture Conditioner did, but not by much.</li>
            <li> I know the Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave in was designed to provide lift to flat hair, but it still missed one of its stated goals, to provide moisture to hair. This product smelled really nice, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair, and it didn&#x27;t provide any additional moisture for my hair. I usually like Dove products, but I can&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product right now.  It is not sticky at all, and leaves my hair really soft.  Helps keep my hair from getting too frizzy.  Works better for me than a lot of the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li> I have a combination of 3b-4a and I purchased this to moisturize my very dry hair - extremely bad idea. I used about 1-2 pumps of the product and it started to foam like crazy, to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t settle into the strands! It made my hair feel like I was using a shampoo containing sodium laureth sulfate. It became so tangled and stiff that I had to wash it out right after. I&#x27;m still searching for a good leave-in moisturizing foam, Hello Hydration is next on the list.</li>
            <li> This is so easy, just run a pump through my hair after a shower and it adds volume.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great foam in moisturizer. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky and hard. A really good product!</li>
            <li> This product helped with volume for my hair.  It worked best when I used it out of the shower on damp hair rather than dry (didn&#x27;t like how it felt with dry hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam leaves a light hold that helps create a nice bounce on my naturally wavy hair.  My hair doesn&#x27;t look dull with this product either.  It doesn&#x27;t smell strong either, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> This Dove Leave In Foam works well to add a little hold to my hair.  When I use this, I don&#x27;t have to use much hair spray when styling my hair - this give just enough hold without leaving my hair heavy or crunchy.  The scent is nice and while I can smell it through out the day, it&#x27;s a nice clean scent, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfume scent.</li>
            <li> This foam is light and airy and can be combed easily through hair. My hair had noticeable volume when I dried it and throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I use mousse everyday and though this pumps out well and has a great smell, I did not see any better of a result than my typical Garnier Fructis mousse that has almost 2 oz more for half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for something to make my thin, fine hair look fuller and have more body. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of mousse - it makes my hair feel almost sticky and doesn&#x27;t look as natural as I&#x27;d like. This product works like a mousse but gives hair a natural look and feel. I&#x27;ve used it on both wet and dry hair and found it works better on wet hair for me. If I blow it dry I end up with lots of volume and and I look like I have more hair. Other times when it&#x27;s wet, I&#x27;ll just comb it back, put a little wave in it and let it dry. It retains that wave and looks like I have some natural waves in my hair. When using on dry hair, I don&#x27;t find I get as much volume but I still have control and no fly-aways. If I forget to put conditioner in my hair, I&#x27;ll just use the foam in its place. It works well without looking like I added a leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have noticed as the days grow warmer and more humid, is that my hair seems to lose its volume. I have pretty much helped solve that problem with hair spray, but there are those days that the humidity wins no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite pleased with Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam and would certainly recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I picked up this product for my daughter to use. She has been experimenting with it and seems to have some success with it in giving her hair more volume. I think she may have better success if she would just take a bit more time with her hair (and overall appearance), but that is a whole other topic. This isn&#x27;t a product I would ever need to use, but I would recommend it to people who have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have TERRIBLE luck with mousse, and I&#x27;ve never taken to it at all. It always seemed to gunk up in streaks in my hair instead of holding a style. I was excited but a bit trepidatious about trying a &amp;#34;Moisturizing Leave In Foam&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;ve been looking so long for a hold styling product I had to try this new wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: This is really great for dry hair. My hair suffers from me dying it like mad, flat ironing AND living in the dry desert. This obviously isn&#x27;t a leave-in conditioner, but it was great at keeping my hair looking soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This left NO streaks or flakes, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: This was my personal experience, but it did seem tricky with a long style. When I put my hair up it&#x27;s usually a simple bun or ponytail, what I need hold with is a half up/half down style I do. It seemed to hold it pretty well at first, but any part of my hair that wasn&#x27;t tied up still wandered almost as much as it usually did.</li>
            <li> I do not have fine or flat hair... I have thick and wavy hair and my big problem is that it gets very frizzy. I was really happy with this product for my hair. It smelled nice, and I put a lot in, but it didn&#x27;t weight down my hair or make it feel stiff or clumpy. Instead it helped keep away the frizz and made the most of my natural waves. It gave the control I was looking for without the stiffness.There was no wet chemical or product look or smell.  It made my hair look healthy and shiny. It stayed nice for a few days (because my hair is dry I don&#x27;t wash it every day) and never got greasy. I am very happy with this product and would use it again.</li>
            <li> I have waist length dirty blonde hair... and since I like leaving it natural I am picky about how clean my hair looks.  I found this foam to (thankfully) do a great job lifting and adding some volume (hard for long hair) but it also left it dirty looking which I didn&#x27;t appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAYBE if you have a color of hair that doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; easily, then this would work, but even then I doubt it. It just leaves too much of a &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; look.  Don&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> I found this leave-in foam to be quite tricky at first.&lt;br /&gt;I know for a fact that it does not work well on dry hair... at least not mine.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on freshly washed damp hair and it worked a lot better, the foam itself I found to be quite thick, so use sparingly because a little goes a long way. If you use too much its a pain to rub it all in. As for providing moisture to the hair, that it does. But I doubt if this product will become a regular staple of mine.</li>
            <li> I love the Dove curl activating mousse, so I thought this would be similar and be good for making hair feel smooth and conditioned.  Instead it kind of &amp;#34;stickys it up&amp;#34; like some extra-body mousse&#x27;s do.  I will keep working with it to see if I can find just the right amount, but it is not what I expected.</li>
