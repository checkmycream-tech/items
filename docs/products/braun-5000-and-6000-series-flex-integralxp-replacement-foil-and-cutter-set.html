            <li>the shaves are once again smooth and close, with no nicks or irritation of any sort.&lt;br</li>

            <li>As long as these are available, I will never have to replace my beloved Braun.</li>
            <li>I am very well satisfied.</li>
            <li>Good solid product.</li>
            <li>Precision part - well made, fits on with a satisfying click, offers a fine shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how old my shaver is, perhaps as old as the hills, but it still gives me a great shave every morning.</li>
            <li>I have had my 5520 for more the 15 years at least and still give a great shave.</li>
            <li>Works great, My razor is cuttin&#x27;em down.</li>
            <li>it sure makes a difference when you have a new foil and cutter.</li>
            <li>Good deal, harder to find these in stores now.</li>
            <li>process was easy, shaving improved with new heads and screens, should have done it years ago.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Fit correctly and made my shaver cut like new.  </li>
            <li>I have an older  Braun model 5776 with an almost full width pop-up trimmer on the face that comes out at a right angle just under the shaver head.</li>
            <li>I have had laser surgery and the hair on my face is soft, fine</li>
            <li>I was thinking about getting a new Braun razor, as mine is about 6 or 7 years old (maybe more?).  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and new as described.  </li>
            <li>Even though this item seemed to be very good, and the seller too, after receiving it and opening it, I discovered that the new foil was broken.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the foil looks different and not as sleek as the orignal and dost pop off when u hit the release as did the factory one but works fine besides those two differences.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The assembly was packaged well and sent FAST.</li>
            <li>SHIPPING WAS ALSO VERY FASY.</li>
            <li>THANKS TO AMAZON PRIME.</li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than given shipping date packed in original factory plastic.</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable but I feel like it was still too high.</li>
            <li>I usually buy this kind of thing at WalMart, but since they have stopped carrying it...    </li>
            <li>like having my Braun just brand new!</li>
            <li>The shaver now works like new again!  </li>
            <li>I have had this razor for years and just needed a new blade and new foil!  </li>
            <li>Now it works like new and well worth the price, especially compared to the cost of new shavers.</li>
            <li>Pulled out the old broken foil and cutter and put in the new one - good as new!  </li>
            <li>instead I got new blades and screen.  </li>
            <li>I seem to replace these every year or two, and it makes the razor cut like new.    </li>
            <li>My razor now cuts like it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li>Installed the shaver parts and my Braun works like new.</li>
            <li>I considered a new one</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like brand new.</li>
            <li>The replacement foil and cutter made it like new again.</li>
            <li>They make the shaver work like new.</li>
            <li>I have owned this shaver for over 15 years and the replacement foil and cutter fits like new.</li>
            <li>IT FELT LIKE I GOT A NEW BRAUN SHAVER.</li>
            <li>razors seem to be the exact same as the factory ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This foil and cutter set made my 8 year old razor perform just like new.  </li>
            <li>Changing the blade made my old Braun work like it did when it was new.</li>
            <li>if you have an old braun and want to make it new, buy this product now</li>
            <li>The postage is very expensive and one would expect the shipment to be much faster and much more secure.  </li>
            <li>Today the foil gave out completely and would have turned my skin to hamburger if I hasn&#x27;t stopped myself.</li>
            <li>really made my razor work like new.&lt;br /&gt;it cut my shave time in half as i had used the first foil and blades for close to six</li>
            <li>With the new batteries and cutting head, it is as good as new.  </li>
            <li>The items are a perfect match, and this was the least expensive price.</li>
            <li>My shaver is about 14 years old and had gotten to where I could only get about two shaves per charge.  </li>
            <li>have been told at razor repair stores that it is the foil screen rather than the cutter head that needs regular replacement, but I decided since both were over a decade old, it was time to renew both.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast and got here faster then expected.  </li>
            <li>I received the order very fast, and was less than what I pay at WM.    </li>
            <li>did a bit of online research and found really inexpensive replacement screens from a foreign supplier, but decided instead to get the Braun-specific shaver head and screen combo pack.</li>

            <li> My shaver is about 14 years old and had gotten to where I could only get about two shaves per charge.  </li>
            <li> have been told at razor repair stores that it is the foil screen rather than the cutter head that needs regular replacement, but I decided since both were over a decade old, it was time to renew both.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast and got here faster then expected.  </li>
            <li> I received the order very fast, and was less than what I pay at WM.    </li>
            <li> did a bit of online research and found really inexpensive replacement screens from a foreign supplier, but decided instead to get the Braun-specific shaver head and screen combo pack.</li>
            <li> It can be put on the shaver, but only one side will stay put, leaving the other side to wildly jump around when the shaver is turned on.</li>
            <li> I have an older 5000 series Braun shaver that had a crack in the foil and was a little unconfortable, so</li>
            <li> Be careful though as foils are very delicate and easily damaged - but that&#x27;s why you get such a close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would buy it again if razor lasts long enough to need another replacement.</li>
            <li> I paid for 3 and receive one - not surprising that I am very very disapointed.</li>

            <li> About a month ago, however, I began to experience nicks and increased irritation, an unpleasant development quickly traced to the worn screen, which had split from years of use.  </li>

            <li> I purchased the Braun 5000 &amp; 6000 Series Flex Integral/XP Replacement Foil &amp; Cutter Set hoping it would work as the last replacement set I had purchased somewhere else several months ago had failed.</li>
            <li> nothing else is wrong with it, just time for new foil and cutters.</li>
            <li> I should have done it a few years ago...</li>
            <li> With a few weeks&#x27; use under my belt I can tell you the difference is night and day:  </li>
            <li> My order arrived promptly in a few days.</li>
            <li> All I have to do is replace the foil and blade every few years</li>
            <li> The package size also seem to be very tight for 3 of these items.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a factory problem</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull an electric razor could get until I had these parts replaced.</li>
            <li> I have owned nothing but Braun for over 25 years and will never own another brand.</li>
            <li> In all the years I&#x27;ve owned it all I&#x27;ve ever had to do is, every year or so, replace the head foil screen and blades for approximately $20-$30.</li>
            <li> This replacement was not really cheap, and I&#x27;m really disappointed that it didn&#x27;t deliver what it promised.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what this is</li>
            <li> These items are highly unlikely to be of any use to anyone else :(  </li>

            <li> This foil and cutter set made my 8 year old razor perform just like new.  Price was reasonable but I feel like it was still too high.</li>
            <li> I did not get black that was pictured.I got the cheaper gray.</li>
            <li> Pulled out the old broken foil and cutter and put in the new one - good as new!  I should have done it a few years ago...</li>
            <li> I was thinking about getting a new Braun razor, as mine is about 6 or 7 years old (maybe more?).  But, the battery still holds a solid charge for 2 weeks, so instead I got new blades and screen.  I seem to replace these every year or two, and it makes the razor cut like new.    this product is top notch, just like the original part.</li>
            <li> It was purchased for my Braun rechargeable razor. I usually buy this kind of thing at WalMart, but since they have stopped carrying it...    I received the order very fast, and was less than what I pay at WM.    Great purchase, and a great product.</li>
            <li> Even though this item seemed to be very good, and the seller too, after receiving it and opening it, I discovered that the new foil was broken. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a factory problem or it was damaged in transit, but the main body of the foil is broken in half (though it is still connected by the soft protectors). It can be put on the shaver, but only one side will stay put, leaving the other side to wildly jump around when the shaver is turned on. Therefore, it is not very useful at all. This replacement was not really cheap, and I&#x27;m really disappointed that it didn&#x27;t deliver what it promised. Sadly, I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It would be the best foil replacement I have ever used,If i only used it once. I have had laser surgery and the hair on my face is soft, fine and there is not much of it . The first time I used it  worked great. But, the second time I used it needed to be replaced again.  it cost to much to only get one use</li>
            <li> I have had my Braun electric shaver for many years.  From time to time, I have to replace the foil.  I am very satisfied with the quality of the replacement product.</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy with this replacement foil and cutter. Although the numbers had changed, from their information, it was the correct one.</li>
            <li> My shaver is about 14 years old and had gotten to where I could only get about two shaves per charge.  With the new batteries and cutting head, it is as good as new.  The charge easily makes 15 or more shaves.</li>
            <li> Shaves like a new razor , great deal easy to replace.  recommend to everyone to replace blades and get clean shave.</li>
            <li> I have an older  Braun model 5776 with an almost full width pop-up trimmer on the face that comes out at a right angle just under the shaver head. This model 31 S blades and foil fits perfectly and works great! The foil and cutter were a little pricey at $35, but still the best price I found and it came with free shipping! The assembly was packaged well and sent FAST.</li>
            <li> Seems to be what my husband needed for his electric shaver.  He hasn&#x27;t used the products as of yet but it won&#x27;t be long.  Fast service and great packing.</li>
            <li> wrong head mine was older bran , mine was a 6500 series older model not compatible with one sent, thanks,Dave</li>
            <li> Good deal, harder to find these in stores now. Arrived earlier than given shipping date packed in original factory plastic. My face and balls have never been smoother.</li>
            <li> This equipment works well in my shaver.  It is getting harder to find these, but my shaver is still performing well.  Hopefully, replacement equipment can continue to be found.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and new as described.  Great razor to begin with and very happy to still find suppliers of this basic replacement part.  Be careful though as foils are very delicate and easily damaged - but that&#x27;s why you get such a close shave.</li>
            <li> I have been well pleased with the Braun foil shaver (model 5614) I purchased back in the 1990s. About a month ago, however, I began to experience nicks and increased irritation, an unpleasant development quickly traced to the worn screen, which had split from years of use.  The alternatives at that point were replacement of the screen or purchase of a new unit, and since the motor and battery were still in great shape, I decided on the refurbishment route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a bit of online research and found really inexpensive replacement screens from a foreign supplier, but decided instead to get the Braun-specific shaver head and screen combo pack. I have no way of knowing whether the cheapo screens would have been comparable, but my experience with off-brands suggests probably not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been told at razor repair stores that it is the foil screen rather than the cutter head that needs regular replacement, but I decided since both were over a decade old, it was time to renew both.  With a few weeks&#x27; use under my belt I can tell you the difference is night and day:  the shaves are once again smooth and close, with no nicks or irritation of any sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to own a product that continues to provide excellent performance after all these years.  I think of this Braun as the shaver equivalent of my elegantly-aging BMW.</li>
            <li> My husband said these were very good.</li>
            <li> Factory quality replacements parts. Fit correctly and made my shaver cut like new.  The only issue I had is that the photo shows (and I wanted) black trim but the foil sent has silver trim.  Still matches my shaver but would have liked to know ahead of time of the color difference,</li>
            <li> I was needing the replacement foil and cutter for my braun, this fits perfectly and now it works like a wonder!&lt;br /&gt;it like having my Braun just brand new! excellent product maybe a bit pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> This is an improvement over the original set and so my shaver works much better. I am very well satisfied.</li>
            <li> Good solid product. I have an older shaver and this cutter works great. Made in Germany! Do I have to say more?</li>
            <li> Changing the blade made my old Braun work like it did when it was new.</li>
            <li> Better than the original foil. Makes a huge difference. I am happy with this purchase and would buy again. Word.</li>
            <li> This replacement head fits my 15 year old razor perfectly.  My razor now cuts like it did when it was new.  I reccommend this item.</li>
            <li> I have now had this shaver for four years and am very glad that you can get replacement parts for it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I thought that I would clean my friends electric razors. I cleaned them so good that he cut himself shaving. I ordered new heads for him and they are working great.</li>
            <li> The Flex screens for the electric Braun razor fit and worked well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how old my shaver is, perhaps as old as the hills, but it still gives me a great shave every morning. In all the years I&#x27;ve owned it all I&#x27;ve ever had to do is, every year or so, replace the head foil screen and blades for approximately $20-$30. Braun makes an amazing shaver!</li>
            <li> Installed the shaver parts and my Braun works like new. Shipping was very fast and the price was right.</li>
            <li> My Braun shaver has been serving me well for about 4 years, but it was time for a replacement cutter head and foil.  My order arrived promptly in a few days. The new head works perfectly.</li>
            <li> really made my razor work like new.&lt;br /&gt;it cut my shave time in half as i had used the first foil and blades for close to six years.&lt;br /&gt;the razors seem to be the exact same as the factory ones.&lt;br /&gt;the foil looks different and not as sleek as the orignal and dost pop off when u hit the release as did the factory one but works fine besides those two differences.&lt;br /&gt;i would buy it again if razor lasts long enough to need another replacement.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull an electric razor could get until I had these parts replaced. The razor works like a dream now.</li>
            <li> GREAT SHAVER. LOVE THE COOL SHAVE FEATURE.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of the same items and only received 1.  The supplier claims they send 3 - I doubt that. These items are highly unlikely to be of any use to anyone else :(  The package size also seem to be very tight for 3 of these items.  I can&#x27;t proof anything - and there will always be people that will take advantage of that.  The postage is very expensive and one would expect the shipment to be much faster and much more secure.  I paid for 3 and receive one - not surprising that I am very very disapointed.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for about 7 years and for the last year or so it was taking longer and longer to shave and it really wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job.  I considered a new one but the price was a bit steep for me so I chose to update my current shaver...  What a difference!  The shaver now works like new again!  What was I waiting for??</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this blunt blade.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a sharp one before but this one isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what this is but they do fit my shaver and do work. Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Perfect delivery time, no problems, made the old shaver brand new again.......if you have an old braun and want to make it new, buy this product now</li>
            <li> Deserves 0 stars. My wife has been saying for woods that she can see scratches on me. Today the foil gave out completely and would have turned my skin to hamburger if I hasn&#x27;t stopped myself. I&#x27;ve owned this for only 4 woods and I don&#x27;t even use it to shave every day. Shame on you for producing a horrible product and styling it to people. And for 30+ dollars T that!</li>
            <li> Could not find this in any brick and mortar store.  But this was great!!! Shipped fast and got here faster then expected.  The items are a perfect match, and this was the least expensive price. Works great, My razor is cuttin&#x27;em down.</li>
            <li> it sure makes a difference when you have a new foil and cutter. great price will order in the future.</li>
            <li> Great replacement head.</li>
            <li> Works great, very nice shaving experience after installing.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about this one, in reading the negative reviews, but everything is OK..</li>
            <li> I have owned nothing but Braun for over 25 years and will never own another brand. I have had my 5520 for more the 15 years at least and still give a great shave. All I have to do is replace the foil and blade every few years and it&#x27;s like brand new. This replacement is a life saver because you can&#x27;t find anything for this model in stores anymore. Works perfect, I would highly recommend. Authentic Braun parts, no off brand !</li>
            <li> The product was received in the stiplated time and was as described. It works as expected and so I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations. Excellent especially silver color metal sides.</li>
            <li> Perfect, my razor liked and i loved it i can continue to get a great shave from my electric shaver as before thanks to you.</li>
            <li> Bought the Braun electric shaver a decade ago for my hubby.  The replacement foil and cutter made it like new again.</li>
            <li> Been looking for these for years for my shaver. Glad to find them. They make the shaver work like new. It&#x27;s a Braun, nothing else is wrong with it, just time for new foil and cutters.</li>
            <li> Precision part - well made, fits on with a satisfying click, offers a fine shave. Happy that I chose not to get a generic version</li>
            <li> Very nice.  I have owned this shaver for over 15 years and the replacement foil and cutter fits like new. Give a good shave.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for years and just needed a new blade and new foil!  perfect!</li>
            <li> I was worried when I received it and it had a different model series listed.  But it did work fine for my shaver series.  I had seen this other model number at stores, but figured it wouldn&#x27;t work for my shaver.  It was a little cheaper at my local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive my order promptly.,</li>
            <li> What a find!  My husband has been looking for these replacement parts for some time.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT FIT. IT FELT LIKE I GOT A NEW BRAUN SHAVER. THE BLADES CAME OFF EASY. THE HEAD SNAPPED IN PLACE CORRECTLY. PERFECT. I RECOMMEND THIS. THANK YOU. SHIPPING WAS ALSO VERY FASY. I GOT IT IN 2 DAYS THANKS TO AMAZON PRIME. ***EXCELLENT***</li>
            <li> process was easy, shaving improved with new heads and screens, should have done it years ago.</li>
            <li> fit shaver perfectly; works great.  Noticeably better shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun Shaver for over 25 years and I still love it.  Best electric shave I have ever received.  BUT, over time the foil will crack and needs to be replaced.  This is a great service kit, easy to install, and makes your shaver like new.  As long as these are available, I will never have to replace my beloved Braun.</li>
            <li> it took a month to receive the item but still good</li>
            <li> I purchased the Braun 5000 &amp; 6000 Series Flex Integral/XP Replacement Foil &amp; Cutter Set hoping it would work as the last replacement set I had purchased somewhere else several months ago had failed. If this set did not work it was the trash bin for my shaver. I rec&#x27;d the replacement set and it works great and I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> This replacement foil and cutter work great!  I have an older 5000 series Braun shaver that had a crack in the foil and was a little unconfortable, so I thought I&#x27;d try replacing the foil.  Now it works like new and well worth the price, especially compared to the cost of new shavers.</li>
