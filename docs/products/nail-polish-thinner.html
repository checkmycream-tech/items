            <li>but the flip top works</li>
            <li>okay to control the amount I add.  </li>
            <li>I find it works much better that way.</li>
            <li>Some polish I like more than others and at the end of them</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how I survived without this for so many years.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Again I have to come up with filler words to be able to leave a review :)</li>
            <li>This is just ok, it does the job, but requires more drops than suggested.</li>
            <li>I had some issues with the packaging with the original bottle I received (the contents leaked) and they were able to resolve the problem very quickly.</li>
            <li>Delivered very quickly and packaged extremly well.</li>
            <li>The product works fine, but the purchase was a hassle.</li>
            <li>I have got one really beautiful polish but it turned out to be too thick, my old thinner was over, so I got this one, and it did the job perfectly well.</li>
            <li>The cost is low for this product and the results are great.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the amazing product.</li>
            <li>but that I liked too much to throw away.</li>
            <li>It really works well, Love it, deff recommend it for any who wants to revive their old favorite nail polish!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very useful product if you use nail polish a lot.</li>
            <li>The dropper bottle for this makes it so easy to add just the right amount to your polishes.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all that matters, right?!</li>
            <li>I use this all the time, and it really extends the life of your polishes and makes sure you get all the value you can from them.</li>
            <li>this came really quick for drlivery.</li>
            <li>This is a good investment especially if you have a large nail polish collection.</li>
            <li>so i puta few drops in the polish and it looks great now.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I hope I explained that right.</li>
            <li>The part I dislike the most is that my polishes will thicken up again after thinning and become even thicker than they were prior to the thinner</li>
            <li>Nail polish remover is just not the same, and I never find this in stores, so I bought up quite a bit and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>thanks again</li>
            <li>It does the job perfectly, it is very easy to handle without making a mess or dripping, and is very sparingly to use.</li>
            <li>I got this a few days ago and have used it to successfully resuscitate many bottles of nail polish which were thick and crappy and otherwise would&#x27;ve been ready to go into the garbage.</li>
            <li>Actual product took too long to come in the mail, overall i like how the product works, great size bottle.</li>
            <li>works great to thin out and is worth the extra $</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to ad MORE of it to polishes that I&#x27;ve previously thinned.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Seche Vite top coats were suddenly restored to their previous glory.</li>
            <li>This is so good to thin a nail polish!</li>
            <li>A 7 year old bottle of Essie nail polish was suddenly like new again.</li>
            <li>The problem for me with this is that i have to put too much in the nail polish for it to make it thinner, but i guess is because maybe the nail polish is too dry.</li>
            <li>the nail polish was like new with only a couple drops :) even works on top coats and base coats :) Only thing is the smell is strong :(</li>
            <li>Seems to have fixed my dried nail polish pretty well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone, just a small investment for a long lifetime of longevity to all of your nail colors; just a few drops in a couple of shakes restore any amazing color that you held on to for  a long time.  </li>

            <li> Not expensive and will thin your dry, thickened polish with just a couple of drops.  </li>
            <li> It does work, although I have used other brands that were more expensive that worked with LESS product.  </li>
            <li> It also did not dull or have any negative effects that I can tell.</li>
            <li> and i think i got over half left and over 50 nail polish.</li>
            <li> Thin polishes are so much easier to work</li>
            <li> I do notice a slight change in the polish after using this, especially with glitters, it makes the dry time a little longer.</li>
            <li> A little over $4.00 is worth it to save my expensive polishes.</li>
            <li> My half used bottles</li>
            <li> The worst part, when I removed the plastic around the product it somehow left the entire bottle very sticky!!</li>
            <li> worked  on even the nail polish that had completely dry and the brush rock hard</li>
            <li> I will never use any other brand !!</li>
            <li> put a few drops of this in my polish before I start painting almost every time I do my nails.</li>
            <li> , they get a little thick</li>
            <li> : /  </li>
            <li> but the shipping was excessively expensive, it came in too big of a box with crammed space-filler.</li>
            <li> OTHER REVIEWS SAID IT WOUD THIN THICKENED POLISH, BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T FOR ME</li>
            <li> It works but I feel like it makes the nail polish smell stronger at least for me</li>
            <li> i had some polish that was thick</li>
            <li> but it leaked during transit and now the whole bottle is sticky and very unpleasant to hold.</li>
            <li> It worked with my Seche Vite and was so much less expensive than their thinner.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to thin out my Seche Vite having read elsewhere that it worked for someone else.  </li>

            <li> The problem for me with this is that i have to put too much in the nail polish for it to make it thinner, but i guess is because maybe the nail polish is too dry.</li>
            <li> Great price and does the job beautifully. Wish I had known about this years ago when I threw out polishes...</li>
            <li> Finally can use the entire bottle of nail polish!</li>
            <li> This is so good to thin a nail polish! I have got one really beautiful polish but it turned out to be too thick, my old thinner was over, so I got this one, and it did the job perfectly well.</li>
            <li> worked  on even the nail polish that had completely dry and the brush rock hard the nail polish was like new with only a couple drops :) even works on top coats and base coats :) Only thing is the smell is strong :(</li>
            <li> works great to thin out and is worth the extra $ and you get the big bottle. im still using the same bottle and i think i got over half left and over 50 nail polish.</li>
            <li> I bought this to thin out my Seche Vite having read elsewhere that it worked for someone else.  I like the fact this is 4 ounces which is a great size and it worked very well.  I also use it in my polishes that are a bit thickened and it works well for those as well.  The cost is low for this product and the results are great.  I only wish it had a dropper but the flip top works okay to control the amount I add.  It worked with my Seche Vite and was so much less expensive than their thinner.  It also did not dull or have any negative effects that I can tell.</li>
            <li> this came really quick for drlivery. i had some polish that was thick so i puta few drops in the polish and it looks great now. thanks again</li>
            <li> The packaging was great, size of bottle good. Actual product took too long to come in the mail, overall i like how the product works, great size bottle.</li>
            <li> Wow!  What an amazing product! Highly recommend it to anyone, just a small investment for a long lifetime of longevity to all of your nail colors; just a few drops in a couple of shakes restore any amazing color that you held on to for  a long time.  I recommend  this product to everyone and anyone who does nails. Thank you so much for the amazing product.</li>
            <li> It does work, although I have used other brands that were more expensive that worked with LESS product.  I have noticed that the polish I have used it in have thickened up again as time goes by. I&#x27;ve had to ad MORE of it to polishes that I&#x27;ve previously thinned. Even with that, it does work, doesn&#x27;t seem to effect the nail enamel as in the way it dries, or the look of it, or the color. This is the second time I have purchased this thinner. I figured out that if I drop it into the polish bottle by dripping it backwards from the dropper on the container lid. Just flip it up and pour it backwards. I hope I explained that right. : /  I find it works much better that way. I have actually used up several bottles of polish by using this thinner. Some polish I like more than others and at the end of them, they get a little thick so I can extend it enough to use it up. This is a very useful product if you use nail polish a lot. I do so it&#x27;s worth it to me. A little over $4.00 is worth it to save my expensive polishes.</li>
            <li> This product is a life saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It saves so much money because you don&#x27;t have to toss out old polishes when they get too thick to use.&lt;br /&gt;2) Thin polishes are so much easier to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a few drops of this in my polish before I start painting almost every time I do my nails. I&#x27;m able to get much more even coats and apply them perfectly with thinned out polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how I survived without this for so many years. This is a must-have for anyone who does their own nails.</li>
            <li> Finally I found this Nail Polish Thinner. It does the job perfectly, it is very easy to handle without making a mess or dripping, and is very sparingly to use. Saves a lot of money on nail polish. I recommend it with 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Good product but it leaked during transit and now the whole bottle is sticky and very unpleasant to hold. I will have to buy a seperate container to hold the product in.</li>
            <li> but the shipping was excessively expensive, it came in too big of a box with crammed space-filler. The worst part, when I removed the plastic around the product it somehow left the entire bottle very sticky!! The product works fine, but the purchase was a hassle.</li>
            <li> It works but I feel like it makes the nail polish smell stronger at least for me it does .</li>
            <li> I got this a few days ago and have used it to successfully resuscitate many bottles of nail polish which were thick and crappy and otherwise would&#x27;ve been ready to go into the garbage. A 7 year old bottle of Essie nail polish was suddenly like new again. My half used bottles Seche Vite top coats were suddenly restored to their previous glory. This is a good investment especially if you have a large nail polish collection. A+ as well for the seller too. I had some issues with the packaging with the original bottle I received (the contents leaked) and they were able to resolve the problem very quickly.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other brand !! In love !</li>
            <li> It works! That&#x27;s all that matters, right?! Awesome. Very strong smell, but that&#x27;s okay. Lots to go around; should have it for a while.</li>
            <li> Seems to have fixed my dried nail polish pretty well.</li>
            <li> great deal for the price</li>
            <li> The dropper bottle for this makes it so easy to add just the right amount to your polishes. I use this all the time, and it really extends the life of your polishes and makes sure you get all the value you can from them. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It really works well, Love it, deff recommend it for any who wants to revive their old favorite nail polish!!!</li>
            <li> It thins nail polish.  Again I have to come up with filler words to be able to leave a review :)</li>
            <li> This is just ok, it does the job, but requires more drops than suggested. I do notice a slight change in the polish after using this, especially with glitters, it makes the dry time a little longer. The part I dislike the most is that my polishes will thicken up again after thinning and become even thicker than they were prior to the thinner (after 1-2 weeks after thinning). I might have to go try the OPI thinner, because I had the same issue with the Zoya thinner, unsure if this is just the nature of thinning products?</li>
            <li> Not expensive and will thin your dry, thickened polish with just a couple of drops.  Nail polish remover is just not the same, and I never find this in stores, so I bought up quite a bit and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING &amp; WORKS JUST AS WELL... AMAZING... GREATEST INVENTION. :D THANX &amp; GOD BLESS :D JUST BRILLANT :D</li>
            <li> Delivered very quickly and packaged extremly well. I have already used it on several bottles and I am quit happy with the product. Now I can keep my bottles of polish without worry of having to throw money away.</li>
            <li> This stuff has rejuvinated nail polish that&#x27;s been unusable for *decades* but that I liked too much to throw away. HOORAAY!</li>
            <li> OTHER REVIEWS SAID IT WOUD THIN THICKENED POLISH, BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T FOR ME</li>
