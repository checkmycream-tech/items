            <li>best medication by far</li>
            <li>so most acne treatment, just causes a rash and more breakouts.</li>
            <li>I used Rezamid as a teenager many years ago because a dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li>I have used Rezamid for many years.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many things,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do you believe in magic?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it works better if I tap it on with the tip of my finger, but don&#x27;t spread it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Also, when I opened this one, it was separated, oily or watery at the top, thicker at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>Try it you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Love this acne medicine.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It does smell funky, and it does make your skin dry, but I have oily skin, so its perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I like that this is pre-tinted [and the basic color works well on my very fair skin tone].  </li>
            <li>It works great to clear acne.  </li>
            <li>and the ones I do get heal very quickly.</li>
            <li>but  on Amazon it was easy to find and purchase.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like it available.  </li>
            <li>I read on several blogs that this was great for cystic acne.</li>
            <li>as in you better spread it around  your face quick) to give it a chance to work and then use a good basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest, and the coloring it comes with sometimes dries oddly on your skin, but it&#x27;s worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li>AND THE S/H HAVE A GREAT EXCUSE TO SLAP YOU WITH $2.00 ADDITIONAL....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>Works Great to dry blemishes</li>
            <li>I only wish that the color could be adjusted somehow to work with fair skin.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t red, maybe that&#x27;s the good part....</li>
            <li>The key to using this product is consistency and quantity- use it often and use a good amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to benzoyl peroxide in some other acne products, so I&#x27;ve been happy to find that this product works for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always amazed at how quickly Rezamid works on my acne.</li>
            <li>it does super quickly-</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to try it but found that it is less drying, has a far more pleasant odor and, IMHO, does a more consistent job with cysts if you catch them in time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very helpful in controlling swelling and bleeding from the huge number of ingrown hairs on my chin, and the resulting nightly surgical interventions.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that really works good on cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny...</li>
            <li>Honestly, to those who are going through acne/have acne prone skin/oily skin or are concerned that foundation will break them out, look no further.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I found the product because it is not easy to find.</li>
            <li>In addition, I can blend in the right color for my skin and it covers well.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and it helps to heal my pimples pretty well.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>when you first out it on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered identical Rezamid in the past, and it has had a pinkish hue, which is more appropriate to my skin color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost every skin treatment on the market: Retin-A, benezoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, antibiotics, light treatments, natural remedies, etc.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years first recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>so be aware if an allergy.  </li>
            <li>First time I have used this product.  </li>
            <li>so I was so glad to finally find a decent alternative.</li>
            <li>I have been cursed with oily skin and large pores all of my life.  </li>
            <li>Rezamid is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that has made a huge difference in how my skin looks.</li>
            <li>It looks very orange like on me.</li>
            <li>and I mixes the whole color match.</li>
            <li>I found that it didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It really dries up pimples fast.</li>
            <li>I use rezamid as make up, I mix it with a tiny bit of sunscreen/moisturizer and make my own sheer foundation</li>
            <li>Works good, but is pretty thin.</li>
            <li>More often than not I&#x27;m subject to large, painful cysts on my cheeks alongside my nose, my chin, and occasionally on my nose itself (delightful).</li>
            <li>Zaps down pimples before they get better.</li>
            <li>This one is a little thinner and goes on better, but you have to really shake the bottle to mix the liquid.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Unlike other sulfur based acne products, this one seems to not have as strong a smell.  </li>
            <li>I generally reserve this for overnight use but have managed to use it during the day with no weird looks or comments.</li>
            <li>After using Rezamid consistently for about 6 months, I barely ever get blemishes-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything, from new products that cost a fortune, to home remedies like rubbing lemon on your face</li>
            <li>My mother in law gave it to me, and in two days, my face is almost totally clear!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how well that works to match anyone&#x27;s skin tone, but I love this stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, can be tinted to match skin tone, and is one of the few products that reduces pimples overnight.  </li>
            <li>Hoping it will infact work on adult acne.</li>
            <li>I have used Rezamid lotion since I was 19 years old</li>
            <li>and I am now 67 years old.  </li>
            <li>no where near my eyes</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that gave me the results I wanted, and fast.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know that I would use it during the day anyway because it&#x27;s kind of flaky and not great as a makeup substitute or for applying makeup over.</li>
            <li>Sulfacet-R is also pretty stinky, so I was limited to using at home or overnight.</li>
            <li>It is the only product that will cover and dry up pimples quickly.  </li>
            <li>It really does dry out oily skin and any acne practically overnight, plus it also seems to sooth redness.</li>
            <li>It may seem pricey, but it goes a long, long way and is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I am now 59 years old and still deal with an occasional breakout.</li>
            <li>It dries out your skin pretty bad, but it also drastically reduces the swelling and pain of a large cyst very quickly, along with help masking the redness.</li>
            <li>As long as you&#x27;re not allergic to sulfur in products, you may find that this product helps keep your skin clear.  </li>
            <li>It did dry out a cystic blemish, but it still took along time to completely heal.  </li>

            <li> It did dry out a cystic blemish, but it still took along time to completely heal.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it dry out the acne, it also acts like a cover up.</li>
            <li> I save the old bottle, rinse it out, and share half a bottle with my parents.  </li>
            <li> Now, deep in middle age, I get occasional, pesky breakouts and have longed for my old but extremely hard to find remedy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use both at the same time because both of them severely dried my skin like no other</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how long this 2 ounce bottle lasts me.</li>
            <li> I spent over hundred dollars for this topical medication along with another acne cream.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s helpful, especially if you can&#x27;t get to your dermatologist to get a Kenalog injection or other treatment.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever - very long shelf life.  </li>
            <li> Still, as drying as it is, my skin is never as dry and irritated as it was with benzoyl peroxide and Rezamid doesn&#x27;t bleach my hair and sheets.</li>
            <li> Within a couple days, my acne was dried up and new breakouts were coming in less and less as time went on.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If I have a particularly bad breakout, I&#x27;ll use it during the day, but that usually isn&#x27;t necessary because it works so quickly at night.</li>
            <li> So in other words if you have darker skin it might not match your skin too well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products, but none of them work as well as this does.</li>
            <li> It helps with the drying of acne and other pimples.  </li>
            <li> I like to lighten the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> So if too dark in color for you then?</li>
            <li> I have used Sulfacet-R Topical lotion (an Rx medication) on at least two occasion and while it often helped (bringing down the swelling), I found that it caused dryness and peeling at the site of the cyst.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t spread smoothly...made me feel like I was spreading some sort of severely watered down paint on my face.</li>
            <li> Shelf life is about 18 months, then it starts to break down, and needs to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is not smooth and uniform as with my previous purchase of Rezamid.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive, but you don&#x27;t need a lot to make a difference, so this little bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it takes 2-3 days to get rid of a zit and it stings a little</li>
            <li> Of course it was a little cheaper then.</li>
            <li> It ends up being a little blobby, but that doesn&#x27;t matter when I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a few bucks</li>
            <li> It comes with a color matcher so you can customize the color of it by just a few drops of the matcher.  </li>
            <li> The 1st thing I noticed though,  the base color it comes in, is almost too dark all ready.</li>
            <li> I put it on every morning and by the end of the day my skin is not more oily like it used to be</li>
            <li> this at the drug store, and they would usually have&lt;br</li>
            <li> It supposed to be worn like make up but its far too pink for my yellow skin and even with the mixer, it looks terrible.</li>
            <li> Also, because it is so drying I usually apply it, let it dry(which</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best acne treatment ever!</li>
            <li> THE PRICE OF POSTAGE IS KILLING....THE STAMP GOES UP 2 OR 3 CENTS AND THE S/H HAVE A GREAT EXCUSE TO SLAP YOU WITH $2.00 ADDITIONAL....NOT PRETTY!&lt;br /&gt;ITEM IS EXCELLENT!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it helps to heal my pimples pretty well. I only wish that the color could be adjusted somehow to work with fair skin. It looks very orange like on me.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product.  I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t perform as well as I thought it would.  It&#x27;s the only retail item that I&#x27;ve found with recorsinol, a peeling agent.  It did dry out a cystic blemish, but it still took along time to completely heal.  I was looking for a miracle product, I guess there is no such product!</li>
            <li> best medication by far</li>
            <li> Ultimate spot treater! Zaps down pimples before they get better. Can be used to conceal pimples too, if u manage to get it to a shade closer to your skin tone</li>
            <li> The darn stuff works!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using rezamid ever since my dermatologist recommended it for me, which was about 4 years ago. This is like a miracle product for acne. Not only does it dry out the acne, it also acts like a cover up. If you are using any foundation, concealer, or powder, then I will recommend that you don&#x27;t because Rezamid will act like a cover up. I tried Maybeline, Neutrogena, and Clinique&#x27;s foundation and powder before, but it made my skin breakout. However, when I started using rezamid, it covered and prevented the breakout.</li>
            <li> This product has been around forever although it&#x27;s hard to find.  It works great to clear acne.  The problem is the smell, color and the fact that it tarnishes silver jewelry.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years it&#x27;s the only thing that I have found to keep my face from being so oily.thant you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rezamid for years.  It&#x27;s light, can be tinted to match skin tone, and is one of the few products that reduces pimples overnight.  I&#x27;ve worn it under makeup and as makeup.  My son also has used it since he was a teen because it covers without feeling or looking like makeup.  It may seem pricey, but it goes a long, long way and is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought it again do to the reviews. Don&#x27;t remember if it was my dermatologist, or my mother&#x27;s who recommended it,  but I used it in my teens. Hoping it will infact work on adult acne. The 1st thing I noticed though,  the base color it comes in, is almost too dark all ready. I like to lighten the dark spots.  I think it was that way 40 yrs. ago too. So if too dark in color for you then? It still is.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to everything.. so most acne treatment, just causes a rash and more breakouts. I started using this when a friend of my sisters recommended it. Within a couple days, my acne was dried up and new breakouts were coming in less and less as time went on. I recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I used Rezamid as a teenager many years ago because a dermatologist recommended it. It worked, and I had no problems with it or complaints about it. Now, deep in middle age, I get occasional, pesky breakouts and have longed for my old but extremely hard to find remedy. Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have used Rezamid lotion since I was 19 years old and I am now 67 years old.  It is the only product that will cover and dry up pimples quickly.  I am so happy I found the product because it is not easy to find.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Hi! I am allergic to 99% of all acne medicines. This is the only acne med. that helps you with oiliness without making your skin red or peal. The color is great for my skin but I am very white and I mixes the whole color match. So in other words if you have darker skin it might not match your skin too well. I put it on every morning and by the end of the day my skin is not more oily like it used to be and nobody can see anything because it looks like a great make up too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s chalky looking and dries my acne under the skin. Unfortunately, I look lumpy and still have zits. They aren&#x27;t red, maybe that&#x27;s the good part....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve depended upon this stuff for years. It&#x27;s very helpful in controlling swelling and bleeding from the huge number of ingrown hairs on my chin, and the resulting nightly surgical interventions.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to buy this off her website but it was almost $10 cheaper on Amazon..it works well on red bumps and cysts but not as well on whiteheads. I&#x27;d say it takes 2-3 days to get rid of a zit and it stings a little when you first out it on. I only use it once a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne for 25+ years now, beginning at age 13. More often than not I&#x27;m subject to large, painful cysts on my cheeks alongside my nose, my chin, and occasionally on my nose itself (delightful). I have used Sulfacet-R Topical lotion (an Rx medication) on at least two occasion and while it often helped (bringing down the swelling), I found that it caused dryness and peeling at the site of the cyst. Sulfacet-R is also pretty stinky, so I was limited to using at home or overnight. In recent years my dermatologist has recommended Rezamid, which she conveniently sells in her office. I was reluctant to try it but found that it is less drying, has a far more pleasant odor and, IMHO, does a more consistent job with cysts if you catch them in time. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure but it&#x27;s helpful, especially if you can&#x27;t get to your dermatologist to get a Kenalog injection or other treatment. I&#x27;m very pale so I never use the dye pack. I generally reserve this for overnight use but have managed to use it during the day with no weird looks or comments. It&#x27;s definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it but the last time I ordered it was a year ago. That&#x27;s how long this 2 ounce bottle lasts me. Of course it was a little cheaper then. Great stuff</li>
            <li> I have used Rezamid for many years. It&#x27;s the best thing&lt;br /&gt;for acne that I&#x27;ve ever tried... and I&#x27;ve tried many things,&lt;br /&gt;both prescription and over the counter. I used to&lt;br /&gt;buy this at the drug store, and they would usually have&lt;br /&gt;to order it in for me. So happy that I found out that&lt;br /&gt;you can buy it via Amazon. It&#x27;s actually a few bucks&lt;br /&gt;cheaper this way, plus I don&#x27;t have to bother&lt;br /&gt;with having the pharmacist order it.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that really works good on cystic acne.  It dries out your skin pretty bad, but it also drastically reduces the swelling and pain of a large cyst very quickly, along with help masking the redness.</li>
            <li> Works well as a cover up product. No complaints. MarkR</li>
            <li> Grand daughter is happy with this product</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re not allergic to sulfur in products, you may find that this product helps keep your skin clear.  I&#x27;m allergic to benzoyl peroxide in some other acne products, so I&#x27;ve been happy to find that this product works for me.</li>
            <li> Works good, but is pretty thin. Actually prefer Acnomel.</li>
            <li> I was turned on to this product when I was a teenager.  I&#x27;m now 59 and when I occasionally get a blemish I use this product.  It is absolutely THE BEST.  It lasts forever - very long shelf life.  It&#x27;s worth every penny...I mean dollar.</li>
            <li> my mom recommended this to me because she used it when she was younger and i love it! I use it as foundation and at the same time it clears up my acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rezamid for years.  It both covers and clears my occasional pimples and oily skin around the nose.  It is a good product but it must be used with caution.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Do you believe in magic? Well, if you don&#x27;t, try Rezamid and it will make a believer out of you. I&#x27;m always amazed at how quickly Rezamid works on my acne. I put it on at night, and notice a reduction in redness and the size of blemishes by morning. I&#x27;ve found that it works better if I tap it on with the tip of my finger, but don&#x27;t spread it. It ends up being a little blobby, but that doesn&#x27;t matter when I&#x27;m sleeping. If I have a particularly bad breakout, I&#x27;ll use it during the day, but that usually isn&#x27;t necessary because it works so quickly at night. It is a bit expensive, but you don&#x27;t need a lot to make a difference, so this little bottle will last a long time. I&#x27;ve used other products, but none of them work as well as this does.</li>
            <li> NO. Just no. Didn&#x27;t do a thing. Didn&#x27;t spread smoothly...made me feel like I was spreading some sort of severely watered down paint on my face. And to make matters worse...I had an allergic reaction to it...and my eyes stung so badly...even though I had it no where near my eyes</li>
            <li> I love it.  Nothing like it available.  And delivery is exquisite.</li>
            <li> A good product for spot treatment or all over the face; whichever you choose.  It helps with the drying of acne and other pimples.  Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> The color of this Rezamid was brownish.  I&#x27;ve ordered identical Rezamid in the past, and it has had a pinkish hue, which is more appropriate to my skin color.  Also, when I opened this one, it was separated, oily or watery at the top, thicker at the bottom.  I&#x27;d hoped shaking it would solve the problem, but EVERY time I open it it, I have the same problem.  The consistency is not smooth and uniform as with my previous purchase of Rezamid.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anybody who is experiencing a problem with acne ...I bought this for my teenage son after looking for it for quite awhile...I remember how it helped me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every skin treatment on the market: Retin-A, benezoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, antibiotics, light treatments, natural remedies, etc. Rezamid is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that has made a huge difference in how my skin looks. After using Rezamid consistently for about 6 months, I barely ever get blemishes- and the ones I do get heal very quickly. The key to using this product is consistency and quantity- use it often and use a good amount. It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest, and the coloring it comes with sometimes dries oddly on your skin, but it&#x27;s worth giving it a shot. Be patient and use it every day and it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ll see results too. Highly, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this all the time when she sees a blemish</li>
            <li> I read on several blogs that this was great for cystic acne. I found that it didn&#x27;t really work. It is also a really weird color to have on your face.</li>
            <li> We have found this product to be highly effective. This was a re-order.</li>
            <li> I spent over hundred dollars for this topical medication along with another acne cream. I couldn&#x27;t use both at the same time because both of them severely dried my skin like no other but this one was the worst treatment by far. It stung like crazy and I realized it has alcohol and I was on Proactive for two years before I switch to this. It supposed to be worn like make up but its far too pink for my yellow skin and even with the mixer, it looks terrible. It neither help my pre-exsisting break out or prevent it.</li>
            <li> Have used this for about 40 years.  Great cover up</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years first recommended to me by my dermatologist. It is the only thing that dries and clears up my forehead acne!</li>
            <li> Great product for ache</li>
            <li> I like that this is pre-tinted [and the basic color works well on my very fair skin tone].  Unlike other sulfur based acne products, this one seems to not have as strong a smell.  It calms blemishes without over drying surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> fast shipper excellent product only thing that works on facial cystic acne! Try it you&#x27;ll be glad you did. thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and can be hard to find but  on Amazon it was easy to find and purchase.  It works great, sometimes within 2 days.</li>
            <li> Honestly, to those who are going through acne/have acne prone skin/oily skin or are concerned that foundation will break them out, look no further.  I use rezamid as make up, I mix it with a tiny bit of sunscreen/moisturizer and make my own sheer foundation and when i need more coverage I use it by itself!  it works so well, doesn&#x27;t break me out, i&#x27;ve been using it for years.  It comes with a color matcher so you can customize the color of it by just a few drops of the matcher.  I&#x27;m not sure how well that works to match anyone&#x27;s skin tone, but I love this stuff and I will continue to use it for years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been so good to me for over five years.  I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Works Great to dry blemishes</li>
            <li> I have been using Rezamid since high school - now 50 years - it is the best for pimples, scrapes, any out break.  It covers while it is healing, sometimes seems like overnight!  It is sulphur based so be aware if an allergy.  It is expensive, but worth it.  Shelf life is about 18 months, then it starts to break down, and needs to be replaced.  I save the old bottle, rinse it out, and share half a bottle with my parents.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a surprisingly good product for something I&#x27;d never heard of. I suddenly became allergic to the benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid I&#x27;d been using since my teens so I was so glad to finally find a decent alternative. It really does dry out oily skin and any acne practically overnight, plus it also seems to sooth redness. My skin is fair so I didn&#x27;t need the tint to match my skin color but I don&#x27;t know that I would use it during the day anyway because it&#x27;s kind of flaky and not great as a makeup substitute or for applying makeup over. Also, because it is so drying I usually apply it, let it dry(which it does super quickly- as in you better spread it around  your face quick) to give it a chance to work and then use a good basic moisturizer. Still, as drying as it is, my skin is never as dry and irritated as it was with benzoyl peroxide and Rezamid doesn&#x27;t bleach my hair and sheets.</li>
            <li> I have been cursed with oily skin and large pores all of my life.  I have tried every over the counter remedy there is.  They all help to some degree, but not as well as Rezamid for me.  In addition, I can blend in the right color for my skin and it covers well.</li>
            <li> The product works great dries out pimples and conceals as well. My teenage daughter and I both use it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a dermatologist years ago and I still use it. Covers well and is effective on acne. It can be diluted (smoothened out a bit) on your face with witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Love this acne medicine. I have been using it since it was a prescription back when I was a teenager. I am now 59 years old and still deal with an occasional breakout. It really dries up pimples fast. I have two grown daughters and they both have been using this product since they were teenagers.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My mother in law gave it to me, and in two days, my face is almost totally clear! I&#x27;ve tried everything, from new products that cost a fortune, to home remedies like rubbing lemon on your face (yeah, I know lol). This is the only thing that gave me the results I wanted, and fast. It does smell funky, and it does make your skin dry, but I have oily skin, so its perfect for me.</li>
            <li> First time I have used this product.  Always used Liquimat in the past.  This one is a little thinner and goes on better, but you have to really shake the bottle to mix the liquid.</li>
            <li> Love this product.I&#x27;ve been using it for 2yrs now.This is the answer for acne prone people.I have se it as makeu pbase.</li>
