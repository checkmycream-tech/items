            <li>My daughter is loving to learn how to put them in people hair.</li>
            <li>and she liked them alot</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this for someone who wants to do feathers as well.</li>
            <li>Very cute and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Very easy taught my nieces who are 5,8 and 13 how to use and they love it!</li>
            <li>My first review of this product wasn&#x27;t very good, but I made a mistake.</li>
            <li>Really loved the feathers and how easy to install they were.</li>
            <li>These extensions are super awesome and so easy to use, i love them and would recommend anyone to get them</li>
            <li>I learned how to put them in one youtube very easy with the tools it comes with.</li>
            <li>Was very easy to put in,  no directions came with it</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and variety of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>For sure but great and soft, and amazing quality,  So my point is the tools are great</li>
            <li>These are so easy to put in because of all the great easy to use tools in the package.</li>
            <li>Bought them to exchange out my own feathers but having so many extras I plan to continue giving them to my Lil cancer patients as well as my niece &amp; keep some for me.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t great quality and sometimes tricky to get to stay in but they are a fun way to change your look once in a while.</li>
            <li>I love the colors they are bright and very pretty !</li>
            <li>My daughter luved the kit she was able to do it herself as well very easy.</li>
            <li>You are able to put them in your hair very easy and then reuse them when you want them out that&#x27;s really cool and good use of it....</li>
            <li>but i had a great first expierience.</li>
            <li>i love the colors and they are easy to use!  </li>
            <li>They are more like synthetic colored hair extentions.</li>
            <li>The hair pieces are kinda cheap, but I liked them.</li>
            <li>My nieces love them in their heads.</li>
            <li>you will want to order more anyway.</li>
            <li>But for what I paid, I am pleased.</li>
            <li>so they need to be trimmed a bit now and then to keep it looking ok.</li>
            <li>My daughter and her friends love changing out the colors.</li>
            <li>and I love how it looks.</li>
            <li>Now as for being able to style it..</li>
            <li>More chemical than anything</li>
            <li>I even bought another set for a birthday gift for a friends daughter and will buy more</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>The price couldn&#x27;t have been better.  </li>
            <li>The feathers are more frayed ribbons than hair</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t use the hook supplied because we have a loop type hook from another kit we like better.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>dont leave in for more than a week</li>

            <li>Love doing these with friends, cousins and my Sis.</li>
            <li>They give you more beads then feathers .</li>
            <li>It came with a lot more than anticipated, but it took a month to get to me.</li>
            <li>But I was expecting more FEATHER LIKE feather hair extensions...</li>
            <li>Love the feathers.</li>
            <li>I also have another Lil girl whom finishes this week and will put in however many  feathers</li>

            <li>It is easy to use and they have stayed in for many days.</li>
            <li>Most were not staying in and tangled easily.</li>
            <li>I love wearing these in my hair, their easy to put in and take out.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t feather though, more like hair, but either way my 11 year old daughter was happy with what she picked out.  </li>
            <li>they came like a 2 weeks early witch is great.  </li>
            <li>Everything arrived on time which was great, but I was surprised to see that there were no instructions whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Feels like real hair, easy to put into hair and a variety of bright colors.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy again or suggest it, but the customer service was nice and refundedme right away.</li>
            <li>It doesnt come with any directions, however its super easy to use!</li>
            <li>it was so cheap to buy and soooo worth it!!</li>
            <li>They were easy to put in.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to remove and re-position.</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>My daughter loves &#x27;em!, just need to learn how to put them in with out the beads since they show easily</li>
            <li>Easy to put in your hair.</li>
            <li>Extensions tangle easily and break off.</li>
            <li>Tools were easy to use and I just found a tutorial online.  </li>
            <li>This Item Was So Easy To Use ,</li>
            <li>Easy</li>
            <li>but once you get it it&#x27;s really easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use stay in forever till u take them out can&#x27;t wait to order them tinsel ones so cool :)</li>
            <li>- you get a lot for very little and they look great in your hair and very easy to put in with the tools!</li>
            <li>The feathers and beads were fine quality also.</li>
            <li>They worked fine for my daughter</li>
            <li>But hopefully they will work just fine for my daughter to wear in her hair.... trying them out tomorrow</li>
            <li>They are beautiful, I love the colors, and the naturalness of the extensions, definitely would buy more, thank you so much</li>
            <li>but if your not in a hurry then this is exactly what your looking for! :)</li>
            <li>This was an amazing price for very high quality product.</li>
            <li>The tools are great but they only send you about 25 extension clips.</li>
            <li>but these looked so cheap.</li>
            <li>I realized when I ordered this kit that they were not actual feathers, which I was happy with.</li>
            <li>Well, the kit came without the hair threading tool, which is a really important part.</li>
            <li>I have not been brave enough to try  synthetic feathers</li>
            <li>look like cheap synthetic hair not a feather</li>
            <li>SURE they would melt right into your hair and be a disaster.</li>
            <li>I used a youtube video to make sure I was doing it right since this pack came with no instructions.</li>
            <li>Not bad, gets tangled easy...</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more!!</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply to my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the pliers that came with it were used.</li>
            <li>these are so fun and kids and adults!  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money for kit with tools!  </li>
            <li>Great item to have if you love adding a little fun to your hair.</li>
            <li>and I think these where about an inch longer than I expected which is a great thing because it gives you room to cut and style them into hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>but they still look cool</li>
            <li>This would be ok for straight hair</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cool to wear inschool.  </li>
            <li>I love these so much.</li>
            <li>Revise your posting title to reflect the true nature of this item.</li>
            <li>It came with enough beads which was good.</li>
            <li>i really recommend buying them :]</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>My iron gets to 410 degrees if I run it through quickly</li>
            <li>they rock,tons of compliments and super cute,great product.</li>
            <li>the color is very bright and long also very soft.</li>
            <li>was worth what i paid, love them and daughters love them easy to use and came before expected way before.</li>
            <li>i got all my stuff on time and every thing was there very pretty in your hair i would reccomend</li>
            <li>I liked this product because the price is reasonable and the quality is decent .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very durable.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommended it for anyone!!!</li>
            <li>The tools that came with it are worth it.</li>
            <li>They are fun</li>
            <li>Like I got my moneies worth.</li>
            <li>Glad I got all the tools with the kit, and also it came in like 3-4 weeks early than stated when I purchased it</li>
            <li>worth the price</li>
            <li>This is a fun kit.</li>
            <li>I got my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I would say a success</li>
            <li>Came with everything we need, I havent yet used them because its a christmas present but looks great so far esp for the price can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying and the price.</li>
            <li>they are so fun</li>
            <li>little girls love them!!</li>
            <li>and it was sent out right away...</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those of you new to these extensions here&#x27;s so easy directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the beads go quick, so make sure you order extra in your color, Mine came without, but they sent them when i notified them....</li>
            <li>The picture must be 3 or 4 of the kits put together because it is not nearly as lush as your own kit.</li>
            <li>Very pretty feathers, quality tools and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>you very much for your help.</li>
            <li>A huge hit at my 9 year old&#x27;s birthday party.</li>
            <li>i did read and was aware this was synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>this arrived snarled and static and all mixed together in the package.</li>
            <li>These were only OK.</li>
            <li>its okay also the price is very low</li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t actual feathers or featherlike, it&#x27;s more like dyed hair extensions..</li>
            <li>(First world problems I know!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>tried a very similar product and it worked much better then</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more extensions in the future.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as listed...initial package didn&#x27;t have the hook, pliers, or the beads but contacted the seller</li>
            <li>It was my first time trying the beads and did it under 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>I actually just bought it for the tools, not the hair extensions, but they turned out to be pretty cute.</li>
            <li>really pretty colors.</li>
            <li>Received exactly as seen.</li>
            <li>- i&#x27;d rather buy something like this at Hot Topic.</li>
            <li>I have not put them in yet but there very soft and really cool looking they got here very fast and</li>
            <li>Works great, looks cute, but the roots are a little thick and the beads are large and can be seen pretty easy.</li>
            <li>I am able to flat iron and curl them, every now</li>
            <li>Super excited to put them in my hair later this week!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical because of how cheap it was but took a chance and am sooo happy I did.</li>
            <li>This product is too easy all tools and hair come in the same order/package!!</li>
            <li>it is very simple to use and easy to put feathers in her hair and take them out.</li>
            <li>the pliers gets stuck and its hard but loved the feathers colors nd length</li>
            <li>they stay in so much longer than the ones that are put in at the hair salon for a much lower price.</li>
            <li>The whole thing came in a tan envelope; no packaging to speak of.</li>
            <li>A guide would&#x27;ve been appreciated, but we&#x27;ll figure it out.</li>
            <li>It was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Ended up giving it to my daughter since she has straight hair.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t pay an arm and a leg for them at a department store when you can get them so much cheaper here.</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I put them in and trimmed them to length and really like them.</li>
            <li>The feather is straight</li>
            <li>they were real feathers.</li>
            <li>everything included and came fast.</li>
            <li>Feathers were much thinner than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>Was not expecting hair, was thinking I was getting real feathers.  </li>
            <li>I expected that I was buying rooster feathers, but when I got them they were not feathers at all, but more like hair extensions</li>
            <li>so pretty there arrived early</li>
            <li>No need to look for the particular tools....</li>
            <li>highly recomended,get one for everybody</li>
            <li>My 10 years old daughter absolutely loves it .</li>
            <li>The tools weren&#x27;t cheap or faulty as I expected.</li>
            <li>The feather extensions weren&#x27;t cheap and ragged as I also expected.</li>
            <li>We will see how long they last, but this is better than paying $10 each at the salon.  </li>
            <li>You are able to wash your hair normally, and if you have curly hair like I do, after a few days the feathers will curl too...</li>
            <li>All the other tools that came with it are fine (pliers, hook, and beads)</li>
            <li>When you want to remove it you just use the pliers to pinch in the opposite direction and it comes right out.  </li>
            <li>I gave it to my daughter to play with and bought a new gift.</li>
            <li>And super long!</li>
            <li>definitely recommend it to anyone interested in new look for hair.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to put in and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>Package contained exactly what was shown, except of course there are only 26 \\&quot;feathers\\&quot;..</li>
            <li>If you order this, be aware that you will get the pictured items only, all thrown together in one ziploc bag.</li>
            <li>These are exactly the same as the ones that are sold at Legoland California for $9.99 per extension.</li>
            <li>I even put one in my five year old sisters hair as well as mine and my friends!</li>
            <li>I knew from the actual description that you only get 26 of them, though at first look the picture is very decieving</li>
            <li>good kit, no directions have to figure it out yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took VERY long at least 3-4 weeks&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>Right now I have two of the aqua blue and one of the hot pink in my hair</li>
            <li>Package arrived 3 days before it was due to arrive so thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The feathers are a little cheap</li>
            <li>Shampoo does not agree with the hair and the colors are more dull than advertised.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter loves the set.</li>
            <li>We were surprised when we got these that they are NOT feathers at all, but plastic-like synthetic hair strands.</li>
            <li>10 year old daughter loves this.  </li>
            <li>Leaves them soft and relaxed.</li>
            <li>Shipped directly from China, which I did not know.</li>
            <li>Have a two year old</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>The price was right and they came sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>the smaller feathers are quite nice, although some are so stiff they won&#x27;t lie flat with the hair ...</li>
            <li>They are simple and easy to do yourself if you want to add a little splash of color or attitude to your hair.</li>
            <li>They are much higher quality then expected.  </li>
            <li>These are really easy to put in hair and my daughter usually can wear it for several months before it falls out.</li>
            <li>I ordered these feather hair extensions to put a little fun in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Might be fun for little girls but not a teen or adult.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s only happened on one extension.</li>
            <li>My hair is super long as in, all the way down to my hip line</li>
            <li>Fun for adding a little color to your hair without actually coloring your hair.  </li>
            <li>These are a HUGE hit for the little girls (aged 7 &amp; 9) and all of their friends at a party!  </li>
            <li>You can wash your hair with them in but just be careful on messing with them too much because they get stringy and get to where they won&#x27;t lay flat.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a fun way to get a small shock of color in the hair.</li>
            <li>It does come with several long feather extensions, however it also comes with some funny feather earrings and jewelry that we are not interested.</li>
            <li>I usually insert one behind each ear and it will do a peek a boo effect and works out good for me.  </li>
            <li>On the blue the tip was very flimsy and bent in half.</li>
            <li>So far its stayed in a very active 7 year old hair.</li>

            <li> i got this about fifteen days after i ordered it is amazing except</li>
            <li> And if you need to trim them up, the ends don&#x27;t look nice.</li>
            <li> and we got a lot of brown,  which wasn&#x27;t popular with the girls.  </li>
            <li> I liked it&lt;br /&gt;And</li>

            <li> They came nicely packaged with everything in it.</li>
            <li> it came on time it nice n</li>
            <li> My daughter is loving to learn how to put them in people hair.</li>
            <li> and she liked them alot</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this for someone who wants to do feathers as well.</li>

            <li> Very easy taught my nieces who are 5,8 and 13 how to use and they love it!</li>
            <li> My first review of this product wasn&#x27;t very good, but I made a mistake.</li>
            <li> Really loved the feathers and how easy to install they were.</li>
            <li> These extensions are super awesome and so easy to use, i love them and would recommend anyone to get them</li>
            <li> I learned how to put them in one youtube very easy with the tools it comes with.</li>
            <li> Was very easy to put in,  no directions came with it</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and variety of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> For sure but great and soft, and amazing quality,  So my point is the tools are great</li>
            <li> These are so easy to put in because of all the great easy to use tools in the package.</li>
            <li> Bought them to exchange out my own feathers but having so many extras I plan to continue giving them to my Lil cancer patients as well as my niece &amp; keep some for me.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t great quality and sometimes tricky to get to stay in but they are a fun way to change your look once in a while.</li>
            <li> I love the colors they are bright and very pretty !</li>
            <li> My daughter luved the kit she was able to do it herself as well very easy.</li>
            <li> You are able to put them in your hair very easy and then reuse them when you want them out that&#x27;s really cool and good use of it....</li>
            <li> but i had a great first expierience.</li>
            <li> i love the colors and they are easy to use!  </li>
            <li> They are more like synthetic colored hair extentions.</li>
            <li> The hair pieces are kinda cheap, but I liked them.</li>
            <li> My nieces love them in their heads.</li>
            <li> you will want to order more anyway.</li>
            <li> But for what I paid, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> so they need to be trimmed a bit now and then to keep it looking ok.</li>
            <li> My daughter and her friends love changing out the colors.</li>
            <li> and I love how it looks.</li>
            <li> Now as for being able to style it..</li>
            <li> More chemical than anything</li>
            <li> I even bought another set for a birthday gift for a friends daughter and will buy more</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> The price couldn&#x27;t have been better.  </li>
            <li> The feathers are more frayed ribbons than hair</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use the hook supplied because we have a loop type hook from another kit we like better.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> I love it :)</li>
            <li> dont leave in for more than a week</li>
            <li> I am buying more .</li>
            <li> Love doing these with friends, cousins and my Sis.</li>
            <li> They give you more beads then feathers .</li>
            <li> It came with a lot more than anticipated, but it took a month to get to me.</li>
            <li> But I was expecting more FEATHER LIKE feather hair extensions...</li>
            <li> Love the feathers.</li>
            <li> I also have another Lil girl whom finishes this week and will put in however many  feathers</li>
            <li> my daughers love that I have a way to safely put feathers in their hair and remove them without it hurting</li>
            <li> ):)</li>
            <li> This is more hair then a feather, I have no idea why these are called feathers....</li>
            <li> It looks great and is very affordable price.</li>
            <li> the beads and kit works great and the feathers are very durable</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> omg I just love these,....</li>
            <li> and I was sooo pleased with the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten feathers before but they weren&#x27;t synthetic and they were more costly.</li>
            <li> I love this hair kit</li>
            <li> i personally love this item.</li>
            <li> I am pleased. :)</li>
            <li> Love this set...</li>
            <li> and i really like the colors on it great</li>
            <li> i love them</li>
            <li> Most of the salons are charging a fortune for these.</li>
            <li> My girls love the colors that came.</li>
            <li> then that i love it</li>
            <li> and I got more variety.</li>
            <li> Very well priced  item, easy to use even for 10 years olds  , great quality.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks great, my daughters love it and they stay in for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and they have stayed in for many days.</li>
            <li> Most were not staying in and tangled easily.</li>
            <li> I love wearing these in my hair, their easy to put in and take out.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t feather though, more like hair, but either way my 11 year old daughter was happy with what she picked out.  </li>
            <li> they came like a 2 weeks early witch is great.  </li>
            <li> Everything arrived on time which was great, but I was surprised to see that there were no instructions whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Feels like real hair, easy to put into hair and a variety of bright colors.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again or suggest it, but the customer service was nice and refundedme right away.</li>
            <li> It doesnt come with any directions, however its super easy to use!</li>
            <li> it was so cheap to buy and soooo worth it!!</li>
            <li> They were easy to put in.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to remove and re-position.</li>
            <li> easy to use</li>
            <li> My daughter loves &#x27;em!, just need to learn how to put them in with out the beads since they show easily</li>
            <li> Easy to put in your hair.</li>
            <li> Extensions tangle easily and break off.</li>
            <li> Tools were easy to use and I just found a tutorial online.  </li>
            <li> This Item Was So Easy To Use ,</li>
            <li> Easy</li>
            <li> but once you get it it&#x27;s really easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use stay in forever till u take them out can&#x27;t wait to order them tinsel ones so cool :)</li>
            <li> - you get a lot for very little and they look great in your hair and very easy to put in with the tools!</li>
            <li> The feathers and beads were fine quality also.</li>
            <li> They worked fine for my daughter</li>
            <li> But hopefully they will work just fine for my daughter to wear in her hair.... trying them out tomorrow</li>
            <li> They are beautiful, I love the colors, and the naturalness of the extensions, definitely would buy more, thank you so much</li>
            <li> but if your not in a hurry then this is exactly what your looking for! :)</li>
            <li> This was an amazing price for very high quality product.</li>
            <li> The tools are great but they only send you about 25 extension clips.</li>
            <li> but these looked so cheap.</li>
            <li> I realized when I ordered this kit that they were not actual feathers, which I was happy with.</li>
            <li> Well, the kit came without the hair threading tool, which is a really important part.</li>
            <li> I have not been brave enough to try  synthetic feathers</li>
            <li> look like cheap synthetic hair not a feather</li>
            <li> SURE they would melt right into your hair and be a disaster.</li>
            <li> I used a youtube video to make sure I was doing it right since this pack came with no instructions.</li>
            <li> Not bad, gets tangled easy...</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more!!</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply to my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the pliers that came with it were used.</li>
            <li> these are so fun and kids and adults!  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money for kit with tools!  </li>
            <li> Great item to have if you love adding a little fun to your hair.</li>
            <li> and I think these where about an inch longer than I expected which is a great thing because it gives you room to cut and style them into hair.  </li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> but they still look cool</li>
            <li> This would be ok for straight hair</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cool to wear inschool.  </li>
            <li> I love these so much.</li>
            <li> Revise your posting title to reflect the true nature of this item.</li>
            <li> It came with enough beads which was good.</li>

            <li> I highly recommended it for anyone!!!</li>
            <li> The tools that came with it are worth it.</li>
            <li> They are fun</li>
            <li> Like I got my moneies worth.</li>
            <li> Glad I got all the tools with the kit, and also it came in like 3-4 weeks early than stated when I purchased it</li>
            <li> worth the price</li>
            <li> This is a fun kit.</li>
            <li> I got my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I would say a success</li>
            <li> Came with everything we need, I havent yet used them because its a christmas present but looks great so far esp for the price can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying and the price.</li>
            <li> they are so fun</li>
            <li> little girls love them!!</li>
            <li> and it was sent out right away...</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those of you new to these extensions here&#x27;s so easy directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the beads go quick, so make sure you order extra in your color, Mine came without, but they sent them when i notified them....</li>
            <li> The picture must be 3 or 4 of the kits put together because it is not nearly as lush as your own kit.</li>
            <li> Very pretty feathers, quality tools and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> you very much for your help.</li>
            <li> A huge hit at my 9 year old&#x27;s birthday party.</li>
            <li> i did read and was aware this was synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> this arrived snarled and static and all mixed together in the package.</li>
            <li> These were only OK.</li>
            <li> its okay also the price is very low</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t actual feathers or featherlike, it&#x27;s more like dyed hair extensions..</li>
            <li> (First world problems I know!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> tried a very similar product and it worked much better then</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more extensions in the future.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as listed...initial package didn&#x27;t have the hook, pliers, or the beads but contacted the seller</li>
            <li> It was my first time trying the beads and did it under 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I actually just bought it for the tools, not the hair extensions, but they turned out to be pretty cute.</li>
            <li> really pretty colors.</li>
            <li> Received exactly as seen.</li>
            <li> - i&#x27;d rather buy something like this at Hot Topic.</li>
            <li> I have not put them in yet but there very soft and really cool looking they got here very fast and</li>
            <li> Works great, looks cute, but the roots are a little thick and the beads are large and can be seen pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I am able to flat iron and curl them, every now</li>
            <li> Super excited to put them in my hair later this week!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of how cheap it was but took a chance and am sooo happy I did.</li>
            <li> This product is too easy all tools and hair come in the same order/package!!</li>
            <li> it is very simple to use and easy to put feathers in her hair and take them out.</li>
            <li> the pliers gets stuck and its hard but loved the feathers colors nd length</li>
            <li> they stay in so much longer than the ones that are put in at the hair salon for a much lower price.</li>
            <li> The whole thing came in a tan envelope; no packaging to speak of.</li>
            <li> A guide would&#x27;ve been appreciated, but we&#x27;ll figure it out.</li>
            <li> It was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Ended up giving it to my daughter since she has straight hair.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t pay an arm and a leg for them at a department store when you can get them so much cheaper here.</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I put them in and trimmed them to length and really like them.</li>
            <li> The feather is straight</li>
            <li> they were real feathers.</li>
            <li> everything included and came fast.</li>
            <li> Feathers were much thinner than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> Was not expecting hair, was thinking I was getting real feathers.  </li>
            <li> I expected that I was buying rooster feathers, but when I got them they were not feathers at all, but more like hair extensions</li>
            <li> so pretty there arrived early</li>
            <li> No need to look for the particular tools....</li>
            <li> highly recomended,get one for everybody</li>
            <li> My 10 years old daughter absolutely loves it .</li>
            <li> The tools weren&#x27;t cheap or faulty as I expected.</li>
            <li> The feather extensions weren&#x27;t cheap and ragged as I also expected.</li>
            <li> We will see how long they last, but this is better than paying $10 each at the salon.  </li>
            <li> You are able to wash your hair normally, and if you have curly hair like I do, after a few days the feathers will curl too...</li>
            <li> All the other tools that came with it are fine (pliers, hook, and beads)</li>
            <li> When you want to remove it you just use the pliers to pinch in the opposite direction and it comes right out.  </li>
            <li> I gave it to my daughter to play with and bought a new gift.</li>
            <li> And super long!</li>
            <li> definitely recommend it to anyone interested in new look for hair.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to put in and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Package contained exactly what was shown, except of course there are only 26 \\&quot;feathers\\&quot;..</li>
            <li> If you order this, be aware that you will get the pictured items only, all thrown together in one ziploc bag.</li>
            <li> These are exactly the same as the ones that are sold at Legoland California for $9.99 per extension.</li>
            <li> I even put one in my five year old sisters hair as well as mine and my friends!</li>
            <li> I knew from the actual description that you only get 26 of them, though at first look the picture is very decieving</li>
            <li> good kit, no directions have to figure it out yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took VERY long at least 3-4 weeks&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> Right now I have two of the aqua blue and one of the hot pink in my hair</li>
            <li> Package arrived 3 days before it was due to arrive so thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The feathers are a little cheap</li>
            <li> Shampoo does not agree with the hair and the colors are more dull than advertised.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter loves the set.</li>
            <li> We were surprised when we got these that they are NOT feathers at all, but plastic-like synthetic hair strands.</li>
            <li> 10 year old daughter loves this.  </li>
            <li> Leaves them soft and relaxed.</li>
            <li> Shipped directly from China, which I did not know.</li>
            <li> Have a two year old</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> The price was right and they came sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> the smaller feathers are quite nice, although some are so stiff they won&#x27;t lie flat with the hair ...</li>
            <li> They are simple and easy to do yourself if you want to add a little splash of color or attitude to your hair.</li>
            <li> They are much higher quality then expected.  </li>
            <li> These are really easy to put in hair and my daughter usually can wear it for several months before it falls out.</li>
            <li> I ordered these feather hair extensions to put a little fun in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Might be fun for little girls but not a teen or adult.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s only happened on one extension.</li>
            <li> My hair is super long as in, all the way down to my hip line</li>
            <li> Fun for adding a little color to your hair without actually coloring your hair.  </li>
            <li> These are a HUGE hit for the little girls (aged 7 &amp; 9) and all of their friends at a party!  </li>
            <li> You can wash your hair with them in but just be careful on messing with them too much because they get stringy and get to where they won&#x27;t lay flat.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a fun way to get a small shock of color in the hair.</li>
            <li> It does come with several long feather extensions, however it also comes with some funny feather earrings and jewelry that we are not interested.</li>
            <li> I usually insert one behind each ear and it will do a peek a boo effect and works out good for me.  </li>
            <li> On the blue the tip was very flimsy and bent in half.</li>
            <li> So far its stayed in a very active 7 year old hair.</li>
            <li> i mean for the price you cant beat it for gifts for little girls ( or even funky and fun adults like me)!!</li>
            <li> (TIP: Compress the bead so that the flat part of the bead is parallel with the scalp.</li>
            <li> just dont put the crimp bead too close to your scalp because it hurts and itchy and its pretty hard to move the bead or uncrimp it.  </li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s confusing to put in hair</li>
            <li> I would NOT suggest using a flat iron or curling iron on them as IM</li>
            <li> so they didn&#x27;t lay very flat to the head.</li>
            <li> They are long enough for women with long hair and the ones with shorter hair can cut them.</li>
            <li> and it is super frustrating.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I had a problem with was my hair, I have very long hair and the feathers were not as long.  </li>
            <li> but you are really getting a very small portion of what is pictured (only 2 of each color).</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re not adult quality.</li>
            <li> The crimpers were very heavy and high quality.</li>
            <li> Total length is roughly 17 inches.</li>
            <li> but they stay in long.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the quality due to the low price.  </li>
            <li> May not purchase again, due to this being only a starter type of kit, due to the tools and only 26 fibers.</li>
            <li> From other raters they say to use on low heat.</li>
            <li> At least we paid $3.99 instead of the new asking price of $8.08!</li>
            <li> I REUSE MINE , WASH IT, BLOW DRY IT, AND ECT...:</li>
            <li> so I have kept the temp down to about 275ish 300 and have not had that same problem again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a little grip inside the beads that make these long lasting.</li>
            <li> I expected what I saw in the picture.</li>
            <li> but I have to be careful when I comb my hair because I&#x27;ve already had two slip out</li>
            <li> not real feathers or hair?</li>
            <li> It got to my house faster than I expected.  </li>
            <li> cuz u have to hold it closed with ur finger,so my hair often gets caught midway thru the bead.</li>
            <li> Takes only a few mins to install which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Not much to it.</li>
            <li> and then they get a little knarled on the ends but the flat iron takes care of that.</li>
            <li> Very thick too not subtle at all.</li>
            <li> These are not real feathers as other reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> These hair &#x27;feathers&#x27; are not good quality, but at such a low price I should have guessed.</li>
            <li> Love having these since i cant dye my hair with my job, only complaint is they are impossible to do by your self.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> But I still expected quality someone would put on their head!</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> it way past when I needed it for my daughters birthday present.</li>
            <li> other</li>
            <li> The little tool used for pulling your hair through the beads was cheaper looking than I expected but it does the job.</li>
            <li> For my 5 year old daughter they are fun enough, the ends gets knarled and nasty</li>
            <li> I am not sure why it took so long</li>
            <li> Not worth keeping.</li>
            <li> and we asked how much they cost she was putting one feather on the hair for 5 dollars that was really expensive</li>
            <li> We received the feather hair extension kit well before the expected date that the site had promised, but it was missing the 100 beads to put the Feather extensions in the hair.</li>
            <li> but I had it down after one go</li>
            <li> but I would suggest turning your straighter down to a lower setting before passing over this.</li>
            <li> (Small enough to go through the bead and allow room for the extension, but not too small that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> And I got like 20 beads all except but black my hair color</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have all day to mess with hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the little clip thing that comes with it to pull ur hair thru the bead is alil hard to keep closed</li>
            <li> Not worth the price or shipping!</li>
            <li> Like my little pony hair.</li>
            <li> You just have to put a little effort into caring for them</li>
            <li> me and my little sisters had a blast with these, i would tell and parent to get these</li>
            <li> i got them for my little cousins for birthday gifts</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair don&#x27;t bother buying this as you will be stuck with straight colored stips sticking out from curly hair, basically left looking stupid.</li>
            <li> extra thin &amp;#34;row&amp;#34; of hair over</li>
            <li> I have had them in my hair for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> im missing.</li>
            <li> My little sister loves this!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how you would use the hook given in the kit.</li>
            <li> these are not actually feathers, it is fake hair</li>
            <li> Although they aren&#x27;t actually feathers (which is what I wanted ) they are fake hair with lines though it</li>
            <li> Grab on small section of hair.</li>
            <li> OMG i use these almost everyday!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed to see that they aren&#x27;t really feathers.</li>
            <li> afraid to flat iron; not sure they won&#x27;t melt.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting it through the bead.</li>
            <li> The extension was really thick</li>
            <li> .. Just a word of warning, look closer at the pictures and youll see what I mean..</li>
            <li> My only complaints were that it pulled my hair out when it came out (like, bad)</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that these weren&#x27;t really feathers, they are like a colored fake hair extension.</li>
            <li> Not happy about this.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s false advertising to call these pieces feathers.</li>
            <li> This posting is false advertising as it states they are feather hair extensions.</li>
            <li> at least 3 months!!</li>
            <li> They looked really fake.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> and it made the hair give off a weird smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dyed, fake hair.</li>
            <li> Im sorry</li>
            <li> thought the bead, insert fake hair, and tighten with the pliers.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter loves the set. they stay in so much longer than the ones that are put in at the hair salon for a much lower price.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that these weren&#x27;t really feathers, they are like a colored fake hair extension. The tools that came with it are worth it.</li>
            <li> They are fun but I think it&#x27;s false advertising to call these pieces feathers. They are more like synthetic colored hair extentions. They don&#x27;t even look feathery. And if you need to trim them up, the ends don&#x27;t look nice.</li>
            <li> Great price for the tools and beads. The hair pieces are kinda cheap, but I liked them.</li>
            <li> Great Product Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Works great, looks cute, but the roots are a little thick and the beads are large and can be seen pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a chea</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be. My nieces love them in their heads.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved it</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy these again, and probably will soon. the beads go quick, so make sure you order extra in your color, Mine came without, but they sent them when i notified them.... you will want to order more anyway.</li>
            <li> Very pretty feathers, quality tools and fast shipping. Bought for my daughter  for Christmas and can&#x27;t wait for her to see and use them. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in what I received. There are no instructions and I didn&#x27;t receive 26 extentions.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. Will be returning for a refund.</li>
            <li> This product is too easy all tools and hair come in the same order/package!! No need to look for the particular tools.... Very easy taught my nieces who are 5,8 and 13 how to use and they love it!</li>
            <li> Just received my kit. I only received 50 beads. Not happy about this. My kit came with curved tipped needle nose pliers.</li>
            <li> i did read and was aware this was synthetic hair. But I still expected quality someone would put on their head! This is barbie hair! Do you remember trying to brush barbie hair?!?! this arrived snarled and static and all mixed together in the package. they are hideous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to have the beads and pliers, but I will NOT use these \\&quot;FEATHERS&#x27;. ew</li>
            <li> These were only OK. The extension was really thick so they didn&#x27;t lay very flat to the head. I used them on kids, so it was finr. But they&#x27;re not adult quality.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughters&#x27; 9th birthday party, we put them in all the girls hair and they loved it! I will definitely order more!!</li>
            <li> I just put them in tonight.  This kit does not come with instructions so I just looked on You Tube.  They were easy to put in.  The kids loved them.  We will see how long they last, but this is better than paying $10 each at the salon.  I wish we would have received an even amount of each color.  Some colors we didn&#x27;t get at all and we got a lot of brown,  which wasn&#x27;t popular with the girls.  But for what I paid, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> We were surprised when we got these that they are NOT feathers at all, but plastic-like synthetic hair strands. I knew from the actual description that you only get 26 of them, though at first look the picture is very decieving, it looks like you are getting a ton but you are really getting a very small portion of what is pictured (only 2 of each color). For my 5 year old daughter they are fun enough, the ends gets knarled and nasty so they need to be trimmed a bit now and then to keep it looking ok. I would NOT suggest using a flat iron or curling iron on them as IM SURE they would melt right into your hair and be a disaster.</li>
            <li> They r great quality for the price. I plan on purchasing them for my nieces as well.  My daughters love them!</li>
            <li> The feathers look great... They are long enough for women with long hair and the ones with shorter hair can cut them. You are able to wash your hair normally, and if you have curly hair like I do, after a few days the feathers will curl too...</li>
            <li> They looked really fake. I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I expected what I saw in the picture. Still great quantity for the price I paid. My daughter and her friends love changing out the colors.</li>
            <li> bundled nylon fibers, colored and striped like feathers.  afraid to flat iron; not sure they won&#x27;t melt.  i like the rings and the hook.  the smaller feathers are quite nice, although some are so stiff they won&#x27;t lie flat with the hair ... they feel like plastic drinking straws.  i&#x27;d look elsewhere ...</li>
            <li> You receive two alike colors through out the entire set. It is easy to use and they have stayed in for many days. The only one that fell out was because my son ripped it out when he was pulling my hair.. And that hurt very bad because he pulled my hair out with it. The little tool used for pulling your hair through the beads was cheaper looking than I expected but it does the job. You can reuse the beads if one falls out before it cracks and everything.. I reused a bead twice one the one my son pulled out and it works just the same. They are easy to remove and re-position. It does take practice but I had it down after one go so I can promise so will you. Right now I have two of the aqua blue and one of the hot pink in my hair and I love how it looks. Now as for being able to style it.. It has not melted yet or anything but I would suggest turning your straighter down to a lower setting before passing over this. I had mine on about 400 degrees and it made the hair give off a weird smell. More chemical than anything so I have kept the temp down to about 275ish 300 and have not had that same problem again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. It doesnt come with any directions, however its super easy to use! If you want to know how to use it you can just look it up on youtube! Great for any age!</li>
            <li> The only thing that I had a problem with was my hair, I have very long hair and the feathers were not as long.  Other then that they are great.</li>
            <li> Thought it was feather material. It&#x27;s dyed, fake hair.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed by these feathers! my local beauty market was trying to sell just the micro beads for 15 dollars! this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Easy to use and looks great, my daughters love it and they stay in for a decent amount of time. I was skeptical because of how cheap it was but took a chance and am sooo happy I did. I even bought another set for a birthday gift for a friends daughter and will buy more i&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Just received my package and everything was in great condition.  The hair was perfect and nicely packaged.  Everything else was a bonus!!  The price couldn&#x27;t have been better.  I order the hair extensions all the time and I think these where about an inch longer than I expected which is a great thing because it gives you room to cut and style them into hair.  The length was a very pleasant surprise.  Great JOB! : )</li>
            <li> easy to use and they stayed put for over a week!!!!</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. The feathers are more frayed ribbons than hair but I was expecting actual feathers. The tools are great but they only send you about 25 extension clips.</li>
            <li> Great! Super easy to apply to my hair but I have to be careful when I comb my hair because I&#x27;ve already had two slip out and I had to reattach them.</li>
            <li> Most were not staying in and tangled easily.</li>
            <li> Love it. 2 of the same colors and the colors are bright and beautiful. The tools aren&#x27;t the prettiest but I love it. I felt Like I got my moneies worth.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift and had it sent to me for wrapping. It it just thrown together in a ziploc bag, with some basic instructions. The whole thing came in a tan envelope; no packaging to speak of. Obviously something someone has thrown together from craft store supplies. Not worth the price or shipping! I gave it to my daughter to play with and bought a new gift.</li>
            <li> Package contained exactly what was shown, except of course there are only 26 \\&quot;feathers\\&quot;..about 2 of each color.  They aren&#x27;t feather though, more like hair, but either way my 11 year old daughter was happy with what she picked out.  Package arrived 3 days before it was due to arrive so thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This was an amazing price for very high quality product. We are planning on buying from Wadoy again. The crimpers were very heavy and high quality. We don&#x27;t use the hook supplied because we have a loop type hook from another kit we like better. I am not sure how you would use the hook given in the kit. The feathers and beads were fine quality also.</li>
            <li> I love it , this is very good!!! It came with a plier and I love it!!!!! I&#x27;ll buy again after I finish using all these</li>
            <li> My little sister loves this! However, we&#x27;re still trying to figure out just how to do this? A guide would&#x27;ve been appreciated, but we&#x27;ll figure it out. Good quality on all the items though.</li>
            <li> I ordered these feather hair extensions to put a little fun in my hair.  They arrived quickly. I was worried about the quality due to the low price.  They are much higher quality then expected.  I can&#x27;t wait to put them in.</li>
            <li> I just got them today and I love them. the color is very bright and long also very soft. they came like a 2 weeks early witch is great.  I will be buying them again. I learned how to put them in one youtube very easy with the tools it comes with. this is a great deal. I love it :)</li>
            <li> These hair &#x27;feathers&#x27; are not good quality, but at such a low price I should have guessed. They worked fine for my daughter</li>
            <li> Love having these since i cant dye my hair with my job, only complaint is they are impossible to do by your self.&lt;br /&gt;Also dont leave in for more than a week or i have to cut my hair to get them out cause of tangling when showering and styling.</li>
            <li> So this is NOT freaken feathers these are HAIR EXTRNSIONS I am going to return them cause I got 3 colors of feathers and there was only 10 feathers the 8 beads so DO NOT BUY!!!!  AND I paid 15.99 thats bunk</li>
            <li> My daughter loves &#x27;em!, just need to learn how to put them in with out the beads since they show easily</li>
            <li> Really loved the feathers and how easy to install they were. I used a youtube video to make sure I was doing it right since this pack came with no instructions. One thing to note is that you do not get all the feathers shown in the picture. You don&#x27;t get that quantity or variety of colors. I&#x27;m still giving 4 stars because I loved the ones I used, I kept them in for 1.5 months with no problems and they curled nicely too. It is a shame that you don&#x27;t get whats in the picture because I was looking forward to having lilac ones. I actually got 7 colors with only 2 in each color.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughters.  The price was right and they came sooner than expected.  Was very easy to put in,  no directions came with it but we watched a utube video to see proper way to do it correctly.  My kids love them!</li>
            <li> Glad I got all the tools with the kit, and also it came in like 3-4 weeks early than stated when I purchased it</li>
            <li> It was better than I expected. I just put it in and its awesome. I highly recommended it for anyone!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter luved the kit she was able to do it herself as well very easy. I liked the colors also good kit.</li>
            <li> These are amazing. I am buying more . Love doing these with friends, cousins and my Sis. They give you more beads then feathers . You can reuse the feathers. Easy to put in your hair.</li>
            <li> I love wearing these in my hair, their easy to put in and take out. I will be wearing them a lot this summer</li>
            <li> I liked it&lt;br /&gt;And worth the price it came with everything you would need  to put them in and a lot of colors</li>
            <li> i cant wear them quite yet because of my job, but i cant wait to put them in at the end of the month!!! the only thing i dont like is how they are seperate strands like hair....</li>
            <li> these are not actually feathers, it is fake hair</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product and so do I it is very simple to use and easy to put feathers in her hair and take them out.</li>
            <li> It came with a lot more than anticipated, but it took a month to get to me. I am not sure why it took so long but this is the longest it has taken for anything to get to me.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the product now that I finally received it.</li>
            <li> its okay also the price is very low</li>
            <li> the pliers gets stuck and its hard but loved the feathers colors nd length .. loved the diff color eads</li>
            <li> Although they aren&#x27;t actually feathers (which is what I wanted ) they are fake hair with lines though it but they still look cool and I like the colors and length</li>
            <li> Great for a girls slumber party!</li>
            <li> FIY they aren&#x27;t actual feathers or featherlike, it&#x27;s more like dyed hair extensions.. I&#x27;m not going to be picky, I guess it will do.. All the other tools that came with it are fine (pliers, hook, and beads) But I was expecting more FEATHER LIKE feather hair extensions... Oh Well.. Just a word of warning, look closer at the pictures and youll see what I mean..</li>
            <li> Very easy to use!  Very nice variety of colors!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, timing,  and service!  Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Easy to use stay in forever till u take them out can&#x27;t wait to order them tinsel ones so cool :)</li>
            <li> Not bad, gets tangled easy...</li>
            <li> Im sorry but these looked so cheap. Like my little pony hair. Very thick too not subtle at all. Might be fun for little girls but not a teen or adult.</li>
            <li> I love the colors they are bright and very pretty ! They came lots faster than what was told ! Everything that was pictured was with the the hair extensions ! Super excited to put them in my hair later this week!</li>
            <li> Extensions tangle easily and break off. Shampoo does not agree with the hair and the colors are more dull than advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a fun kit. I like that it also includes the pliers. For the price that really makes me happy! I like to keep the kit together and don&#x27;t want to search through my tool box for a pair of pliers. (First world problems I know!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any way the pliers, beads, and hook were all perfect. My only concern was with the tip of the extensions. So far it&#x27;s only happened on one extension. I&#x27;ve used three as of writing this review. On the blue the tip was very flimsy and bent in half. I had a hard time getting it through the bead. I got it in but it was challenge that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a little grip inside the beads that make these long lasting. I have these in a toddlers hair and they aren&#x27;t falling out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you new to these extensions here&#x27;s so easy directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Part your hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. Part one extra thin &amp;#34;row&amp;#34; of hair over so the extension is under a layer of hair. (TIP: This hides the bead)&lt;br /&gt;3. Put one bead on the hook.&lt;br /&gt;4. Grab on small section of hair. (Small enough to go through the bead and allow room for the extension, but not too small that&#x27;s there&#x27;s nothing for the bead to hold on to)&lt;br /&gt;5. Open the clasp on the end of the hook.&lt;br /&gt;6. Place the clasp around the root of the selected hair and close the clasp.&lt;br /&gt;7. Pull the hair through the bead, removing the hook and leaving the bead.&lt;br /&gt;8. Push the end of the extension through the bead. (Along with the hair, don&#x27;t let the hair fall out)&lt;br /&gt;9. Use the pliers to compress the bead. (TIP: Compress the bead so that the flat part of the bead is parallel with the scalp. Don&#x27;t compress it so that it is sticking up or it will stick out of your hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to put the extensions about an inch away from the scalp but you can put it where ever you want. Please leave me a comment if you have questions. I&#x27;m happy to help.</li>
            <li> I have had them in my hair for a few weeks. No fading when I wash my hair. They are great and I love the colors!</li>
            <li> Works great. As described. Daughter loves them!</li>
            <li> Love the feathers. The tools and beads were not included!</li>
            <li> The guality is terrible. :(</li>
            <li> Bought them to exchange out my own feathers but having so many extras I plan to continue giving them to my Lil cancer patients as well as my niece &amp; keep some for me. One had chemo as well as radiation therapy so gave her 4 for later and taught her mom  how to put them in. I also have another Lil girl whom finishes this week and will put in however many  feathers she would like and probably give her a couple to to change them out. Very impressive with the feathers. Thanks</li>
            <li> 10 year old daughter loves this.  we often give these as party gifts to her friends.  for $7 it is an excellent deal.</li>
            <li> This would be ok for straight hair but it states that it can be curled for curly hair but it will not curl at all! I tried different heat settings and even different curling irons. Ended up giving it to my daughter since she has straight hair. If you have curly hair don&#x27;t bother buying this as you will be stuck with straight colored stips sticking out from curly hair, basically left looking stupid.</li>
            <li> My 14-year-old grand-daughter wears these in her hair and just loves them. But don&#x27;t pay an arm and a leg for them at a department store when you can get them so much cheaper here.</li>
            <li> I liked this product because the price is reasonable and the quality is decent .&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it because it falls out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a very similar product and it worked much better then this product did</li>
            <li> A huge hit at my 9 year old&#x27;s birthday party. Some of them stayed in for a month.</li>
            <li> Great product! Awesome Price!</li>
            <li> It shipped immediately and the product is great quality.  I got my money&#x27;s worth.  I am very happy with everything!</li>
            <li> I realized when I ordered this kit that they were not actual feathers, which I was happy with. I received 2 of each color shown, I put them in and trimmed them to length and really like them. I am able to flat iron and curl them, every now and then they get a little knarled on the ends but the flat iron takes care of that. My iron gets to 410 degrees if I run it through quickly it works great. Leaves them soft and relaxed. You just have to put a little effort into caring for them so they look nice. I got these because I wanted an inexpensive alternate to actual feathers. Plus you can change the color when ever you like. I would say a success</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money, it was horrible and I just threw it away</li>
            <li> My first review of this product wasn&#x27;t very good, but I made a mistake. There actually was 26 total in package. Thank you for that. Although I would also like to let everyone know these are NOT feathers. Just synthetic colored hair.</li>
            <li> i got this about fifteen days after i ordered it is amazing except the hook part fell apart after i used like 5 to 6 times and now i can&#x27;t put the feathers in my hair</li>
            <li> my daughers love that I have a way to safely put feathers in their hair and remove them without it hurting and it&#x27;s cool to wear inschool.  I will be ordering more extensions in the future.  I love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> They are beautiful, I love the colors, and the naturalness of the extensions, definitely would buy more, thank you so much</li>
            <li> You are able to put them in your hair very easy and then reuse them when you want them out that&#x27;s really cool and good use of it.... I REUSE MINE , WASH IT, BLOW DRY IT, AND ECT...:):)</li>
            <li> I love these so much. But my hook broke and the ends of the feathers by my head were shoe string like. Too big.</li>
            <li> Great item to have if you love adding a little fun to your hair. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Never got the feathers.</li>
            <li> not real feathers or hair? how am I supposed to use my irons?</li>
            <li> The package was great.  It got to my house faster than I expected.  Tools were easy to use and I just found a tutorial online.  I still have several extensions in my hair now.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> very good product and am very happy with it. it comes with a variety of beads and and feathers so you have options avalible and it comes with all the tools you need!</li>
            <li> This is more hair then a feather, I have no idea why these are called feathers....but I love them!!!! My daughter also loves them. They are so easy to put in and they last a long time. I seen review about being scared to curl well you can straighten them I do know, I don&#x27;t know about curling. I always straighten my hair even the feather. The feather is straight you wouldn&#x27;t have to I just do. But this is a great deal I think! People always saying they love it!</li>
            <li> was worth what i paid, love them and daughters love them easy to use and came before expected way before. will use again</li>
            <li> The seller is very nice, answered all my answer before I bought the item.&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived on time and in a very good condition.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in new look for hair. It looks great and is very affordable price.</li>
            <li> OMG i use these almost everyday! the beads and kit works great and the feathers are very durable i actually reuse them alot!! Love this product it was so cheap to buy and soooo worth it!!</li>
            <li> I just loved these feathers there SINTHETIC. For sure but great and soft, and amazing quality,  So my point is the tools are great And the feather are to omg I just love these,.... So order them for sure!!</li>
            <li> My 10 years old daughter absolutely loves it . Very well priced  item, easy to use even for 10 years olds  , great quality.</li>
            <li> every thing was in my order, so it was perfect. Keep doing a great job&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much for your help.</li>
            <li> I really liked these feathers. They stayed in great and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about going to a salon and paying 10 dollars for one feather.</li>
            <li> I have not put them in yet but there very soft and really cool looking they got here very fast and a big plus is they in included tools</li>
            <li> These are not real feathers as other reviewers stated. They look and feel terrible. My husband purchased thinking they were real feathers. At least we paid $3.99 instead of the new asking price of $8.08! Not worth keeping. Very disappointed! This posting is false advertising as it states they are feather hair extensions. These are feather-looking hair extensions made from hair! Revise your posting title to reflect the true nature of this item.</li>
            <li> Exactly as listed...initial package didn&#x27;t have the hook, pliers, or the beads but contacted the seller and it was sent out right away...it does take a while for shipping to the US but if your not in a hurry then this is exactly what your looking for! :)</li>
            <li> very happy with this product - you get a lot for very little and they look great in your hair and very easy to put in with the tools!</li>
            <li> Well, the kit came without the hair threading tool, which is a really important part. The extension is very low quality synthetic hair (like Barbie doll hair) dyed to look like feather extensions. Won&#x27;t buy again or suggest it, but the customer service was nice and refundedme right away.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t judge this product by the picture listed. The picture must be 3 or 4 of the kits put together because it is not nearly as lush as your own kit.</li>
            <li> We received the feather hair extension kit well before the expected date that the site had promised, but it was missing the 100 beads to put the Feather extensions in the hair.</li>
            <li> Used this kit at a town fair to earn money 4 a good cause..had a very good turn out..little girls love them!!</li>
            <li> they all ways would get tangled together and never come apart and they suck I think people have their own opinions</li>
            <li> Not quite what I was expecting. Sooo I will use these on my niece she is only 3 so she won&#x27;t know the difference!</li>
            <li> Bought these for a girls sleepover and the girls loved them. Package came with everything to put them in their hair. Very easy to use and variety of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> Do not expect the quantity of feathers that you see in the picture. It does come with several long feather extensions, however it also comes with some funny feather earrings and jewelry that we are not interested. Shipped directly from China, which I did not know.</li>
            <li> Came with everything we need, I havent yet used them because its a christmas present but looks great so far esp for the price can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> awesome. my daughter loved them. everything was perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the pliers that came with it were used.</li>
            <li> These took awhile to get to me. But for the price they worked perfect.</li>
            <li> These feathers were so awesome. They came nicely packaged with everything in it. They are so fun to wear and look wonderful. These are so easy to put in because of all the great easy to use tools in the package. It came with enough beads which was good. They&#x27;re were 26 feathers in a variety of colors and I was sooo pleased with the price. I&#x27;ve gotten feathers before but they weren&#x27;t synthetic and they were more costly. I have not been brave enough to try  synthetic feathers but i had a great first expierience. I reccomend this for everyone</li>
            <li> I love this hair kit i got all my stuff on time and every thing was there very pretty in your hair i would reccomend</li>
            <li> they rock,tons of compliments and super cute,great product.Way cheaper than going to a salon to have them put in.I will order these again.</li>
            <li> Feather Hair Extension did not fix with any hair with bead. This kit did not work. They need to make extension smaller or bead bigger.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because i was looking for something to add alittle color to my hair without it having to be permanent. Their real cute and u have 2 of each color shown to choose from. I even shared them with my friends. My only complaint is the little clip thing that comes with it to pull ur hair thru the bead is alil hard to keep closed cuz u have to hold it closed with ur finger,so my hair often gets caught midway thru the bead. Other than that im happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> i personally love this item. It isnt just for kids its great for anyone and any age. i used it for my birthday andd everyone loved it. they last forever!! at least 3 months!! I suggest you get it if u are unsure.</li>
            <li> I was not sent the correct amount of feathers. It is advertised that you will be sent 26 feathers where I was only sent 19!</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with my product. The tools weren&#x27;t cheap or faulty as I expected. The feather extensions weren&#x27;t cheap and ragged as I also expected. May not purchase again, due to this being only a starter type of kit, due to the tools and only 26 fibers. I am pleased. :)</li>
            <li> This Item Was So Easy To Use , Easy Like 1,2,3 And I loved all the colors ! Just a really Great item . And Yes . I RECOMEND , !</li>
            <li> me and my little sisters had a blast with these, i would tell and parent to get these</li>
            <li> Love this set...everything included and came fast.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughters and I. It is very easy to use. I haven&#x27;t tried to use a curling iron or straightener so I hope it doesn&#x27;t melt. From other raters they say to use on low heat. So far its stayed in a very active 7 year old hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaints were that it pulled my hair out when it came out (like, bad) and I looked like a joke when trying to put my hair in pony tails. It also came with a lot of dull, boring colors but I got so many that It looked great with just the bright ones in. Get someone to help you put them in. I got a lot of compliments!</li>
            <li> Very cute and easy to use! Using them for the grand opening of our salon and as an add on for the summertime!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very durable.  I&#x27;ve had mine in a month now. You can wash and curl them. Plus they get lots of compliments! Definitely worth buying and the price.</li>
            <li> good kit, no directions have to figure it out yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took VERY long at least 3-4 weeks&lt;br /&gt;Got it way past when I needed it for my daughters birthday present.</li>
            <li> Feels like real hair, easy to put into hair and a variety of bright colors.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my niece, who had put this item on a wish list. Everything arrived on time which was great, but I was surprised to see that there were no instructions whatsoever. If you order this, be aware that you will get the pictured items only, all thrown together in one ziploc bag. That is it, so I hope you know what to do with it!</li>
            <li> it came on time it nice n pretty it works perfectly and i really like the colors on it great</li>
            <li> Everything I need for hair streaks. Great deal.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t great quality and sometimes tricky to get to stay in but they are a fun way to change your look once in a while. You can wash your hair with them in but just be careful on messing with them too much because they get stringy and get to where they won&#x27;t lay flat.</li>
            <li> What a great value! These are really easy to put in hair and my daughter usually can wear it for several months before it falls out. They&#x27;re a fun way to get a small shock of color in the hair.</li>
            <li> this is the best deal eva!! highly recomended,get one for everybody</li>
            <li> The synthetic feathers are obviously synthetic. I have attempted to put some feathers in my hair twice now with no luck and it is super frustrating. Hopefully, one of these days I will succeed.</li>
            <li> these are so fun and kids and adults!  i got them for my little cousins for birthday gifts and i even got a set for me! i love the colors and they are easy to use!  just dont put the crimp bead too close to your scalp because it hurts and itchy and its pretty hard to move the bead or uncrimp it.  i mean for the price you cant beat it for gifts for little girls ( or even funky and fun adults like me)!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 12 year-old daughter loved the colors and length of the feathers, very easy to use!! It was my first time trying the beads and did it under 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> This kit is great for the money. I actually just bought it for the tools, not the hair extensions, but they turned out to be pretty cute. And super long! Which is great because my hair is really long too, so the shorter feathers usually turn out looking a bit weird. All in all a great deal for your money.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed to see that they aren&#x27;t really feathers. It&#x27;s not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> really pretty colors. Quality synthetic feathers</li>
            <li> Great product. My daughter is loving to learn how to put them in people hair.</li>
            <li> great kit, I got mostly white feathers, but still enough blue and purple for my party</li>
            <li> Received exactly as seen.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money for kit with tools!  I braided mine and loved them because the reminded me of the Bahamas!</li>
            <li> i love them they are so fun</li>
            <li> Just received it. Feathers were much thinner than I thought they would be. But hopefully they will work just fine for my daughter to wear in her hair.... trying them out tomorrow</li>
            <li> Was not expecting hair, was thinking I was getting real feathers.  However, this works out great and I can reuse them and with 100 beads you will get several uses.  Have a two year old so I don&#x27;t have all day to mess with hair. Takes only a few mins to install which is a plus. You just put the bead over the hook, grab hair with hook and pull it thought the bead, insert fake hair, and tighten with the pliers. Not much to it. When you want to remove it you just use the pliers to pinch in the opposite direction and it comes right out.  No hair damage. They are a good length too.  My hair is super long as in, all the way down to my hip line and I am 5&#x27;11.  I usually insert one behind each ear and it will do a peek a boo effect and works out good for me.  Total length is roughly 17 inches.</li>
            <li> Most of the salons are charging a fortune for these. They are simple and easy to do yourself if you want to add a little splash of color or attitude to your hair.</li>
            <li> the beads dont come out i have to put them out and the hook came broke and i think there is only about 25 beads</li>
            <li> Fun for adding a little color to your hair without actually coloring your hair.  My girls love the colors that came.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter. At first it&#x27;s confusing to put in hair but once you get it it&#x27;s really easy. She absolutely loved them! I even put some in my hair. The feathers are a little cheap but they stay in long. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Everything is there, everything works, great price. What else could you ask for? Great buy for any age! And beginners.</li>
            <li> I expected that I was buying rooster feathers, but when I got them they were not feathers at all, but more like hair extensions - i&#x27;d rather buy something like this at Hot Topic.</li>
            <li> Literally. Just got. And I got like 20 beads all except but black my hair color so if i could get the amount im missing. Ill fix my review other then that i love it</li>
            <li> The feathers were in great shape, the clamp looked used and was  opened but otherwise great product</li>
            <li> These are a HUGE hit for the little girls (aged 7 &amp; 9) and all of their friends at a party!  Great quality.  They lasted for 3-4 weeks before I had to take them out.  These are exactly the same as the ones that are sold at Legoland California for $9.99 per extension.</li>
            <li> Only two extensions per color and never got any micro beads.</li>
            <li> i loved them there so pretty there arrived early thats why i loved the feathers i put some on my daughter and she liked them alot she actually invited some friends over so they could get some to i saw this lady she putting on some feathers to kids and we asked how much they cost she was putting one feather on the hair for 5 dollars that was really expensive but i am happy about this feathers i really recommend buying them :]</li>
            <li> These are not feathers. They are a hair like product.</li>
            <li> Awesome way cheaper then my niece going to the salon for these monthly! She loves them</li>
            <li> My sister wanted feather extensions put in her hair,so I ordered these so I could do her hair.They came faster than I thought they actually would and I got more variety. There were even multicolored feathers! I did my sisters hair and she loved it.I even put one in my five year old sisters hair as well as mine and my friends! I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend this for someone who wants to do feathers as well.</li>
            <li> These are horrible! look like cheap synthetic hair not a feather</li>
            <li> These extensions are super awesome and so easy to use, i love them and would recommend anyone to get them</li>
