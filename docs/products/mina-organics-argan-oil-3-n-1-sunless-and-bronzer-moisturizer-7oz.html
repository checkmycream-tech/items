            <li>A wonderful product!</li>
            <li>The best news is this doesnt break me out</li>
            <li>This smells great!</li>
            <li>smells awesome!  and doesn&#x27;t create that sunless tan smell afterward.  </li>
            <li>I have great luck with Banana Boat &amp;#34;deep dark&amp;#34; sunless tan for my body.</li>
            <li>THEY REPLACED MY PRODUCT FREE OF CHARGE!!!</li>
            <li>Feels great, smells nice!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant-- not chemical smelling-- and</li>
            <li>I would for sure recommend this product to any of my friends, family, and coworkers!</li>
            <li>That said, I like the dispenser and it does a nice job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>it smells nice and it moisturizes your skin.</li>
            <li>This product is by far the best sunless/bronzer product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best one I have used.</li>
            <li>I love this product it gives you a nice summer glow..</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a sunless tanner that is both moisturizing and is looking for a natural but bronzed skin tone.</li>
            <li>so I am strong believer in sunless tanning!</li>
            <li>It has a light , nice scent</li>
            <li>really love the fact that it has no parabens, mineral oil or petroleum products.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>I have tried to unscrew the top portion with no avail.  </li>
            <li>This product has many ingredients.</li>
            <li>Most times its something from target.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely (reminds me of a pina colada!) and gives a nice, light bronze tone right away.  </li>
            <li>This provides a surprising amount of color on the first application.</li>
            <li>This bronzer really smells good</li>
            <li>If I am willing to splurge I will go to Macys, but I finally found a product that has a great price &amp; gets the job done!</li>
            <li>I have light olive toned skin and it doesn&#x27;t turn orange at all.</li>
            <li>and I have a light tan, not an orange tint.</li>
            <li>but I think this one is worth my time for everyone!</li>
            <li>- it doesn&#x27;t have that tell-tale smell of most self-tanning sprays/lotions, and it really doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily at all.</li>
            <li>I ended up throwing it away even though it was full of cream.</li>
            <li>This is a nice lotion but the tanning was very light and did not see much change with daily use.  </li>
            <li>I usually do not write too many reviews on products</li>
            <li>I wanted a more natural sunless tanner for my face and that is what I got!</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say that a fair-skinned person could use this once weekly for a nice bit of color.</li>
            <li>The dispenser broker right away</li>
            <li>I am a very very fair-skinned person, and try to stay out of the sun.</li>
            <li>They are aware that some pumps stop working.</li>
            <li>This sunless tanner not only creates a smooth &amp; even tan/glow all over your body/face but also moisturizers your skin!</li>
            <li>The bronzer in it makes it easy to ascertain that you&#x27;ve applied it evenly right away , not have to wait several hours to discover you</li>
            <li>Honestly, I use this product about every other day to help enrich the spray on tan.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the smell of the lotion</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>The gradual sunless tanner works really well and is not streaky at all.</li>
            <li>Mix the two components very well before applying</li>
            <li>My other favorite aspect of this product is that when you are putting it on you can see the tinted color which helps know where you need to spread the lotion.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty light, nothing compared to other self tanners.</li>
            <li>I actually liked this product for the few days that the dispenser worked!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a slight tint to the lotion, making it pretty easy to see where you&#x27;re putting it.</li>
            <li>will not make you really dark, but just the right amount for really fair people to look healthy without looking fake.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made with natural oils because my skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li>VERY NATURAL LOOKING</li>
            <li>The self tanner streaks a bit, and doesn&#x27;t completely cover all areas even after exfoliating.</li>
            <li>and it looks soooooo natural.</li>
            <li>The texture is not sticky, this feels like a soft lotion.</li>
            <li>This product is super moisturizing, especially when my skin is so dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>The other positive of this is that you can use it on both your face and your body and often times, I have found that sunless tanners cause my face to get blemishes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really not done much in the way of giving my face color.  </li>
            <li>I love the product &amp; the company that stands behind their product.</li>
            <li>the upside is that there were no streaks or spots as it had only a subtle tanning effect and went on smoothly.</li>

            <li> This is yummy smelling and used it on my face, which usually breaks out to new things, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I thought it would gradually give my skin the look of slight tanning, but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable even right after it&#x27;s applied.  </li>

            <li> I only apply to my face due to the cost.</li>
            <li> I would give this two thumbs up and same review as the lotion that I purchased, but this seems to show color faster than the other.</li>
            <li> You need to watch putting too much on in a short period of time or the color can be a little undesirable.</li>
            <li> I would suggest a heavy exfoliation prior to application.</li>

            <li> which is one of the things I have struggled with before with other sunless tanners.</li>
            <li> I did compare the 2 this week, and this one does show or tan you faster than the other.</li>
            <li> The color is very minimal.</li>
            <li> It does do a good job moisterizing, and does not have a horrible scent.</li>
            <li> So I feel like I wasted money on this product.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt waste my money on this..keep looking..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave negative reviews</li>
            <li> gives a subtle glow to your skin.  </li>
            <li> but this was very irritating.  </li>
            <li> For those of you looking for an organic product, you will be disgusted and disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I hate putting on sunless tanners because they smell terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Honestly, I use this product about every other day to help enrich the spray on tan.  Beside moisturizing it protects the tan from fading.</li>
            <li> I am a very very fair-skinned person, and try to stay out of the sun. I do, however, like a bit of color! This provides a surprising amount of color on the first application. I would suggest a heavy exfoliation prior to application. There&#x27;s a slight tint to the lotion, making it pretty easy to see where you&#x27;re putting it. I also really like the smell of the lotion - it doesn&#x27;t have that tell-tale smell of most self-tanning sprays/lotions, and it really doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily at all. Overall, I would say that a fair-skinned person could use this once weekly for a nice bit of color. The color layers well, too!</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best sunless/bronzer product I have ever used. I gave up on getting a natural tan due to it&#x27;s harmful effects so switched to products like this about 15 yrs ago. I have tried several brands. This one is by far the best one I have used. I receive a lot of compliments on my \\&quot;tan\\&quot;!! UPDATE...I CONTACTED THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THIS PRODUCT. THEY REPLACED MY PRODUCT FREE OF CHARGE!!! I love the product &amp; the company that stands behind their product. They are aware that some pumps stop working.Their customer service is one of the best  I&#x27;ve dealt with. I have changed my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lotion but the tanning was very light and did not see much change with daily use.  The fragrance is pleasant-- not chemical smelling-- and the upside is that there were no streaks or spots as it had only a subtle tanning effect and went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The self tanner streaks a bit, and doesn&#x27;t completely cover all areas even after exfoliating. Also after using this product about 4 times, the dual opening on the container became clogged  to only one opening pumping  only the moisturizer out and not the bronzing self-tanner which is supposed to come through the other opening. So I feel like I wasted money on this product.</li>
            <li> This bronzer really smells good and I would recommend it for those who don&#x27;t want to be in the sun.You need to watch putting too much on in a short period of time or the color can be a little undesirable.But I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months and it&#x27;s really not done much in the way of giving my face color.  I think it is basically just a tinted moisturizer and when you wash your face you wash off the tint.  I thought it would gradually give my skin the look of slight tanning, but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable even right after it&#x27;s applied.  That said, I like the dispenser and it does a nice job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS I HAVE USED FOR TANNING....VERY NATURAL LOOKING AND DOES NOT HAVE THE SUNLESS TANNING LOTION TRADITIONAL SMELL. It has a light , nice scent</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. I have light olive toned skin and it doesn&#x27;t turn orange at all. It smells lovely (reminds me of a pina colada!) and gives a nice, light bronze tone right away.  I have noticed a very slight sunless tanner smell only once or twice, its just a whiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the fact that it has no parabens, mineral oil or petroleum products.  I will definitley repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product it gives you a nice summer glow..it smells nice and it moisturizes your skin.I would recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I actually liked this product for the few days that the dispenser worked!  The dispenser broker right away and there is no way to get the bronzer and moisturizer out of the container.  I have tried to unscrew the top portion with no avail.  I don&#x27;t usually leave negative reviews but this was very irritating.  I ended up throwing it away even though it was full of cream.</li>
            <li> This facial bronzer does not give a noticeable brozing look on your face. It does do a good job moisterizing, and does not have a horrible scent.</li>
            <li> I did not use this item because I&#x27;m allergic to the ingredients. The ingredients should be listed before you purchase the item. This product has many ingredients. Contact the manufacturer before purchasing this item to save time. I do not know how well this product works, so I will not give them 1 star. However, ingredients should be posted.</li>
            <li> For those of you looking for an organic product, you will be disgusted and disappointed with this product. It contains no organic ingredients, and several other ingredients that I always try to avoid like \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;, BHT, yellow # 5, and a slew of other non organic chemicals. I wouldnt waste my money on this..keep looking..</li>
            <li> I usually do not write too many reviews on products but I think this one is worth my time for everyone! I gave up tanning four years ago so I am strong believer in sunless tanning! I have tried several different brands. Most times its something from target. If I am willing to splurge I will go to Macys, but I finally found a product that has a great price &amp; gets the job done! This sunless tanner not only creates a smooth &amp; even tan/glow all over your body/face but also moisturizers your skin! My other favorite aspect of this product is that when you are putting it on you can see the tinted color which helps know where you need to spread the lotion. I would for sure recommend this product to any of my friends, family, and coworkers!</li>
            <li> A wonderful product! Feels great, smells nice! I wish it made me a bit browner but people still notice I&#x27;m tan and it looks soooooo natural. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again and have recommended it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I wanted a more natural sunless tanner for my face and that is what I got! The best news is this doesnt break me out and I have acne prone skin. The color is very minimal. I apply two nights in a row and I have a light tan, not an orange tint. I only apply to my face due to the cost. I have great luck with Banana Boat &amp;#34;deep dark&amp;#34; sunless tan for my body. The smell is pretty light, nothing compared to other self tanners. The texture is not sticky, this feels like a soft lotion. I accidentally forgot to wash my hands and the back of my hands weren&#x27;t orange which tells you how buildable the sunless lotion is.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different moisturizers in my time but this is one of my favorites.  This product is super moisturizing, especially when my skin is so dry in the winter. I like that it&#x27;s made with natural oils because my skin feels much smoother. The gradual sunless tanner works really well and is not streaky at all. I don&#x27;t look orange or unnatural which is one of the things I have struggled with before with other sunless tanners. The other positive of this is that you can use it on both your face and your body and often times, I have found that sunless tanners cause my face to get blemishes. One of the biggest perks is that this product smells like coconuts. I hate putting on sunless tanners because they smell terrible. This smells great! I am very happy with this product and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a sunless tanner that is both moisturizing and is looking for a natural but bronzed skin tone.</li>
            <li> I would give this two thumbs up and same review as the lotion that I purchased, but this seems to show color faster than the other. I did compare the 2 this week, and this one does show or tan you faster than the other. This is yummy smelling and used it on my face, which usually breaks out to new things, but it didn&#x27;t.

            <li> gives a subtle glow to your skin.  will not make you really dark, but just the right amount for really fair people to look healthy without looking fake.  smells awesome!  and doesn&#x27;t create that sunless tan smell afterward.  my son says I always smell like coconuts.</li>
