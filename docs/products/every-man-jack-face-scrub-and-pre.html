    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I hope the excellent pre-shave scrub can make it with just internet sales.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect level of abrasiveness for me.</li>
            <li>This face scrub is great if your on a budget like me.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise this is a great GREAT face scrub.</li>
            <li>The product does not feel like it&#x27;s scraping your face, and I&#x27;ve experienced no irritation from using it.  </li>
            <li>good consistency and a balanced amount of micro-beads.  </li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>Work well and smells good.</li>
            <li>if its good then why just 3 stars?&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is refreshing and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I also found the Mint fragrance surprisingly nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The feel of the product is nice:</li>
            <li>It works great to clean my face of oils and preparing it for shaving.</li>
            <li>because it keeps my face clean all day and did a great job at keeping my skin conditioned and oil free.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable on the skin, no dryness issues.</li>
            <li>I love Every Man Jack.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that they don&#x27;t test their products on animals.</li>
            <li>I would gladly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>In my opinion Anthony Logistics has one of the best facial scrubs for men ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>, but it is price-prohibitive for many people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they changed their face wash and it&#x27;s ok but not minty any more</li>
            <li>Great Product but much cheaper at Target</li>
            <li>Smells great, all natural, and leaves your skin feeling and looking nice.</li>
            <li>I love everything about the EMJ product line (with one exception).  </li>
            <li>I found Zurh scrub to be much better.</li>
            <li>The scrub is great on your face and gets it very clean and soft.</li>
            <li>if that&#x27;s good or not in terms of skin care, but I prefer something that really *feels</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d look for something more environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>mint smell is very mild.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to shave your face.</li>
            <li>it does not give me that satisfying clean sensation after scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was paraben free, and cruelty</li>
            <li>and they still use the same great product.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy their after shave lotion as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time using it I fell in love.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the blackheads from my face.    </li>
            <li>However, it does have a mild mint fragrance, so if you&#x27;re looking for something that is fragrance free, or just don&#x27;t like added fragrances at all, you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend, and I haven&#x27;t had a chance to give it to him yet since I am still waiting on another half of his gift, but I had to steal just a drop of it since it smelled so good!</li>
            <li>Soften the consistency of the scrub, take out the fragrance and you&#x27;d have a true 5-star face scrub thatfits into anyone&#x27;s budget.</li>
            <li>I particularly love the Pre-Shave Scrub so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loyal to using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The exfoliating beads are mild, but still feel as if they are doing their job.  </li>
            <li>A quick google of polyethylene/environment will confirm this.</li>
            <li>Even though the Nivea Face Scrub doesn&#x27;t use natural ingredients, it seems to clean my face slightly better.</li>
            <li>Not enough jojoba beads in product to make it an effective scrub.</li>
            <li>Not gritty like Nivea scrub... really nice.</li>
            <li>I could really feel the scrub exfoliating my face to a squeaky clean smoothness that I haven&#x27;t felt on my face in years.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena works just as good, and for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li>very, very unsatisfying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently overseas and just grateful to be able to get this product out my way.</li>
            <li>On the bottle it says \\&quot;Pre-Shave\\&quot;, but I use it daily in the shower and it always works its magic.</li>
            <li>Given its current price on Amazon, there are much better products to be had.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product; difficult to find.</li>
            <li>but the fact is, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as other products.</li>
            <li>Also a bonus that they took out Dyes, Parabens, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Phthalates, and left in natural solutions like coconut surfactants, vitamin e, and the amazing Jojoba beads that makes the scrub feel like a massage.    </li>
            <li>order is for only one - does not work well enough to be a good value at that price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the full line of EMJ products, feel free to look up my other reviews on their products.)</li>
            <li>The razor just glides across your face and you get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Very misleading, shame on you Amazon.</li>
            <li>Smell is interesting, but as expected on an all-natural product.</li>
            <li>The lack of Parabens and SLS is a nice bonus, although that is not a primary factor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the fact is, I just like the feeling of other products more.</li>
            <li>Squeeze too soft and you barely get anything out of the bottle, but you get the hang of it pretty quick.    </li>
            <li>the one from Nivea for men is much better for less money.</li>
            <li>I have been waiting for a company like Every Man Jack to cater to males who need quick products that clean their face especially when you have naturally oily skin or simply need to wash your face because of exercise.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that they try to use natural extracts and I am really pulling for this company</li>
            <li>Her reaction is definitely worth a couple extra dollars.</li>
            <li>In addition to this product, he has tried several other of the Every Man Jack products, and in general is very pleased.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes a difference right before shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>this face scrub is not here nor there: it&#x27;s not fine enough to be called microfine like the one from MenSience nor is it coarse enough to make it more suitable for non-daily scrubs.</li>
            <li>Be aware the picture shows two 5oz bottles, however the price is only for one bottle.  </li>
            <li>To start off the review, I&#x27;d like to mention that I have sensitive skin that tends to get oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Whoever said this stuff is too watery is completely nuts, which brings me to why I gave this stuff a 4-star review.</li>
            <li>It makes it soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since ordered directly from EMJ</li>
            <li>So thick, in fact, that you have to squeeze the bottle with just the right amount of force and pray you get just the right amount.</li>
            <li>How effective these additions are for a facial scrub is an entirely different subject, but they are usually only found in higher-end products.  </li>
            <li>That would indicate it actually has more small plastic micro beads, than jojoba beads.</li>
            <li>apart from that I really don&#x27;t care much for the scent, since it&#x27;s a mixture of medicinal with a slight touch of mint.</li>
            <li>None of the major retailers mentioned in the web site carry this Every Man Jack brand.</li>
            <li>B00005BL1R Nivea for Men Face Cleansing, Double Action Face Wash]] for about 2 years now</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve used better and worse scrubs.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how EMJ manages to keep their prices so reasonable especially since their products are on the same level in terms of quality, as similar items which more expensive.</li>
            <li>The combination of humectants, emollients, anti-inflammatories, skin calming agents, and vitamins found in the EMJ scrub are not found in any other product near this price as far as I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>This is the second product that I have used from this company and the main reason I support them is because they do not use parabens, sodium laurel sulfate and all of the other ingredients that are frowned upon in skin care.    </li>

            <li> Not really practical to order here.</li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s scrubbing my face, like Jack Black or</li>

            <li> In fact, I would prefer it to be a little stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Polyethylene is about to be banned in products like these where I live(NY) due to the negative effects they have on the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure</li>
            <li> and it just plain sucks.</li>
            <li> Squeeze too hard</li>
            <li> So that why I said it sucks.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too watery or too thick</li>
            <li> Anyone who takes his shaving seriously should have EMJ Pre-Shave Scrub in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> The mint fragrance is subtle and doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> But the smell of this stuff drives my girlfriend crazy.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read another review regarding the &#x27;Every Man Jack Pre-shave Face Scrub&#x27; and I agree with this individual. I have been waiting for a company like Every Man Jack to cater to males who need quick products that clean their face especially when you have naturally oily skin or simply need to wash your face because of exercise. This is the second product that I have used from this company and the main reason I support them is because they do not use parabens, sodium laurel sulfate and all of the other ingredients that are frowned upon in skin care.    I like the fact that they try to use natural extracts and I am really pulling for this company but the fact is, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as other products. This product and the EMJ post-shave lotion or both too watery. Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the blackheads from my face.    Even though the Nivea Face Scrub doesn&#x27;t use natural ingredients, it seems to clean my face slightly better. I&#x27;m not sure as to why this is but at this point I&#x27;m hesitant to try another EMJ product for the time being.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently overseas and just grateful to be able to get this product out my way.</li>
            <li> I love Every Man Jack.  This face scrub is great if your on a budget like me.  I noticed a difference after using this product.  It wish I could find it locally in stores but I can&#x27;t.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> To start off the review, I&#x27;d like to mention that I have sensitive skin that tends to get oily throughout the day. I&#x27;ve been loyal to using [[ASIN:B00005BL1R Nivea for Men Face Cleansing, Double Action Face Wash]] for about 2 years now because it keeps my face clean all day and did a great job at keeping my skin conditioned and oil free. I ran out about a month ago and stumbled upon this Every Man Jack Face Scrub at my local grocery store and decided to purchase it because it was comparable in price to my preferred Nivea face wash, but the Nivea was out of stock.    First time using it I fell in love. I could really feel the scrub exfoliating my face to a squeaky clean smoothness that I haven&#x27;t felt on my face in years. I also found the Mint fragrance surprisingly nice and not overpowering. Whoever said this stuff is too watery is completely nuts, which brings me to why I gave this stuff a 4-star review. The scrub consistency is pretty thick. So thick, in fact, that you have to squeeze the bottle with just the right amount of force and pray you get just the right amount. Squeeze too hard and it goes splattering everywhere. Squeeze too soft and you barely get anything out of the bottle, but you get the hang of it pretty quick.    I&#x27;m glad that they don&#x27;t test their products on animals. Also a bonus that they took out Dyes, Parabens, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Phthalates, and left in natural solutions like coconut surfactants, vitamin e, and the amazing Jojoba beads that makes the scrub feel like a massage.    I would gladly recommend this to anyone. However, it does have a mild mint fragrance, so if you&#x27;re looking for something that is fragrance free, or just don&#x27;t like added fragrances at all, you might want to look elsewhere. Otherwise this is a great GREAT face scrub. On the bottle it says \\&quot;Pre-Shave\\&quot;, but I use it daily in the shower and it always works its magic. Soften the consistency of the scrub, take out the fragrance and you&#x27;d have a true 5-star face scrub thatfits into anyone&#x27;s budget.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ve used better and worse scrubs.  However, I like this product for the price.  In my opinion Anthony Logistics has one of the best facial scrubs for men ([[ASIN:B0037F7Z58 Anthony Logistics for Men Facial Scrub 8 oz (237 ml)]], but it is price-prohibitive for many people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product performs on par with its immediate competitors such as the Neutrogena, L&#x27;Oreal, and Nivea lines; however, when you look at the ingredient list, you find a product that usually sells for a much higher price.  The combination of humectants, emollients, anti-inflammatories, skin calming agents, and vitamins found in the EMJ scrub are not found in any other product near this price as far as I&#x27;ve found.  How effective these additions are for a facial scrub is an entirely different subject, but they are usually only found in higher-end products.  The lack of Parabens and SLS is a nice bonus, although that is not a primary factor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel of the product is nice: good consistency and a balanced amount of micro-beads.  The product does not feel like it&#x27;s scraping your face, and I&#x27;ve experienced no irritation from using it.  The exfoliating beads are mild, but still feel as if they are doing their job.  I would recommend this product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years, and it does the job.  Be aware the picture shows two 5oz bottles, however the price is only for one bottle.  Given its current price on Amazon, there are much better products to be had.</li>
            <li> they changed their face wash and it&#x27;s ok but not minty any more and it doesn&#x27;t have the micro-scrub balls</li>
            <li> Great Product but much cheaper at Target</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about 3 months now. I&#x27;ve used similar products by Jack Black and Nivea for men. Out of the three, the grit EMJ used for exfoliating is the finest. I&#x27;m not really sure if that&#x27;s good or not in terms of skin care, but I prefer something that really *feels* like it&#x27;s scrubbing my face, like Jack Black or Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too watery or too thick, the consistency seems just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint smell is very mild. In fact, I would prefer it to be a little stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this is made in the US, that they don&#x27;t test on animals, and they don&#x27;t have a lot of the junk ingredients ... but the fact is, I just like the feeling of other products more. I may buy again, I may not.&lt;br /&gt;(Since I&#x27;ve been using the full line of EMJ products, feel free to look up my other reviews on their products.)</li>
            <li> I like this. The scrub is great on your face and gets it very clean and soft. PLUS it does work on your beard. It makes it soft so it is easy to shave your face. The razor just glides across your face and you get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product; difficult to find. None of the major retailers mentioned in the web site carry this Every Man Jack brand. I hope the excellent pre-shave scrub can make it with just internet sales.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, and I haven&#x27;t had a chance to give it to him yet since I am still waiting on another half of his gift, but I had to steal just a drop of it since it smelled so good! I can&#x27;t ever find this stuff in the surrounding grocery stores and now I want some for myself. Smells great, all natural, and leaves your skin feeling and looking nice. I especially cannot get over the smell...</li>
            <li> This is a substandard product compared to the Nivea face wash. It does not clean as well and it just plain sucks. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love everything about the EMJ product line (with one exception).  I particularly love the Pre-Shave Scrub so much I order it on-line since I cannot purchase it locally.  It&#x27;s an integral part of my shaving experience.  I don&#x27;t know how EMJ manages to keep their prices so reasonable especially since their products are on the same level in terms of quality, as similar items which more expensive. Anyone who takes his shaving seriously should have EMJ Pre-Shave Scrub in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> this face scrub is not here nor there: it&#x27;s not fine enough to be called microfine like the one from MenSience nor is it coarse enough to make it more suitable for non-daily scrubs. it does not give me that satisfying clean sensation after scrubbing. apart from that I really don&#x27;t care much for the scent, since it&#x27;s a mixture of medicinal with a slight touch of mint. very, very unsatisfying. the one from Nivea for men is much better for less money.</li>
            <li> I like the way the product works. It works like an average facial scrub. I bought it because it was paraben free, and cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains Polyethylene though. Polyethylene is about to be banned in products like these where I live(NY) due to the negative effects they have on the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item claims to have Jojoba beads which aid in scrubbing, but the ingredient Polyethylene precedes Jojoba on the ingredient list. That would indicate it actually has more small plastic micro beads, than jojoba beads. These micro plastic beads end up in the water supply once they leave our homes. They then end up being consumed by fish which are part of the food supply. I&#x27;d look for something more environmentally friendly. A quick google of polyethylene/environment will confirm this.</li>
            <li> When I got the package, the cleanser was open thus it leak out a half. So that why I said it sucks.</li>
            <li> My son loves the products for shaving and cleaning his face.  It is refreshing and does a great job.  It smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have bought this scrub several times now for my teenage son.  He likes the product very much as a basic daily face scrub to help keep away pimples and blackheads.  It only takes a small amount of the scrub, so each tube lasts a long time. The scrub does not over-dry his skin, and even though it contains jojoba, he does not find it to be oily either.  In addition to this product, he has tried several other of the Every Man Jack products, and in general is very pleased.</li>
            <li> Work well and smells good.</li>
            <li> I bought this online bc my local Target stopped carrying it. When it arrived in the mail it was a different (white) container and the scrub was entirely different. I&#x27;ve since ordered directly from EMJ and they still use the same great product. This vendor is sketchy if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using EMJ face scrub for a couple years now. It&#x27;s the perfect level of abrasiveness for me. I picked it because it has no parabens and no SLS. The mint fragrance is subtle and doesn&#x27;t bother me. I recently thought they had reformulated it when I got a tube with an overpowering flowery fragrance. I e-mailed Every Man Jack customer service; they got back to me quickly and told me it was likely a bad batch or tube. They are sending me a replacement tube. I opened a second tube I had and found it was the regular face scrub I like. Sticking with this product!</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying, by the picture on here, two 5oz bottles. However when my package arrived there was only one bottle and found out later the price was only for one bottle. Very misleading, shame on you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not enough jojoba beads in product to make it an effective scrub. I found Zurh scrub to be much better.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable on the skin, no dryness issues. It definitely makes a difference right before shaving with a razor. Smell is interesting, but as expected on an all-natural product.</li>
            <li> Not gritty like Nivea scrub... really nice.</li>
            <li> picture shows 2 bottles- order is for only one - does not work well enough to be a good value at that price</li>
            <li> It does the job cleaning my face.  Neutrogena works just as good, and for a lot less money.  But the smell of this stuff drives my girlfriend crazy.  Her reaction is definitely worth a couple extra dollars.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for quite some time. It works great to clean my face of oils and preparing it for shaving. Every man jack is a quality brand and I really enjoy their after shave lotion as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if its good then why just 3 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the price is double what it costs at Target. For the same amount. Not really practical to order here. Next time you are out shopping and need some face scrub, pick up some Every Man Jack. I just wish the price was lower here.</li>
