            <li> but i think the pricing is a little too high for the spray and lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so devastating when Bath &amp; Body Works does a limited fragrance run, especially on a fragrance that you love.</li>
            <li> Was sad when they discontinued it and had to find a new fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend awhile back and tried to find it in stores but failed.</li>

            <li> What an addictive and alluring scent! I fell in love with this fragrance after testing MANY others in a Bath &amp; Body Works shop, and after consuming the small bottle I bought there, knew I wanted more.
