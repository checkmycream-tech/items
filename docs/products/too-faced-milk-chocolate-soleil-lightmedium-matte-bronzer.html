            <li>I love these bronzers!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of cocoa!  </li>
            <li>smells and tastes DELICIOUS, the color is perfect for very light or fair skin, I find it a bit chalky and dusty when I use it over my tan skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect bronzey tan color for my fair skin, minus the sparkles...</li>
            <li>but this product is very light, matte, blends well and does not irritate.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>I love this product...have been using Jane Iredale Bronzer, not anymore.  </li>
            <li>and they love it...</li>
            <li>I love this bronzer, which I also use as a powder foundation too.</li>
            <li>I have a yellow undertone and it looks great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this stuff (I have it in both shades).  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite bronzers.</li>
            <li>It goes on with such ease and it makes my look flawless.</li>
            <li>love the smell</li>
            <li>It smells gorgeous, has a silky smooth super fine grain formulation, and it looks *</li>
            <li>but I had an Prescriptives flat blush brush that fit perfectly into the compact without compromising the product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad and no one notices (except for my dogs who try to lick it off my face!)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s quickly become my favorite bronzer.</li>
            <li>These bronzers are great - super natural looking.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a light glow and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and blendable.</li>
            <li>Wonderful bronzing color for pale skin.</li>
            <li>Shipped safely and brand new.</li>
            <li>really well with light coverage powder makeup as well as over BB cream or full coverage</li>
            <li>I normally use Benefit&#x27;s Hoola, but this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>, for a golden look all over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s matte, with no shimmer, and more natural.</li>
            <li>I do have to say despite me having to reapply it every 6 or so hours, it&#x27;s worth it because it just smells heavenly.</li>
            <li>This does the trick for the most part, but still, way too light which is why I only gave it four stars.  </li>
            <li>Just the right shade for my complexion.</li>
            <li>overall I love it and would highly recommend it for anyone with light skin.</li>
            <li>gorgeous, light, long lasting</li>
            <li>It really does smell like chocolate!</li>
            <li>It gives you a fresh natural look.</li>
            <li>Added bonus: It smells really</li>
            <li>the must it really smells like chocolate loveeeeeee it</li>
            <li>I also do not need to touch it up throughout the day, it stays very well.</li>
            <li>well so it doesn&#x27;t look fake, gives me a perfect hint of color, and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>In the spring/ summer, I use Milk Chocolate as my all-over powder (to set CC or BB creams) and I use the original Chocolate Soleil (medium/ deep) for contouring.  </li>
            <li>now!This is one of the only products that I have found that is light and natural looking while still affordable in price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and the company that carries it...</li>
            <li>foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend highly.  </li>
            <li>Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>For a while now, I have been trying out a new bronzer each time I run out.</li>
            <li>The coloration of the Milk Chocolate is neutral, so it&#x27;ll accommodate many skin tones (and it has absolutely NO orange or red hue to it at all).  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>this stuff is completely matte.</li>
            <li>ultra* natural.  </li>
            <li>Light enough for a lovely, non-orange tan color, yet buildable enough for soft to dramatic contouring.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not a very loose powder</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this product...have been using Jane Iredale Bronzer, not anymore.  The color, feel on my face is wonderful. Several people have noticed, they are not sure, have said something is different about me and they love it...my little secret...I highly recommend this product and the company that carries it...Great service as well.</li>
            <li> This yummy bronzer is light and beautiful!  Just like the slightly darker version (Chocolate Soleil Matte Bronzing Powder) it has a wonderful cocoa fragrance.  I have very sensitive skin but this product is very light, matte, blends well and does not irritate. It is &#x27;build-able&#x27; with the versatility to be just sun-kissed to dramatic golden goddess!  I also use it for additional glow on my neck, d&amp;eacute;colletage, etc., for a golden look all over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works really well with light coverage powder makeup as well as over BB cream or full coverage foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend highly.  Yum!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the color was unsuccessful choice but it has a great chocolate smell, amazing!</li>
            <li> This is the best bronzer better than benefit hoola bronzer!!!</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer, which I also use as a powder foundation too. It gives my skin a light glow and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love this! I discovered it watching a YouTube tutorial and it&#x27;s quickly become my favorite bronzer. I have a yellow undertone and it looks great!</li>
            <li> gorgeous, light, long lasting</li>
            <li> Uh, yep- smells like chocolate, aka it&#x27;s divine to smell; why does this matter? Because if you like smelling good, then it&#x27;s number one in the bronzer world. I like to also think of when my boyfriend will kiss me and he won&#x27;t smell the nasty makeup-y smell. This color is GREAT for fair-skinned gals. It&#x27;s matte, with no shimmer, and more natural. I do have to say despite me having to reapply it every 6 or so hours, it&#x27;s worth it because it just smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> It literally does smell like a chocolate bar...heaven!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect bronzey tan color for my fair skin, minus the sparkles...this stuff is completely matte. I normally use Benefit&#x27;s Hoola, but this is my new favorite! Light enough for a lovely, non-orange tan color, yet buildable enough for soft to dramatic contouring. It&#x27;s so smooth and blendable. Definitely making the switch to this from now on!</li>
            <li> This product is Great for contouring!! It gives you a fresh natural look. Matte finish. Added bonus: It smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a very loose powder so you dont need a lot of product when you apply it.</li>
            <li> I love these bronzers! I use the Chocolate Soleil but accidentally ordered the Milk Chocolate so I gave it to a friend who is lighter than me. These bronzers are great - super natural looking. They are matte so there is none of that shimmer/shine that a lot of bronzers give. I have oily skin so shimmer is just a disaster on my face. These bronzers seem to keep my oil in check and don&#x27;t cause me to break out. They do smell like cocoa which is a little weird to get used to but it&#x27;s not bad and no one notices (except for my dogs who try to lick it off my face!)</li>
            <li> Oh my god, I can&#x27;t even.  I&#x27;m in love with this stuff (I have it in both shades).  In the spring/ summer, I use Milk Chocolate as my all-over powder (to set CC or BB creams) and I use the original Chocolate Soleil (medium/ deep) for contouring.  It smells gorgeous, has a silky smooth super fine grain formulation, and it looks *ultra* natural.  The coloration of the Milk Chocolate is neutral, so it&#x27;ll accommodate many skin tones (and it has absolutely NO orange or red hue to it at all).  I&#x27;m a sun worshipper, but I NEVER tan my face (SPF 100+, represent) -- this stuff + the Medium/ Deep Chocolate Soleil makes my face 100% match my tan.</li>
            <li> For a while now, I have been trying out a new bronzer each time I run out. I decided to go with this one because of the reviews and ratings on other sites. I am very pale. VERY pale. And I need a bronzer that blends well so it doesn&#x27;t look fake, gives me a perfect hint of color, and looks natural.  This makes my skin look flawless, and it lasts all day. However, it&#x27;s very light. You can build your color, but I feel like I&#x27;m using a lot to get to my desires shade. I like to have a slight tannish looking, glowy skin. This does the trick for the most part, but still, way too light which is why I only gave it four stars.  For the winter months this will work, but definitely not summer. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful bronzing color for pale skin. Smells great, doesn&#x27;t taste too bad either, if the powder migrates through the air to your lips while brushing on!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite bronzers. It really does smell like chocolate! Shipped safely and brand new. I am a redhead with very pale skin and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome color for fair skin. Sheer and weightless. Smells great too!  The only draw back is that there is no brush included but I had an Prescriptives flat blush brush that fit perfectly into the compact without compromising the product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of cocoa!  Just the right shade for my complexion.</li>
            <li> Great product. The matte is perfect and it smells delicious also. My husband always tells me I smell like cake now!This is one of the only products that I have found that is light and natural looking while still affordable in price. Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> I love this!! It goes on with such ease and it makes my look flawless.</li>
            <li> love the smell the must it really smells like chocolate loveeeeeee it</li>
            <li> smells and tastes DELICIOUS, the color is perfect for very light or fair skin, I find it a bit chalky and dusty when I use it over my tan skin. It does NOT leave those weird blotchy bronzer marks that some dark bronzers leave on my face. I also do not need to touch it up throughout the day, it stays very well. overall I love it and would highly recommend it for anyone with light skin.</li>
