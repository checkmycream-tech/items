            <li>I wanted to return it, but Amazon will not let you return products that could be labeled hazardous.</li>
            <li>so maybe that&#x27;s what the rose name is for.</li>
            <li>Dose not have a rose smell.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish I had cancelled the order.</li>

            <li>Love the fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I also have one of those mini fillable perfume sprays that I&#x27;ve filled</li>
            <li>Adds shine and same pleasant scent as the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing is , it prevents frizz</li>
            <li>It is the same smell as the pink shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair (which I love) but the smell is fleeting at best.</li>
            <li>I expected a more authentc rose smell.</li>
            <li>Scent is too light,  which I thought would be good because it wouldn&#x27;t  overpower and clash with other perfumes I might be wearing.</li>
            <li>It is smell good and soft but once it is in your hair wont last more than 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light, delicate rose scent.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair smell good without weighing it down or drying it out.</li>

            <li>It smells good; but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair and this hair fragrance makes it feel oily but brittle and frizzy at the same time.</li>
            <li>got caught up in the hype, was really hoping for a fragrance that was light enough to use as a hair scent.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really smell it&#x27;s aroma much.</li>
            <li>and I like it so much.  </li>
            <li>I wished I had been able to afford the other scent but since I like roses I thought this would work just as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is strong enough to get the smells of smoke or other strong odors out of the hair.</li>
            <li>It is not bad but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of sweet, hard to spray, and doesn&#x27;t really last very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this scent.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice, similar to, but not exactly like the shampoo/conditioning set.  </li>
            <li>Nice fragrance for your hair, especially on days where you have not washed it and need a little freshening up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually very surprised by this fact.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your  money on this product!</li>
            <li>Since it can be a little heavy for my fine hair I spray on my hands and smooth on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>My 52 year old hilighted n</li>
            <li>It turned my lifeless aging hair into soft manageable tresses.</li>
            <li>do I think it was advertised as, it is basically applying a light mist of shine oil to tame fly-away hair or whatever</li>
            <li>Last for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little oily which is somewhat okay since my hair is a little dry.  </li>
            <li>However, the scent disappeared shortly after applying; not long- lasting- no impact!</li>

            <li> It smells wonderful, but doesn&#x27;t seem to last?  Otherwise, smooth transaction.  Buy with confidence.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Along with their shampoo&#x27;s this is great stuff.  Love the fresh scent.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this scent. It&#x27;s very clean and it does help freshen your hair.  This is my favorite of the hair fragrance mist that Fekkai makes, but honestly all of them are very nice.</li>
            <li> not really what i expected. its an oil mist so with that in mind it doesnt really tame your hair just makes it oily..but it does smell nice.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like rose and undortunatly Amazon policy won&#x27;t let you return it because it is &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34;. It smells like super sweet cotton candy, actually makes me feel sick.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> This product has zero smell at all! How can they sell a product as a &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; when it has no fragrance. I wanted to return it, but Amazon will not let you return products that could be labeled hazardous. I guess this product has alcohol in it...or something. I smells and feels like tap water.  Do not waste your  money on this product!</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting more of a fragrance then I experienced with the rose scent. Didn&#x27;t really smell it&#x27;s aroma much. It&#x27;s just ok in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and helps refresh hair.  Adds shine and same pleasant scent as the shampoo.  Glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> love it! gives a subtle smell to my hair without weighing it down. i use it throughout the day. definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like the scent although very light.  I was disappointed it doesn&#x27;t last at all.  Not like the Pink Sugar scent.</li>
            <li> For me, the scent lasts about 10 seconds</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance for your hair, especially on days where you have not washed it and need a little freshening up.</li>
            <li> Nice Smell on the hair!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice light smell. Last for a decent amount of time. Works well on human hair wigs too</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this scent.  Could hardly smell it.  Should not be labeled as a fragrance mist.  The only good thing is , it prevents frizz that&#x27;s it.  I do not recommend this product, total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Product arrived broken and doesn&#x27;t smell like roses</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking with a name like fresh rose, it would smell like roses. Wrong. It is pink so maybe that&#x27;s what the rose name is for. The scent is sort of fruity. Not my thing. It also made my hair feel a bit on the greasy side even with just one spritz but my hair is very fine.</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely wonderful! I definitely recommend buying this. The only negative I have about it is that if you spray it directly on your hair it looks oily afterwards.</li>
            <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last. It is smell good and soft but once it is in your hair wont last more than 40 minutes. You can smell your hair and you will smell no essence after 30 to 40 minutes. This has happened to me inside the house with a temperature between 72 and 75 degrees Farenheit.</li>
            <li> Dose not have a rose smell. It is the same smell as the pink shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair (which I love) but the smell is fleeting at best. I have fine curly hair and this hair fragrance makes it feel oily but brittle and frizzy at the same time.</li>
            <li> It smells good; but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.  It&#x27;s a little oily which is somewhat okay since my hair is a little dry.  I would give this mist 5 stars if it lasted longer and it was less oily.</li>
            <li> Scent is too light,  which I thought would be good because it wouldn&#x27;t  overpower and clash with other perfumes I might be wearing. However, the scent disappeared shortly after applying; not long- lasting- no impact!</li>
            <li> I really love this scent.  It&#x27;s the best of three that I have tried.  I&#x27;m actually very surprised by this fact.  I usually avoid flower scents like the plague.  It&#x27;s a very light, delicate rose scent.  I think that is why it works and I like it so much.  I&#x27;d buy it again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> waited forever on this product to ship...I guess all the magazine buzz effected supply, whatever.  It does smell nice, similar to, but not exactly like the shampoo/conditioning set.  Takes too much to actually scent your hair and what I did not realize nor do I think it was advertised as, it is basically applying a light mist of shine oil to tame fly-away hair or whatever so you can&#x27;t use enough or you will end up with stringy, flat hair.&lt;br /&gt;I got caught up in the hype, was really hoping for a fragrance that was light enough to use as a hair scent.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!!  Smell is fantastic.  Since it can be a little heavy for my fine hair I spray on my hands and smooth on the ends of my hair. Works great ! I have even sprayed some on my pillow!!</li>
            <li> I waited fot this product for almost 2 months! After all that time, I expected something much more special. I expected a more authentc rose smell. It&#x27;s kind of sweet, hard to spray, and doesn&#x27;t really last very well. I kind of wish I had cancelled the order. I will use it when my hair is less than clean, but the smell is what I am the most disappointed in.</li>
            <li> The smell is perfect, may first smell strong but it settles. I&#x27;ve received plenty of complements to continue to purchase this product. I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair everyday so it&#x27;s perfect for a touch up.</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance mist on my hair, because it does not make the hair frizzy.  It makes your hair smell good without weighing it down or drying it out.</li>
            <li> I wished I had been able to afford the other scent but since I like roses I thought this would work just as well. It is not bad but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, wished it lasted a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase through amazon after reading you can&#x27;t return it so I bought it at a big box store. And I will use thus forever. My 52 year old hilighted n colored hair loves it. It turned my lifeless aging hair into soft manageable tresses. My hair is course and I have a long shag. Yes a shag.. I spray this on in the am during the day n at bedtime. I use the matching shampoo and conditioner and mask. And I can go 3-5 days without washing my hair. In the am I spray my hair and then spray my boar bristle brush and shape and refresh my style. I love it. It&#x27;s nor overpowering at all. After I get dressed I mist the back of my hair and let the mist hit my clothing at the neckline, and it blends well with my Chloe body lotion. I don&#x27;t think this is strong enough to get the smells of smoke or other strong odors out of the hair. But the shampoo, conditioner and mask will. For those who say it&#x27;s oily I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever had that happen. I carry one in my purse. I also have one of those mini fillable perfume sprays that I&#x27;ve filled n carry that in my cross body bag.</li>
