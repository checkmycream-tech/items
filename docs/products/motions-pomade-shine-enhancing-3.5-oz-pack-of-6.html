            <li>The best deal for pomade and works well in my hair.    </li>
            <li>Great for curly hair!  </li>
            <li>The wax he uses and likes the best is called [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>And, best of all, doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily so that I know</li>
            <li>Best pomade I have tried.</li>
            <li>The shine is not the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>The pomade made his hair spike perfectly.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>Great for getting that kitchen and the esges of your hair.</li>
            <li>If you have a son that uses it every day this seems like a great choice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the smell, look, and usability is great with this</li>
            <li>Slicks the hair very nicely although not for an all day hold.</li>
            <li>This does the trick but not as good as hair wax, which holds his hair all day.  </li>
            <li>it has good hold and to re-activate it for restyling, a spritz of water is all that you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife loved this product and ranted and raved about it after every use.</li>
            <li>It has a nice feel and gives a great shine.</li>
            <li>It keeps hair moist, doesn&#x27;t add to breakage, smells good and adds shine.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product that I would recommend and continue to use.</li>
            <li>and it looks nice.  </li>
            <li>It works for a lot of things which is nice but doesn&#x27;t do any one of them as well as a \\&quot;dedicated to that need\\&quot; product would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I emulsify (warm)</li>
            <li>Just about any product can produce this kind of shine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good product and I&#x27;m sure we will use it up and even buy some for light control of my husband&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not the best overall pomade on the market, its low cost makes it the best choice for me.    </li>
            <li>it is more &#x27;liquidy&#x27;.</li>
            <li>If use often you will see a change of more manageable here.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair,threw away the product, and am feeling slightly better.</li>
            <li>Still, there are better Twists wraps out there including one by Motions:</li>
            <li>She used it on my daughter as well and saved the jar so she could be reminded about buying more of it.</li>
            <li>and it creates more defined waves.</li>
            <li>My menfolk use more hair product that the women around here.  </li>
            <li>If they did I&#x27;d have had even more complaints.  </li>
            <li>The exotic Samba scent resembles plastic burning in the bottom of a dishwasher combined with coconutty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When comparing this pomade to Garnier, L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Line, Bed Head and others--I find it to be a much better buy.</li>
            <li>Much better than using gel, and it lasts a while.  </li>
            <li>There are better options out there.</li>
            <li>Mostly I obtained these as a practical joke , presenting her with a dozen or so products at one time.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out</li>
            <li>For the first 6 years I used a well known brand, American Crew (AC), that did an excellent job at making my hair look good (relatively) and had a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the texture is very smooth and glides easily on your hair so there is no need to use a lot.</li>
            <li>The smell was obnoxious and my stomach rolled pretty good a couple of times but held it all together.  </li>
            <li>but in lightening up on the heaviness of the product, they lost some of the strong hold and control that most \\&quot;Ethnic\\&quot; haired men and women look for in a Pomade.  </li>
            <li>Very good product especially for kids!</li>
            <li>I have very full hair and the motions at home shine enhancer worked wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a very good holding pomade especially for the edges of your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a strong hold and one that I can continue to style through the day.  </li>
            <li>so it is not too strong.  </li>
            <li>They give a strong hold without flaking or getting crusty.  </li>
            <li>I liked the look very much for an evening party but would never wear it that way all day.</li>
            <li>All in all I have been VERY pleased with this whole product line.</li>
            <li>It does keep more of a wet look, but isn&#x27;t all that great for separating hair for a messy/textured look.  </li>
            <li>It would probably be the only pomade I&#x27;d buy, but I&#x27;m now trying out \\&quot;wax\\&quot; which I&#x27;m having great results with as well.</li>
            <li>Overall great product for ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s texture is light</li>
            <li>I chose to rate Motions Shine Enhancing Pomade 4 stars because it works well applied lightly.</li>
            <li>I found that it is light.  </li>
            <li>The shimmer is light and doesn&#x27;t look glossy or tacky.  </li>
            <li>This claims to sport a grease free shine, but I bet to differ.  </li>
            <li>It does nothing to smooth the hair at the edges of your hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also worth noting is that the top 3 ingredients are water, laneth -15, and mineral oil</li>
            <li>but fortunately it does fade away</li>
            <li>So when I noticed that this product was available to try out decided to take a chance.  </li>
            <li>As long as you know HOW to use a pomade, it&#x27;ll work great for you.  </li>
            <li>This wonderful pomade gives my hair just the right amount of control with no stiffness and adds a beautiful, natural sheen, making my long (many years old) hair look fresh and young again.</li>
            <li>(someone mentioned Pina Colada, and I can smell that, but it is almost more intense than that).  </li>
            <li>The smell is good, and it holds for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>Its more like a hair gel than a real pomade.  </li>
            <li>I read some complaints that it is too thin, but the consistency is perfect for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried that the smell would linger around all day, but it seems to go away fairly quickly once you get it in your hair.</li>
            <li>- I have used other African-American hair products and have had a pleasant experience with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it simply doesn&#x27;t have a nice fragrance to it like the AC product.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a nice line between quality and cost...</li>
            <li>B001T8MN16 Motions Salon Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil, 8 Ounce]] but not as many.  </li>
            <li>I will be having fun with the Pomade for those kinds of hair stylings.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that this Motions At Home Shine enhancing Pomade does what it says which is Lightweight, non-greasy formula which gives you extra control for more precise styling.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future.</li>
            <li>&quot; gets it right</li>
            <li>Plus the price is right.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use a pomade product, but because I have fine hair prone to fly-aways</li>
            <li>fragrance is very pleasant and this is one of the few hair products I&#x27;ve encountered which actually helps me to look</li>
            <li>Overall, I prefer using the Suave matte finish to this, which is a bit easier to apply and seemed to keep your hair looking more consistent throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to go back in a timecapsule to the 1980s to feel comfortable wearing that kinda feirce style all day!  </li>
            <li>It is a lighter yellow/beige color and the top is the same color.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s the shine that turned them off as I&#x27;m pretty sure they never cracked open the lid.  </li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of pomade.  </li>
            <li>For that, there are many other products available right down to the old-fashioned [[ASIN:B000GG16QA Brylcreem Hair Cream Original - 5.5 Oz.]] or the slightly more modern [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>As a guy, I never expected to be interested in trying to style my hair with pomade and the like, but allowing myself to become long-haired and still with a fairly full though thinning head of hair, I&#x27;ve found this product to be quite useful.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a decent though more pricey alternative to styling gel.</li>
            <li>Smell  Not as strong at holding hair in place as some other pomades      Details:  Quick background on my use of pomade.</li>
            <li>I only wished that Motions&#x27; other products worked as successfully as these two did.</li>
            <li>, I like the product, the price is right and it works for my hair type and super short \\&quot;boy\\&quot; cut.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this holds your hair in place very well throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t say much about it myself.</li>
            <li>She highly recommends it and is a committed user of the product!</li>
            <li>It is not thin or runny.  </li>
            <li>We really favor pomade in our household because it works well for both genders.</li>
            <li>I can use it to sculpt and flatten my hair, my wife uses it for anti-frizz and gentle shine.</li>
            <li>This pomade is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is still slightly damp, work the pomade really well in your hands, then apply and work it through.  </li>
            <li>Various pomades have different consistencies - this one is more gel-like and somewhat runny, yet very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t figure out how \\&quot;I would know\\&quot;, she has subsequently utilized more in the product line and is looking better than ever---at least hair-wise (jab)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product to be a good alternative for my husband&#x27;s naturally curly \\&quot;caucasian\\&quot; hair that is cut short but left a little longer on the top so his natural curls can form into whirls instead of spikes.  </li>
            <li>Also, it has a sweet smell that an older teen may not like.</li>
            <li>but I did think it performed decently and at $17 a decent price so 4-stars from me based upon price/value.</li>
            <li>The product does provide decent hold though I find gel to be a bit stronger.</li>
            <li>It is mainly a shine enhancer, not a fixative</li>
            <li>can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It has a decent enough hold, but the firmness of the hold loosens very quickly and it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll stick with my normal Paul Mitchel Teatree pomade (plus</li>
            <li>Shiny, stinky and not what I&#x27;d normally use.</li>
            <li>highly recommend trying this pomade first with just one jar before ordering a pack of 6 from Amazon and later discovering you may not like it and your stuck with 6 jars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance was the main reason why I didn&#x27;t like Motions products before, but this is clearly an updated version.  </li>
            <li>Holds decent enough for me and actually did better controlling my fly-away cowlicks than some other pomades I use.  </li>
            <li>I especially like to use it to make a ponytail a little neater and more polished.  </li>
            <li>have used this new Pomade on my long hair to acheive the new runway look of  wet, slicked back sides to then form a low on the back wrapped ponytail, but I had to use a good amount.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell, but that is far from enough to validate the using of this product in my hair.</li>
            <li>B004IT03QA FX Wild Harvest Hair Molding Wax, Beeswax, Flexible Hold, 2 oz.]].  </li>
            <li>Also, it has no heavy scent to clash with my perfume.</li>
            <li>It is so shiny and lush whenever I use this product.</li>
            <li>Have an age old friend who is \\&quot;all about the hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I only gave it a 4 star review because it can give a greasy look if you use too much.</li>
            <li>I think you still need to use a styling product on top of this, but don&#x27;t waste your money unless you only want the shimmer.</li>
            <li>At first I was kind of skeptical because the pomade its self has a yellow shimmery color which I thought would be visible once applied to my hair</li>
            <li>This actually has worked well, however, in the areas where my hair is thinner; and still does a decent job in the fuller areas as well.</li>
            <li>The main reason why I&#x27;ve stuck with the product is simply the price.</li>
            <li>There is a slight coconut scent to this whipped oil product that some might find mildly offensive but if you are already using the Nexxus Shampoo &amp; Conditioners, this scent will not clash with those products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have very heavy hair that needs better hold,  try the hair wax I mentioned above.  </li>
            <li>For night time, it&#x27;s nice to slick back my long hair and then tie it all into an intricate not at the nape of my neck.  </li>
            <li>I liked that the pomade didn&#x27;t leave his hair feeling hard or looking wet.</li>
            <li>Pomade means something very specific and this forumla is much lighter than traditional Pomades even though it performs well for some people.  </li>
            <li>The thing is, I think folks look to a Pomade to CONTROL movement, not merely to slick back their hair.  </li>
            <li>have used this as a twist wrap  conditioner on children with layered hair and no other conditioner applied.  </li>
            <li>Well, not sure this is the right pomade for me with short straight hair</li>
            <li>You take two  hunks of hair, wet them lightly with the Pomade, twist them around each other and then roll them up in rag curlers over night with a sleep cap.  </li>
            <li>I generally use wax or gel to spike his hair.</li>
            <li>These Motions products are, I think, developed for people with a very different hair type than mine.</li>
            <li>but I always fall back on old fashion pomade.  </li>
            <li>I guess its back to the old fashion stuff.  </li>
            <li>This pomade has a nice feel, (not so greasy), and it controls my hair which is particularly difficult at times.</li>
            <li>It also says NEW LOOK NEW FRAGRANCE on it, so I may have gotten something that some of the other reviewers did not.  </li>
            <li>I have short, straight, dry hair.  </li>
            <li>it around tip of finger first and then wraps 1 inch sections around the wavy bottom half of my hair</li>
            <li>Took me about a month and a half to get through the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve moved away from the gels of my youth and have pretty much used pastes in my hair since my late teen years.  </li>
            <li>It is really important to use a VERY VERY small amount.</li>
            <li>When I wash my hair it wants to fluff everywhere and the pomade puts it back in control.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These were the only two products that did not tangle my hair and left it feeling soft and somewhat moisturized.</li>
            <li>It has a little bit of a shimmer and it looked cute on his blonde hair (not like glitter just a little extra shine).</li>
            <li>I am growing out my hair for the first time, and needed to tame it without the \\&quot;gel\\</li>

            <li> It does keep more of a wet look, but isn&#x27;t all that great for separating hair for a messy/textured look.  </li>
            <li> It would probably be the only pomade I&#x27;d buy, but I&#x27;m now trying out \\&quot;wax\\&quot; which I&#x27;m having great results with as well.</li>
            <li> Overall great product for ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s texture is light</li>
            <li> I chose to rate Motions Shine Enhancing Pomade 4 stars because it works well applied lightly.</li>
            <li> I found that it is light.  </li>
            <li> The shimmer is light and doesn&#x27;t look glossy or tacky.  </li>
            <li> This claims to sport a grease free shine, but I bet to differ.  </li>
            <li> It does nothing to smooth the hair at the edges of your hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also worth noting is that the top 3 ingredients are water, laneth -15, and mineral oil</li>
            <li> but fortunately it does fade away</li>
            <li> So when I noticed that this product was available to try out decided to take a chance.  </li>
            <li> As long as you know HOW to use a pomade, it&#x27;ll work great for you.  </li>
            <li> This wonderful pomade gives my hair just the right amount of control with no stiffness and adds a beautiful, natural sheen, making my long (many years old) hair look fresh and young again.</li>
            <li> (someone mentioned Pina Colada, and I can smell that, but it is almost more intense than that).  </li>
            <li> The smell is good, and it holds for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> Its more like a hair gel than a real pomade.  </li>
            <li> I read some complaints that it is too thin, but the consistency is perfect for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried that the smell would linger around all day, but it seems to go away fairly quickly once you get it in your hair.</li>
            <li> - I have used other African-American hair products and have had a pleasant experience with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it simply doesn&#x27;t have a nice fragrance to it like the AC product.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a nice line between quality and cost...</li>
            <li> B001T8MN16 Motions Salon Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil, 8 Ounce]] but not as many.  </li>
            <li> I will be having fun with the Pomade for those kinds of hair stylings.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that this Motions At Home Shine enhancing Pomade does what it says which is Lightweight, non-greasy formula which gives you extra control for more precise styling.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future.</li>
            <li> &quot; gets it right</li>
            <li> Plus the price is right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a pomade product, but because I have fine hair prone to fly-aways</li>
            <li> fragrance is very pleasant and this is one of the few hair products I&#x27;ve encountered which actually helps me to look</li>
            <li> Overall, I prefer using the Suave matte finish to this, which is a bit easier to apply and seemed to keep your hair looking more consistent throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to go back in a timecapsule to the 1980s to feel comfortable wearing that kinda feirce style all day!  </li>
            <li> It is a lighter yellow/beige color and the top is the same color.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s the shine that turned them off as I&#x27;m pretty sure they never cracked open the lid.  </li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of pomade.  </li>
            <li> For that, there are many other products available right down to the old-fashioned [[ASIN:B000GG16QA Brylcreem Hair Cream Original - 5.5 Oz.]] or the slightly more modern [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> As a guy, I never expected to be interested in trying to style my hair with pomade and the like, but allowing myself to become long-haired and still with a fairly full though thinning head of hair, I&#x27;ve found this product to be quite useful.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a decent though more pricey alternative to styling gel.</li>
            <li> Smell  Not as strong at holding hair in place as some other pomades      Details:  Quick background on my use of pomade.</li>
            <li> I only wished that Motions&#x27; other products worked as successfully as these two did.</li>
            <li> , I like the product, the price is right and it works for my hair type and super short \\&quot;boy\\&quot; cut.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this holds your hair in place very well throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t say much about it myself.</li>
            <li> She highly recommends it and is a committed user of the product!</li>
            <li> It is not thin or runny.  </li>
            <li> We really favor pomade in our household because it works well for both genders.</li>
            <li> I can use it to sculpt and flatten my hair, my wife uses it for anti-frizz and gentle shine.</li>
            <li> This pomade is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Make sure your hair is still slightly damp, work the pomade really well in your hands, then apply and work it through.  </li>
            <li> Various pomades have different consistencies - this one is more gel-like and somewhat runny, yet very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t figure out how \\&quot;I would know\\&quot;, she has subsequently utilized more in the product line and is looking better than ever---at least hair-wise (jab)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product to be a good alternative for my husband&#x27;s naturally curly \\&quot;caucasian\\&quot; hair that is cut short but left a little longer on the top so his natural curls can form into whirls instead of spikes.  </li>
            <li> Also, it has a sweet smell that an older teen may not like.</li>
            <li> but I did think it performed decently and at $17 a decent price so 4-stars from me based upon price/value.</li>
            <li> The product does provide decent hold though I find gel to be a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> It is mainly a shine enhancer, not a fixative</li>
            <li> can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It has a decent enough hold, but the firmness of the hold loosens very quickly and it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll stick with my normal Paul Mitchel Teatree pomade (plus</li>
            <li> Shiny, stinky and not what I&#x27;d normally use.</li>
            <li> highly recommend trying this pomade first with just one jar before ordering a pack of 6 from Amazon and later discovering you may not like it and your stuck with 6 jars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance was the main reason why I didn&#x27;t like Motions products before, but this is clearly an updated version.  </li>
            <li> Holds decent enough for me and actually did better controlling my fly-away cowlicks than some other pomades I use.  </li>
            <li> I especially like to use it to make a ponytail a little neater and more polished.  </li>
            <li> have used this new Pomade on my long hair to acheive the new runway look of  wet, slicked back sides to then form a low on the back wrapped ponytail, but I had to use a good amount.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell, but that is far from enough to validate the using of this product in my hair.</li>

            <li> Also, it has no heavy scent to clash with my perfume.</li>
            <li> It is so shiny and lush whenever I use this product.</li>
            <li> Have an age old friend who is \\&quot;all about the hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I only gave it a 4 star review because it can give a greasy look if you use too much.</li>
            <li> I think you still need to use a styling product on top of this, but don&#x27;t waste your money unless you only want the shimmer.</li>
            <li> At first I was kind of skeptical because the pomade its self has a yellow shimmery color which I thought would be visible once applied to my hair</li>
            <li> This actually has worked well, however, in the areas where my hair is thinner; and still does a decent job in the fuller areas as well.</li>
            <li> The main reason why I&#x27;ve stuck with the product is simply the price.</li>
            <li> There is a slight coconut scent to this whipped oil product that some might find mildly offensive but if you are already using the Nexxus Shampoo &amp; Conditioners, this scent will not clash with those products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have very heavy hair that needs better hold,  try the hair wax I mentioned above.  </li>
            <li> For night time, it&#x27;s nice to slick back my long hair and then tie it all into an intricate not at the nape of my neck.  </li>
            <li> I liked that the pomade didn&#x27;t leave his hair feeling hard or looking wet.</li>
            <li> Pomade means something very specific and this forumla is much lighter than traditional Pomades even though it performs well for some people.  </li>
            <li> The thing is, I think folks look to a Pomade to CONTROL movement, not merely to slick back their hair.  </li>
            <li> have used this as a twist wrap  conditioner on children with layered hair and no other conditioner applied.  </li>
            <li> Well, not sure this is the right pomade for me with short straight hair</li>
            <li> You take two  hunks of hair, wet them lightly with the Pomade, twist them around each other and then roll them up in rag curlers over night with a sleep cap.  </li>
            <li> I generally use wax or gel to spike his hair.</li>
            <li> These Motions products are, I think, developed for people with a very different hair type than mine.</li>
            <li> but I always fall back on old fashion pomade.  </li>
            <li> I guess its back to the old fashion stuff.  </li>
            <li> This pomade has a nice feel, (not so greasy), and it controls my hair which is particularly difficult at times.</li>
            <li> It also says NEW LOOK NEW FRAGRANCE on it, so I may have gotten something that some of the other reviewers did not.  </li>
            <li> I have short, straight, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> it around tip of finger first and then wraps 1 inch sections around the wavy bottom half of my hair</li>
            <li> Took me about a month and a half to get through the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve moved away from the gels of my youth and have pretty much used pastes in my hair since my late teen years.  </li>
            <li> It is really important to use a VERY VERY small amount.</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair it wants to fluff everywhere and the pomade puts it back in control.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These were the only two products that did not tangle my hair and left it feeling soft and somewhat moisturized.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a shimmer and it looked cute on his blonde hair (not like glitter just a little extra shine).</li>
            <li> I am growing out my hair for the first time, and needed to tame it without the \\&quot;gel\\</li>
            <li> 1 - A am a white woman with blonde thick super short</li>
            <li> He needs a little control on the sides where it is shorter but still wants to stick out since his waves don&#x27;t want to lay flat.  </li>
            <li> You also do not want to use a lot if flat ironing, and straighening your hair or a hot curler use  very little or it will burn your scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little wet at first, I would prefer it a bit dryer, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> Next day, you take them down and have well defined ringlets in a natural style.  </li>
            <li> I use this when I straighten ,hotcurl, flat iron</li>
            <li> Actually wasn&#x27;t too bad, kind of a runny pomade</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for girls mom, for long hair, whatever excuses they could come up</li>
            <li> I applied to my long bangs and the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Pomade is a pretty basic product and its pretty hard to get it wrong.</li>
            <li> With that being said, the reviews on these other Motions products I ordered will probably be the same.</li>
            <li> The main difference that I can see at least for my curly/wavy hair is that this product does not cause the flaking that gel often causes at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> but I only used a little.  </li>
            <li> I was a surprised with all of the negative reviews about this.  </li>
            <li> The only downside was the cost, but I decided it was one of the few items I would splurge on.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later (today) I put some in my hair.</li>
            <li> In this case, regardless of the hair it&#x27;s designed for, it&#x27;s just a very runny and thin product; not something I would consider a pomade.</li>
            <li> Being African American and rocking a natural hair style it can be difficult to find hair products that work.  </li>
            <li> Does give a shine, but does not really do anything for hair control on my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very wet and loose.  </li>
            <li> I was in school and thought it was due to stress.</li>
            <li> Perhaps when purchasing other pomades you&#x27;re paying for brand loyalty, but given that this comes in a pack of 6</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bed Head in the past and will go back to that product.</li>
            <li> Never satisfied with the way it looks , I obtained several Motions At Home products for her.</li>
            <li> The Motions at Home Shine Enhancing Pomade is similar to gel based products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Other than that forget about it.</li>
            <li> I use a few different hair products to tame my mop</li>
            <li> The issue I have with Motions is that this is not a great pomade but far closer to a gel than anything else.  </li>
            <li> The Motions at Home pomade costs around 70% less than what I was paying.</li>
            <li> It does leave a slightly greasy feeling as well.  </li>
            <li> It does help slightly with frizz control.  </li>
            <li> Over the last few years as my hair has started to thin out a bit I often found it would &#x27;clump up&#x27; some of the hair in the thinner spots (due to firm consistency of the product).</li>
            <li> Use a little so that it does not make your hair greasey .</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as firm as AC...</li>
            <li> Within a few hours my hairline became inflamed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Altough it has few ingredients, I would have preferred Motions company not to use Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzyl Benzoate and replace mineral oil with olive or coconut oil.</li>
            <li> my Paul Mitchel is one of few pomades that I&#x27;ve found don&#x27;t irritate my forehead skin over time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it a few times</li>
            <li> I have a very slight cowlick in my bangs and have been unsuccessful at managing it with this product.  </li>
            <li> Pomades usually have wax in them and this does have some liquid Parrafin wax whipped into a blend of hdrogenated mineral oil as well as a few of the botanical extracts we find in the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but since it&#x27;s whipped oil, it does slick my heavy hair well and still leave some movement.  </li>
            <li> if you aren&#x27;t Black or Multi-racial, you may not know what I mean by that</li>
            <li> For the past 8 years or so I&#x27;ve been using pomade.</li>
            <li> Pomade is one of those products, however, that when bought in individual tubs at the grocery store or salon can be quite expensive.</li>
            <li> I just think it&#x27;s been saddled with false expectations due to the name.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a whipped hair gel or whipped hair oil Humectant, not a Pomade.s been saddled with false expectations due to the name.  </li>
            <li> This helps keep my hair tamed without making it hard to greasy.</li>
            <li> I was totally disappointed that an entire line of hair products missed the mark.</li>
            <li> Works well for hair with some thin spots    </li>
            <li> The fragrance wasn&#x27;t heavy or unpleasant to me and it dissipates over time.  </li>
            <li> Maybe for crazy hair day or ???</li>
            <li> : It stinks and doesn&#x27;t work as well as I could have hoped.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best deal for pomade and works well in my hair.    I like the consistency of the pomade and holds my hair just the way I wante it. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. It would probably be the only pomade I&#x27;d buy, but I&#x27;m now trying out \\&quot;wax\\&quot; which I&#x27;m having great results with as well.</li>
            <li> Summary:  While it&#x27;s not the best overall pomade on the market, its low cost makes it the best choice for me.    Pros:  Low Cost  Works well for hair with some thin spots    Cons:  Smell  Not as strong at holding hair in place as some other pomades      Details:  Quick background on my use of pomade. For the past 8 years or so I&#x27;ve been using pomade. For the first 6 years I used a well known brand, American Crew (AC), that did an excellent job at making my hair look good (relatively) and had a wonderful fragrance. The only downside was the cost, but I decided it was one of the few items I would splurge on. Over the last few years as my hair has started to thin out a bit I often found it would &#x27;clump up&#x27; some of the hair in the thinner spots (due to firm consistency of the product). I finally decided to try a lower cost alternative since I couldn&#x27;t justify spending a hundred bucks a year on hair products anyway.    After using Motions At Home Pomade for almost two years now, here is my take on it. It isn&#x27;t as firm as AC...it is more &#x27;liquidy&#x27;. This actually has worked well, however, in the areas where my hair is thinner; and still does a decent job in the fuller areas as well. My biggest gripe about the product is the smell. It has a &#x27;chemical&#x27; smell to it. It doesn&#x27;t make me nauseous or anything...it simply doesn&#x27;t have a nice fragrance to it like the AC product. I was a bit worried that the smell would linger around all day, but it seems to go away fairly quickly once you get it in your hair. The main reason why I&#x27;ve stuck with the product is simply the price. The Motions at Home pomade costs around 70% less than what I was paying. Overall it&#x27;s a nice line between quality and cost...which I&#x27;m all about.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair!  The smell isn&#x27;t great but the function is!</li>
            <li> I had been trying to find this in stores and was having no luck. This pomade gives instant shine and definition. It seals in moisture and protects hair when heat styling.</li>
            <li> This pomade has a nice feel, (not so greasy), and it controls my hair which is particularly difficult at times. When I wash my hair it wants to fluff everywhere and the pomade puts it back in control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is very pleasant and this is one of the few hair products I&#x27;ve encountered which actually helps me to look well-groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this when I straighten ,hotcurl, flat iron and  before I blowdring hair. Great for getting that kitchen and the esges of your hair. If use often you will see a change of more manageable here. Use a little so that it does not make your hair greasey . You also do not want to use a lot if flat ironing, and straighening your hair or a hot curler use  very little or it will burn your scalp. Overall great product for ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> I have this on regular shipment. Very good product especially for kids! Slicks the hair very nicely although not for an all day hold.</li>
            <li> It works well for my hair type but it broke me out in hives.I have red patches all over my hairline.I have psoriasis but haven&#x27;t had an outbreak in over a year.I was in school and thought it was due to stress.I put this on my hair for a couple of days and I had one of the worst outbreaks of my life.My face, neck, and hairline were covered in red patches.At the time I didn&#x27;t link it to the product.A few weeks later (today) I put some in my hair.Within a few hours my hairline became inflamed.I washed my hair,threw away the product, and am feeling slightly better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a pomade product, but because I have fine hair prone to fly-aways I used this product for just that. The Motions Pomade flattened fly-aways and made my hair extra shiny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this holds your hair in place very well throughout the day.  Various pomades have different consistencies - this one is more gel-like and somewhat runny, yet very lightweight.  It does keep more of a wet look, but isn&#x27;t all that great for separating hair for a messy/textured look.  Overall, I prefer using the Suave matte finish to this, which is a bit easier to apply and seemed to keep your hair looking more consistent throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Daverat&#x27;s Wife Speaking (please forgive typos, I have arthritis) This is one of the few Motions products that really CAN work for \\&quot;Caucasian\\&quot; hair as well as Ethnic hair but in lightening up on the heaviness of the product, they lost some of the strong hold and control that most \\&quot;Ethnic\\&quot; haired men and women look for in a Pomade.  Pomades usually have wax in them and this does have some liquid Parrafin wax whipped into a blend of hdrogenated mineral oil as well as a few of the botanical extracts we find in the [[ASIN:B001T8MN16 Motions Salon Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil, 8 Ounce]] but not as many.  There is a slight coconut scent to this whipped oil product that some might find mildly offensive but if you are already using the Nexxus Shampoo &amp; Conditioners, this scent will not clash with those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product to be a good alternative for my husband&#x27;s naturally curly \\&quot;caucasian\\&quot; hair that is cut short but left a little longer on the top so his natural curls can form into whirls instead of spikes.  He needs a little control on the sides where it is shorter but still wants to stick out since his waves don&#x27;t want to lay flat.  This does the trick but not as good as hair wax, which holds his hair all day.  The wax he uses and likes the best is called [[ASIN:B004IT03QA FX Wild Harvest Hair Molding Wax, Beeswax, Flexible Hold, 2 oz.]].  They make a Pomade but we haven&#x27;t tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this new Pomade on my long hair to acheive the new runway look of  wet, slicked back sides to then form a low on the back wrapped ponytail, but I had to use a good amount.  I liked the look very much for an evening party but would never wear it that way all day. I&#x27;d have to go back in a timecapsule to the 1980s to feel comfortable wearing that kinda feirce style all day!  For night time, it&#x27;s nice to slick back my long hair and then tie it all into an intricate not at the nape of my neck.  I will be having fun with the Pomade for those kinds of hair stylings.  It&#x27;s texture is light but since it&#x27;s whipped oil, it does slick my heavy hair well and still leave some movement.  The thing is, I think folks look to a Pomade to CONTROL movement, not merely to slick back their hair.  For that, there are many other products available right down to the old-fashioned [[ASIN:B000GG16QA Brylcreem Hair Cream Original - 5.5 Oz.]] or the slightly more modern [[ASIN:B000052Y31 Alberto VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing, Normal/Dry Hair, 1.5 oz (42.5 g)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this as a twist wrap  conditioner on children with layered hair and no other conditioner applied.  You take two  hunks of hair, wet them lightly with the Pomade, twist them around each other and then roll them up in rag curlers over night with a sleep cap.  Next day, you take them down and have well defined ringlets in a natural style.  if you aren&#x27;t Black or Multi-racial, you may not know what I mean by that but it&#x27;s a protective hairstyle you can use instead of braids and it looks nice.  Still, there are better Twists wraps out there including one by Motions: [[ASIN:B007TKFXHO Motions Foaming Wrap Lotion, 1.7 oz.]].  So it seems this product is falling in between several needs.  It works for a lot of things which is nice but doesn&#x27;t do any one of them as well as a \\&quot;dedicated to that need\\&quot; product would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Pomade a lot, but wish they would call it a Humectant rather than Pomade.  Pomade means something very specific and this forumla is much lighter than traditional Pomades even though it performs well for some people.  If you have very heavy hair that needs better hold,  try the hair wax I mentioned above.  You can apply that in the palms of your hands, work it in well and style.  it has good hold and to re-activate it for restyling, a spritz of water is all that you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product and I&#x27;m sure we will use it up and even buy some for light control of my husband&#x27;s curly hair.  I just think it&#x27;s been saddled with false expectations due to the name.  It&#x27;s a whipped hair gel or whipped hair oil Humectant, not a Pomade.s been saddled with false expectations due to the name.  It&#x27;s a whipped hair gel or whipped hair oil Humectant, not a Pomade.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this product and ranted and raved about it after every use. She used it on my daughter as well and saved the jar so she could be reminded about buying more of it. I am a balding man so I couldn&#x27;t say much about it myself. She highly recommends it and is a committed user of the product!</li>
            <li> As a guy, I never expected to be interested in trying to style my hair with pomade and the like, but allowing myself to become long-haired and still with a fairly full though thinning head of hair, I&#x27;ve found this product to be quite useful.</li>
            <li> I chose to rate Motions Shine Enhancing Pomade 4 stars because it works well applied lightly. I emulsify (warm) it around tip of finger first and then wraps 1 inch sections around the wavy bottom half of my hair and it creates more defined waves. I do not care for the smell, would prefer something like Redkin Anti-snap or an apple/grape scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this pomade first with just one jar before ordering a pack of 6 from Amazon and later discovering you may not like it and your stuck with 6 jars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altough it has few ingredients, I would have preferred Motions company not to use Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzyl Benzoate and replace mineral oil with olive or coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This wonderful pomade gives my hair just the right amount of control with no stiffness and adds a beautiful, natural sheen, making my long (many years old) hair look fresh and young again. Also, it has no heavy scent to clash with my perfume.</li>
            <li> My grandchild used this and the comment was \\&quot;it&#x27;s fine\\&quot; and nothing further.  I have not used this since it is an ethnic haircare product and not something I would use.</li>
            <li> It only takes a pea-sized bead of this product to give hair lift, volume, and shine. My hair is medium-short, and this helps give lift, especially inbetween haircuts. It has a nice feel and gives a great shine. And, best of all, doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily so that I know I have to plan to wash it the next day. All in all I have been VERY pleased with this whole product line.</li>
            <li> I like this pomade.  I found that it is light.  The fragrance wasn&#x27;t heavy or unpleasant to me and it dissipates over time.  The fragrance was the main reason why I didn&#x27;t like Motions products before, but this is clearly an updated version.  The container that I got wasn&#x27;t the one shown.  It is a lighter yellow/beige color and the top is the same color.  It is labeled Motions Salon Haircare instead of Motions At Home.  It also says NEW LOOK NEW FRAGRANCE on it, so I may have gotten something that some of the other reviewers did not.  It is not thin or runny.  The texture reminds me of vaseline, but it isn&#x27;t greasy.  I have used it several times and I have had no problems with it.  I especially like to use it to make a ponytail a little neater and more polished.  The shimmer is light and doesn&#x27;t look glossy or tacky.  I was a surprised with all of the negative reviews about this.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve moved away from the gels of my youth and have pretty much used pastes in my hair since my late teen years.  I&#x27;m always looking for a strong hold and one that I can continue to style through the day.  The issue I have with Motions is that this is not a great pomade but far closer to a gel than anything else.  It is very wet and loose.  It has a decent enough hold, but the firmness of the hold loosens very quickly and it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.  It also has a somewhat oily texture, which I was not a fan of.  It bleeds into the feeling my hair possesses after using this product.  This claims to sport a grease free shine, but I bet to differ.  As a plus, it smells like alcohol (someone mentioned Pina Colada, and I can smell that, but it is almost more intense than that).  I really like the smell, but that is far from enough to validate the using of this product in my hair.</li>
            <li> Well, not sure this is the right pomade for me with short straight hair but I figured what the hey I&#x27;ll give it a try.  Actually wasn&#x27;t too bad, kind of a runny pomade but I only used a little.  Holds decent enough for me and actually did better controlling my fly-away cowlicks than some other pomades I use.  But, makes my hair look a bit too greasy for my tastes so I&#x27;ll stick with my normal Paul Mitchel Teatree pomade (plus my Paul Mitchel is one of few pomades that I&#x27;ve found don&#x27;t irritate my forehead skin over time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will not add this Motions Pomade to my regular stable of hair products but I did think it performed decently and at $17 a decent price so 4-stars from me based upon price/value.</li>
            <li> These Motions products are, I think, developed for people with a very different hair type than mine. In this case, regardless of the hair it&#x27;s designed for, it&#x27;s just a very runny and thin product; not something I would consider a pomade. Your mileage may vary, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> My menfolk use more hair product that the women around here.  They&#x27;re always using gel or mousse or whatever they can get their hands on, even my hair spray but they turned up their noses at even trying this pomade.  It&#x27;s for girls mom, for long hair, whatever excuses they could come up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BTW this is a product for anyone.... anyone who can stand the smell.  Perhaps it&#x27;s the shine that turned them off as I&#x27;m pretty sure they never cracked open the lid.  If they did I&#x27;d have had even more complaints.  The exotic Samba scent resembles plastic burning in the bottom of a dishwasher combined with coconutty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for the sake of punishment.  The smell was obnoxious and my stomach rolled pretty good a couple of times but held it all together.  I applied to my long bangs and the ends of my hair.  Shiny, stinky and not what I&#x27;d normally use. Maybe for crazy hair day or ??? I totally recommend passing on this product.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this Motions At Home Shine enhancing Pomade does what it says which is Lightweight, non-greasy formula which gives you extra control for more precise styling. Flexible hold formula also allows to re-work any style. Recommended</li>
            <li> We really favor pomade in our household because it works well for both genders. I can use it to sculpt and flatten my hair, my wife uses it for anti-frizz and gentle shine. Pomade is one of those products, however, that when bought in individual tubs at the grocery store or salon can be quite expensive. When comparing this pomade to Garnier, L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Line, Bed Head and others--I find it to be a much better buy. Perhaps when purchasing other pomades you&#x27;re paying for brand loyalty, but given that this comes in a pack of 6 I&#x27;d recommend it over the others. Pomade is a pretty basic product and its pretty hard to get it wrong. \\&quot;Motions\\&quot; gets it right and so they get my vote. I&#x27;d recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I have very full hair and the motions at home shine enhancer worked wonders on my hair. It is so shiny and lush whenever I use this product.</li>
            <li> I have short, straight, dry hair.  This product leaves my hair shiny and manageable all day.  Best pomade I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am biracial (black/white) and have very difficult hair. This helps keep my hair tamed without making it hard to greasy. I definitely would reccommend this to people with hair like mine. I&#x27;ve recently started using it in my daughters hair as well to help hold her curls and keep them from frizzing.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of pomade.  I am growing out my hair for the first time, and needed to tame it without the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little wet at first, I would prefer it a bit dryer, if that makes sense.  The smell is good, and it holds for the entire day.  Much better than using gel, and it lasts a while.  I am on tub number two, and i use it every day.  Took me about a month and a half to get through the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good pomade for the price</li>
            <li> Motions At Home Shine Enhancing Pomade smooths my hair without making it look greasy.  It also delivers the shine it promises.  However, the &amp;#34;sculpting&amp;#34; effect doesn&#x27;t last the entire day...maybe an hour or two.  I have a very slight cowlick in my bangs and have been unsuccessful at managing it with this product.  I&#x27;ve used Bed Head in the past and will go back to that product.</li>
            <li> PROS: It does give a bit of shine and some manageability. It soothes split ends and frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: It stinks and doesn&#x27;t work as well as I could have hoped. The shine is not the best I&#x27;ve ever seen. Just about any product can produce this kind of shine. It does nothing to smooth the hair at the edges of your hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 STARS: This may work for some, but I don&#x27;t recommend it. There are better options out there.</li>
            <li> Have an age old friend who is \\&quot;all about the hair\\&quot;. Never satisfied with the way it looks , I obtained several Motions At Home products for her. Mostly I obtained these as a practical joke , presenting her with a dozen or so products at one time.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out she is ecstatic with the results! Couldn&#x27;t figure out how \\&quot;I would know\\&quot;, she has subsequently utilized more in the product line and is looking better than ever---at least hair-wise (jab)</li>
            <li> The Motions at Home Shine Enhancing Pomade is similar to gel based products I have used in the past. The main difference that I can see at least for my curly/wavy hair is that this product does not cause the flaking that gel often causes at the end of the day.  Also worth noting is that the top 3 ingredients are water, laneth -15, and mineral oil so it does nourish the hair rather than simply allow for styling.  The product does provide decent hold though I find gel to be a bit stronger. The fragrance is a bit like coconut but fortunately it does fade away so it is not too strong.  Overall this is a decent though more pricey alternative to styling gel.</li>
            <li> Being African American and rocking a natural hair style it can be difficult to find hair products that work.  This one does.  It keeps hair moist, doesn&#x27;t add to breakage, smells good and adds shine.  Plus the price is right.</li>
            <li> I ordered several projects from the Motions hair line. Prior to the last order, I ordered their curl butter and another product and was totally dissatisfied. With that being said, the reviews on these other Motions products I ordered will probably be the same. I was totally disappointed that an entire line of hair products missed the mark. I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future. Not only did they do what they said they&#x27;d do, after the 1st hour or so, but the residue and build up in my hair, caused me to have to cut sections of my hair to get the residue and knots out of my hair. Out of the 9 products I tried there were only two that did anything for me and that was moisturizing cleanser and the deep conditioning hair masque. These were the only two products that did not tangle my hair and left it feeling soft and somewhat moisturized. I can actually run a comb or brush through it without pulling out plugs. I only wished that Motions&#x27; other products worked as successfully as these two did.</li>
            <li> NUMBER 1 - A am a white woman with blonde thick super short hair.&lt;br /&gt;NUMBER 2 - When I agreed to review this product, I knew that the \\&quot;Motions At Home\\&quot; line of hair products are geared toward African-American hair.&lt;br /&gt;NUMBER 3 - I have used other African-American hair products and have had a pleasant experience with them.&lt;br /&gt;NUMBER 4 - This product does what it says!  It is mainly a shine enhancer, not a fixative product.&lt;br /&gt;NUMBER 5 - All in all, I like the product, the price is right and it works for my hair type and super short \\&quot;boy\\&quot; cut.</li>
            <li> This is a very good holding pomade especially for the edges of your hair. I love the smell and the texture is very smooth and glides easily on your hair so there is no need to use a lot.At first I was kind of skeptical because the pomade its self has a yellow shimmery color which I thought would be visible once applied to my hair but thankfully it doesn&#x27;t. This is a good product that I would recommend and continue to use.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3CHEOZPQLZJLM]]I used the Motions At Home Shine Enhancing Pomade on my 1.5 year-old son. This pomade is very inexpensive. If you have a son that uses it every day this seems like a great choice. I generally use wax or gel to spike his hair. I liked that the pomade didn&#x27;t leave his hair feeling hard or looking wet. The pomade made his hair spike perfectly. It has a little bit of a shimmer and it looked cute on his blonde hair (not like glitter just a little extra shine). I only gave it a 4 star review because it can give a greasy look if you use too much. Also, it has a sweet smell that an older teen may not like. It is really important to use a VERY VERY small amount. I read some complaints that it is too thin, but the consistency is perfect for fine hair. The consistency is somewhere in between a gel and a wax. I have included a video so that you can see it put to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of pomades.  They give a strong hold without flaking or getting crusty.  As long as you know HOW to use a pomade, it&#x27;ll work great for you.  Make sure your hair is still slightly damp, work the pomade really well in your hands, then apply and work it through.  This will get it evenly through your hair and keep the hold longer.  Some people just glob it on and that&#x27;s going to leave chunks hanging in places like Cameron Diaz in &#x27;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the smell, look, and usability is great with this pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Does give a shine, but does not really do anything for hair control on my curly hair.  It does leave a slightly greasy feeling as well.  It does help slightly with frizz control.  I think you still need to use a styling product on top of this, but don&#x27;t waste your money unless you only want the shimmer.</li>
            <li> Motions At Home Shine Enhancing Pomade is a pomade made for those who don&#x27;t like pomade.  I use a few different hair products to tame my mop but I always fall back on old fashion pomade.  So when I noticed that this product was available to try out decided to take a chance.  I used it a few times and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  Its more like a hair gel than a real pomade.  The Motions At Home version is not workable, it stiffens up a bit and it doesn&#x27;t smell like pomade either.  I guess its back to the old fashion stuff.  If you are into hair gels and want something that looks like pomade but isn&#x27;t then you&#x27;ll want to try this stuff.  Other than that forget about it.</li>
