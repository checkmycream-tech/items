            <li>Great reasonable priced product for curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was softer, the curls were more prominent and it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair</li>
            <li>The product did however help better define my curls</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My wife has tried numerous products over time and somehow this works out to be the best.</li>
            <li>As of now, one thing for sure is that we are going to keep subscribing to this product here on Amazon till she finds something else.    </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t moisturize, soften or make my hair any more manageable.  </li>
            <li>This has been my all time favorite curl cream since I discovered it.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>My lady and I love this stuff :)</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love this product &amp; will use it indefinitely.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>love the smell.</li>
            <li>When I get out I brush and leave in about a quarter sized amount of my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>this feels good, leaves my hair soft and smells good too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, humidity tends to frizz it out in a most unattractive fashion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light and doesn&#x27;t leave residue on your head (</li>
            <li>but I love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to specify that it is chemo damage because this is a special kind of damage not color/perm/heat or chemical damage.</li>
            <li>Made my curls very soft and everyone told me my curls looked great</li>
            <li>So glad this is available.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on other reviews I found when I bought the EverCurl cleansing conditioner (which I am very happy with) and found it lacking.  </li>
            <li>i love this leave in cream, it defines my curls and leaves them soft and smelling really good.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and helps tame some of the frizziness but needs to be paired with another product with more hold and control.</li>
            <li>Leave hair silky and smooth</li>
            <li>stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It encourages my naturally curly hair to curl without frizz and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair that soft and doesn&#x27;t work good as a detangler.</li>
            <li>It really does wonders for your hair without making it feel greasy or oily!!!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>The Tresemme was the first product I actually like - it was light, provided great control and light moisturizing.</li>
            <li>When I took them out my curls were nice an soft.</li>
            <li>Works surprisingly well on natural hair!&lt;br /&gt;Feels soft during application, keeps hair soft.all day. :)</li>
            <li>excellent, it brought my hair back to life, I was starting to go bald.</li>
            <li>Works okay not crazy about the smell very plasticky.  </li>
            <li>By nature, curly hair is typically dry (drier than most anyway) and for the most part unmanageable.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff for naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li>but overall it has a nice smell to it</li>
            <li>This is nice because it holds shape well, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and is easily brushed out.</li>
            <li>I am reviewing right now the shipping and the product itself.</li>
            <li>Either way not the right product for me.  </li>
            <li>Works great on certain hair textures that are not super curly.</li>
            <li>This product really helps my curly hair to be fluffy, without being fly away or out of control.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my fine curly hair soft and in control.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used EverCurl</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive but works really well!</li>
            <li>With the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;, i was only able to &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; my hair, and still needed to condition the beejeebers out of it.</li>
            <li>Although I really don&#x27;t know why some people wish to!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a user of quite a number of non-sulphate hair products, and I&#x27;ve used many different leave-in creams.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>First leave-in I have tried.</li>
            <li>I use a dime size amount on my own hair and it was just enough to give me soft ends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve traipsed through the higher end of hair products for my curly hair (Bumble &amp; Bumble, Moroccan Hair Oil), and this does just as much for me at about a fifth of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most days I don&#x27;t blow dry since I&#x27;m at the gym, but it works great air dry or blow dry.</li>
            <li>It pretty much stops any frizz, and my curls are very bouncy and weightless.</li>
            <li>When I use EverCurl Hydracharge leave in cream, it makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>I only use it where I have extra frizz and on the ends of my hair and it makes it look super healthy.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped really fast and on time.</li>
            <li>I have days that it works really well</li>
            <li>It does help to keep my hair combed straight when I wear it like that instead of tousled.  </li>
            <li>I have 3C/2B curls that are very prone to frizziness.</li>
            <li>That will save everyone who is using the product this much as well as shipping costs.  </li>
            <li>I tried using it with my hair both wavy/curly and straight</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair still which I really like.</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly, and like others, I&#x27;ve fought it all my life.</li>
            <li>really helps keep my frizzy hair under control.</li>
            <li>It works for my wavy hair and really helps control the frizz</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>my hair is very curly and it keeps my curls though</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally very curlly, like coils of curls.</li>
            <li>I really like the EverCurl products by L&#x27;Oreal and the Hydracharge</li>
            <li>Absolute score.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>too much of a perfume smell</li>
            <li>really like this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fought my curly hair most of my life,  but recently decided to consider my natural curly hair as an asset.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some other leave-in conditioners, but this one I adore--coupled with the L&#x27;Oreal [non-shampoo]cleansing conditioner, my hair has never been better--</li>
            <li>I have long curly hair, fine strands.</li>
            <li>You only need to use a little bit, so one container lasts for a good while.  </li>
            <li>Most of my gift cards were wasted on brands that did not work for her.  </li>
            <li>have rather dry and curly hair that tends to frizzle a lot, specially in humid climate, and since I discovered this cream</li>
            <li>With that in mind I&#x27;ve been looking for the right product to hydrate, fortify and enhance my mop of coarse hair .  </li>
            <li>After playing around with this I finally figured out the right combo.</li>
            <li>This morning when I opened the new subscription shipment it hit us.  </li>
            <li>I use one pump for my hair after a shower (I keep my hair short to better enhance its curls) and use my hands and fingers to run it throughout my damp or wet hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my curls defined and very soft.</li>
            <li>Either way it will give your curls the moisture it needs to stay bouncy and soft!</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this leave-in as I purchased it with the cleansing conditioner from the same line.  </li>
            <li>--I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair down passed my shoulders for the longest time now, but no matter how many different conditioners I tried, the dryness continued--I was feeling like giving up until I decided to try this product, and the other L&#x27;Oreal product that is shampoo-free--the results have been nothing short of wonderful--my hair finally feels like hair again, and not like straw!--I hope and pray I can always purchase those two L&#x27;Oreal products down through the years, so that I can keep my hair looking and feeling as beautiful, and soft and manageable as it has become since I began using them!</li>
            <li>It could not tame my mane.</li>
            <li>hair came back from chemo really soft and curly and these products work very well</li>
            <li>Maybe if I wore it naturally curly</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised by the results.</li>
            <li>Touchable, soft and springy</li>
            <li>She has naturally curly hair that needs a leave in conditioner so that the curls do not turn into a rats nest.</li>
            <li>After using it is now silky soft.</li>
            <li>I used tresemme curl care mousse exclusively for nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly yet can straighten naturally with length or brushing.</li>
            <li>Curls are soft and touchable without that &amp;#34;mousse&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li>Your hair will never be dry again after using the whole line of  EverCurl products.</li>
            <li>another reviewer was referring to - unless they are using too much) and I am now able to CONTROL my locks as opposed to merely guiding them, If I so wish, I can dry my hair to perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>I yet have to find a product that keeps my hair down, like it is right out the shower.</li>
            <li>It barely lasts for one month.</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft like similar products do.</li>
            <li>If you want your hair to look like a celebrity&#x27;s apparently this is the ticket.</li>
            <li>Also, the dry climate in which I live, doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This leave in does leave her hair soft and pretty, but a little goes a long way to achieve that.</li>
            <li>My hair is normal in width and it has low porosity (dry Hair).</li>
            <li>and then i dry the hair with rollers and they look waivy and natural.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair which is naturally dry and can get so frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, fine, thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I used too much one day and by the end of the day her hair was a greasy mess.</li>
            <li>And if I want to coax a certain look or shape, I just wet my finger tips after it&#x27;s dry and touch some water here and there, tug a curl out or tuck it back, and</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Works surprisingly well on natural hair!&lt;br /&gt;Feels soft during application, keeps hair soft.all day. :)</li>
            <li> excellent, it brought my hair back to life, I was starting to go bald.</li>
            <li> Works okay not crazy about the smell very plasticky.  </li>
            <li> By nature, curly hair is typically dry (drier than most anyway) and for the most part unmanageable.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff for naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li> but overall it has a nice smell to it</li>
            <li> This is nice because it holds shape well, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and is easily brushed out.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing right now the shipping and the product itself.</li>
            <li> Either way not the right product for me.  </li>
            <li> Works great on certain hair textures that are not super curly.</li>
            <li> This product really helps my curly hair to be fluffy, without being fly away or out of control.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my fine curly hair soft and in control.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used EverCurl</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive but works really well!</li>
            <li> With the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;, i was only able to &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; my hair, and still needed to condition the beejeebers out of it.</li>
            <li> Although I really don&#x27;t know why some people wish to!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a user of quite a number of non-sulphate hair products, and I&#x27;ve used many different leave-in creams.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> First leave-in I have tried.</li>
            <li> I use a dime size amount on my own hair and it was just enough to give me soft ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve traipsed through the higher end of hair products for my curly hair (Bumble &amp; Bumble, Moroccan Hair Oil), and this does just as much for me at about a fifth of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most days I don&#x27;t blow dry since I&#x27;m at the gym, but it works great air dry or blow dry.</li>
            <li> It pretty much stops any frizz, and my curls are very bouncy and weightless.</li>
            <li> When I use EverCurl Hydracharge leave in cream, it makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I only use it where I have extra frizz and on the ends of my hair and it makes it look super healthy.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped really fast and on time.</li>
            <li> I have days that it works really well</li>
            <li> It does help to keep my hair combed straight when I wear it like that instead of tousled.  </li>
            <li> I have 3C/2B curls that are very prone to frizziness.</li>
            <li> That will save everyone who is using the product this much as well as shipping costs.  </li>
            <li> I tried using it with my hair both wavy/curly and straight</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair still which I really like.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly, and like others, I&#x27;ve fought it all my life.</li>
            <li> really helps keep my frizzy hair under control.</li>
            <li> It works for my wavy hair and really helps control the frizz</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> my hair is very curly and it keeps my curls though</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very curlly, like coils of curls.</li>
            <li> I really like the EverCurl products by L&#x27;Oreal and the Hydracharge</li>
            <li> Absolute score.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> too much of a perfume smell</li>
            <li> really like this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fought my curly hair most of my life,  but recently decided to consider my natural curly hair as an asset.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other leave-in conditioners, but this one I adore--coupled with the L&#x27;Oreal [non-shampoo]cleansing conditioner, my hair has never been better--</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair, fine strands.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit, so one container lasts for a good while.  </li>
            <li> Most of my gift cards were wasted on brands that did not work for her.  </li>
            <li> have rather dry and curly hair that tends to frizzle a lot, specially in humid climate, and since I discovered this cream</li>
            <li> With that in mind I&#x27;ve been looking for the right product to hydrate, fortify and enhance my mop of coarse hair .  </li>
            <li> After playing around with this I finally figured out the right combo.</li>
            <li> This morning when I opened the new subscription shipment it hit us.  </li>
            <li> I use one pump for my hair after a shower (I keep my hair short to better enhance its curls) and use my hands and fingers to run it throughout my damp or wet hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my curls defined and very soft.</li>
            <li> Either way it will give your curls the moisture it needs to stay bouncy and soft!</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this leave-in as I purchased it with the cleansing conditioner from the same line.  </li>
            <li> --I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair down passed my shoulders for the longest time now, but no matter how many different conditioners I tried, the dryness continued--I was feeling like giving up until I decided to try this product, and the other L&#x27;Oreal product that is shampoo-free--the results have been nothing short of wonderful--my hair finally feels like hair again, and not like straw!--I hope and pray I can always purchase those two L&#x27;Oreal products down through the years, so that I can keep my hair looking and feeling as beautiful, and soft and manageable as it has become since I began using them!</li>
            <li> It could not tame my mane.</li>
            <li> hair came back from chemo really soft and curly and these products work very well</li>
            <li> Maybe if I wore it naturally curly</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised by the results.</li>
            <li> Touchable, soft and springy</li>
            <li> She has naturally curly hair that needs a leave in conditioner so that the curls do not turn into a rats nest.</li>
            <li> After using it is now silky soft.</li>
            <li> I used tresemme curl care mousse exclusively for nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly yet can straighten naturally with length or brushing.</li>
            <li> Curls are soft and touchable without that &amp;#34;mousse&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> Your hair will never be dry again after using the whole line of  EverCurl products.</li>
            <li> another reviewer was referring to - unless they are using too much) and I am now able to CONTROL my locks as opposed to merely guiding them, If I so wish, I can dry my hair to perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> I yet have to find a product that keeps my hair down, like it is right out the shower.</li>
            <li> It barely lasts for one month.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft like similar products do.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair to look like a celebrity&#x27;s apparently this is the ticket.</li>
            <li> Also, the dry climate in which I live, doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This leave in does leave her hair soft and pretty, but a little goes a long way to achieve that.</li>
            <li> My hair is normal in width and it has low porosity (dry Hair).</li>
            <li> and then i dry the hair with rollers and they look waivy and natural.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which is naturally dry and can get so frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, fine, thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I used too much one day and by the end of the day her hair was a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> And if I want to coax a certain look or shape, I just wet my finger tips after it&#x27;s dry and touch some water here and there, tug a curl out or tuck it back, and</li>
            <li> But the next day my hair was dry and frizzy again, so I bought another product within the same line; called L&#x27;Oreal Sculpt and hold cream and gel,and after using both in my hair after the shower my hair was not dry and it held in place for almost 3 days.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh it down and it is not stiff.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry and coarse before I found this cream.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of the weather conditions, this cream keeps my hair in the same shape, I just apply it after taking a shower and then blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair other day... and sometimes this product doesn&#x27;t last that well through day two.</li>
            <li> Not a natural smell.</li>
            <li> nearly cut in half!</li>
            <li> Dry hair / long / wavy</li>
            <li> My hair is long (midback) but it poofs up, frizzes, and shrinks a lot (to my chin) when it is dry and curly.</li>
            <li> Try the EverCurl Hydracharge Cleansing Conditioner with it if you have dry, frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> I let it dry over night.</li>
            <li> and it stays when my hair is dry</li>
            <li> I even put it on that spot when my hair is dry to get rid of the frizz.</li>
            <li> If I want curls, I add water and air dry.</li>
            <li> Then I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that if you use too much, at least for me, it may make your hair too soft.</li>
            <li> My hair, being curly, is always very dry, but this cream makes my hair feel silky and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I leaves my curls a little sticky....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is a bad product, but it makes my hair much oilier much faster than when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> Just made my curls a lil harder to maintain</li>
            <li> but I have thick naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the the pump often stops working long before I run out of product</li>
            <li> The only product that can tame my little ones curls.  </li>
            <li> But this L&#x27;Oreal product provides ample moisture w/o a heavy residue (I&#x27;m not sure what &#x27;white residue&#x27;</li>
            <li> and I have to take the top off and dump it in my hand which is really annoying.</li>
            <li> It just tends to soften my hair and keep it from overly frizzing, as well as maybe tamping it down a bit.</li>
            <li> I stopped putting this in my hair everyday due to the buildup.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint!</li>
            <li> I found this product dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li> Seems heavy and doesn&#x27;t help control frizz.</li>
            <li> If you have hair like mine, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I tried a few curl creams at recommendation of a co-worker.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be too heavy for my hair and pull my curls down/out.  </li>
            <li> but they are mostly messy if I don&#x27;t apply a curling cream.</li>
            <li> I like this product, because I usually use mousse in my hair when I want to wear it down curly, but sometimes I don&#x27;t want my hair to be stiff.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair with minimum frizz but never gets stiff.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly and dry hair.</li>
            <li> On the down side...I cannot find it in stores anymore anywhere!!</li>
            <li> I have seen this advertised in magazines for the past couple of months and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t perform the way I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bi-racial (at least).</li>
            <li> I bought this in the store (WLM) as an alternative to my usual &amp;#34;Tresemme Hydra curl&amp;#34; which was out of stock - everywhere!</li>
            <li> the two products together have stopped all the terrible dryness, especially on the ends of my hair, that generally caused me to continually need to trim it all off</li>
            <li> I finally got sick of defined, but crunchy, hair.</li>
            <li> is in my opinion is the one that makes the hair the lightest, softest and cleanest looking, of them all (including other very expensive</li>
            <li> I have very thick, frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li> and others that I&#x27;m not happy with it.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind on my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a predicament, I&#x27;d like to use the expensive stuff just for the value of it...</li>
            <li> It also has a faint coconut smell.    </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t go back to those awful &amp;#34;anti frizz&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this one.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great reasonable priced product for curly/wavy hair.  Try the EverCurl Hydracharge Cleansing Conditioner with it if you have dry, frizzy curls. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It was shipped really fast and on time. I like this product because is 100% vegan, doesn&#x27;t have parabens, sulfates or silicones. I recommend to anyone who is starting lo/no poo. I am reviewing right now the shipping and the product itself. I didn&#x27;t start to use yet, but as soon as I use I&#x27;ll post another review about the effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have unruly curly hair that I have been fighting with for 50 + years.  I have used a lot of different products and I still had to fight with my hair.  This is the first time I have used EverCurl and I was not disappointed.  My hair was softer, the curls were more prominent and it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this to all curly hair sufferers!</li>
            <li> Bottle lasted about a month. I have dry, fine, thick wavy hair. I found this product dried out my hair.  The product did however help better define my curls but it also did add weight to my hair.</li>
            <li> excellent, it brought my hair back to life, I was starting to go bald. I love it</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it and then i dry the hair with rollers and they look waivy and natural.</li>
            <li> Works okay not crazy about the smell very plasticky.  Not a natural smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I wish it came in a larger container!</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive but works really well!</li>
            <li> I love this cream!! I use it on my curls alone or under another product. Either way it will give your curls the moisture it needs to stay bouncy and soft!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff and the aroma is so fresh! Your hair will never be dry again after using the whole line of  EverCurl products.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product.  I have days that it works really well and others that I&#x27;m not happy with it.  It does help to keep my hair combed straight when I wear it like that instead of tousled.  I will finish bottle and then determine if I will repurchase.  I have curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> i love this leave in cream, it defines my curls and leaves them soft and smelling really good. it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind on my hair</li>
            <li> Love it. Gives my hair more curl than frizz!</li>
            <li> It works well to take without removing curls, but does not work as well even on curly hair as their EverSleek Sulfate-Free Smoothing System Humidity Defying Leave-In Creme.</li>
            <li> I have 3C/2B curls that are very prone to frizziness. This is a wonderful product and helps tame some of the frizziness but needs to be paired with another product with more hold and control. However, just like everyone else said, the lid to this thing is the devil. It will not open! I broke the pump before even using it one time because it just wouldnt open. very frustrating. They should re-package this thing cuz the lid/pump is s***.</li>
            <li> It is the best leave in conditioner that I have found! Love it!!!! Would recommend this to anyone for all types of hair!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff for naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I love this product, but for some reason the pump on the bottle is broken!</li>
            <li> another winner.. Thank you</li>
            <li> My wife has tried numerous products over time and somehow this works out to be the best. Most of my gift cards were wasted on brands that did not work for her.  As of now, one thing for sure is that we are going to keep subscribing to this product here on Amazon till she finds something else.    Update 07_28_2015:  This morning when I opened the new subscription shipment it hit us.  Wife orders 2 every month, why does the vendor not provide a bigger size option?  That will save everyone who is using the product this much as well as shipping costs.  My 2 cents.</li>
            <li> This product really helps my curly hair to be fluffy, without being fly away or out of control.  You only need to use a little bit, so one container lasts for a good while.  Now that I have found it, I will use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I have seen this advertised in magazines for the past couple of months and decided to try it. I used it underneath Motions foaming wrap lotion. I used curl formers to set my hair. I let it dry over night. When I took them out my curls were nice an soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other reviews I found when I bought the EverCurl cleansing conditioner (which I am very happy with) and found it lacking.  I don&#x27;t think it is a bad product, but it makes my hair much oilier much faster than when I don&#x27;t use it.  At the same time I don&#x27;t find it improves my styling experience.  Maybe if I wore it naturally curly like I used to it would help maintain the curl.  So, since I would rather not have to start washing my hair daily I won&#x27;t be using this anymore and would not recommend it for those curly tops who blow out their curls.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this one.  I really had high hopes for this leave-in as I purchased it with the cleansing conditioner from the same line.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t perform the way I expected.  It didn&#x27;t moisturize, soften or make my hair any more manageable.  I tried using it with my hair both wavy/curly and straight and I still didn&#x27;t get what the product was supposed to be doing.  Or maybe it just didn&#x27;t do it for me. Either way not the right product for me.  Dry hair / long / wavy /  damaged (chemo)  -  I feel like I have to specify that it is chemo damage because this is a special kind of damage not color/perm/heat or chemical damage.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised by the results. This became my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; product for bouncy curls. Applied to damp hair and finger combed through. I have tried a number of curl products, but this one works. Touchable, soft and springy</li>
            <li> buying on line is convenient&lt;br /&gt;my hair came back from chemo really soft and curly and these products work very well&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone with hair</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. She has naturally curly hair that needs a leave in conditioner so that the curls do not turn into a rats nest. This leave in does leave her hair soft and pretty, but a little goes a long way to achieve that. I used too much one day and by the end of the day her hair was a greasy mess. I use a dime size amount on my own hair and it was just enough to give me soft ends.</li>
            <li> This has been my all time favorite curl cream since I discovered it. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; and is lightweight. On the down side...I cannot find it in stores anymore anywhere!! I need some more!!! What happened??</li>
            <li> This is the best leave-in cream that I have found for my curly hair.  My hair was so dry and coarse before I found this cream.  After using it is now silky soft.</li>
            <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve recently become a CurlyGirl convert and was looking for a cheaper alternative with the same results as DevaCurl and this is it!  I bought another container so I&#x27;d have one at the gym and one at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Still loving it!  I have it delivered every month for Subscribe and Save. Only complaint is the the pump often stops working long before I run out of product and I have to take the top off and dump it in my hand which is really annoying.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product!</li>
            <li> Smoothes &amp; defines curls but will cause oily look if you apply too close to the scalp</li>
            <li> This product works!!! With that being said - it leaves a white residue on the hair that comes off on my brush - Kinda gross. I stopped putting this in my hair everyday due to the buildup.</li>
            <li> as a girl with curly hair I am always looking for good products.  I recently went no shampoo and have been using a cleansing condition by Loreal.  this pairs perfect with it.  It does not leave my hair still which I really like.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the store (WLM) as an alternative to my usual &amp;#34;Tresemme Hydra curl&amp;#34; which was out of stock - everywhere! And I have to say, I&#x27;m quite pleased. My hair is very curly, and like others, I&#x27;ve fought it all my life. The Tresemme was the first product I actually like - it was light, provided great control and light moisturizing. By nature, curly hair is typically dry (drier than most anyway) and for the most part unmanageable. With the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;, i was only able to &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; my hair, and still needed to condition the beejeebers out of it. But this L&#x27;Oreal product provides ample moisture w/o a heavy residue (I&#x27;m not sure what &#x27;white residue&#x27; another reviewer was referring to - unless they are using too much) and I am now able to CONTROL my locks as opposed to merely guiding them, If I so wish, I can dry my hair to perfectly straight. Although I really don&#x27;t know why some people wish to! Anyway, this is a great product (for me) and the price???? You can&#x27;t beat this online/Amazon price - nearly cut in half! And the fragrance is very nice too.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to help control my curling hair. Seems heavy and doesn&#x27;t help control frizz. Will continue to look for another product.</li>
            <li> My lady and I love this stuff :) It really does wonders for your hair without making it feel greasy or oily!!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which is naturally dry and can get so frizzy.  I use this after I use the shampoo and conditioner that L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCurl Hydracharge makes.  Makes my hair soft and more manageable. So glad this is available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a user of quite a number of non-sulphate hair products, and I&#x27;ve used many different leave-in creams.&lt;br /&gt;This is in my opinion is the one that makes the hair the lightest, softest and cleanest looking, of them all (including other very expensive brands)&lt;br /&gt;I have rather dry and curly hair that tends to frizzle a lot, specially in humid climate, and since I discovered this cream I&#x27;m in a predicament, I&#x27;d like to use the expensive stuff just for the value of it... but this Hydracharge is so good I keep resisting the idea.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It is great for curly hair. Keeps my hair moist and protected without a greasy feeling or hardening of my hair. I just wish the bottle was bigger. It barely lasts for one month.</li>
            <li> Ok so this product is incredible. Gives you great shine and softness. The only problem is that if you use too much, at least for me, it may make your hair too soft. If that makes sense. I have natural 3c hair and just using about a dime size is perfect. Doesn&#x27;t over condition my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice product and shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other leave-in conditioners, but this one I adore--coupled with the L&#x27;Oreal [non-shampoo]cleansing conditioner, my hair has never been better--the two products together have stopped all the terrible dryness, especially on the ends of my hair, that generally caused me to continually need to trim it all off--I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair down passed my shoulders for the longest time now, but no matter how many different conditioners I tried, the dryness continued--I was feeling like giving up until I decided to try this product, and the other L&#x27;Oreal product that is shampoo-free--the results have been nothing short of wonderful--my hair finally feels like hair again, and not like straw!--I hope and pray I can always purchase those two L&#x27;Oreal products down through the years, so that I can keep my hair looking and feeling as beautiful, and soft and manageable as it has become since I began using them!</li>
            <li> Love this product &amp; will use it indefinitely.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work okay but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft like similar products do.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well on natural hair!&lt;br /&gt;Feels soft during application, keeps hair soft.all day. :)</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for my daughter&#x27;s fine curly hair.  It smoothes out tangles and enhances her curls and does not feel greasy.  Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Works great on certain hair textures that are not super curly. It could not tame my mane.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  really helps keep my frizzy hair under control.</li>
            <li> Great leave in conditioner.  Made my curls very soft and everyone told me my curls looked great</li>
            <li> This is one of the BEST creams I have found for my curly, frizzy hair. It pretty much stops any frizz, and my curls are very bouncy and weightless. My hair, being curly, is always very dry, but this cream makes my hair feel silky and hydrated. Love love love this stuff!! So happy I gave it a try!</li>
            <li> love the smell. Use it on myself &amp; my kids. All have wavy/curly hair. Great to use before combing through.</li>
            <li> It works for my wavy hair and really helps control the frizz</li>
            <li> I recommended. I just bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> I have 2B Wavy Curvy hair. My hair is normal in width and it has low porosity (dry Hair). When I use EverCurl Hydracharge leave in cream, it makes my hair super soft. When I use this product, I can brush/comb my hair and I don&#x27;t have to worry about breakage. It does not make my hair look oily or greasy. It also has a faint coconut smell.    [...]</li>
            <li> Order it fulfilled my expectations. Compliance on the date of shipment. Good quality. Well packed and discounts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fought my curly hair most of my life,  but recently decided to consider my natural curly hair as an asset.  With that in mind I&#x27;ve been looking for the right product to hydrate, fortify and enhance my mop of coarse hair .  This product leaves my hair sticky, clumpy and lackluster.  If you have hair like mine, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, frizzy curly hair. I used tresemme curl care mousse exclusively for nearly 10 years. I finally got sick of defined, but crunchy, hair. I tried a few curl creams at recommendation of a co-worker. Most were too expensive for my taste or didn&#x27;t have enough hold. After playing around with this I finally figured out the right combo. I only co-wash my hair. When I get out I brush and leave in about a quarter sized amount of my favorite conditioner. I then mix this curl cream with a anti frizz serum and apply to my hair in sections and finger through. Most days I don&#x27;t blow dry since I&#x27;m at the gym, but it works great air dry or blow dry. Leaves my curls defined and very soft. I only wash my hair other day... and sometimes this product doesn&#x27;t last that well through day two. That&#x27;s my only complaint!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly and dry hair. Using this product was OK for, it made my hair smell good, while keeping it tact for that day. But the next day my hair was dry and frizzy again, so I bought another product within the same line; called L&#x27;Oreal Sculpt and hold cream and gel,and after using both in my hair after the shower my hair was not dry and it held in place for almost 3 days.</li>
            <li> This some of the only stuff that works with my hair. It keeps my hair with minimum frizz but never gets stiff.</li>
            <li> The only product that can tame my little ones curls.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for me. I have long curly hair, fine strands. Not saying this won&#x27;t work for a different hair type.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I leaves my curls a little sticky....my hair is very curly and it keeps my curls though</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very curlly, like coils of curls. My hair is long (midback) but it poofs up, frizzes, and shrinks a lot (to my chin) when it is dry and curly. I yet have to find a product that keeps my hair down, like it is right out the shower. But this product is good to use to keep hair from frizzing and keeping hair hydrated, I guess my hair is just bound to shrink.</li>
            <li> I really like the EverCurl products by L&#x27;Oreal and the Hydracharge is no exception.  It encourages my naturally curly hair to curl without frizz and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> It was okey... Just made my curls a lil harder to maintain but overall it has a nice smell to it</li>
            <li> Great Product . Leave hair silky and smooth</li>
            <li> this feels good, leaves my hair soft and smells good too. the smell is coconut and it stays when my hair is dry so when you don&#x27;t like the smell of coconut you maybe would try something else.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be too heavy for my hair and pull my curls down/out.  I only use it where I have extra frizz and on the ends of my hair and it makes it look super healthy.  This is not my ALL OVER hair curl product, but it is great for taming frizz and might be great all over if you have tighter curls than I do.  Sometimes mine just look like waves.  I have a nappy area in one spot that it does a great job on.  I even put it on that spot when my hair is dry to get rid of the frizz.</li>
            <li> My sister likes it. SHe says it does what it says. Her hair looks great</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for curly hair, I have nice curls but they are mostly messy if I don&#x27;t apply a curling cream. Regardless of the weather conditions, this cream keeps my hair in the same shape, I just apply it after taking a shower and then blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I like this product, because I usually use mousse in my hair when I want to wear it down curly, but sometimes I don&#x27;t want my hair to be stiff. This is nice because it holds shape well, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and is easily brushed out. Only lasts a couple of hours though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bi-racial (at least). My hair is curly yet can straighten naturally with length or brushing. If I want curls, I add water and air dry. Easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, humidity tends to frizz it out in a most unattractive fashion. Also, the dry climate in which I live, doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I stumbled upon this product (and its coordinating shampoo &amp; conditioner) here on Amazon (did not see it locally) and thought, what the hell. I&#x27;ll give it a shot. I&#x27;ve tried everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is fantastic. I use one pump for my hair after a shower (I keep my hair short to better enhance its curls) and use my hands and fingers to run it throughout my damp or wet hair. Then I let it air dry. Curls are soft and touchable without that &amp;#34;mousse&amp;#34; feeling. And if I want to coax a certain look or shape, I just wet my finger tips after it&#x27;s dry and touch some water here and there, tug a curl out or tuck it back, and voila. Done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go back to those awful &amp;#34;anti frizz&amp;#34; glaze oil whatevers again. Absolute score.&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars</li>
            <li> First leave-in I have tried. Smells great and keeps my hair moist. It&#x27;s nice and light and doesn&#x27;t leave residue on your head (provided you don&#x27;t use the entire bottle at once).</li>
            <li> too much of a perfume smell so it ends up aggravating my asthma</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I&#x27;ve traipsed through the higher end of hair products for my curly hair (Bumble &amp; Bumble, Moroccan Hair Oil), and this does just as much for me at about a fifth of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the spectrum of products, it is NOT sticky or crispy like some meant to hold curls in place. It just tends to soften my hair and keep it from overly frizzing, as well as maybe tamping it down a bit. Easier to travel with than some oils that leak all over your suitcase, as well.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Leaves my fine curly hair soft and in control. Does not weigh it down and it is not stiff. Smells great.</li>
            <li> makes my hair silkly and bouncy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have curly hair but I love this. If you want your hair to look like a celebrity&#x27;s apparently this is the ticket. Can&#x27;t ever find it in the store and was pleased to find it here!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but I have thick naturally curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair that soft and doesn&#x27;t work good as a detangler. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> really like this product</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair and lives her  curls shiny and defined</li>
