            <li>(and about 5 more in storage)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It works better too.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying Vasoline and rubbing it on your lips if you don&#x27;t care about your health.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After that, I enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product off and on for 5 years or more, as I find it</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>i love the way it makes my lips look and feel.</li>
            <li>pruney-lips\\&quot; that most women my age have.  </li>
            <li>I have had better.  </li>
            <li>I like this lip balm, it keeps my lips smooth and hydrated, does not feel greasy and it has a nice cocoa butter smell.</li>
            <li>The best part of it is that it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have order this product from BeautyInBlack, the shipping was very quick, it was a first-class USPS mail delivery to be precise.</li>
            <li>bright yellow tube means I don&#x27;t lose it all the time :)</li>
            <li>HUGE PLUS)</li>
            <li>I have even cut the end of the balm off with a knife to get a smooth surface, but it always turns bumpy again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have tried many lip balms, this one by far is the best especially during the winter.</li>
            <li>I placed an order through Amazon for 10 tubes of Cococare  Butter Lip Balm it is a great product, I have bought this product at the drugstore several times</li>
            <li>but its cheap.</li>
            <li>it showed free shipping &amp; was charge $5.99 for shipping.</li>
            <li>The product is nice and it conditions very well, but i gave it 4 stars since it comes in the mail in the envelope</li>
            <li>I have used many different balms/glosses/sticks, trying to see what works best for me, a person with constantly chapped lips, even during the summer.  </li>
            <li>The first and primary ingredient is PETROLEUM!</li>
            <li>This is as good as Christian Dior 30.00 lip balm!!!</li>
            <li>Unless your not a germ freak like me it is a great alternative to other name brands like Chapstick or carmex.</li>
            <li>I HAD super try lips.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is the only lip balm I will use and have not been able to find it in stores.</li>
            <li>I will pay the higher price + shipping rather than give them up!</li>
            <li>Glides over my lips easily and moisturizes them deeply. :-)</li>
            <li>Gets rid of all dryness and leaves them soft like a baby :)</li>
            <li>This is the only lip balm that not only protects but softens your lips and the smell is great.  </li>
            <li>so i gave it to my little sister and she loved it</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Since this is my first time using this product</li>
            <li>That stuff works really well!</li>
            <li>(Oh, it&#x27;s really inexpensive too!</li>
            <li>We used to be able to get it from a local retailer, but they&#x27;ve discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>There is a long-term benefit, I feel my lips are much more hydrated overall.  </li>
            <li>You just need to make sure you select the one you actually want!</li>
            <li>I think this is a good lip balm to wear in the winter, but some may find it too heavy for summertime.</li>
            <li>i have really dry skin and most of all the lip balms make my lips crack except for this one.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even stand the smell when applying it to my lips, such a strong scent.</li>
            <li>I bought the large 1 oz.</li>
            <li>pure ingredients  </li>
            <li>It is moist enough to go on smoothly and stays that way.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizing.</li>
            <li>WELL the shipping cost THREE TIMES as much as the 10 tubes of Cococare Lip Balm so after I cancelled the order the company still sent the order</li>
            <li>It is much softer than the well known brand and easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>This is an absolute scam.</li>
            <li>It is a product which is very damaging to your lips.</li>
            <li>Fast ship.  </li>
            <li>It was what I expected,  just figure it would be more.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Most importantly, I will be 60 in a few months, and I have no trace of the \\&quot;old lady</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really a fan of the cost, but if you&#x27;re ok with the price, then it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I almost panicked when I found out that Walgreens was no longer carrying this product and was highly relieved to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t like normal lip balms.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right in the middle.</li>
            <li>Every month or so I try a new lip balm because none live up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I could never find this product in stores except in Virginia on vacation, problem is I live in Chicago.  </li>
            <li>Walgreens no longer carries it because that&#x27;s where I first discovered this jewel and the only reason for going to that store.  </li>
            <li>Others are too cooling on the lips, too cakey, but these alleviate his dry chapped lips right away.</li>
            <li>The lip balm is too soft for me.  </li>
            <li>this is a natural product.</li>
            <li>Seriously, common, the primary ingredient is used to make gasoline!</li>
            <li>My lips are always soft, yet they are never greasy or sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who likes soft lips.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the old fashion brand.  </li>
            <li>I actually purchased this product for my mom, who can&#x27;t use most other commercial lip balms as she is extremely sensitive to the \\&quot;taste\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>If your lips are really dry this product will make them peel first</li>
            <li>No waxy feel, no scent and no mess.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really lasts very long on your lips, though.  </li>
            <li>Have used Cococare for 30 years and love it - disappointed when it wasn&#x27;t available in stores.  </li>
            <li>This one actually works and leaves your lips soft.</li>
            <li>it softens lips and overall condition of the lips are soft and not flaky.</li>
            <li>My lips are no longer dry and cracked from the NYC cold, and the product smells great.</li>
            <li>It is so much cheaper than all the other brands</li>
            <li>It appeared to look like it from the outside but on the inside it was not the same as the old fashion Cocoa Butter Product.</li>

            <li> Why would they try to make a product based on CRUDE MINERAL OIL that&#x27;s used for GASOLINE look as if it were a healthy product based on natural cocoa butter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other ones just dry my lips more, and I have used all of them, the expensive ones and the</li>

            <li> It also arrived in the mail a day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It is flavorless, which keeps me from licking it off - one of the biggest problems with other similar products.</li>
            <li> and this is the only lip balm out of the 20 plus other brands I have tried that works.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry mouth</li>
            <li> Always been struggling to find a lip balm that don&#x27;t make my lips dry.</li>
            <li> I fight dry lips.  </li>
            <li> and I can not live without it.</li>
            <li> extremely affordable  the stick lasts for a long time  heals chapped lips in a day  </li>
            <li> /&gt;they are economical but very efective against dry bloody lips.</li>
            <li> - I had used it in the long ago past and couldn&#x27;t buy it locally.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to put any pressure on the balm when applying to your lips.  </li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not only did I find it on Amazon.com -- but it&#x27;s less than the retailer&#x27;s price!  </li>
            <li> and Ive tried just about every other chapstick out there.</li>
            <li> Nevermind Chapstick or any other lip balm.  </li>
            <li> This product is hands down my fave because it works.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews!</li>
            <li> No more dry and chapped lips at night and all day.</li>
            <li> Not only does it taste and smell bad, but it didn&#x27;t work well, AND it&#x27;s based on petroleum with one of the last ingredients being actual</li>
            <li> It took a little while getting used to the flavor, though.</li>
            <li> The other brands either dry my lips, burn, are weird and minty or have some other chemical that doesn&#x27;t agree with my lips.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s less expensive and in a bigger tube.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> It does apply a bit thick, but I like that because it protects my lips from the harsh winter wind.</li>
            <li> these are sometimes hard to find in peak winter months</li>
            <li> The negative from this was that the stick did not have any sort of protective seal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm/gloss fanatic</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years and have not had one complaint.</li>
            <li> Before going to bed, I like to use an organic, vitamin-containing lip balm and then put this over it to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it in because it is so thick.</li>
            <li> this item has topped any other expensive item that i have ever purchased and that claimed it would solve my problems.</li>
            <li> I have to special order this lip balm because for some stupid reason Walgreens doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore!  </li>
            <li> can apply a thin coat or a thick coat  </li>
            <li> so I refused the order when it arrived at my residence and had a very hard time getting a credit from this company and it was not AMAZON&#x27;S fault at all</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is no where to be found in my neighborhood or anywhere nearby</li>
            <li> ill use it when i&#x27;m desperate.</li>
            <li> Too bad I don&#x27;t have stock in this.  </li>
            <li> It works nicely as a base if you want to run some lipstick/color over it, as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this and instantly hated it upon opening it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever found. It is flavorless, which keeps me from licking it off - one of the biggest problems with other similar products. It is moist enough to go on smoothly and stays that way.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;This is a good lip balm. Gets rid of all dryness and leaves them soft like a baby :)&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was a cream like this.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it for sure!&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> awesome product!! i have really dry skin and most of all the lip balms make my lips crack except for this one. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used chapstick all my life. Til I took a plunge and purchased a stick of Cococare. My lips are no longer dry and cracked from the NYC cold, and the product smells great. I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I have order this product from BeautyInBlack, the shipping was very quick, it was a first-class USPS mail delivery to be precise. The negative from this was that the stick did not have any sort of protective seal so it is unclear if it had been tampered with. Since this is my first time using this product I don&#x27;t know if it was the shipper fault, or if the brand never intended on making it come with a seal. Unless your not a germ freak like me it is a great alternative to other name brands like Chapstick or carmex.</li>
            <li> The lip balm is too soft for me.  You have to be careful not to put any pressure on the balm when applying to your lips.  What also bothers me (and yes, I am just being picky), is that the stick itself gets lumpy.  It&#x27;s almost like the balm itself is a bit chunky.  I have even cut the end of the balm off with a knife to get a smooth surface, but it always turns bumpy again.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell good, though and feel good on your lips.  I don&#x27;t think it really lasts very long on your lips, though.  I prefer the [[ASIN:B002P8DGXI Neosporin Lip Health, Daily Hydration Therapy SPF 20 .35 oz (10 g)]] in the white tube.  That stuff works really well!</li>
            <li> Every month or so I try a new lip balm because none live up to my expectations.  I bought the large 1 oz. stick for my heels and got the idea to use it on my lips.  Then I found the lip balm!  It is perfect in every way:     long-lasting (only have to reapply every 3 hours)  can apply a thin coat or a thick coat  pure ingredients  extremely affordable  the stick lasts for a long time  heals chapped lips in a day  bright yellow tube means I don&#x27;t lose it all the time :)</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m a lip balm/gloss fanatic and I just love this stuff.  It stays on for hours and leaves my lips feeling moisturized and the chapping goes away instantly. If you never use lip balm @ all,try this and you&#x27;ll be hooked. I know I am.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It isn&#x27;t like normal lip balms. This one actually works and leaves your lips soft. It doesn&#x27;t have the nicest smell, but the fact that it works makes up for it.</li>
            <li> After finding out cocoa butter was a crucial lip ingrediant, I bought 2 of these. They are amazing! moisture lasts for hours, smells good, not too greasy. I am a lip junkie, and of my years of lipping it up, this is the best lip balm EVER. Buy it! (Oh, it&#x27;s really inexpensive too! HUGE PLUS)</li>
            <li> I have had every lip balm under the sun.  This is the best.  It is fantastic in the extreme cold and hot summer days.  Really moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this product for my mom, who can&#x27;t use most other commercial lip balms as she is extremely sensitive to the \\&quot;taste\\&quot;.  She swears by the Cococare product.  We used to be able to get it from a local retailer, but they&#x27;ve discontinued it.  Not only did I find it on Amazon.com -- but it&#x27;s less than the retailer&#x27;s price!  It&#x27;s a win-win for me!</li>
            <li> I HAD super try lips. Almost getting paranoic about this fact as nothing would help. I have tried lots of lip balms on the market, each of them resulting in making my lips even drier. This is the best lip balm I have ever tried. it softens lips and overall condition of the lips are soft and not flaky. Thank you</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews! I have also been using this product for years. I happened upon it when I was in a walgreens and thought.. hey it&#x27;s only a dollar!! It is so much cheaper than all the other brands and yet it is waaaaayyy better! The other brands either dry my lips, burn, are weird and minty or have some other chemical that doesn&#x27;t agree with my lips. And a plus is that this product smells great and doesn&#x27;t taste like anything!</li>
            <li> I looooove this chapstick. Love it even more than palmer&#x27;s chapstick. Plus, it&#x27;s less expensive and in a bigger tube.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I had was with the seller OTCRX4U. They took FOREVER to send me just two tubes of chapstick, but I don&#x27;t blame Cococare for their (OTCRX4U) ignorance and laziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from problems with delivery and the seller of this item, I don&#x27;t regret purchasing this item at all. Glides over my lips easily and moisturizes them deeply. :-)</li>
            <li> i have tried many lip balms, this one by far is the best especially during the winter. I have been using this product for over 5 years and have not had one complaint. If your lips are really dry this product will make them peel first but once it goes through that phase and you keep using this lip balm only your lips will NOT PEEL EVER AGAIN. Unfortunately, this product is no where to be found in my neighborhood or anywhere nearby so i had to choice but to order it online, i ordered 10 of them. All of my friends already know how great this product is, so i know as soon as they see this item in my bag it will be gone, that is why i have backup in my house at all times. this item has topped any other expensive item that i have ever purchased and that claimed it would solve my problems. #1 LIP BALM OUT THERE!!</li>
            <li> I placed an order through Amazon for 10 tubes of Cococare  Butter Lip Balm it is a great product, I have bought this product at the drugstore several times so I thought I would place an order because the price was cheaper than the drugstore. I placed the order and did not notice the shipping charge until after I placed the order so I cancelled the order...WELL the shipping cost THREE TIMES as much as the 10 tubes of Cococare Lip Balm so after I cancelled the order the company still sent the order so I refused the order when it arrived at my residence and had a very hard time getting a credit from this company and it was not AMAZON&#x27;S fault at all they helped me in everyway they possible could !!!!</li>
            <li> This is truly the only chapstick that actually works and Ive tried just about every other chapstick out there.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5 years and its the only lip balm that works for me. The other ones just dry my lips more, and I have used all of them, the expensive ones and the not so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stays, protects and looks like a moderate lip gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one in the car, one in my purse, and one in my bathroom...(and about 5 more in storage)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are economical but very efective against dry bloody lips. MY lips will start to bleed if I don&#x27;t use it, but if they do, they will stop bleeding and itching when I apply this lip balm. I love it and I can not live without it.</li>
            <li> I used the cocoa-butter version and am very happy with it.  I have used many different balms/glosses/sticks, trying to see what works best for me, a person with constantly chapped lips, even during the summer.  This product has been the most effective with the most sensible packaging in combination with the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stick lasts a long time both in the stick and on my lips.  There is a long-term benefit, I feel my lips are much more hydrated overall.  It works nicely as a base if you want to run some lipstick/color over it, as well.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is so good! It stays on and it smells nice. No more dry and chapped lips at night and all day.</li>
            <li> It works great. You just need to make sure you select the one you actually want! I recommend the cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> Best lip balm product ever! No need to apply 100 times a day. Only after eating or having it wiped off do you need to reapply.</li>
            <li> Once I discovered this product, I have never purchased another brand.  It is much softer than the well known brand and easier to apply.  It works better too.  Now I buy them by the handfull- some for my brother, some for my mother, one for my purse, bedside, etc.  I used to buy them for $.99 at Walgreens, but they no longer carry them.  I will pay the higher price + shipping rather than give them up!</li>
            <li> Made my lips feel really nice.</li>
            <li> My husband only uses this chapstick. It&#x27;s the only one that works for him and he loves the taste. Others are too cooling on the lips, too cakey, but these alleviate his dry chapped lips right away.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute scam. The name &amp;#34;Cococare Cocoa Butter&amp;#34; led me to believe this product was based on Cocoa Butter. That is not the case at ALL. The first and primary ingredient is PETROLEUM! What?? Why would they try to make a product based on CRUDE MINERAL OIL that&#x27;s used for GASOLINE look as if it were a healthy product based on natural cocoa butter?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely deceiving - No ingredients listed on this page. Probably because they know it would scare people away. You&#x27;re better off buying Vasoline and rubbing it on your lips if you don&#x27;t care about your health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I threw it away instantly. Not only does it taste and smell bad, but it didn&#x27;t work well, AND it&#x27;s based on petroleum with one of the last ingredients being actual Cocoa Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY thinking this is a natural product. It is a product which is very damaging to your lips. Seriously, common, the primary ingredient is used to make gasoline! Think about it.</li>
            <li> I have to special order this lip balm because for some stupid reason Walgreens doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore!  I cannot survive without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Fast ship.  Excellent lip balm.</li>
            <li> This is as good as Christian Dior 30.00 lip balm!!! Stays on lips like glue!!!! I keep tubes everywhere in the car/house in desk at work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of the cost, but if you&#x27;re ok with the price, then it&#x27;s a decent product. It took a little while getting used to the flavor, though. After that, I enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> This chapstick has a nice smell, and texture.It&#x27;s not too greasy or waxy. It&#x27;s right in the middle. It also arrived in the mail a day earlier than expected. There&#x27;s a lot of chapstick in the tube. I didn&#x27;t like that the shipping was more expensive than the product, and that theres no seal. I thought I had a used one when I got it.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this lip balm at a one of those nationwide drugstores, but after they stopped carrying it I found it on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and it works!</li>
            <li> If you never tried it, YOU MUST.  Nevermind Chapstick or any other lip balm.  This IS your go to balm for the winter.  No waxy feel, no scent and no mess. It&#x27;s a great moisterizer and repleshnishes lips.  My lips feel healed after use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for 5 years or more, as I find it and I love it.  My lips are always soft, yet they are never greasy or sticky feeling.  I would recommend this product to anyone who likes soft lips.</li>
            <li> i thought it was a chapstick for me but when i saw it on my lips in the mirror my lips were shinny so i gave it to my little sister and she loved it</li>
            <li> I bought this and instantly hated it upon opening it. I can&#x27;t even stand the smell when applying it to my lips, such a strong scent.</li>
            <li> i love the way it makes my lips look and feel. but the smell is nuts!!! it smells nothing like coconut.  it smells like 80&#x27;s grandma avon perfume!!! but its cheap. ill use it when i&#x27;m desperate.</li>
            <li> I have been using [[ASIN:B000GG29F2 Cococare Cocoa Butter lip balm - 0.15 Oz]] for 10+ years and I am hooked for life.  I can&#x27;t stand waxy lip balms, and this one sort of melts into your lips and feels silky and wonderful.  Most importantly, I will be 60 in a few months, and I have no trace of the \\&quot;old lady pruney-lips\\&quot; that most women my age have.  My 87-year-old mother is now hooked on it as well.  I almost panicked when I found out that Walgreens was no longer carrying this product and was highly relieved to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> these are sometimes hard to find in peak winter months so I ordered from Amazon,  they arrived in packaging but each individual stick was not sealed like when you buy them at the pharmacy, that is the only reason i did not give it 5 stars.  otherwise its great.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected,  just figure it would be more. Didn&#x27;t like that it showed free shipping &amp; was charge $5.99 for shipping.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.  I was looking for the old fashion brand.  It appeared to look like it from the outside but on the inside it was not the same as the old fashion Cocoa Butter Product.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000GG29F2 Cococare Cocoa Butter lip balm - 0.15 Oz]] This is the only lip balm that not only protects but softens your lips and the smell is great.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> i have extemely chapped lips every winter and this has helped. I use it every day and night . it works</li>
            <li> The product is nice and it conditions very well, but i gave it 4 stars since it comes in the mail in the envelope but when i take the lip balm out...there is no covering on it or case.</li>
            <li> I could never find this product in stores except in Virginia on vacation, problem is I live in Chicago.  That&#x27;s why I purchased online. Leaves lips silky smooth love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is the only lip balm I will use and have not been able to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I have had better.  This contains petroleum which I try to avoid in lip balm.</li>
            <li> Have used Cococare for 30 years and love it - disappointed when it wasn&#x27;t available in stores.  Great product  Thanks</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry mouth and this is the only lip balm out of the 20 plus other brands I have tried that works.  It&#x27;s a shame Walgreens no longer carries it because that&#x27;s where I first discovered this jewel and the only reason for going to that store.  Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you.  It&#x27;s the best lip balm on the market!</li>
            <li> Always been struggling to find a lip balm that don&#x27;t make my lips dry. I found it finally, it has become a necessity for me I keep it with me everywhere I go in my pocket.</li>
            <li> I like the Cocoa Butter Lip Balm a lot - I had used it in the long ago past and couldn&#x27;t buy it locally.  Suddenly I remembered that I purchased it online, so I went there again.</li>
            <li> I like this lip balm, it keeps my lips smooth and hydrated, does not feel greasy and it has a nice cocoa butter smell.</li>
            <li> Usually I cant use petroleum-containing products, but this one is both gentle and moisturizing. It does have a bit of a shine, but it&#x27;s not glossy. It does apply a bit thick, but I like that because it protects my lips from the harsh winter wind. I think this is a good lip balm to wear in the winter, but some may find it too heavy for summertime. Before going to bed, I like to use an organic, vitamin-containing lip balm and then put this over it to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it in because it is so thick. The best part of it is that it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive. I have about 6-7 lip balms I can use out of the 100s I tried (due to sensitivity/irritation issues), and this one is the cheapest by far!</li>
            <li> My very favorite lip balm!!!</li>
            <li> I fight dry lips.  This product is hands down my fave because it works.  I&#x27;ve given away tubes to friends and they place an order because it is good and inexpensive.  Too bad I don&#x27;t have stock in this.  I buy 10 tubes at a time.</li>
            <li> Have been buying this product for years and I love it. Cheap, smells good and looks more like lip gloss than chap stick!</li>
            <li> 3 rd tube to purchase....use nothing else and probably never will</li>
    </ol>
