            <li>I really do love this thing and it will be great if I stay the night elsewhere or travel!</li>
            <li>I have been using the safe - my -face pillow for a year and the results on my face are amazing!!</li>
            <li>Good Luck.</li>
            <li>The pillow was affordale which I loved as well...</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the pillow.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this pillow!</li>
            <li>but prevention is always better than cure!</li>
            <li>and when I woke up I was perfectly on the my pillow supporting my neck.</li>
            <li>I love this pillow!</li>
            <li>It works for my breathing problem and I find it great for allowing me to drop easily into sleep and allow deeper breathing.  </li>
            <li>I wish it would have worked for me as I was very excited to try it out!</li>
            <li>Great concept to wake up wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li>and it is a great fit for sleeping with the hose and mask.  </li>
            <li>The cat found a permanent loving home.</li>
            <li>Too soon to see how effective a product</li>
            <li>It would be nice if this had a washable cover that you could remove.</li>
            <li>just supports my neck so nicely.</li>
            <li>but it still would be nice to have the option of a zippered cover.</li>
            <li>My husband has tried to steal it to use with his cpap machine but he&#x27;ll have to get his own...</li>
            <li>I currently own the le Petite and want to use that one for travel</li>
            <li>Pillow is flimsy, slippery and makes you too warm.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to breath and snags very easily.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is best used on top of  a soft pillow.  </li>
            <li>Nice satin pillow huge difference on my face and no marks when I wake up in the am!:)</li>
            <li>Much better at preventing smoosh face than memory foam pillows.  </li>
            <li>My neck somehow feels better that way</li>
            <li>so I sleep with a slant pillow and put this satin pillow on top.</li>
            <li>and if I lose more stuffing perhaps picking up some of that at the craft store to boost it up.</li>
            <li>Quite the contrary, I use an inflatable pillow that I love; can&#x27;t see this one replacing that.</li>
            <li>As a side sleeper, I have tried many anti-aging products and pillows, wanting to wake up without the sleep lines and puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I use it on top of a foam pillow.  </li>
            <li>I bought one for my mother, who enjoys using it on top of a feather pillow.  </li>
            <li>I also use it under my neck when I&#x27;m reading for better support and leverage.</li>
            <li>and I love how it keeps my face elevated off the pillow as to reduce smashing my face and getting those lovely lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>cute pillow ..</li>
            <li>But for the time being, having already adjusted to it, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Your results may be better if you are a cooperative sleeper...</li>
            <li>Nice and comfortable, it doesn&#x27;t leave marks in the mouth area when I sleep</li>
            <li>I sleep on top of a &amp;#34;my pillow&amp;#34; pillow.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love my pillow, so comfy</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s the case, I look at it as, some protection is better than no</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>It would work much better if it was thicker.</li>
            <li>I have seen this and wanted it for many years and now have bought one for myself.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to purchase some more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>I must say that it has many benefits.  </li>
            <li>I sleep in the free fall sleep position!  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this will prevent pre-mature wrinkles (which would have been caused by my sleep position).</li>
            <li>Although I love the concept, I have a suggestion for the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>It may slip out right after I fall asleep, so what good is it doing me?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>i love it, It is great, comfortable and really works protecting lash</li>
            <li>This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time.  </li>
            <li>When I first got this pillow I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this pillow would really be any good, but it was inexpensive and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect because I&#x27;m someone who doesn&#x27;t really like a pillow for much height, anyway.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses a bean-filled pillow and found this pillow to make it more comfortable to sleep on his side.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That too becomes more familiar as you continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>(I wake up with my skin completely smooth, despite still sleeping on my side), but it also made it much more comfortable to sleep.  </li>
            <li>In addition to protecting your face from wrinkles, it is also easy on the hair-do.  </li>
            <li>It travels easily also.</li>
            <li>/&gt;really easy to take with you</li>
            <li>I bought this to see how well it work, and it works fine.</li>
            <li>I have thrown it in the washing machine and dryer, and it came out fine.  </li>
            <li>You can turn your face a little to the sides and it&#x27;s perfect comfort and keeps your face off anything that can create the fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size, provides very comfortable support, and encourages restful sleep.</li>
            <li>and I was waking up with huge sleep wrinkles on my face</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really comfortable.</li>
            <li>With that in mind, it may be worth the money to buy a better one.</li>
            <li>Love this pillow, worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it was fairly comfortable.</li>
            <li>Had neck surgery and thought this would help but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t get comfortable on it at all.</li>
            <li>This pillow is comfortable to sleep with</li>
            <li>I think if I bought the pillow cover casing to fit snugly over this pillow, it would be firmer and more useful.  </li>
            <li>So far I love the pillow, its very comfortable and easy to sleep on...</li>
            <li>Small size is the best!</li>
            <li>still give the pillow 5 stars, because for the price and its effects, its worth trying and getting used to it!  </li>
            <li>if I use it on my side I have to make sure my face is in the exact spot</li>
            <li>It stays in place quite well, the satin makes it cool.</li>
            <li>Not only does it stop you from sleeping on your face, it will also perserve your hairstyle as you are not sleeping on your hair, but a surprising benefit was that it helps with nasal allergies as my nose is elevated from the pillow, which is helping with my nasal allergies.  </li>
            <li>Love this new pillow!</li>
            <li>you for your quick response to my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t keep it on my main pillow through the night. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>So comfy, love it and highly reccomend this pillow to prevent wrinkles on the side of your face while you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Wake</li>
            <li>I use the pillow right on top of my regular pillow and it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Although a foam c-shaped neck pillow will work if u r on the cheap ;)</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pretty comfortable, too --</li>
            <li>It normally stays put for the most part</li>
            <li>Linda made a special effort and send my order on Saturday instead of Monday, and the package arrived within 2 days, it was so helpful and so kind, as she did not request extra for the service.</li>
            <li>At one year out on my updated review here, it is still worth it though I have had to baby it along now after a year.  </li>
            <li>It even makes sleeping on my back more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I rarely have that happen, but it has happened a time or two.</li>
            <li>This pillow is particularly useful if you are a side sleeper</li>
            <li>think I should just make my own pillow at this point or learn to sleep on the back.</li>
            <li>I have never written a review, but I thought this product was worth my time to endorse.  </li>
            <li>It took some trial and error to get it to the right position</li>
            <li>it is right now.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am familiar with the cotton version of this product and that one comes with a cotton pillow case and I have used that version for about 12 years buying a new one every couple of years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost a tad too high but keeps me off my shoulders and wow was it comfortable!</li>
            <li>i wish you didn&#x27;t need to put on top of a regular pillow.  </li>
            <li>but maybe it&#x27;s because i&#x27;m not using it consistently.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>The product worked exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>If you are a side-sleeper, this pillow works well on top of another regular pillow.  </li>
            <li>I sleep mostly on my side but occasionaly end up on my back</li>
            <li>It appears that they added more stuffing to it or it was possibly returned</li>
            <li>Just put it on top of your regular pillow .</li>
            <li>This pillow was my first choice.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I also sleep on my stomach, and it seems to work pretty well that way too.  </li>
            <li>I use this pillow on top of it&#x27;s larger counterpart.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on top of a traditional bed pillow</li>
            <li>I use it on top of my regular pillow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on top of a regular pillow because like another reviewer said... that would be too much height for me!  </li>
            <li>Constantly slips off the bed and ends up on the floor more than my head.</li>
            <li>I can bend it to be a neck support easily and it bounces right back.</li>
            <li>It needs to be placed on top of another flat pillow.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re supposed to use it on top of a regular pillow, but that would be too much height for me.  </li>
            <li>it should be which wakes me up too much during the night, and also makes me too aware of staying that way</li>
            <li>NOT SO GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit slick, which makes it good for those who are looking to avoid/prevent wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I still do so very rarely, but I can finally see the potential for doing so more</li>
            <li>This would be great if it was not as flat as a pancake, I had to open it and add a little more stuffing</li>
            <li>For a while, it was fine, but then it just didn&#x27;t have enough support for me.  </li>
            <li>Since I toss and turn at night, I ended up waking up twice during the first night, because this pillow would slide off my main pillow, since it has satin pillowcase which is very slippery.</li>
            <li>A real joke.</li>
            <li>I gathered up what stuffing I could find in the washer stuffed it back in and hand sewed with running stitches along the seam line to secure</li>
            <li>Needs a pillow case that needs to be made of non slippery material like cotton so that the pillow stays in place the whole night.  </li>
            <li>For support, not so much unless you like it doubled over.  </li>
            <li>For me, doubled over was too much - no in-between.  </li>
            <li>and I like that it is comfortable in all positions whether laying on my side or my back.</li>
            <li>I have found that it really does reduce the creases and marks that can happen while sleeping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very restless sleeper</li>
            <li>He likes it as it really helps his neck.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use, but doesn&#x27;t stay in place the entire night.  </li>
            <li>I had to wash the whole thing, I do this once a week.</li>
            <li>In the next two nights, I ended up waking up in the morning with this pillow on the floor, with my dog comfortably sleeping on it.</li>
            <li>I really do.  </li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s no way they cost that much to make, but I guess that&#x27;s how they stay in business.</li>
            <li>It supports my neck and that&#x27;s what I really want.  </li>
            <li>Much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for apnea patients!</li>
            <li>It has really been helping him not to wake up with headaches</li>
            <li>He puts it on top of his pillow since it&#x27;s not very tall</li>
            <li>I have TMJ disorder and it really helps that.    </li>
            <li>The next time I washed it I put it in a lingerie bag and ran the washing machine on warm on the regular cycle.</li>
            <li>I have to put this pillow on top of another soft pillow to get the necessary support for my neck.  </li>
            <li>However, it takes a little more getting my head in just the right place</li>
            <li>Also, when you first use it, it seems odd to have your head supported mostly at the forehead and chin.  </li>
            <li>While the original thought was \\&quot;it&#x27;s so much smaller than I&#x27;d expected\\&quot;, this pillow turned out to surpass expectations.  </li>
            <li>The Petite works better than the other.</li>
            <li>and it took me about two weeks to get through a whole night without switching to a normal pillow,</li>
            <li>surprised how much I do!</li>
            <li>This could have been annoying but it slips right under my head and neck, my face doesnt really touch the pillow except at the temple, and I&#x27;m supported perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have only used it alone on top of the mattress without a regular pillow.</li>
            <li>(It might stay in place better if only one side - the side where you put your face - were satin and the back side cotton)  </li>
            <li>I give it three stars because it makes a decent travel pillow on an airplane.</li>
            <li>I get better results just sleeping on my back with a regular pillow.</li>
            <li>I kept waking up with deep creases in my face, but luckily, I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>it makes it too high (for my taste) and slips around a bit.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I wear eyelash extensions and this pillow is highly recommanded for maintaining the extensions and not wrinkling my face.</li>
            <li>I have never used this pillow or the other cotton one they sell directly as described, that is on top of another pillow.</li>
            <li>You will have to use it on top of your regular pillow, unless you like to sleep on the flat surface without any support.</li>
            <li>Although this pillow is good in theory, it went flat after just a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>This little pillow is so comfortable!</li>
            <li>I love my little pillow.  </li>
            <li>A lot of times, I would bunch up the covers near my face and cuddle with them, because I don&#x27;t like much height.  </li>
            <li>I have have used this pillow with the satin case for a few years and love it.  </li>
            <li>After a few more washings it is not holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;Another issue I have is I don&#x27;t ever wake up with it under my head.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine and other times</li>
            <li>I bought the smaller pillow and it is just right for me.  </li>
            <li>First, I got such a great service - I had a time limit which I failed to see when I placed the order.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s a new neck</li>
            <li>I slept the first night almost until morning without tossing and turning and I can&#x27;t remember the last time that happened.</li>
            <li>you just need a pretty flat pillow to set it on, or else your neck may get sore.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t decide between the large one or the smaller</li>
            <li>Finding a comfortable spot is a little tricky</li>
            <li>It is awkward finding a comfortable position and many nights</li>
            <li>I still had my old cotton one</li>
            <li>so I saw directly</li>
            <li>This pillow has not only made it much safer for my face</li>
            <li>This makes it feel strange when you first start using it -- seems to slide out from underneath you.  </li>
            <li>but it seems helpful so far to preserve my face.</li>
            <li>I think I was so self conscious about the wrinkles forming that it was affecting my sleep.</li>
            <li>But its a natural cure for wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li>In retrospect, I&#x27;m surprised how comfy this pillow is.</li>
            <li>and now I wake up without all of the wrinkles and creases from my old pillow.  </li>
            <li>I do like the soft satin cover on the pillow</li>
            <li>This may be OK as a travel pillow, but is not comfortable for regular sleeping.</li>
            <li>You can also fold the pillow for neck support if you want to sleep on your back or if you lay the pillow flat and sleep in the middle of the pillow, it&#x27;s comfortable, too.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, you can&#x27;t really use any normal pillow cases with this, and the specific pillow cases are quite pricey.  </li>
            <li>Many other pillows that claim to have similar effects are much more expensive (though I can&#x27;t say anything to their effectiveness).</li>
            <li>In the morning, I DID notice less obvious sleep lines around my nose, which got me really excited.</li>
            <li>Now if you are thinking you can order a pillow case to fit this from the cotton one the company sells, it will not fit and is a different shape with the arms longer and at a different curve so you will have to live with it as it is coverless unless they start to make a cover for this one.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m only in my late 20s, but I&#x27;ve never been able to train myself to not sleep on my stomach or side.  </li>
            <li>Used on top of another pillow, it&#x27;s just barely thick enough to keep my face elevated.</li>
            <li>It does take a little getting use to but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Used on regular pillow as per instructions, keeps face and also high cheek bones from pressure of regular pillow!  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s small enough to bring along to make any pillow comfortable with the added benefit not getting wrinkles while I travel.</li>
            <li>I have to say that the wrinkles around my eyes are noticeably decreased, and I am sleeping better.</li>
            <li>At this smaller size, by itself, I can sleep on my back and not have my head cranked too far up.</li>
            <li>Soft material, no funky odors, and can be folded or twisted into so many positions to get just the support you want.</li>
            <li>The first washing I soaked it in a bucket and air dried it in the Southern California sun because I was scared the fabric would run and it would be a mass of threads.  </li>
            <li>but one thing did actually bother me a lot, it is &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; small, I get up of my sleep just to put it in the right position again and again</li>
            <li>It feels a bit flimsier than the first one I bought but still decent idea behind it.</li>

            <li> It also works great for a neck support while traveling.  </li>

            <li> I really do love this thing and it will be great if I stay the night elsewhere or travel!</li>
            <li> I have been using the safe - my -face pillow for a year and the results on my face are amazing!!</li>
            <li> Good Luck.</li>
            <li> The pillow was affordale which I loved as well...</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the pillow.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pillow!</li>
            <li> but prevention is always better than cure!</li>
            <li> and when I woke up I was perfectly on the my pillow supporting my neck.</li>
            <li> I love this pillow!</li>
            <li> It works for my breathing problem and I find it great for allowing me to drop easily into sleep and allow deeper breathing.  </li>
            <li> I wish it would have worked for me as I was very excited to try it out!</li>
            <li> Great concept to wake up wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li> and it is a great fit for sleeping with the hose and mask.  </li>
            <li> The cat found a permanent loving home.</li>
            <li> Too soon to see how effective a product</li>
            <li> It would be nice if this had a washable cover that you could remove.</li>
            <li> just supports my neck so nicely.</li>
            <li> but it still would be nice to have the option of a zippered cover.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried to steal it to use with his cpap machine but he&#x27;ll have to get his own...</li>
            <li> I currently own the le Petite and want to use that one for travel</li>
            <li> Pillow is flimsy, slippery and makes you too warm.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to breath and snags very easily.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is best used on top of  a soft pillow.  </li>
            <li> Nice satin pillow huge difference on my face and no marks when I wake up in the am!:)</li>
            <li> Much better at preventing smoosh face than memory foam pillows.  </li>
            <li> My neck somehow feels better that way</li>
            <li> so I sleep with a slant pillow and put this satin pillow on top.</li>
            <li> and if I lose more stuffing perhaps picking up some of that at the craft store to boost it up.</li>
            <li> Quite the contrary, I use an inflatable pillow that I love; can&#x27;t see this one replacing that.</li>
            <li> As a side sleeper, I have tried many anti-aging products and pillows, wanting to wake up without the sleep lines and puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I use it on top of a foam pillow.  </li>
            <li> I bought one for my mother, who enjoys using it on top of a feather pillow.  </li>
            <li> I also use it under my neck when I&#x27;m reading for better support and leverage.</li>
            <li> and I love how it keeps my face elevated off the pillow as to reduce smashing my face and getting those lovely lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> cute pillow ..</li>
            <li> But for the time being, having already adjusted to it, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> Your results may be better if you are a cooperative sleeper...</li>
            <li> Nice and comfortable, it doesn&#x27;t leave marks in the mouth area when I sleep</li>
            <li> I sleep on top of a &amp;#34;my pillow&amp;#34; pillow.</li>
            <li> Plus, I love my pillow, so comfy</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s the case, I look at it as, some protection is better than no</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> It would work much better if it was thicker.</li>
            <li> I have seen this and wanted it for many years and now have bought one for myself.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to purchase some more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> I must say that it has many benefits.  </li>
            <li> I sleep in the free fall sleep position!  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will prevent pre-mature wrinkles (which would have been caused by my sleep position).</li>
            <li> Although I love the concept, I have a suggestion for the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It may slip out right after I fall asleep, so what good is it doing me?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  </li>
            <li> i love it, It is great, comfortable and really works protecting lash</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time.  </li>
            <li> When I first got this pillow I loved it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this pillow would really be any good, but it was inexpensive and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect because I&#x27;m someone who doesn&#x27;t really like a pillow for much height, anyway.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses a bean-filled pillow and found this pillow to make it more comfortable to sleep on his side.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That too becomes more familiar as you continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> (I wake up with my skin completely smooth, despite still sleeping on my side), but it also made it much more comfortable to sleep.  </li>
            <li> In addition to protecting your face from wrinkles, it is also easy on the hair-do.  </li>
            <li> It travels easily also.</li>
            <li> /&gt;really easy to take with you</li>
            <li> I bought this to see how well it work, and it works fine.</li>
            <li> I have thrown it in the washing machine and dryer, and it came out fine.  </li>
            <li> You can turn your face a little to the sides and it&#x27;s perfect comfort and keeps your face off anything that can create the fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size, provides very comfortable support, and encourages restful sleep.</li>
            <li> and I was waking up with huge sleep wrinkles on my face</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really comfortable.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, it may be worth the money to buy a better one.</li>
            <li> Love this pillow, worth the money.</li>
            <li> but it was fairly comfortable.</li>
            <li> Had neck surgery and thought this would help but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t get comfortable on it at all.</li>
            <li> This pillow is comfortable to sleep with</li>
            <li> I think if I bought the pillow cover casing to fit snugly over this pillow, it would be firmer and more useful.  </li>
            <li> So far I love the pillow, its very comfortable and easy to sleep on...</li>
            <li> Small size is the best!</li>
            <li> still give the pillow 5 stars, because for the price and its effects, its worth trying and getting used to it!  </li>
            <li> if I use it on my side I have to make sure my face is in the exact spot</li>
            <li> It stays in place quite well, the satin makes it cool.</li>
            <li> Not only does it stop you from sleeping on your face, it will also perserve your hairstyle as you are not sleeping on your hair, but a surprising benefit was that it helps with nasal allergies as my nose is elevated from the pillow, which is helping with my nasal allergies.  </li>
            <li> Love this new pillow!</li>
            <li> you for your quick response to my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t keep it on my main pillow through the night. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> So comfy, love it and highly reccomend this pillow to prevent wrinkles on the side of your face while you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Wake</li>
            <li> I use the pillow right on top of my regular pillow and it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Although a foam c-shaped neck pillow will work if u r on the cheap ;)</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s pretty comfortable, too --</li>
            <li> It normally stays put for the most part</li>
            <li> Linda made a special effort and send my order on Saturday instead of Monday, and the package arrived within 2 days, it was so helpful and so kind, as she did not request extra for the service.</li>
            <li> At one year out on my updated review here, it is still worth it though I have had to baby it along now after a year.  </li>
            <li> It even makes sleeping on my back more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I rarely have that happen, but it has happened a time or two.</li>
            <li> This pillow is particularly useful if you are a side sleeper</li>
            <li> think I should just make my own pillow at this point or learn to sleep on the back.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review, but I thought this product was worth my time to endorse.  </li>
            <li> It took some trial and error to get it to the right position</li>
            <li> it is right now.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am familiar with the cotton version of this product and that one comes with a cotton pillow case and I have used that version for about 12 years buying a new one every couple of years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a tad too high but keeps me off my shoulders and wow was it comfortable!</li>
            <li> i wish you didn&#x27;t need to put on top of a regular pillow.  </li>
            <li> but maybe it&#x27;s because i&#x27;m not using it consistently.</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> The product worked exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> If you are a side-sleeper, this pillow works well on top of another regular pillow.  </li>
            <li> I sleep mostly on my side but occasionaly end up on my back</li>
            <li> It appears that they added more stuffing to it or it was possibly returned</li>
            <li> Just put it on top of your regular pillow .</li>
            <li> This pillow was my first choice.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I also sleep on my stomach, and it seems to work pretty well that way too.  </li>
            <li> I use this pillow on top of it&#x27;s larger counterpart.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on top of a traditional bed pillow</li>
            <li> I use it on top of my regular pillow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on top of a regular pillow because like another reviewer said... that would be too much height for me!  </li>
            <li> Constantly slips off the bed and ends up on the floor more than my head.</li>
            <li> I can bend it to be a neck support easily and it bounces right back.</li>
            <li> It needs to be placed on top of another flat pillow.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re supposed to use it on top of a regular pillow, but that would be too much height for me.  </li>
            <li> it should be which wakes me up too much during the night, and also makes me too aware of staying that way</li>
            <li> NOT SO GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit slick, which makes it good for those who are looking to avoid/prevent wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I still do so very rarely, but I can finally see the potential for doing so more</li>
            <li> This would be great if it was not as flat as a pancake, I had to open it and add a little more stuffing</li>
            <li> For a while, it was fine, but then it just didn&#x27;t have enough support for me.  </li>
            <li> Since I toss and turn at night, I ended up waking up twice during the first night, because this pillow would slide off my main pillow, since it has satin pillowcase which is very slippery.</li>
            <li> A real joke.</li>
            <li> I gathered up what stuffing I could find in the washer stuffed it back in and hand sewed with running stitches along the seam line to secure</li>
            <li> Needs a pillow case that needs to be made of non slippery material like cotton so that the pillow stays in place the whole night.  </li>
            <li> For support, not so much unless you like it doubled over.  </li>
            <li> For me, doubled over was too much - no in-between.  </li>
            <li> and I like that it is comfortable in all positions whether laying on my side or my back.</li>
            <li> I have found that it really does reduce the creases and marks that can happen while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very restless sleeper</li>
            <li> He likes it as it really helps his neck.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use, but doesn&#x27;t stay in place the entire night.  </li>
            <li> I had to wash the whole thing, I do this once a week.</li>
            <li> In the next two nights, I ended up waking up in the morning with this pillow on the floor, with my dog comfortably sleeping on it.</li>
            <li> I really do.  </li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s no way they cost that much to make, but I guess that&#x27;s how they stay in business.</li>
            <li> It supports my neck and that&#x27;s what I really want.  </li>
            <li> Much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for apnea patients!</li>
            <li> It has really been helping him not to wake up with headaches</li>
            <li> He puts it on top of his pillow since it&#x27;s not very tall</li>
            <li> I have TMJ disorder and it really helps that.    </li>
            <li> The next time I washed it I put it in a lingerie bag and ran the washing machine on warm on the regular cycle.</li>
            <li> I have to put this pillow on top of another soft pillow to get the necessary support for my neck.  </li>
            <li> However, it takes a little more getting my head in just the right place</li>
            <li> Also, when you first use it, it seems odd to have your head supported mostly at the forehead and chin.  </li>
            <li> While the original thought was \\&quot;it&#x27;s so much smaller than I&#x27;d expected\\&quot;, this pillow turned out to surpass expectations.  </li>
            <li> The Petite works better than the other.</li>
            <li> and it took me about two weeks to get through a whole night without switching to a normal pillow,</li>
            <li> surprised how much I do!</li>
            <li> This could have been annoying but it slips right under my head and neck, my face doesnt really touch the pillow except at the temple, and I&#x27;m supported perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have only used it alone on top of the mattress without a regular pillow.</li>
            <li> (It might stay in place better if only one side - the side where you put your face - were satin and the back side cotton)  </li>
            <li> I give it three stars because it makes a decent travel pillow on an airplane.</li>
            <li> I get better results just sleeping on my back with a regular pillow.</li>
            <li> I kept waking up with deep creases in my face, but luckily, I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> it makes it too high (for my taste) and slips around a bit.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wear eyelash extensions and this pillow is highly recommanded for maintaining the extensions and not wrinkling my face.</li>
            <li> I have never used this pillow or the other cotton one they sell directly as described, that is on top of another pillow.</li>
            <li> You will have to use it on top of your regular pillow, unless you like to sleep on the flat surface without any support.</li>
            <li> Although this pillow is good in theory, it went flat after just a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> This little pillow is so comfortable!</li>
            <li> I love my little pillow.  </li>
            <li> A lot of times, I would bunch up the covers near my face and cuddle with them, because I don&#x27;t like much height.  </li>
            <li> I have have used this pillow with the satin case for a few years and love it.  </li>
            <li> After a few more washings it is not holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;Another issue I have is I don&#x27;t ever wake up with it under my head.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine and other times</li>
            <li> I bought the smaller pillow and it is just right for me.  </li>
            <li> First, I got such a great service - I had a time limit which I failed to see when I placed the order.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s a new neck</li>
            <li> I slept the first night almost until morning without tossing and turning and I can&#x27;t remember the last time that happened.</li>
            <li> you just need a pretty flat pillow to set it on, or else your neck may get sore.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide between the large one or the smaller</li>
            <li> Finding a comfortable spot is a little tricky</li>
            <li> It is awkward finding a comfortable position and many nights</li>
            <li> I still had my old cotton one</li>
            <li> so I saw directly</li>
            <li> This pillow has not only made it much safer for my face</li>
            <li> This makes it feel strange when you first start using it -- seems to slide out from underneath you.  </li>
            <li> but it seems helpful so far to preserve my face.</li>
            <li> I think I was so self conscious about the wrinkles forming that it was affecting my sleep.</li>
            <li> But its a natural cure for wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li> In retrospect, I&#x27;m surprised how comfy this pillow is.</li>
            <li> and now I wake up without all of the wrinkles and creases from my old pillow.  </li>
            <li> I do like the soft satin cover on the pillow</li>
            <li> This may be OK as a travel pillow, but is not comfortable for regular sleeping.</li>
            <li> You can also fold the pillow for neck support if you want to sleep on your back or if you lay the pillow flat and sleep in the middle of the pillow, it&#x27;s comfortable, too.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, you can&#x27;t really use any normal pillow cases with this, and the specific pillow cases are quite pricey.  </li>
            <li> Many other pillows that claim to have similar effects are much more expensive (though I can&#x27;t say anything to their effectiveness).</li>
            <li> In the morning, I DID notice less obvious sleep lines around my nose, which got me really excited.</li>
            <li> Now if you are thinking you can order a pillow case to fit this from the cotton one the company sells, it will not fit and is a different shape with the arms longer and at a different curve so you will have to live with it as it is coverless unless they start to make a cover for this one.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m only in my late 20s, but I&#x27;ve never been able to train myself to not sleep on my stomach or side.  </li>
            <li> Used on top of another pillow, it&#x27;s just barely thick enough to keep my face elevated.</li>
            <li> It does take a little getting use to but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Used on regular pillow as per instructions, keeps face and also high cheek bones from pressure of regular pillow!  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s small enough to bring along to make any pillow comfortable with the added benefit not getting wrinkles while I travel.</li>
            <li> I have to say that the wrinkles around my eyes are noticeably decreased, and I am sleeping better.</li>
            <li> At this smaller size, by itself, I can sleep on my back and not have my head cranked too far up.</li>
            <li> Soft material, no funky odors, and can be folded or twisted into so many positions to get just the support you want.</li>
            <li> The first washing I soaked it in a bucket and air dried it in the Southern California sun because I was scared the fabric would run and it would be a mass of threads.  </li>
            <li> but one thing did actually bother me a lot, it is &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; small, I get up of my sleep just to put it in the right position again and again</li>
            <li> It feels a bit flimsier than the first one I bought but still decent idea behind it.</li>
            <li> I received it, first thing I noticed was it was too small and too flat.</li>
            <li> A Little Too Small to comfortably support the face in the correct position when side sleeping.  </li>
            <li> Too small and too thin to be effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they can justify the ones including the case cost so much just because the case is included</li>
            <li> I thought this pillow may help but by itself it&#x27;s too flat and with my skinniest pillow</li>
            <li> apparently I am not.</li>
            <li> My second night involved minor tossing and turning</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too flat to use alone.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sleep flat on the Just the Pillow, so I have a delemma.</li>
            <li> It certainly beats those big thick gigantic pillows that do havoc to your neck and crowsfeet all night long.</li>
            <li> I will have to not leave it in so long in the machine</li>
            <li> I put it inside a regular pillowcase which helps with the slipping.</li>
            <li> I wanted a pillow like this as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> One thing is there is about an inch section that has strange seems on it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have it for a long time</li>
            <li> There is one with a cover which I should have spent this extra to buy</li>
            <li> The first washing wasn&#x27;t bad, after a night sleeping on it and smashing it down it was comfortable again.</li>
            <li> Cut out fabric slightly wider than those lines, sew on the lines (make the cover slightly larger than the actual pillow) and that&#x27;s it!  </li>
            <li> but I decided to go with the smaller because it was less expensive (in case I didn&#x27;t like it) and that I can use this on top of my other squishy pillow</li>
            <li> The pillow was flat like in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I recommend to everyone that sleeps with their face smooshed into a regular pillow, also small enough to pack and washes well.</li>
            <li> I slept so deep that I also slept an hour later than usual.</li>
            <li> Too flat, too slippery, just not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found it&#x27;s a little easier to breathe when using it for side-sleeping, because there is open space in front of the face when positioned properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 2016:  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it prevents wrinkles because I&#x27;ve only been using it a few months.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these pillows a few years ago from the same company which had a removable cover.</li>
            <li> but this one is washable so not a real problem.</li>
            <li> Pillow is a little flat</li>
            <li> I made (sewed) a cover for it, one side satin and the other side cotton.  </li>
            <li> If I sleep on my back it feels too hard under my neck and</li>
            <li> Too small, too thin, costs too much, doesn&#x27;t do any of what they claim.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money paid...or even $1.00.</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable to sleep on</li>
            <li> I sleep on my tummy and used to wake up every morning with creases down my face from smooshing it into the pillow.</li>
            <li> I prop up on a couple other my pillows and this little pillow</li>
            <li> I feel that it helps to prevent wrinkles along the nasal line but notice slight wrinkle line forming about an inch into my face from my earthat is vertical</li>
            <li> I have to fold it in half to feel like I&#x27;m using a pillow.</li>
            <li> I woke up with a slight headache also</li>
            <li> I have also noticed much less neck pain and headaches in the morning.</li>
            <li> It has less space for the face, which in the end makes my cheek still pressed to the pillow and leaves sleep</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even sleep with a pillow half the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and feel it might break down soon.  </li>
            <li> All I did was trace around the pillow on to the chosen fabrics, leaving a little opening to push the pillow through.  </li>
            <li> If you know a little about sewing, you can make a cover.  </li>
            <li> This took a little bit of getting used to</li>
            <li> , it is also pricy a little bit.</li>
            <li> I need or just another pillow to place it on that is a little lower.</li>
            <li> and I noticed I needed a little neck support.  </li>
            <li> it is just a flat weird weird shaped pillow and this pillow gets hot since it accumulates/absorbs the heat.</li>
            <li> Between the poor craftsmanship, the awkward shape and the cheap filling I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I have had this pillow for 12 months now and a few washings.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s overpriced for such a thin, flimsy pillow, it&#x27;s the cheapest of its type that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> however it is nothing that a few stitches cannot fix.</li>
            <li> It took me a few nights to get used to</li>
            <li> The satin on the pillow in opinion is a waste because I always put a removable cover on my pillows and it just gets covered up.</li>
            <li> Does the trick but its a little TOO SMALL.</li>
            <li> This is a very disappointing little string thing which didn&#x27;t hold up, even through the first washing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit lumpy and hard, and I don&#x27;t think I can get used to just resting my face in position on the little edges all night.</li>
            <li> but my neck is, well, not the ordinary and straighter than it should be doctors say.</li>
            <li> but this is insanely small</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> My complaints on this pillow are the size, which I consider is too small, and the material which also needs to be upgraded; I put it into another satin pillow case to preserve it because I dont trust the material it was made with...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure that, as I sleep, my head doesn&#x27;t get out of place and then the anti wrinkle aspect is lost.  </li>
            <li> It works but is small.</li>
            <li> it is so small</li>
            <li> No more smashed face.  </li>
            <li> No more pillow face wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> I figure at least it is doing its job part of the night.  </li>
            <li> This pillow was a really big disappointment.</li>
            <li> The pillow seems small but it does the trick!</li>
            <li> so I saw this one that was way less expensive than the cotton ones I had purchased over the years that they still sell.  </li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t complained about the theft!  </li>
            <li> The pillow is smaller than I thought which I found very disappointing.</li>
            <li> because it is almost impossible to keep the slippery pillow on my other pillow.</li>
            <li> Once I got over the shock at how thin it was (so thin it comes with a message assuring you that it fluffs up, which it does not) and tried it out</li>
            <li> I find the pillow too thin to raise my face off and stop it from creasing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, perhaps because I am on my slant pillow, it is always on the floor by morning either because it is slippery or because of my slant pillow or both.</li>
            <li> I ended up tossing and turning uncomfortably all night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I wake up with lines in weird places on my face...  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I was using it wrong</li>
            <li> After purchasing this pillow from the company website I was very disappointed in my purchase.  </li>
            <li> and I have seen improvement with those awful wrinkles when I smoosh my face when I sleep on my side.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not very comfortable to sleep on</li>
            <li> This would be great if it was not as flat as a pancake, I had to open it and add a little more stuffing</li>
            <li> I use the pillow right on top of my regular pillow and it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time.  If you believe satin helps your face when you sleep,&lt;br /&gt;Then you&#x27;ll totally believe that this is the holy grail!  Small size is the best!</li>
            <li> Mistake. Too small, too thin, costs too much, doesn&#x27;t do any of what they claim. Not for cradle for neck or face support. A real joke.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  Much better at preventing smoosh face than memory foam pillows.  Although a foam c-shaped neck pillow will work if u r on the cheap ;)</li>
            <li> This helps support my neck when I sleep. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have had this pillow for 12 months now and a few washings. The first washing I soaked it in a bucket and air dried it in the Southern California sun because I was scared the fabric would run and it would be a mass of threads.  The next time I washed it I put it in a lingerie bag and ran the washing machine on warm on the regular cycle. No shredding and both times it returned to its cushy softness. However this last time, post the cat attacking it, there was some shredding with the seamline opening where the cloth label was inserted. I don&#x27;t think all of it was cat related. I gathered up what stuffing I could find in the washer stuffed it back in and hand sewed with running stitches along the seam line to secure it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am familiar with the cotton version of this product and that one comes with a cotton pillow case and I have used that version for about 12 years buying a new one every couple of years. I ruined my last one by leaving the pillow case on when it went in the wash and that was the end of that pillow so I saw this one that was way less expensive than the cotton ones I had purchased over the years that they still sell.  Now if you are thinking you can order a pillow case to fit this from the cotton one the company sells, it will not fit and is a different shape with the arms longer and at a different curve so you will have to live with it as it is coverless unless they start to make a cover for this one. I still had my old cotton one so I saw directly that the cover would not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have never used this pillow or the other cotton one they sell directly as described, that is on top of another pillow. I have only used it alone on top of the mattress without a regular pillow. My neck somehow feels better that way but my neck is, well, not the ordinary and straighter than it should be doctors say. I feel that it helps to prevent wrinkles along the nasal line but notice slight wrinkle line forming about an inch into my face from my earthat is vertical but it is only visible when I don&#x27;t moisturize religiously.  But I am in my 60&#x27;s now and this is after using this type of pillow from this company for over 10 years. If I had only slept on my back, this would have not occurred, I would imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have acid reflux so I sleep with a slant pillow and put this satin pillow on top. Unfortunately, perhaps because I am on my slant pillow, it is always on the floor by morning either because it is slippery or because of my slant pillow or both. At one year out on my updated review here, it is still worth it though I have had to baby it along now after a year.  Maybe next time I wash it I will have to not leave it in so long in the machine and if I lose more stuffing perhaps picking up some of that at the craft store to boost it up. When it starts to hopelessly fray, I will have to let it go. The cat found a permanent loving home.</li>
            <li> Used on regular pillow as per instructions, keeps face and also high cheek bones from pressure of regular pillow!  Very happy.</li>
            <li> This may be OK as a travel pillow, but is not comfortable for regular sleeping. It&#x27;s a bit lumpy and hard, and I don&#x27;t think I can get used to just resting my face in position on the little edges all night.</li>
            <li> i wish you didn&#x27;t need to put on top of a regular pillow.  it makes it too high (for my taste) and slips around a bit.  I get used to it now and again and it&#x27;s fine and other times I have to take it away.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any great improvements in my skin but maybe it&#x27;s because i&#x27;m not using it consistently.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it prevents wrinkles because I&#x27;ve only been using it a few months. But I like it. I didn&#x27;t buy a cover, I simply put the pillow inside my regular pillow case with my regular pillow in there, too. Since the point of the pillow is to suspend your face between the &amp;#34;tentacles&amp;#34; having a silky pillowcase didn&#x27;t seem necessary. It took some trial and error to get it to the right position but it&#x27;s really comfortable. It&#x27;s pretty small and I can take it with me on trips. I don&#x27;t think of it as a replacement for a travel pillow.Quite the contrary, I use an inflatable pillow that I love; can&#x27;t see this one replacing that. However, it&#x27;s small enough to bring along to make any pillow comfortable with the added benefit not getting wrinkles while I travel.</li>
            <li> Really works! Used to get morning mush face, not anymore. And it&#x27;s pretty comfortable, too -- you just need a pretty flat pillow to set it on, or else your neck may get sore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s washable and doesn&#x27;t slip on to the floor. At last I can breathe while I sleep. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the pillow.  I would recommend it to others. It did what they advertised.</li>
            <li> Great pillow. Helps with sinus issues and you don&#x27;t wake up with wrinkles if you sleep on your side or stomach!</li>
            <li> bought this because I want a smaller pillow but this is insanely small</li>
            <li> This is A great way to keep from getting the overnight wrinkles in your face while getting a great nights sleep.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this pillow from the company website I was very disappointed in my purchase.  As a side sleeper, I have tried many anti-aging products and pillows, wanting to wake up without the sleep lines and puffiness.  Although this pillow is good in theory, it went flat after just a few weeks of use.  It is awkward finding a comfortable position and many nights I ended up tossing and turning uncomfortably all night. I wish it would have worked for me as I was very excited to try it out! Between the poor craftsmanship, the awkward shape and the cheap filling I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> While the original thought was \\&quot;it&#x27;s so much smaller than I&#x27;d expected\\&quot;, this pillow turned out to surpass expectations.  I love it!  It&#x27;s just the right size, provides very comfortable support, and encourages restful sleep.</li>
            <li> I used to wake up with lines on my face from my face being scrunched against my pillow.  Mind you, I&#x27;m only in my late 20s, but I&#x27;ve never been able to train myself to not sleep on my stomach or side.  This pillow has not only made it much safer for my face (I wake up with my skin completely smooth, despite still sleeping on my side), but it also made it much more comfortable to sleep.  It even makes sleeping on my back more comfortable.  I still do so very rarely, but I can finally see the potential for doing so more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;This pillow is great as a topper on a variety of pillows.  I use it on top of a foam pillow.  I bought one for my mother, who enjoys using it on top of a feather pillow.  My husband uses a bean-filled pillow and found this pillow to make it more comfortable to sleep on his side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NOT SO GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit slick, which makes it good for those who are looking to avoid/prevent wrinkles.  This makes it feel strange when you first start using it -- seems to slide out from underneath you.  However, once I got used to it, I&#x27;ve been grateful for the slickness.  Also, when you first use it, it seems odd to have your head supported mostly at the forehead and chin.  That too becomes more familiar as you continue to use it.  Lastly, you can&#x27;t really use any normal pillow cases with this, and the specific pillow cases are quite pricey.  However, the pillow itself is washable, though it takes a while to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give the pillow 5 stars, because for the price and its effects, its worth trying and getting used to it!  Many other pillows that claim to have similar effects are much more expensive (though I can&#x27;t say anything to their effectiveness).</li>
            <li> The product worked exactly as described.  I am a side sleeper and as a result I was starting to get some wrinkles from my face being smooshed against my pillow.  This pillow has saved my face from this and my wrinkles have faded.</li>
            <li> Great concept to wake up wrinkle free.  Needs a pillow case that needs to be made of non slippery material like cotton so that the pillow stays in place the whole night.  Otherwise, the pillow could end up anywhere else by the time you wake up.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this pillow.  I forget to bring mine with me for our winter home and had to buy another.  Love it!  Great neck support when folded for reading in bed.</li>
            <li> I have have used this pillow with the satin case for a few years and love it.  In addition to protecting your face from wrinkles, it is also easy on the hair-do.  So, two benefits in one pillow.  Also great when staying overnight in a hospital recliner.  It travels easily also.</li>
            <li> The pillow was flat like in other reviews. I bought this to see how well it work, and it works fine. Eventually I will purchase the more expensive pillows. I don&#x27;t wake up with wrinkles or lines. If you toss and turn this is not the pillow for you.  It needs to be placed on top of another flat pillow. And since its silk it can slip. I rarely have that happen, but it has happened a time or two. I also use it under my neck when I&#x27;m reading for better support and leverage.</li>
            <li> When I first got this pillow I loved it.  I&#x27;ve used it on the couch and in bed.  I have neck problems and need a lot of support under my neck.  For a while, it was fine, but then it just didn&#x27;t have enough support for me.  For comfort, it&#x27;s perfect.  For support, not so much unless you like it doubled over.  For me, doubled over was too much - no in-between.  I like it for the car, though.  I have thrown it in the washing machine and dryer, and it came out fine.  Had to work it around to get the filling back into the middle, but all-in-all, I like it.</li>
            <li> This is the smaller of the two pillows and I absolutely love it! I couldn&#x27;t decide between the large one or the smaller but I decided to go with the smaller because it was less expensive (in case I didn&#x27;t like it) and that I can use this on top of my other squishy pillow and I love how it keeps my face elevated off the pillow as to reduce smashing my face and getting those lovely lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m being smothered by my regular pillow. It normally stays put for the most part and I like that it is comfortable in all positions whether laying on my side or my back. The pillow seems small but it does the trick! I think it&#x27;s the perfect size. I have found that it really does reduce the creases and marks that can happen while sleeping.</li>
            <li> cute pillow ..Does the trick but its a little TOO SMALL.</li>
            <li> Once I got over the shock at how thin it was (so thin it comes with a message assuring you that it fluffs up, which it does not) and tried it out, I could tell that it relieved pressure on my eye area, cheeks, and naolabial folds. While it&#x27;s overpriced for such a thin, flimsy pillow, it&#x27;s the cheapest of its type that I&#x27;ve seen. Used on top of another pillow, it&#x27;s just barely thick enough to keep my face elevated. I put it inside a regular pillowcase which helps with the slipping. I&#x27;m a very restless sleeper and it took me about two weeks to get through a whole night without switching to a normal pillow, but now I&#x27;m quite used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, this isn&#x27;t a quick-fix. You have to commit to using this pillow for life if you want to reap the benefits. With that in mind, it may be worth the money to buy a better one. But for the time being, having already adjusted to it, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I recommend to everyone that sleeps with their face smooshed into a regular pillow, also small enough to pack and washes well.</li>
            <li> Just the pillow does&#x27;t allow for a case to change and wash.  It works for my breathing problem and I find it great for allowing me to drop easily into sleep and allow deeper breathing.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and feel it might break down soon.  Too soon to see how effective a product it is right now.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my husband as he was always stealing mine.  He likes it as it really helps his neck.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pillow! I have been sleeping with it for several months now. I&#x27;m a side sleeper and I have seen improvement with those awful wrinkles when I smoosh my face when I sleep on my side. Get a pillow case.</li>
            <li> Too small. Buy a silk pillowcase instead for your preferred pillow size.</li>
            <li> Pillow is a little flat but I think that it does work as advertised.  Hasn&#x27;t torn up yet so it&#x27;s ok.  I have to fold it in half to feel like I&#x27;m using a pillow.</li>
            <li> If you are a side-sleeper, this pillow works well on top of another regular pillow.  It is comfortable to use, but doesn&#x27;t stay in place the entire night.  (It might stay in place better if only one side - the side where you put your face - were satin and the back side cotton)  I figure at least it is doing its job part of the night.  I&#x27;ve also found it&#x27;s a little easier to breathe when using it for side-sleeping, because there is open space in front of the face when positioned properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 2016:  I made (sewed) a cover for it, one side satin and the other side cotton.  When using that cover, the pillow stays in place perfectly.  All I did was trace around the pillow on to the chosen fabrics, leaving a little opening to push the pillow through.  Cut out fabric slightly wider than those lines, sew on the lines (make the cover slightly larger than the actual pillow) and that&#x27;s it!  If you know a little about sewing, you can make a cover.  Good Luck.</li>
            <li> Love this pillow, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Kept sliding off in middle of night.  Could never find pillow in the darkness of the room....was forever looking for it.  Gave it away.  Not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> This took a little bit of getting used to but now I can&#x27;t sleep without it. I sleep on my tummy and used to wake up every morning with creases down my face from smooshing it into the pillow. This pillow supports my head and neck really well without being too firm. I don&#x27;t know if it does a lot for wrinkles yet but prevention is always better than cure!</li>
            <li> A great buy for this pillow.</li>
            <li> We have all known pillows like this. I sleep on my face so I sometimes wake up looking like I have been in a bar fight which is not feminine. I thought this pillow may help but by itself it&#x27;s too flat and with my skinniest pillow it&#x27;s too fat. Whatever I do it seems to either impede my sleep or wind up on the floor under a dog. The dog&#x27;s face always looks great so maybe it&#x27;s working for him. Your results may be better if you are a cooperative sleeper...apparently I am not. I give it three stars because it makes a decent travel pillow on an airplane.</li>
            <li> I wanted a pillow like this as long as I can remember. Nice and comfortable, it doesn&#x27;t leave marks in the mouth area when I sleep but one thing did actually bother me a lot, it is &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; small, I get up of my sleep just to put it in the right position again and again, it is also pricy a little bit.</li>
            <li> This does help save your face.  I wake up with no crease marks on my cheeks and I feel rested.</li>
            <li> This pillow is great. It does take a little getting use to but it is worth it. This pillow is particularly useful if you are a side sleeper and you get &amp;#34;injectables&amp;#34; so not to damage the product placement. It has started to come apart at the seam after about a year and I only wash it in a lingerie bag however it is nothing that a few stitches cannot fix. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this new pillow!</li>
            <li> I was sold on this pillow and got it to help prevent facial wrinkles and such. It took me a few nights to get used to but it was fairly comfortable. I did not like the material. It doesn&#x27;t seem to breath and snags very easily. It would be nice if this had a washable cover that you could remove. I had to wash the whole thing, I do this once a week. It does not wash well. It came out all lumpy. The first washing wasn&#x27;t bad, after a night sleeping on it and smashing it down it was comfortable again. After a few more washings it is not holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;Another issue I have is I don&#x27;t ever wake up with it under my head. It seems to slide around. It may slip out right after I fall asleep, so what good is it doing me?&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this pillow. Maybe if it had a removable cover that you could wash.</li>
            <li> This little pillow is so comfortable! I slept the first night almost until morning without tossing and turning and I can&#x27;t remember the last time that happened. I slept so deep that I also slept an hour later than usual. My pillow didn&#x27;t move once the entire night. It perfectly cradles my face and keeps the area around my eyes from touching the pillow. I sleep on top of a &amp;#34;my pillow&amp;#34; pillow. It&#x27;s almost a tad too high but keeps me off my shoulders and wow was it comfortable! My second night involved minor tossing and turning but I didn&#x27;t lose my pillow once. I woke up with a slight headache also but I think it&#x27;s a new neck I need or just another pillow to place it on that is a little lower. When I&#x27;m watching TV before bed I prop up on a couple other my pillows and this little pillow just supports my neck so nicely. You can turn your face a little to the sides and it&#x27;s perfect comfort and keeps your face off anything that can create the fine lines and wrinkles. I sleep mostly on my side but occasionaly end up on my back and when I woke up I was perfectly on the my pillow supporting my neck. I really do love this thing and it will be great if I stay the night elsewhere or travel! One thing is there is about an inch section that has strange seems on it. It appears that they added more stuffing to it or it was possibly returned so I hope that part holds up with the washing of it. I couldn&#x27;t be happier over all with the pillow and the customer service!</li>
            <li> Perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your quick response to my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your very creative design!!! What a difference!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kindest regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JM</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite understand how this works but it does. I haven&#x27;t woken up with swelling or lines since I got it. Finding a comfortable spot is a little tricky but I&#x27;ve managed. Will be purchasing a back up.</li>
            <li> First, I got such a great service - I had a time limit which I failed to see when I placed the order. Linda made a special effort and send my order on Saturday instead of Monday, and the package arrived within 2 days, it was so helpful and so kind, as she did not request extra for the service. Plus, I love my pillow, so comfy and it is keeping my face with the cream on...I don&#x27;t have it for a long time but it seems helpful so far to preserve my face.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found this years ago! Product meets description provided. Delivered on time - no issues with the purchase itself. I have to say that the wrinkles around my eyes are noticeably decreased, and I am sleeping better. I think I was so self conscious about the wrinkles forming that it was affecting my sleep. I have also noticed much less neck pain and headaches in the morning. Very pleased with the product!!</li>
            <li> I like the pillow although it does take some getting used to. Once properly positioned it does appear to protect the face from getting &amp;#34;squashed&amp;#34; like it would on a regular pillow. My one criticism is that the cover is not removable making it necessary to purchase a separate cover. I bought one of these pillows a few years ago from the same company which had a removable cover. I know the pillow is machine washable but it still would be nice to have the option of a zippered cover. The satin on the pillow in opinion is a waste because I always put a removable cover on my pillows and it just gets covered up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this pillow for 13 years and that is why people think I&#x27;m 10 years younger. For women who sleep on their side, its a must have. The Petite works better than the other. Just put it on top of your regular pillow . It will take about 2-3 weeks to get use to. But its a natural cure for wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have to put this pillow on top of another soft pillow to get the necessary support for my neck.  I sleep on my sides and since I started using it, I&#x27;ve noticed my face looks fresher in the morning. My complaints on this pillow are the size, which I consider is too small, and the material which also needs to be upgraded; I put it into another satin pillow case to preserve it because I dont trust the material it was made with...</li>
            <li> I wear eyelash extensions and this pillow is highly recommanded for maintaining the extensions and not wrinkling my face. I bought it and used it....nope...not working as described. it is just a flat weird weird shaped pillow and this pillow gets hot since it accumulates/absorbs the heat.</li>
            <li> I started developing the sleep lines that no longer would go away in couple of hours, so I went on a quest to find a solution. This pillow was my first choice.&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, first thing I noticed was it was too small and too flat. You will have to use it on top of your regular pillow, unless you like to sleep on the flat surface without any support. I gave this pillow 3 night trial. Since I toss and turn at night, I ended up waking up twice during the first night, because this pillow would slide off my main pillow, since it has satin pillowcase which is very slippery. In the morning, I DID notice less obvious sleep lines around my nose, which got me really excited. In the next two nights, I ended up waking up in the morning with this pillow on the floor, with my dog comfortably sleeping on it. I just couldn&#x27;t keep it on my main pillow through the night. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;It does work if you are a cooperative sleeper and don&#x27;t turn at night like I do.&lt;br /&gt;The concept is great and it does work if you can stay in one place all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy their larger pillow and it didn&#x27;t work either. It has less space for the face, which in the end makes my cheek still pressed to the pillow and leaves sleep lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I should just make my own pillow at this point or learn to sleep on the back.</li>
            <li> I really do.  I use one myself.  Got this for my daughter for Christmas, but now realize I should have gotten the pillow case cover as well.  I&#x27;m not sure how they can justify the ones including the case cost so much just because the case is included, there&#x27;s no way they cost that much to make, but I guess that&#x27;s how they stay in business.</li>
            <li> I bought the smaller pillow and it is just right for me.  I guess with this smaller pillow you&#x27;re supposed to use it on top of a regular pillow, but that would be too much height for me.  At this smaller size, by itself, I can sleep on my back and not have my head cranked too far up. It supports my neck and that&#x27;s what I really want.  Maybe if you sleep on your side you might need the extra height, to keep your head properly aligned.  I also sleep on my stomach, and it seems to work pretty well that way too.  However, it takes a little more getting my head in just the right place and I&#x27;m not sure that, as I sleep, my head doesn&#x27;t get out of place and then the anti wrinkle aspect is lost.  If that&#x27;s the case, I look at it as, some protection is better than no protection.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve looked at a lot of pillows.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this pillow would really be any good, but it was inexpensive and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Glad I did. Much better than I expected. I really like it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B006IHI8VW Just the Pillow for $19.99]]&lt;br /&gt;I used this pillow in my Dermatologist&#x27;s office and had to have one. It has been twelve years and I am definetely sold.  I will never sleep on another pillow. I have several and even keep one in my luggage. It certainly beats those big thick gigantic pillows that do havoc to your neck and crowsfeet all night long.</li>
            <li> This pillow was a really big disappointment. If I sleep on my back it feels too hard under my neck and if I use it on my side I have to make sure my face is in the exact spot it should be which wakes me up too much during the night, and also makes me too aware of staying that way so I don&#x27;t  get a restful sleep. I get better results just sleeping on my back with a regular pillow.</li>
            <li> This pillow travels with me.  It is best used on top of  a soft pillow.  Great for a side or stomach sleeper.  Eliminated sleep lines on my face!</li>
            <li> DOESNT come w a pillow cover.  Feels like it&#x27;s shrinking/losing it&#x27;s shape when I put it in the wash, as the woman on the phone suggested.  That being said... I tell everyone about it.  Just wish I&#x27;d bought the bigger one (wish a washable cover)</li>
            <li> I was developing sleep lines on my face.  This pillow stopped the damage.  It will take a while to get rid of the ones I had before using the pillow.  I should have used it earlier.  My recommendation:  don&#x27;t wait until sleep lines form.  It&#x27;s hard to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> In retrospect, I&#x27;m surprised how comfy this pillow is. This could have been annoying but it slips right under my head and neck, my face doesnt really touch the pillow except at the temple, and I&#x27;m supported perfectly. It stays in place quite well, the satin makes it cool. I&#x27;ve been using it about a week. It seems well made. I can bend it to be a neck support easily and it bounces right back.</li>
            <li> Soft material, no funky odors, and can be folded or twisted into so many positions to get just the support you want.</li>
            <li> I use this pillow on top of it&#x27;s larger counterpart.  I tried it on top of a traditional bed pillow but it just didn&#x27;t work for me and it&#x27;s too flat to use alone.  I used to wake up with my face all scrunched up from my regular pillow but this pillow works great and now I wake up without all of the wrinkles and creases from my old pillow.  My husband has tried to steal it to use with his cpap machine but he&#x27;ll have to get his own...</li>
            <li> Nice satin pillow huge difference on my face and no marks when I wake up in the am!:)</li>
            <li> I have been using the safe - my -face pillow for a year and the results on my face are amazing!! You will wake up without extra lines caused by the linen and the skin looks refreshed . I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> So far I love the pillow, its very comfortable and easy to sleep on...I don&#x27;t feel like I wake up with lines in weird places on my face...  The pillow was affordale which I loved as well... Joy E</li>
            <li> It helps prevent wrinkles, especially if you&#x27;re a side sleeper. Prevents your face from getting squished by the pillow. Also, makes it easier to breathe, keeps your face from sinking into the pillow.</li>
            <li> I find the pillow too thin to raise my face off and stop it from creasing in the morning.  It would work much better if it was thicker.</li>
            <li> Too flat, too slippery, just not worth it.  I don&#x27;t think it actually does anything for the wrinkles on my face either!</li>
            <li> I would use it laying on the side of my face and I still feel like it was squishing my eye area. I don&#x27;t know if I was using it wrong but I just didn&#x27;t see the difference between that and another pillow.</li>
            <li> It works but is small.</li>
            <li> i love it, It is great, comfortable and really works protecting lash extensions.&lt;br /&gt;really easy to take with you while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;It should come with a  pillowcase...</li>
            <li> I have seen this and wanted it for many years and now have bought one for myself.  I like this.  I like to sleep on my side.  I do hope it does help with facial wrinkles.  I don&#x27;t know yet.</li>
            <li> The pillow is great.  I love it.  I can&#x27;t believe my head stays on the pillow it is so small but it does.  I take it with me when I am away from home.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  I have sleep apnea and it is a great fit for sleeping with the hose and mask.  Highly recommend for apnea patients!</li>
            <li> Too small and too thin to be effective.</li>
            <li> Had neck surgery and thought this would help but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t get comfortable on it at all. Would not recommend&lt;br /&gt;this pillow at all.</li>
            <li> I love this pillow! I&#x27;m 29 and I was waking up with huge sleep wrinkles on my face that I know in time would become permanent. This pillow is comfortable to sleep with and I no longer wake up with the sleep wrinkles. It contours around your face perfectly so it gives your neck and head support without smashing into your face. I use it on top of my regular pillow. I&#x27;m going to purchase some more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review, but I thought this product was worth my time to endorse.  I am 53 and decided to address the face that I have am starting to notice face creases on the one side of my face that I sleep one.  I ordered and received this product in October 2012--using it four months, and I must say that it has many benefits.  Not only does it stop you from sleeping on your face, it will also perserve your hairstyle as you are not sleeping on your hair, but a surprising benefit was that it helps with nasal allergies as my nose is elevated from the pillow, which is helping with my nasal allergies.  I currently own the le Petite and want to use that one for travel and I want to use the larger one for home!.  Great idea!</li>
            <li> The pillow is smaller than I thought which I found very disappointing. I do like the soft satin cover on the pillow</li>
            <li> Just what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li> I slept on it one night and my husband decided he&#x27;d try it.  He has 3 herniated discs in his neck and has lots of headaches.  It has really been helping him not to wake up with headaches so I haven&#x27;t complained about the theft!  He puts it on top of his pillow since it&#x27;s not very tall and it works great for him.</li>
            <li> I kept waking up with deep creases in my face, but luckily, I have oily skin.  So, I would just massage the oils into the crease.  I sleep in the free fall sleep position!  I sleep on my stomach with my face in the pillow and my head turned to the side.  This smashed my face into the pillow or mattress.  Sometimes, I didn&#x27;t use a pillow.  The La Petite pillow is great.  It supports my neck.  I don&#x27;t use it on top of a regular pillow because like another reviewer said... that would be too much height for me!  I don&#x27;t even sleep with a pillow half the time.  A lot of times, I would bunch up the covers near my face and cuddle with them, because I don&#x27;t like much height.  This pillow is perfect.  It&#x27;s perfect because I&#x27;m someone who doesn&#x27;t really like a pillow for much height, anyway.  The La Petite suspends your face.  No more smashed face.  Also, I had been sleeping without a pillow and I noticed I needed a little neck support.  This pillow is perfect for that.  :)  You can also fold the pillow for neck support if you want to sleep on your back or if you lay the pillow flat and sleep in the middle of the pillow, it&#x27;s comfortable, too.  In my opinion, there is three ways to sleep with this pillow.  This is a wonderful pillow...  It does what it says...  I sleep on my face.  This pillow suspends your face!  Perfect!  No more pillow face wrinkles.  I&#x27;m sure this will prevent pre-mature wrinkles (which would have been caused by my sleep position).</li>
            <li> A Little Too Small to comfortably support the face in the correct position when side sleeping.  Maybe just my problem, but did not like it.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot- surprised how much I do!</li>
            <li> Although I love the concept, I have a suggestion for the manufacturer. Attach an elastic band (either removeable with snaps etc.) because it is almost impossible to keep the slippery pillow on my other pillow. I can&#x27;t sleep flat on the Just the Pillow, so I have a delemma. I coul sew elastic  it on myself but it would be great if it came that way.</li>
            <li> Pillow is flimsy, slippery and makes you too warm.  Constantly slips off the bed and ends up on the floor more than my head.</li>
            <li> So comfy, love it and highly reccomend this pillow to prevent wrinkles on the side of your face while you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Wake up and no wrinkles</li>
            <li> I love my little pillow.  I have TMJ disorder and it really helps that.    It also works great for a neck support while traveling.  There is one with a cover which I should have spent this extra to buy but this one is washable so not a real problem.</li>
            <li> This is a very disappointing little string thing which didn&#x27;t hold up, even through the first washing. Definitely not worth the money paid...or even $1.00.</li>
            <li> I think if I bought the pillow cover casing to fit snugly over this pillow, it would be firmer and more useful.  It feels a bit flimsier than the first one I bought but still decent idea behind it.</li>
