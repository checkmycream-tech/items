    <ol>
            <li>I just sit in front of the TV with my mirror and remove my face hair with this awesome product.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Thank you for this great product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best way for me to removed hair.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Very happy customer</li>
            <li>Otherwise it works just perfect..</li>
            <li>This threading tool is awesome and its great in every way!</li>
            <li>Wonderful creation!</li>
            <li>Happy customer !</li>
            <li>i must say, THIS IS THE BEST THREADING PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Best for face and neck.</li>
            <li>This is the best tool.</li>
            <li>She is very happy with this product too.  </li>
            <li>The best hair removal ever.</li>
            <li>Recommend Using this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>You have to try this awesome</li>
            <li>tool is the best method of hair removal from the face without pain or side effects for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li>Wonderful</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve recommended this tool to some of those who couldn&#x27;t do threading by themselves and they&#x27;ve paid me a good compliment!</li>
            <li>Also, there are how-to-videos to watch on their website and they have great customer service.</li>
            <li>and for twenty bucks I thought it was a great deal.</li>
            <li>I am happy when I think of all the money I will save it pays for itself.  </li>
            <li>Finally....i am happy</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as great as thread in a fabric store.</li>
            <li>The Helix takes some time getting used to, but watching the video helps a great deal.</li>
            <li>this product is great</li>
            <li>Before, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with it.  </li>
            <li>If you have a brave family member who will let you practice on them, it is easier to learn how to thread on another person.  </li>
            <li>This thing is great to do it on yourself, however...</li>
            <li>The thread isn&#x27;t great either.</li>
            <li>It is a great idea and it will save a lot of fingers cuts from the thread.</li>
            <li>I am happy for my purchases and they came with a storage pouch and thread.</li>
            <li>Saves a lot of money and works great.</li>
            <li>With the face, its great.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found this tool!!</li>
            <li>Helix Threadease is amazing!</li>
            <li>so amazing!</li>
            <li>but once I clicked on the link and looked on the website I thought what an amazing invention!  </li>
            <li>I will practice more before I do my eyebrows, but I am confidence that it will work perfect just from the results I have achieved  already.</li>
            <li>Very Very happy :))))</li>
            <li>Once you get coordinated hand movements, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>A good product.</li>
            <li>its really good if you want to learn how to thread.</li>
            <li>, the thread wasnt that good</li>
            <li>but it work good.</li>
            <li>My mom loved it.</li>
            <li>la parte superior de labios en la parte superior de ceja, y eso era demasiado para mis dedos.</li>
            <li>Good product that helps you with threading if you have difficulty doing it with just the thread.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t as easy as they make it seem!!</li>
            <li>Very good and easy to use, you just need to watch the video and follow the steps.</li>
            <li>i appreciate that the product was exceptionally described and how i received it with no excuses in between and in promised time.  </li>
            <li>Of course it takes some time to get used to and practice makes perfect, but it is totally worth it if you like to be in control of your threading.</li>
            <li>But otherwise I am very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>Another reason I&#x27;m so happy about this product is because this works 100x better than waxing and using products like Nair when it would leave some hair still.</li>
            <li>:) I totally love it!!</li>
            <li>Very handy, better than using your fingers.  </li>
            <li>I really love Helix Threadease and can&#x27;t stop raving about it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I decided to buy this!</li>
            <li>Now, I love it now!  </li>
            <li>and i love it!</li>
            <li>It is wayyy better than tweezing and healthier than waxing!</li>
            <li>, however i still think it&#x27;s pretty Awesome.</li>
            <li>After months I can tell you that I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it !</li>
            <li>but this is helping me and hopefully soon I will be able to thread without using this too!</li>
            <li>I have to say that all it took was just two views of the videos that they had recommended to be able to effectively and successfully use the threading tool with no complications..</li>
            <li>Sometimes I would burn my face or sometimes it worked amazingly well.</li>
            <li>It works amazing â™¡</li>
            <li>I can do it all on my own..</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work...ESPECIALLY on your own face.</li>
            <li>I use a spring for hair removal, I can do my own waxing and can thread with my hands (which hurts and burns after a while).  </li>
            <li>I found this to be an effective tool for hair removal which is why I give it four stars.</li>
            <li>Watch the video before you use it and if you have seen people thread you would kind of have an idea how to use it.</li>
            <li>Really nice product.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the innovative Helix Threadease.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt much and works just perfect :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also the cotton thread that they give you breaks easily, luckily I just happened to have some polyester thread that worked great.</li>
            <li>The thread they send with this breaks very easily.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, I used it on my legs and the results were better than waxing!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and effective to remove even the most stubborn peach fuzz!</li>
            <li>finally able to thread my own face.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, when I bought the product I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper, and more effective.</li>
            <li>its affordable and its so easy to use!</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product very easy to use and very light weight</li>
            <li>Perhaps I need to practice my technique some more, but I can&#x27;t say this made threading my eyebrows very easy at all.</li>
            <li>then I am sure you can use it very easily.</li>
            <li>I could get it to work, yes, but I wasn&#x27;t able to maneuver it very easily to get all the areas that I wanted to thread, and with accuracy.  </li>
            <li>First off, let me just tell you how great of a concept this is..</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and the handles cause blistering on thumbs.</li>
            <li>me tell you is a good product and is very easy on the right side</li>
            <li>its very easy to use, and its give you amazing feeling after you clean your face</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Much better than waxing and pulling the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll become more proficient.</li>
            <li>After that, I started doing threading instead which is much better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this item.</li>
            <li>So, I always thread my eye brows, however I never was able to do it my self ..</li>
            <li>Just make sure u don&#x27;t start with ur eyebrows ..</li>
            <li>Sincerely Luis Aleman</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so glad I found the Helix Threadese Tool.</li>
            <li>Just wish the thread they sent with it was more durable..</li>
            <li>I will get better thread when this runs out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT, this thing is WONDERFUL for anything else (upper lip, face, etc.).</li>
            <li>Threading is wonderful and it is a while before the hair grows back (longer hair-free period than waxing).</li>
            <li>just need to find a better thread.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use it on my legs, but that&#x27;s not what I purchased the Helix for.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>With practice I am now able to remove hair from my chin and over my lip.</li>
            <li>i found this :)</li>
            <li>i love the thread that it comes with</li>
            <li>i love this tool since i&#x27;ve seen the video...</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I think if someone else does it for you it would be better.</li>
            <li>This works even better because I can get closer to my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>But no problem I will buy one more :)</li>
            <li>Maybe one day I&#x27;ll get more use out of it.</li>
            <li>This item is working for my wife she love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but glad that I got refund.</li>
            <li>It IS OKAY if you do have moisturizer on your face.  </li>
            <li>It works perfectly for me on the coarse hairs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a bit of a learning curve but if you are persistent and use it more than two times you will soon figure out how to master it.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was just me, but I could not get it to pull more than maybe one hair</li>
            <li>Make sure the hair you want to pluck</li>
            <li>but with practice I am sure I will be able to do that as well.</li>
            <li>The lady would always ask if I&#x27;m OK.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have plenty of time to learn how to thread if you&#x27;re a beginner.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works, but for some reason I can not get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>so i just got a better quality at the beauty supply and it worked.  </li>
            <li>It takes two or three times to become an expert :)</li>
            <li>I watched the video many times.</li>
            <li>the top part of the brow and mustache....</li>
            <li>you and God Bless :)</li>
            <li>ordered 2 more for my sisters &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love being able to take care of this embarrassing issue in the privacy of my home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried many time to use it, it was a hassle experience.</li>
            <li>Makes the threading service I offer sanitary and my clients love it.</li>
            <li>You will need to buy a better thread than what comes with the kit.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have more control.</li>
            <li>I just need to practice to have a better coordination in my hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will take much more practice.  </li>
            <li>UNDER the brow, align the TOP sting with your brow arch.  </li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li>After earning the unenviable nickname of &amp;#34;Butterfingers&amp;#34; as a kid, I can&#x27;t tell you how many times me and my fumblefingers have messed up crafts projects, beading, etc.</li>
            <li>Give this product a try, and I bet you&#x27;ll have better luck with it than I did.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who gets threading, this is a MUST buy!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so you are able to use the product</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the look of threaded eyebrows but cannot always go because of my kids.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need more practice.</li>
            <li>It could be my technique and it is definitely better than using your hands</li>
            <li>I also wasn&#x27;t so sure about the thread that came with.</li>
            <li>After watching online videos and much practice, I am happy to say this product works well for me.</li>
            <li>most convience time for me.  </li>
            <li>I Love this product, and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Make sure you watch the videos.</li>
            <li>I probably need to do a lot more practice for this to work for me.</li>
            <li>didnt like it very much, could be good for someone else found it vwry hrd to use or get used to</li>
            <li>Does a pretty good job</li>
            <li>but I feel I did a good job on my first try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it seems to work easily for others.  </li>
            <li>So many people said that it was easy.</li>
            <li>I rather just thread regarly using my hands, doesn&#x27;t cut my fingers and is more precise than this helix..</li>
            <li>Most important-</li>
            <li>its a huge money saver &amp; its great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>After watching the demo videos, I tried threading for the first time with this tool and I am in love!</li>
            <li>When i found this I was really excited to be able to do threading at home</li>
            <li>Was the simplest, most straightforward thing</li>
            <li>This is a great product easy to use so easy my 14 year old nephew could use it he helped me get those fine hairs from underneath my chin.</li>
            <li>Not as easy to use as it looks.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and quite straighforward otherwise.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how easy this was to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy hair remover.</li>
            <li>If I put it to my eyebrow, I could easily remove all the hair....and the eyebrow itself.</li>
            <li>We did purchase some stronger thread and find the product to be easy to use in the privacy of our home.</li>
            <li>, it was shipped/delivered very quickly, so that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
            <li>Practice makes the tool easy</li>
            <li>It makes threading at home so easy.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use and it saved time and money...</li>
            <li>I have never threaded before or been threaded on, but all my girlfriends have raved about it and how easy it is to do yourself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO easy.</li>
            <li>the ladies at the salons make it look so easy.</li>
            <li>threads in the pack are not too strong.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re fine.)</li>
            <li>Helix Threadease is so easy and comfortable to use</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to get the threads to move smoothly like they do in the instruction video.</li>
            <li>Overall great product..  </li>
            <li>All you need is a light dust of powder - don&#x27;t pour it on.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even bother because it isn&#x27;t precise.</li>
            <li>This will fit neatly into my toiletry bag for travel, in my purse, will store neatly in the bathroom drawer.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT that I will DEFINITELY recommend to my girls!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I watched the you tube video on how to use it to make sure I was using right</li>
            <li>Easy to use and removes hair quickly</li>
            <li>SUPER easy to set up.  </li>
            <li>I would also like to add that the sellers were extremely friendly with answering my questions</li>
            <li>When i placed my order i was excited to receive my product.  </li>
            <li>i was overwhelmed when i received it on time as promised i was also very pleased to know that the company was working efficiently and professionally in getting my Helix Threadease.  </li>
            <li>I had been extremely excited to get this home and try it out.</li>
            <li>Ok, first of all, I&#x27;d like to answer:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it and it works very well!</li>
            <li>Originally purchasing this kit to save money...</li>
            <li>, I am FREE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to creators of Helix threadease for having this amazing idea and making it into such a lovely product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Additionally, The system was not doing a good job threading my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>Cool.</li>
            <li>You get better with time and it is an absolute life saver....</li>
            <li>With this tool, I&#x27;m in control and can work on it as much as I would like until I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>Pleased with my purchase, again after much practice.</li>
            <li>Sometimes... Because it does make me able to thread my own eyebrows, which is very good, because threading is really expensive out here, in California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to people who REALLY insist on threading, but are broke.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I had some mild redness</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product.  </li>
            <li>also works very well for your eyebrows which it is initially designed for and it works great on your legs as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Helix Threading System has it&#x27;s own video, but the \\&quot;real users\\&quot; videos on Youtube are SO much better - especially as they give you invaluable tips and tricks.  </li>
            <li>Threasd breaks easily and it is just too large to do eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Its super fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something a little more beginner friendly but the learning curve seems kind of steep.</li>
            <li>Slowly, with the help of these videos and with practice, you will be able to thread and shape your own eyebrows!  </li>
            <li>Best part is that it will same me money and time in the long run.</li>
            <li>After the first try, I was hooked!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>The Helix Threadease Hair Removal tool works exactly as described!  </li>
            <li>Unit is too large to use comfortably.  </li>
            <li>It took a little bit of practice but it works great.</li>
            <li>When i first began looking on amazon for products that worked LIKE threading, i ran across the threadease but skimmed over it thinking it was nothing special.</li>
            <li>I am kind of obsessed and love to use it because the results are amazing</li>
            <li>not working great waste of money, mine still here never use it after one time</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>i completely fell in love with this</li>
            <li>it, its worth it</li>
            <li>You just have to make sure when you use the tool that you place the V part of the thread near the hair you want to remove and wala its gone.</li>
            <li>this product is worth getting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this would be easier if someone used it on you, but as far as going solo...</li>
            <li>the learning curve is worth it.</li>
            <li>Much easier when you need a quick clean up before going out.</li>
            <li>I think I own 7 different pairs of tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s growing back in nicely.</li>
            <li>Does require some practice, but is worth it.</li>
            <li>easy, quickly, and didn&#x27;t leave pimples on my sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>right is sugar waxing.   </li>
            <li>I ordered it right away and tried it the day I received it.</li>
            <li>She caught on right away, she did her cheek and lip.</li>
            <li>It cost me a ton, and they didn&#x27;t always get it right.</li>
            <li>The major problems I run into are the thread breaking and not being able to grasp the hair around my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>however the videos online are pretty useful.</li>
            <li>Always make sure that you carefully read and follow the instructions and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>This product is hands down the BEST beauty product I have purchased in so long.</li>
            <li>i like it very much ..</li>
            <li>Its great because it removes all those thins hairs that are so hard to get with tweezers.</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn my skin and left my legs really smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saving so much $$ a month!  </li>
            <li>Start practicing on ur legs and thugs first ..</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love this product and will be using it all the time!</li>
            <li>I can actually thread with more accuracy using this tool</li>
            <li>*)  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t removed it from the drawer since the first time I tried it...</li>
            <li>It took around 45 minutes the first time I tried this...</li>
            <li>The thread, because of the ridges, is more likely to break, but since it works so well, I don&#x27;t mind looping another piece of thread through.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>For the price of the product Helix should have included higher quality string.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even use it on someone else&#x27;s eyebrows, they will be very upset with the results!</li>
            <li>is that I still had to wait until most of the hairs grow back, as going to the salon and paying Â£30 every week</li>
            <li>hairs should be pretty grown in order to wax it clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Takes some practice but does the job - make sure to use regular threadand NOT tthe one it comes with</li>
            <li>I go into my salon  for a full face once a month, and normally do an at home touch up in between.</li>
            <li>First impression: it comes with no directions</li>
            <li>The key- if you&#x27;re doing the TOP of your brown, just align the LOWER string with your brow arch.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for reading my review!</li>
            <li>Stay away from the eyebrows at first.</li>
            <li>I can say that these are exactly as pictured but for me they seem to get in the way.</li>
            <li>but it was not hard especially since doing my own threading is cheaper than having to pay a salon to do it.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product on facial hair.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this tool was going to be great, but after using it a few times, a problem developed.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is beautifully designed to get the same results you get done professionally from a threading salon.</li>
            <li>And even though it was my first time working with the tool, it took me only 15 mins to adapt and get really speedy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I am skeptical about the bottom of eyebrows but am sure the top can be done easily.</li>
            <li>I watched a couple of videos online before deciding to buy the product mainly because I was wondering if it was worth 20 bucks + shipping (it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and the money spent was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Not only was it easy to use, but it&#x27;s really affordable when you think of all the money you will be saving by making trips the salon, plus tips and gas!  </li>
            <li>I like threading because it is fast, effective, and lasts longer than other methods.  </li>
            <li>Whether you are threading or tweezing, use a MAGNIFIED mirror to better help you see the hairs you are trying to grab - especially the short, light, or baby</li>
            <li>i always wanted to learn but would give up pretty soon, not because the hair pulling was too much to handle, but because the thread always cuts into the fingers.</li>
            <li>I really like this product at first</li>
            <li>So anyway, I&#x27;ve seen alot of tutorials on youtube about the product as well and see only so many can really do the brow area because you have to pull it up in order to get the hair and might get too much of it or whateva.</li>
            <li>I think it was super clever how they came up with this tool, and highly recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li>I watched the video twice for instructions and thought it looked easy enough</li>
            <li>The plastic scrapes the thread every time you open and close, so it rips easily.</li>
            <li>it definitely doesn&#x27;t look as easy as it does.&lt;br /&gt;need</li>
            <li>Only problem is the string rips too easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth in usage that I could do my entire face threading for the first time all by myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I will have to go back to having them done at a salon because I just didn&#x27;t find them easy for me to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to learn how to use, and so far I&#x27;ve gotten all the hair off my chin, neck, upper lip, and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Not to mention its a fairly large gadget.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fairly familiar with how the general concept works.</li>
            <li>I can work fine on my upper lips.</li>
            <li>So when I got this, I was really excited, since I had to wax my &#x27;stache every week.. which sucked and was a huge mess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try again as it very well could be user error.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Smooth, hair-free facial skin without any breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this tool.  </li>
            <li>your eyelid skin is very susceptible to getting caught up in the thread.</li>
            <li>I really like  the Helix Threadease.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend you using this on your eyebrows unless you are an absolute pro.</li>
            <li>I have never threaded myself before, but the information they give you to find their tutorial videos online was much appreciated.</li>
            <li>It is very helpful.</li>
            <li>This tool make it so much</li>
            <li>Fantastic product especially for beginners like me!</li>
            <li>does not work if you really want it to work.</li>
            <li>I use this  to make the hair line of my beard straight.</li>
            <li>It was just too much of a learning curve I guess.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>string.&lt;br /&gt;I found everything to work really well except for the string.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bulky, using fingers is much easier for me.</li>
            <li>fast shipping also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really on the fence with this item.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a real challenge.  </li>
            <li>But this tool made it very easy.however</li>
            <li>much easier.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li>can feel myself a real woman now!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I am saving so much money.</li>
            <li>and it really helped me understand how to use this product.</li>
            <li>Really like this.</li>
            <li>It looked promising</li>
            <li>With Helix become easier to do it in all my face, in fact I didn&#x27;t feel too much pain.</li>
            <li>I saved so much by using this tool.</li>
            <li>took one point off because it really didn&#x27;t work on my body hair, legs or armpits</li>
            <li>really I was waiting it ASAP</li>
            <li>Really I have tried And for the life of me cannot figure out how to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They help so much.</li>
            <li>LOL seriously!</li>
            <li>But overall I am happy, I have very sensetive skin, with this I sufer very little to no irritation at all</li>
            <li>I love this product and recommend to other women.</li>
            <li>Sure there are other threaders out there, but have you seen the price and read the reviews?  </li>
            <li>I got this product very fast, and tried it immediately on clean, dry, powdered skin.</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t recommend is having a clean face, even though they tell you different, because after it&#x27;s done it keeps your face tender, longer.</li>
            <li>If you are light-skinned, turn red easily, or are of any other complexion and have never threaded before, I suggest you thread your eyebrows the day before you attend an important event or go to work...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was skeptical at first because it just looked too easy, but when I got the product two days later and used it for the first time I was so pleased!</li>
            <li>Certainly I&#x27;m not as thorough as the professional which is probably why I had so much redness, but I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Portable, Durable, Easy to use...What else is expected...</li>
            <li>You can actually thread anywhere on your body, but most people stick to threading only on their face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;two days ago, on my birthday, before we went out, I was able to thread all of my facial hair (neck, chin, upper lip,under the lower lip, sideburns,cheeks, forehead, under the eyes)</li>
            <li>: sure, it&#x27;s simple to use, you open and close your hands.</li>
            <li>I practiced and practice, but couldn&#x27;t get the thread to slid smoothly and had trouble finding the right angle to remove chin hairs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!ould leave some hair still.</li>
            <li>I think I had high expectations for this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend  the R.E.M spring sprong instead.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>With a little bit more practice, I feel like I am going to become an expert threading.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like a little padding on the inside of the grip for comfort and better use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>kind of hard to get the threader to twist and grab hairs will keep trying I guess it takes a lot of practice</li>
            <li>Plus I felt really embarrassed when some people or even beauticianists would stare at me and get surprised how \\&quot;hairy\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I thought this would work out for me, but by the time I got this thing to work, to tell you the truth, I was kind of anxious getting these things too near my face.</li>
            <li>I do think it&#x27;s critical that you have some prior experience or exposure to threading to better understand the process to complete this on yourself.</li>
            <li>But as soon as I found out about this item, I didn&#x27;t hesitate one second and purchased this item right away.  </li>
            <li>If you give up right away, you will definitely not like the</li>
            <li>I actually had more precision and success when I threaded by hand in the past.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gained new clients by pointing out the benefits of my threading services.  </li>
            <li>easy to set-up less than five minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I first tried the Helix Threadese Tool after visiting my dermatologist last month.</li>
            <li>At first it&#x27;ll take a while to use and to actually get all the hairs</li>
            <li>However, whether you are a beginner or expert, this system becomes easy to use with a little bit of practice.  </li>
            <li>If the string hadn&#x27;t broken so quickly, because of that plastic manufacturing mold-seam, I would have given it a 5-star review, easily.  </li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly, but was missing the thread.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get all the hairs on the bottom side of my eyebrows because I had no hands free for holding the skin tight</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of bulky and large so positioning the threads is difficult.</li>
            <li>It is more painful, but the end result is a much better one.  </li>
            <li>I have terribly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I will give you a heads up though as far as the thread that came with it</li>
            <li>Within a few minutes my chin was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>i suggest everybody who wants to get rid of their facial hair to BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>With the thread ease, i can take care of my facial hair in about ten-twenty minutes without too much pain or cleanup.</li>
            <li>It is saving me with the cuts on my figures which frequently happen during self threading.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just easier to keep going to a professional.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t wax or use chemicals</li>
            <li>But: there are no guidelines on how much thread to use, the length, directions on how to do different areas, etc.</li>
            <li>Professional waxing has ruined my skin by leaving scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really hurts your fingers after a short time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the old fashioned method with my fingers and cotton thread.</li>
            <li>ok I got this product because I m tired to pay to much on my eyebrows</li>
            <li>Now, the only money i spend on threading is for my eyebrows because 1) i dont have enough experience to shape my eyebrows the right way and 2) because i would need another person to hold my eyelid and forehead for me.</li>
            <li>But most importantly no more shame when going on the streets, chatting with my friends, going on a date and worrying if they can see that stubble on my face!</li>
            <li>Previously, I was using this system just for the purpose of doing a quick clean-up job on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>One thing to note: the shorter the string the better, especially if you have small hands.</li>
            <li>It definitely saves me and will continue to save me money and also time because it takes a lot of effort to constantly go to the mall last minute and back home before an important event.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes, the rings are too big and bulky causing my hands to cramp.</li>
            <li>I spent most of my time re threading the little tool.  </li>
            <li>And it actually did!&lt;br /&gt;I know it might sound a little bit too much for such a simple thing like hair removal tool BUT not for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes threading so easy it is hard when you d it by ur bare hands your fingers will scream!</li>
            <li>especially the eyelid part as it is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>It was very hard to use and the directions could have been better.</li>
            <li>Not to mention when i use it right, my skin has far less irritation than tweezing and waxing!</li>
            <li>I have been familiar with threading for a few years and it is my method of choice for tweezing facial hair.</li>
            <li>I like this product, and it was worth the money, but It took a little while to get used to using it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really hard to reach hairs on your neck or jaw bone, specially the areas near the ears.</li>
            <li>But I find this product useless because you can do the same thing with your fingers and get alot better result because this product is large and restrictive.</li>
            <li>I decided to stop seeing the professional threader because of the severe red bumps, and also the cumulative cost, so I decided to buy this product, plus she could not get my eyebrows quite the way I like.</li>
            <li>than I could with my bare hands -- I wouldn&#x27;t have dared to attempt threading my eyebrows before..</li>
            <li>have a very excessive hair growth on my face, and for me learning how to thread my whole face by myself was one of the main new years&#x27; resolutions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also have the GiGi wax system and it&#x27;s to messy and at times can discolor skin or burn if the heat settings aren&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li>The Helix Threadease has made it alot easier to remove/thread facial hair; I mainly use it for upper lip and my upper eyebrow.</li>
            <li>The only problem I found with this was that the thread was too thin, but it did work better than a thicker thread.</li>
            <li>Total waste of money, not even worth 2 cents.</li>
            <li>I will say that it was a little tricky to use at first</li>
            <li>I noticed that the thread wasn&#x27;t sliding smoothly and quickly anymore, thereby making it very difficult to use.</li>
            <li>However, it does take practicing to get used to, so don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t get it the first few times.</li>
            <li>ghetto like cut some duck tape and wrap it around that area so it wouldn&#x27;t saw down as fast, would work hmmmmm.</li>
            <li>It is too thin and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>As someone who has NEVER threaded, it took me about 4 minutes to get the basic gist of the motion and method and and pull my first few hairs.  </li>
            <li>Yes it takes a bit of practice, but after just a few minutes I got it down and now my face is smooth and I&#x27;m feeling</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that the thread they give you is so thin that it breaks way too easily.</li>

            <li> You have to try this awesome</li>
            <li> tool is the best method of hair removal from the face without pain or side effects for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li> Wonderful</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve recommended this tool to some of those who couldn&#x27;t do threading by themselves and they&#x27;ve paid me a good compliment!</li>
            <li> Also, there are how-to-videos to watch on their website and they have great customer service.</li>
            <li> and for twenty bucks I thought it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> I am happy when I think of all the money I will save it pays for itself.  </li>
            <li> Finally....i am happy</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as great as thread in a fabric store.</li>
            <li> The Helix takes some time getting used to, but watching the video helps a great deal.</li>

            <li> This thing is great to do it on yourself, however...</li>
            <li> The thread isn&#x27;t great either.</li>
            <li> It is a great idea and it will save a lot of fingers cuts from the thread.</li>
            <li> I am happy for my purchases and they came with a storage pouch and thread.</li>
            <li> Saves a lot of money and works great.</li>
            <li> With the face, its great.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found this tool!!</li>
            <li> Helix Threadease is amazing!</li>
            <li> so amazing!</li>
            <li> but once I clicked on the link and looked on the website I thought what an amazing invention!  </li>
            <li> I will practice more before I do my eyebrows, but I am confidence that it will work perfect just from the results I have achieved  already.</li>
            <li> Very Very happy :))))</li>
            <li> Once you get coordinated hand movements, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> A good product.</li>
            <li> its really good if you want to learn how to thread.</li>
            <li> , the thread wasnt that good</li>
            <li> but it work good.</li>
            <li> My mom loved it.</li>
            <li> la parte superior de labios en la parte superior de ceja, y eso era demasiado para mis dedos.</li>
            <li> Good product that helps you with threading if you have difficulty doing it with just the thread.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t as easy as they make it seem!!</li>
            <li> Very good and easy to use, you just need to watch the video and follow the steps.</li>
            <li> i appreciate that the product was exceptionally described and how i received it with no excuses in between and in promised time.  </li>
            <li> Of course it takes some time to get used to and practice makes perfect, but it is totally worth it if you like to be in control of your threading.</li>
            <li> But otherwise I am very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Another reason I&#x27;m so happy about this product is because this works 100x better than waxing and using products like Nair when it would leave some hair still.</li>
            <li> :) I totally love it!!</li>
            <li> Very handy, better than using your fingers.  </li>
            <li> I really love Helix Threadease and can&#x27;t stop raving about it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to buy this!</li>
            <li> Now, I love it now!  </li>
            <li> and i love it!</li>
            <li> It is wayyy better than tweezing and healthier than waxing!</li>
            <li> , however i still think it&#x27;s pretty Awesome.</li>
            <li> After months I can tell you that I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it !</li>
            <li> but this is helping me and hopefully soon I will be able to thread without using this too!</li>
            <li> I have to say that all it took was just two views of the videos that they had recommended to be able to effectively and successfully use the threading tool with no complications..</li>
            <li> Sometimes I would burn my face or sometimes it worked amazingly well.</li>
            <li> It works amazing â™¡</li>
            <li> I can do it all on my own..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work...ESPECIALLY on your own face.</li>
            <li> I use a spring for hair removal, I can do my own waxing and can thread with my hands (which hurts and burns after a while).  </li>
            <li> I found this to be an effective tool for hair removal which is why I give it four stars.</li>
            <li> Watch the video before you use it and if you have seen people thread you would kind of have an idea how to use it.</li>
            <li> Really nice product.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the innovative Helix Threadease.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt much and works just perfect :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also the cotton thread that they give you breaks easily, luckily I just happened to have some polyester thread that worked great.</li>
            <li> The thread they send with this breaks very easily.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, I used it on my legs and the results were better than waxing!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective to remove even the most stubborn peach fuzz!</li>
            <li> finally able to thread my own face.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, when I bought the product I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper, and more effective.</li>
            <li> its affordable and its so easy to use!</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product very easy to use and very light weight</li>
            <li> Perhaps I need to practice my technique some more, but I can&#x27;t say this made threading my eyebrows very easy at all.</li>
            <li> then I am sure you can use it very easily.</li>
            <li> I could get it to work, yes, but I wasn&#x27;t able to maneuver it very easily to get all the areas that I wanted to thread, and with accuracy.  </li>
            <li> First off, let me just tell you how great of a concept this is..</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and the handles cause blistering on thumbs.</li>
            <li> me tell you is a good product and is very easy on the right side</li>
            <li> its very easy to use, and its give you amazing feeling after you clean your face</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Much better than waxing and pulling the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll become more proficient.</li>
            <li> After that, I started doing threading instead which is much better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item.</li>
            <li> So, I always thread my eye brows, however I never was able to do it my self ..</li>
            <li> Just make sure u don&#x27;t start with ur eyebrows ..</li>
            <li> Sincerely Luis Aleman</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so glad I found the Helix Threadese Tool.</li>
            <li> Just wish the thread they sent with it was more durable..</li>
            <li> I will get better thread when this runs out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT, this thing is WONDERFUL for anything else (upper lip, face, etc.).</li>
            <li> Threading is wonderful and it is a while before the hair grows back (longer hair-free period than waxing).</li>
            <li> just need to find a better thread.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use it on my legs, but that&#x27;s not what I purchased the Helix for.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> With practice I am now able to remove hair from my chin and over my lip.</li>
            <li> i found this :)</li>
            <li> i love the thread that it comes with</li>
            <li> i love this tool since i&#x27;ve seen the video...</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I think if someone else does it for you it would be better.</li>
            <li> This works even better because I can get closer to my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> But no problem I will buy one more :)</li>
            <li> Maybe one day I&#x27;ll get more use out of it.</li>
            <li> This item is working for my wife she love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but glad that I got refund.</li>
            <li> It IS OKAY if you do have moisturizer on your face.  </li>
            <li> It works perfectly for me on the coarse hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a bit of a learning curve but if you are persistent and use it more than two times you will soon figure out how to master it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just me, but I could not get it to pull more than maybe one hair</li>
            <li> Make sure the hair you want to pluck</li>
            <li> but with practice I am sure I will be able to do that as well.</li>
            <li> The lady would always ask if I&#x27;m OK.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have plenty of time to learn how to thread if you&#x27;re a beginner.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works, but for some reason I can not get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> so i just got a better quality at the beauty supply and it worked.  </li>
            <li> It takes two or three times to become an expert :)</li>
            <li> I watched the video many times.</li>
            <li> the top part of the brow and mustache....</li>
            <li> you and God Bless :)</li>
            <li> ordered 2 more for my sisters &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love being able to take care of this embarrassing issue in the privacy of my home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried many time to use it, it was a hassle experience.</li>
            <li> Makes the threading service I offer sanitary and my clients love it.</li>
            <li> You will need to buy a better thread than what comes with the kit.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have more control.</li>
            <li> I just need to practice to have a better coordination in my hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will take much more practice.  </li>
            <li> UNDER the brow, align the TOP sting with your brow arch.  </li>
            <li> Try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> After earning the unenviable nickname of &amp;#34;Butterfingers&amp;#34; as a kid, I can&#x27;t tell you how many times me and my fumblefingers have messed up crafts projects, beading, etc.</li>
            <li> Give this product a try, and I bet you&#x27;ll have better luck with it than I did.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who gets threading, this is a MUST buy!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so you are able to use the product</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the look of threaded eyebrows but cannot always go because of my kids.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need more practice.</li>
            <li> It could be my technique and it is definitely better than using your hands</li>
            <li> I also wasn&#x27;t so sure about the thread that came with.</li>
            <li> After watching online videos and much practice, I am happy to say this product works well for me.</li>
            <li> most convience time for me.  </li>
            <li> I Love this product, and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Make sure you watch the videos.</li>
            <li> I probably need to do a lot more practice for this to work for me.</li>
            <li> didnt like it very much, could be good for someone else found it vwry hrd to use or get used to</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job</li>
            <li> but I feel I did a good job on my first try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it seems to work easily for others.  </li>
            <li> So many people said that it was easy.</li>
            <li> I rather just thread regarly using my hands, doesn&#x27;t cut my fingers and is more precise than this helix..</li>
            <li> Most important-</li>
            <li> its a huge money saver &amp; its great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> After watching the demo videos, I tried threading for the first time with this tool and I am in love!</li>
            <li> When i found this I was really excited to be able to do threading at home</li>
            <li> Was the simplest, most straightforward thing</li>
            <li> This is a great product easy to use so easy my 14 year old nephew could use it he helped me get those fine hairs from underneath my chin.</li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as it looks.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and quite straighforward otherwise.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy this was to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy hair remover.</li>
            <li> If I put it to my eyebrow, I could easily remove all the hair....and the eyebrow itself.</li>
            <li> We did purchase some stronger thread and find the product to be easy to use in the privacy of our home.</li>
            <li> , it was shipped/delivered very quickly, so that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
            <li> Practice makes the tool easy</li>
            <li> It makes threading at home so easy.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and it saved time and money...</li>
            <li> I have never threaded before or been threaded on, but all my girlfriends have raved about it and how easy it is to do yourself.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO easy.</li>
            <li> the ladies at the salons make it look so easy.</li>
            <li> threads in the pack are not too strong.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re fine.)</li>
            <li> Helix Threadease is so easy and comfortable to use</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get the threads to move smoothly like they do in the instruction video.</li>
            <li> Overall great product..  </li>
            <li> All you need is a light dust of powder - don&#x27;t pour it on.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even bother because it isn&#x27;t precise.</li>
            <li> This will fit neatly into my toiletry bag for travel, in my purse, will store neatly in the bathroom drawer.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT that I will DEFINITELY recommend to my girls!&lt;br</li>

            <li> SUPER easy to set up.  </li>
            <li> I would also like to add that the sellers were extremely friendly with answering my questions</li>
            <li> When i placed my order i was excited to receive my product.  </li>
            <li> i was overwhelmed when i received it on time as promised i was also very pleased to know that the company was working efficiently and professionally in getting my Helix Threadease.  </li>
            <li> I had been extremely excited to get this home and try it out.</li>
            <li> Ok, first of all, I&#x27;d like to answer:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it and it works very well!</li>
            <li> Originally purchasing this kit to save money...</li>
            <li> , I am FREE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to creators of Helix threadease for having this amazing idea and making it into such a lovely product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Additionally, The system was not doing a good job threading my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Cool.</li>
            <li> You get better with time and it is an absolute life saver....</li>
            <li> With this tool, I&#x27;m in control and can work on it as much as I would like until I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Pleased with my purchase, again after much practice.</li>
            <li> Sometimes... Because it does make me able to thread my own eyebrows, which is very good, because threading is really expensive out here, in California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to people who REALLY insist on threading, but are broke.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I had some mild redness</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product.  </li>
            <li> also works very well for your eyebrows which it is initially designed for and it works great on your legs as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Helix Threading System has it&#x27;s own video, but the \\&quot;real users\\&quot; videos on Youtube are SO much better - especially as they give you invaluable tips and tricks.  </li>
            <li> Threasd breaks easily and it is just too large to do eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Its super fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little more beginner friendly but the learning curve seems kind of steep.</li>
            <li> Slowly, with the help of these videos and with practice, you will be able to thread and shape your own eyebrows!  </li>
            <li> Best part is that it will same me money and time in the long run.</li>
            <li> After the first try, I was hooked!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> The Helix Threadease Hair Removal tool works exactly as described!  </li>
            <li> Unit is too large to use comfortably.  </li>
            <li> It took a little bit of practice but it works great.</li>
            <li> When i first began looking on amazon for products that worked LIKE threading, i ran across the threadease but skimmed over it thinking it was nothing special.</li>
            <li> I am kind of obsessed and love to use it because the results are amazing</li>
            <li> not working great waste of money, mine still here never use it after one time</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> i completely fell in love with this</li>
            <li> it, its worth it</li>
            <li> You just have to make sure when you use the tool that you place the V part of the thread near the hair you want to remove and wala its gone.</li>
            <li> this product is worth getting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this would be easier if someone used it on you, but as far as going solo...</li>
            <li> the learning curve is worth it.</li>
            <li> Much easier when you need a quick clean up before going out.</li>
            <li> I think I own 7 different pairs of tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s growing back in nicely.</li>
            <li> Does require some practice, but is worth it.</li>
            <li> easy, quickly, and didn&#x27;t leave pimples on my sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> right is sugar waxing.   </li>
            <li> I ordered it right away and tried it the day I received it.</li>
            <li> She caught on right away, she did her cheek and lip.</li>
            <li> It cost me a ton, and they didn&#x27;t always get it right.</li>
            <li> The major problems I run into are the thread breaking and not being able to grasp the hair around my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> however the videos online are pretty useful.</li>
            <li> Always make sure that you carefully read and follow the instructions and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> This product is hands down the BEST beauty product I have purchased in so long.</li>
            <li> i like it very much ..</li>
            <li> Its great because it removes all those thins hairs that are so hard to get with tweezers.</li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn my skin and left my legs really smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving so much $$ a month!  </li>
            <li> Start practicing on ur legs and thugs first ..</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love this product and will be using it all the time!</li>
            <li> I can actually thread with more accuracy using this tool</li>
            <li> *)  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t removed it from the drawer since the first time I tried it...</li>
            <li> It took around 45 minutes the first time I tried this...</li>
            <li> The thread, because of the ridges, is more likely to break, but since it works so well, I don&#x27;t mind looping another piece of thread through.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> For the price of the product Helix should have included higher quality string.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even use it on someone else&#x27;s eyebrows, they will be very upset with the results!</li>
            <li> is that I still had to wait until most of the hairs grow back, as going to the salon and paying Â£30 every week</li>
            <li> hairs should be pretty grown in order to wax it clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes some practice but does the job - make sure to use regular threadand NOT tthe one it comes with</li>
            <li> I go into my salon  for a full face once a month, and normally do an at home touch up in between.</li>
            <li> First impression: it comes with no directions</li>
            <li> The key- if you&#x27;re doing the TOP of your brown, just align the LOWER string with your brow arch.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for reading my review!</li>
            <li> Stay away from the eyebrows at first.</li>
            <li> I can say that these are exactly as pictured but for me they seem to get in the way.</li>
            <li> but it was not hard especially since doing my own threading is cheaper than having to pay a salon to do it.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product on facial hair.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this tool was going to be great, but after using it a few times, a problem developed.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is beautifully designed to get the same results you get done professionally from a threading salon.</li>
            <li> And even though it was my first time working with the tool, it took me only 15 mins to adapt and get really speedy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am skeptical about the bottom of eyebrows but am sure the top can be done easily.</li>
            <li> I watched a couple of videos online before deciding to buy the product mainly because I was wondering if it was worth 20 bucks + shipping (it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and the money spent was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Not only was it easy to use, but it&#x27;s really affordable when you think of all the money you will be saving by making trips the salon, plus tips and gas!  </li>
            <li> I like threading because it is fast, effective, and lasts longer than other methods.  </li>
            <li> Whether you are threading or tweezing, use a MAGNIFIED mirror to better help you see the hairs you are trying to grab - especially the short, light, or baby</li>
            <li> i always wanted to learn but would give up pretty soon, not because the hair pulling was too much to handle, but because the thread always cuts into the fingers.</li>
            <li> I really like this product at first</li>
            <li> So anyway, I&#x27;ve seen alot of tutorials on youtube about the product as well and see only so many can really do the brow area because you have to pull it up in order to get the hair and might get too much of it or whateva.</li>
            <li> I think it was super clever how they came up with this tool, and highly recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li> I watched the video twice for instructions and thought it looked easy enough</li>
            <li> The plastic scrapes the thread every time you open and close, so it rips easily.</li>
            <li> it definitely doesn&#x27;t look as easy as it does.&lt;br /&gt;need</li>
            <li> Only problem is the string rips too easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth in usage that I could do my entire face threading for the first time all by myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I will have to go back to having them done at a salon because I just didn&#x27;t find them easy for me to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to learn how to use, and so far I&#x27;ve gotten all the hair off my chin, neck, upper lip, and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Not to mention its a fairly large gadget.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m fairly familiar with how the general concept works.</li>
            <li> I can work fine on my upper lips.</li>
            <li> So when I got this, I was really excited, since I had to wax my &#x27;stache every week.. which sucked and was a huge mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try again as it very well could be user error.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Smooth, hair-free facial skin without any breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this tool.  </li>
            <li> your eyelid skin is very susceptible to getting caught up in the thread.</li>
            <li> I really like  the Helix Threadease.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend you using this on your eyebrows unless you are an absolute pro.</li>
            <li> I have never threaded myself before, but the information they give you to find their tutorial videos online was much appreciated.</li>
            <li> It is very helpful.</li>
            <li> This tool make it so much</li>
            <li> Fantastic product especially for beginners like me!</li>
            <li> does not work if you really want it to work.</li>
            <li> I use this  to make the hair line of my beard straight.</li>
            <li> It was just too much of a learning curve I guess.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> string.&lt;br /&gt;I found everything to work really well except for the string.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bulky, using fingers is much easier for me.</li>
            <li> fast shipping also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really on the fence with this item.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a real challenge.  </li>
            <li> But this tool made it very easy.however</li>
            <li> much easier.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li> can feel myself a real woman now!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I am saving so much money.</li>
            <li> and it really helped me understand how to use this product.</li>
            <li> Really like this.</li>
            <li> It looked promising</li>
            <li> With Helix become easier to do it in all my face, in fact I didn&#x27;t feel too much pain.</li>
            <li> I saved so much by using this tool.</li>
            <li> took one point off because it really didn&#x27;t work on my body hair, legs or armpits</li>
            <li> really I was waiting it ASAP</li>
            <li> Really I have tried And for the life of me cannot figure out how to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They help so much.</li>
            <li> LOL seriously!</li>
            <li> But overall I am happy, I have very sensetive skin, with this I sufer very little to no irritation at all</li>
            <li> I love this product and recommend to other women.</li>
            <li> Sure there are other threaders out there, but have you seen the price and read the reviews?  </li>
            <li> I got this product very fast, and tried it immediately on clean, dry, powdered skin.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t recommend is having a clean face, even though they tell you different, because after it&#x27;s done it keeps your face tender, longer.</li>
            <li> If you are light-skinned, turn red easily, or are of any other complexion and have never threaded before, I suggest you thread your eyebrows the day before you attend an important event or go to work...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical at first because it just looked too easy, but when I got the product two days later and used it for the first time I was so pleased!</li>
            <li> Certainly I&#x27;m not as thorough as the professional which is probably why I had so much redness, but I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Portable, Durable, Easy to use...What else is expected...</li>
            <li> You can actually thread anywhere on your body, but most people stick to threading only on their face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;two days ago, on my birthday, before we went out, I was able to thread all of my facial hair (neck, chin, upper lip,under the lower lip, sideburns,cheeks, forehead, under the eyes)</li>
            <li> : sure, it&#x27;s simple to use, you open and close your hands.</li>
            <li> I practiced and practice, but couldn&#x27;t get the thread to slid smoothly and had trouble finding the right angle to remove chin hairs.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!ould leave some hair still.</li>
            <li> I think I had high expectations for this.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend  the R.E.M spring sprong instead.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> With a little bit more practice, I feel like I am going to become an expert threading.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like a little padding on the inside of the grip for comfort and better use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> kind of hard to get the threader to twist and grab hairs will keep trying I guess it takes a lot of practice</li>
            <li> Plus I felt really embarrassed when some people or even beauticianists would stare at me and get surprised how \\&quot;hairy\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I thought this would work out for me, but by the time I got this thing to work, to tell you the truth, I was kind of anxious getting these things too near my face.</li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s critical that you have some prior experience or exposure to threading to better understand the process to complete this on yourself.</li>
            <li> But as soon as I found out about this item, I didn&#x27;t hesitate one second and purchased this item right away.  </li>
            <li> If you give up right away, you will definitely not like the</li>
            <li> I actually had more precision and success when I threaded by hand in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gained new clients by pointing out the benefits of my threading services.  </li>
            <li> easy to set-up less than five minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I first tried the Helix Threadese Tool after visiting my dermatologist last month.</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;ll take a while to use and to actually get all the hairs</li>
            <li> However, whether you are a beginner or expert, this system becomes easy to use with a little bit of practice.  </li>
            <li> If the string hadn&#x27;t broken so quickly, because of that plastic manufacturing mold-seam, I would have given it a 5-star review, easily.  </li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly, but was missing the thread.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get all the hairs on the bottom side of my eyebrows because I had no hands free for holding the skin tight</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kind of bulky and large so positioning the threads is difficult.</li>
            <li> It is more painful, but the end result is a much better one.  </li>
            <li> I have terribly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I will give you a heads up though as far as the thread that came with it</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes my chin was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> i suggest everybody who wants to get rid of their facial hair to BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> With the thread ease, i can take care of my facial hair in about ten-twenty minutes without too much pain or cleanup.</li>
            <li> It is saving me with the cuts on my figures which frequently happen during self threading.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just easier to keep going to a professional.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t wax or use chemicals</li>
            <li> But: there are no guidelines on how much thread to use, the length, directions on how to do different areas, etc.</li>
            <li> Professional waxing has ruined my skin by leaving scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it really hurts your fingers after a short time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the old fashioned method with my fingers and cotton thread.</li>
            <li> ok I got this product because I m tired to pay to much on my eyebrows</li>
            <li> Now, the only money i spend on threading is for my eyebrows because 1) i dont have enough experience to shape my eyebrows the right way and 2) because i would need another person to hold my eyelid and forehead for me.</li>
            <li> But most importantly no more shame when going on the streets, chatting with my friends, going on a date and worrying if they can see that stubble on my face!</li>
            <li> Previously, I was using this system just for the purpose of doing a quick clean-up job on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> One thing to note: the shorter the string the better, especially if you have small hands.</li>
            <li> It definitely saves me and will continue to save me money and also time because it takes a lot of effort to constantly go to the mall last minute and back home before an important event.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, the rings are too big and bulky causing my hands to cramp.</li>
            <li> I spent most of my time re threading the little tool.  </li>
            <li> And it actually did!&lt;br /&gt;I know it might sound a little bit too much for such a simple thing like hair removal tool BUT not for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes threading so easy it is hard when you d it by ur bare hands your fingers will scream!</li>
            <li> especially the eyelid part as it is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to use and the directions could have been better.</li>
            <li> Not to mention when i use it right, my skin has far less irritation than tweezing and waxing!</li>
            <li> I have been familiar with threading for a few years and it is my method of choice for tweezing facial hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product, and it was worth the money, but It took a little while to get used to using it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really hard to reach hairs on your neck or jaw bone, specially the areas near the ears.</li>
            <li> But I find this product useless because you can do the same thing with your fingers and get alot better result because this product is large and restrictive.</li>
            <li> I decided to stop seeing the professional threader because of the severe red bumps, and also the cumulative cost, so I decided to buy this product, plus she could not get my eyebrows quite the way I like.</li>
            <li> than I could with my bare hands -- I wouldn&#x27;t have dared to attempt threading my eyebrows before..</li>
            <li> have a very excessive hair growth on my face, and for me learning how to thread my whole face by myself was one of the main new years&#x27; resolutions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also have the GiGi wax system and it&#x27;s to messy and at times can discolor skin or burn if the heat settings aren&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li> The Helix Threadease has made it alot easier to remove/thread facial hair; I mainly use it for upper lip and my upper eyebrow.</li>
            <li> The only problem I found with this was that the thread was too thin, but it did work better than a thicker thread.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money, not even worth 2 cents.</li>
            <li> I will say that it was a little tricky to use at first</li>
            <li> I noticed that the thread wasn&#x27;t sliding smoothly and quickly anymore, thereby making it very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> However, it does take practicing to get used to, so don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t get it the first few times.</li>
            <li> ghetto like cut some duck tape and wrap it around that area so it wouldn&#x27;t saw down as fast, would work hmmmmm.</li>
            <li> It is too thin and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> As someone who has NEVER threaded, it took me about 4 minutes to get the basic gist of the motion and method and and pull my first few hairs.  </li>
            <li> Yes it takes a bit of practice, but after just a few minutes I got it down and now my face is smooth and I&#x27;m feeling</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the thread they give you is so thin that it breaks way too easily.</li>
            <li> This is really hard to get right.</li>
            <li> I used to thread with my bare hands, but never could last very long before my fingers got swollen and sore from thread burn.  </li>
            <li> I think this is due to me being a complete novice and not holding the string close to my skin, as well as trying to master the motion.  </li>
            <li> I have also tried using a long piece of thread and then looping it twice around, and that actually works for the bigger hairs.</li>
            <li> The videos are super-helpful and it is hard at first to thread</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to get a hang of at first.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to use at first, but once you get the swing off things no problems.</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying this because of the mixed reviews and some people having trouble mastering this tool, but I needed to try something new in hair removal.</li>
            <li> Remember, threading is slightly painful and it&#x27;s easy for beginners to thread too much hair and botch their results.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what to really write.</li>
            <li> product fully take off the hair and the hair takes a long time to grow back</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s anything wrong with the product itself because that woild be true if you were threading without it, so that&#x27;s why I give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to take my Dremel to it and just smooth that ridge down on the inside and maybe swab a little almond or tea tree oil, just to lube it up and make the thread slide a little</li>
            <li> The chin area is difficult to do , but iits never seemed like it was easy to do even when the pros did it..</li>
            <li> After looking at it closely, I realized that the thread was actually \\&quot;sawing\\&quot; (or perhaps partially melting from friction generated heat) fairly deep grooves into the plastic inside the loop that holds the thread.</li>
            <li> Also, it was delivered to me the next day, days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It does take a few tries to get the hang of it, but once you do, it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li> Only down side so far to me is the sawing down of the product where the string hook on to, but why make anything so it can last forever?!</li>
            <li> If you have absolutely no tolerance for pain, stick to your current method.  </li>
            <li> You can also thread on the go, whereas you can&#x27;t wax on the go, and tweezing often takes long if you are restricted by time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the threading tool i have been searching for for so long now.</li>
            <li> and that was after several tries.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t hurt the hands if you use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am disappointed about is that you cant do underneath your OWN eyebrows with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to hurt overall but in my opinion the pain was worse because I washed my face first rather then not doing that like I used to do</li>
            <li> But I circumvented this problem by using one of the red plasticky things and wrapping the other thread that is holding the loop onto my fingers.</li>
            <li> I am used to going to the salon to get my brows and other facial hair done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to tackling my eyebrows and the few coarse hairs I get on my chin and upper lip.  </li>
            <li> It is only a few hours later</li>
            <li> Not a big deal because you can buy your own, but just an annoying thing I had to go replace.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just left a mess and took to long.</li>
            <li> I used them and ended up threading off half of my left eyebrow.</li>
            <li> I thought these was super weird looking from a distance</li>
            <li> very hard to use - not really a substitute for the real thing.</li>
            <li> Doing it by hand is significantly harder and longer to learn.  </li>
            <li> It does just what i expected.  </li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Making the time to travel to the place and all the money spent, I researched where I could learn to thread.</li>
            <li> I give it a 3 out of 5, only because it was missing a piece of the order.</li>
            <li> simple!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried using thread alone before, but it&#x27;s heck of a lot harder.</li>
            <li> are a few tips for everyone, but especially for beginners!&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Notice in the product picture that the string loop is as wide as her forehead.</li>
            <li> but it isnt rough on the skin which i like</li>
            <li> My skin was red for a few seconds and that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I find the threadease is cumbersome and harder to control.</li>
            <li> and I could only do it for a few minutes before I would get cuts on my fingers or they would get extremely irritated.</li>
            <li> This is so much more efficient than tweezing and much less painful than other hair removal techniques.</li>
            <li> I see from other customer reviews that no one else has mentioned this problem, so perhaps my threaders are just defective.</li>
            <li> i bought 2 kits &lt; one for me and the other as a gift&gt; ,</li>
            <li> In the beginning, if you are not able to thread the extra hairs under your eyebrows, just use a tweezer.  </li>
            <li> Or, I am not agile enough to work this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t try other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> you have to use enough thread to create space between the &amp;#34;cutting section&amp;#34; of the thread in order to get into the small angled areas of your forehead.  </li>
            <li> I also watched the tutorials as wells as videos from other reviewers of the product.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Helix because the thread is sharp on your fingers</li>
            <li> ordered the Helix Threadease after reading reviews between it, other threading tools and the hand method.  </li>
            <li> This I can see is due to it rubbing on the plastic seam ridge from the manufacture process.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much less than other methods and with no residual pain.  </li>
            <li> it work as well as the woman demoing it, but I personally don&#x27;t want to work that hard in my attempts</li>
            <li> I have larger hands and still had a hard time using this</li>
            <li> but I still get bad red bumps that last a 5-7 days when I go to a professional threader.   </li>
            <li> The frustration is not worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> not worth buying it.&lt;br /&gt;I returned after 1-trial</li>
            <li> Threading is a form of art that usually requires experts to take month long classes.  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH BUYING.</li>
            <li> i came back to amazon to look for yet ANOTHER product (the first one failed miserably) and looked more into the threadease.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all</li>
            <li> it is much mor complicated...</li>
            <li> average cost was $25 each time I visited the salon.  </li>
            <li> but it not worth the waiting time .</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> When you pinch down on one side, it will grab the hairs and pull them out from the root.  </li>
            <li> I used to have tears flowing down my face while getting this done at the mall</li>
            <li> My sister is hopeful she&#x27;ll get it down.</li>
            <li> and I have my eyebrows down pat.  </li>
            <li> I put them down and went to play with The Donut, my Wonder Cat.</li>
            <li> but the left is a little hard for me</li>
            <li> If I used less pressure or held the tool looser</li>
            <li> My knuckles hurt from the plastic, but that&#x27;s still a lot less pain than one would get from rope burn or a string cut.  </li>
            <li> used to go to a salon and get my face threaded, but it cost me Â£30 (I live in London) for full face+eyebrows and the worst thing</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t mess them up.  </li>
            <li> The other hair removal method I like for sensitive skin, but is a bit difficult to get consistency</li>
            <li> takes a little getting used to  </li>
            <li> Needs a little patience using it</li>
            <li> The only draw back is after some time the thread is cutting the plastic too.</li>
            <li> I have never waxed my eyebrows as I am afraid that if I get them waxed, one day someone might take off my whole eyebrow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have received the Helix a few days ago and once I got the hang of using it, it became easier to use and cleaned up my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> it kept snapping after a few goes.</li>
            <li> I watched the video a few times</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> To me, this is a gimmicky tool that does not function.  </li>
            <li> not a comfortable one.</li>
            <li> I feel like it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work anything like the video, even after practicing for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few times to get use.</li>
            <li> it removes hair safely  in few minutes .&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is heavy duty stuff, folks.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Also, as noted by other reviews, the thread that comes with it is very bad quality and breaks easily when threading coarser hair.</li>
            <li> but so far, very frustrating.</li>
            <li> major fail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been threading my thick, dark, Filipino and Hispanic eyebrows for over 8 years, and I get what the inventor means about &amp;#</li>
            <li> I practiced but was unable to get the thread tight enough.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, they do not work as you expected, I know how to thread and do the eyebrow on my friends, but cannot do it on myself this does not work very hard to work them</li>
            <li> It is however, time consuming,the tool feels a little primative, it&#x27;s def not something you can do while watching tv, takes at least a few hours of pratice and to self threath</li>
            <li> The only thing I find a little difficult to thread is in between my eyebrows, but that&#x27;s because my nose gets in the way.</li>
            <li> A few videos noted that it would be difficult to remove facial hair because the skin needed to be pulled taught and you can&#x27;t do that when both hands are already in use.</li>
            <li> I feel I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> I watched several videos on the internet to try and figure out what I was doing wrong.</li>
            <li> it is difficult to do the eyebrow area by yourself, you definitely need someone to help you...</li>
            <li> Seems like it should be no more than $15 maybe $20 max with shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When i ordered it it came without directions but instructions to the website :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sad that I didn&#x27;t use it earlier</li>
            <li> BUT: this is the freakin most worst grooming product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Laser (which did not work at all), shaving, waxing, sugaring, those awful depilatory creams and my favorite obsession tweezing.  </li>
            <li> My rating, my experience, and I&#x27;m still not sure about using these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried in the past to thread and was never able to</li>
            <li> Even after watching the video several time I found it difficult to use not at all like the write up.</li>
            <li> I had so much hope for this :( product.  </li>
            <li> Really hard to use .</li>
            <li> Too hard for me to figure out.</li>
            <li> Under the eyebrows is very difficult though because you usually need to have someone else pull the skin so that you dont accidently pluck out too much hair (or the wrong ones).</li>
            <li> , packaging is hideous, and the thread it comes with sucks.</li>
            <li> I needed to go at least every 3 weeks...</li>
            <li> but the spring loses tension</li>
            <li> the hell is wrong with you?&amp;#34; and whatever other unpleasantries some like to dole out.</li>
            <li> I do not have the patience nor the tolerance for tweezing as I find it to be painful to remove one hair at a time, whereas with threading, you are removing multiple hairs at once, making it quicker and less painful overall.  </li>
            <li> It gets a little complicated for the eyebows.</li>
            <li> I have tried laser hair removal but for me it was too painful and hair came back after a while.  </li>
            <li> But I think waxing will be faster and a little less painful.  </li>
            <li> But I am not that dumb...</li>
            <li> The thread kept getting twisted up in itself the minute it grabbed onto a hair :/</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just dumb, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to use this product.  </li>
            <li> I watched tutorial videos but still very hard to use.</li>
            <li> but I find the Helix a little awkward to handle.</li>
            <li> That is because the skin is so thin and needs to be pulled taught.</li>
            <li> but when I got the hang of it I am addicted to it.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with the thread being thin but they explained the reasoning behind it to me and it made sense.</li>
            <li> The plastic is NOT that crappy, thin, plastic.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with the Threadease</li>
            <li> Also the thread put little ridges into the plastic caused by friction, so it is now very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> last, and probably the worst method I used is plucking, which not only time consuming and quite painful (when you pluck hairs all over your face, not just eyebrows)</li>
            <li> I think it was less painful then waxing and healthier for my skin too.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive product, not easy to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy how hard it is to do this and</li>
            <li> One wrong flick of the wrist</li>
            <li> Too difficult for me to use on my face.</li>
            <li> Felt a kw ad and weird.</li>
            <li> UNCOMFORTABLE TO USE.</li>
            <li> This product is difficult to master.</li>
            <li> and it is difficult to maneuver and use on your eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> However, I found it difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> but the worst thing is that plucking makes hairs grow back thicker and darker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Their website for instructional videos: wtf, please include directions on how to set up and use, INSIDE the package I purchased.</li>
            <li> Never used it because it is awkward to hold and the string too thick and does not pull hair at all!!</li>
            <li> It kept cutting the thread that was provided.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use even after watching videos.</li>
            <li> In fact I find it impossible to use.</li>
            <li> Its very hard to use for EyeBrows, very disappointed with the purchase.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t even hurt as bad as i thought it would.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get frustrated -</li>
            <li> but it was so painful, or &amp;#34;twice painful&amp;#34;: on fingers and face, because of this</li>
            <li> but, when I received it I was disappointed it didn&#x27;t work all.</li>
            <li> Did everything as instructed but still can&#x27;t get it to do why it&#x27;s supposed to do :(</li>
            <li> I did not know how to used :( .</li>
            <li> and it doesnt hurt as bad as tweezing or waxing!</li>
            <li> I used to do waxing at a salon and have had a terrible experience.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very difficult to use even after watching videos. I feel I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It allows me to threat my eyebrows, face, and upper lip without constantly going to the mall. I just sit in front of the TV with my mirror and remove my face hair with this awesome product. Of course it takes some time to get used to and practice makes perfect, but it is totally worth it if you like to be in control of your threading. It definitely saves me and will continue to save me money and also time because it takes a lot of effort to constantly go to the mall last minute and back home before an important event. I love it and will definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I watched the video twice for instructions and thought it looked easy enough but when I went to thread I got NOTHING.. yea. NOTHING... I&#x27;ll try again as it very well could be user error.  But I am not that dumb...</li>
            <li> No longer dread removing hair around the eyebrows. Much better than waxing and pulling the skin. The longer this product is used the easier it gets to maneuver. Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not as easy to use as it looks.</li>
            <li> the Helix Threadease is as promised... Easy to use and removes hair quickly and it doesnt hurt as bad as tweezing or waxing! I love this product and recommend to other women.</li>
            <li> I have received the Helix a few days ago and once I got the hang of using it, it became easier to use and cleaned up my eyebrows. I recommend this product for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have terribly sensitive skin. Waxing makes me break out with acne so I never do that. Threading does not make me break out but I still get bad red bumps that last a 5-7 days when I go to a professional threader.   I decided to stop seeing the professional threader because of the severe red bumps, and also the cumulative cost, so I decided to buy this product, plus she could not get my eyebrows quite the way I like. The other hair removal method I like for sensitive skin, but is a bit difficult to get consistency right is sugar waxing.   I got this product very fast, and tried it immediately on clean, dry, powdered skin. I had some mild redness but it went away after an hour or so. Certainly I&#x27;m not as thorough as the professional which is probably why I had so much redness, but I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and recommend it to others. Doing it by hand is significantly harder and longer to learn.  I have no doubt with practice I&#x27;ll become more proficient. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The Helix Threadease has made it alot easier to remove/thread facial hair; I mainly use it for upper lip and my upper eyebrow. Under the eyebrows is very difficult though because you usually need to have someone else pull the skin so that you dont accidently pluck out too much hair (or the wrong ones). Easy to use and quite straighforward otherwise. I would recommend checking out the How To videos on youtube if needed.  * I would also like to add that the sellers were extremely friendly with answering my questions and I have recommended this product to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product.  It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It works just like it&#x27;s shown in the video, it does truly remove all different types of thickness of hair and hair does grows back finer. It is however, time consuming,the tool feels a little primative, it&#x27;s def not something you can do while watching tv, takes at least a few hours of pratice and to self threath it&#x27;s really hard to reach hairs on your neck or jaw bone, specially the areas near the ears. But overall I am happy, I have very sensetive skin, with this I sufer very little to no irritation at all and now no one can tell I have a facial hair problem. Yay!</li>
            <li> Helix Threadease is amazing! this tool for hair removal is just plan genius! I used to cut my fingers all the time from the traditional threading, but with this tool, threading is faster, easier and safer for my fingers! What&#x27;s more, I used it on my legs and the results were better than waxing! It didn&#x27;t burn my skin and left my legs really smooth! I really love Helix Threadease and can&#x27;t stop raving about it! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy this was to use.  I&#x27;m saving so much $$ a month!  After the first try, I was hooked!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I used to do waxing at a salon and have had a terrible experience. After that, I started doing threading instead which is much better. But as soon as I found out about this item, I didn&#x27;t hesitate one second and purchased this item right away.  It saved me a lot of money and haven&#x27;t been to a threading salon since I&#x27;ve bought this item. Always make sure that you carefully read and follow the instructions and you will be fine. Thank you for this great product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item. When I purchased it I had never done threading before.. after about 10 minutes if that, I had already got the hang of it. Its super fast and easy. The only thing I am disappointed about is that you cant do underneath your OWN eyebrows with it. That is because the skin is so thin and needs to be pulled taught. However if you are doing someone else&#x27;s,they can hold the skin while you do it. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s anything wrong with the product itself because that woild be true if you were threading without it, so that&#x27;s why I give it 5 stars! Its great because it removes all those thins hairs that are so hard to get with tweezers.</li>
            <li> So, I always thread my eye brows, however I never was able to do it my self .. Even though this took me a while to get a hang of it, I do like using it .. Just make sure u don&#x27;t start with ur eyebrows .. Start practicing on ur legs and thugs first .. Then move on to ur face.</li>
            <li> When i placed my order i was excited to receive my product.  i was overwhelmed when i received it on time as promised i was also very pleased to know that the company was working efficiently and professionally in getting my Helix Threadease.  I have to say that all it took was just two views of the videos that they had recommended to be able to effectively and successfully use the threading tool with no complications.. i appreciate that the product was exceptionally described and how i received it with no excuses in between and in promised time.  Thanks for such a great product.  Sincerely Luis Aleman</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am just learning to thread and I could only do it for a few minutes before I would get cuts on my fingers or they would get extremely irritated. It&#x27;s super easy to learn how to use, and so far I&#x27;ve gotten all the hair off my chin, neck, upper lip, and eyebrows. Removes hair a lot faster than tweezers since you don&#x27;t have pluck one hair at a time and it gets the short hairs that tweezers can&#x27;t. The only thing I find a little difficult to thread is in between my eyebrows, but that&#x27;s because my nose gets in the way. Other than that, I love this product and will be using it all the time!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get the threads to move smoothly like they do in the instruction video. It&#x27;s not the best way for me to removed hair. Also, the string kept on breaking as I was attempting to do it. If you don&#x27;t have patience or time, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Helix Threadese Tool after visiting my dermatologist last month. I was prescribed Tazorac (prescription topical retinoid for acne prone skin) and was advised NOT to wax or bleach my face anymore because of the drug interaction. I asked her what to do instead and she suggesting threading. I did a lot of research for threading products and finally came across Helix Threadese on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first because it just looked too easy, but when I got the product two days later and used it for the first time I was so pleased! This product is hands down the BEST beauty product I have purchased in so long. No gimmicks!  Not only was it easy to use, but it&#x27;s really affordable when you think of all the money you will be saving by making trips the salon, plus tips and gas!  I am kind of obsessed and love to use it because the results are amazing and I cant believe I can achieve them all by myself! Also, there are how-to-videos to watch on their website and they have great customer service. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  Smooth, hair-free facial skin without any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my friends ask me \\&quot;who does your eyebrows?\\&quot; and they can&#x27;t believe I do them myself.  I will definitely be buying the Helix Threadese as Christmas gifts this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I found the Helix Threadese Tool. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like this tool.  I used to thread with my bare hands, but never could last very long before my fingers got swollen and sore from thread burn.  This tool relieves you of any pain or discomfort.  I can actually thread with more accuracy using this tool than I could with my bare hands -- I wouldn&#x27;t have dared to attempt threading my eyebrows before..but I actually did it with this tool!  (**Use caution when threading beneath your eyebrows...your eyelid skin is very susceptible to getting caught up in the thread.**)  Overall great product..  Just wish the thread they sent with it was more durable..it kept snapping after a few goes.</li>
            <li> I really like  the Helix Threadease. takes a little getting used to  I watched the video a few times so I could figure it out but it was not hard especially since doing my own threading is cheaper than having to pay a salon to do it. I couldnot afford to keep going to a salon to have it done. and for twenty bucks I thought it was a great deal. I will give you a heads up though as far as the thread that came with it it was oookay. it snapped a couple of times but I still removed hair I just had to rethread tool a couple of times.I will get better thread when this runs out. But otherwise I am very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I would not recommend you using this on your eyebrows unless you are an absolute pro. One wrong flick of the wrist and you might lose your brow (this may or may not be personal experience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, this thing is WONDERFUL for anything else (upper lip, face, etc.). Threading is wonderful and it is a while before the hair grows back (longer hair-free period than waxing). I have never threaded myself before, but the information they give you to find their tutorial videos online was much appreciated. The videos are super-helpful and it is hard at first to thread but once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;re off.</li>
            <li> Really hard to use . In fact I find it impossible to use. It&#x27;s definitely not something for eyebrows because it doesn&#x27;t give enough control.</li>
            <li> Very handy, better than using your fingers.  just need to find a better thread.  Needs a little patience using it but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product easy to use so easy my 14 year old nephew could use it he helped me get those fine hairs from underneath my chin. He was a little to excited though to see me in a little pain but it was worth it.Within a few minutes my chin was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;It also works very well for your eyebrows which it is initially designed for and it works great on your legs as well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> At first I thought this tool was going to be great, but after using it a few times, a problem developed. I noticed that the thread wasn&#x27;t sliding smoothly and quickly anymore, thereby making it very difficult to use. After looking at it closely, I realized that the thread was actually \\&quot;sawing\\&quot; (or perhaps partially melting from friction generated heat) fairly deep grooves into the plastic inside the loop that holds the thread. I see from other customer reviews that no one else has mentioned this problem, so perhaps my threaders are just defective. I contacted the company about the problem and they responded promptly and said to send the threaders back and they will refund my money. Also, as noted by other reviews, the thread that comes with it is very bad quality and breaks easily when threading coarser hair.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertised. However, it does take practicing to get used to, so don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t get it the first few times. It works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product on facial hair. I practiced and practice, but couldn&#x27;t get the thread to slid smoothly and had trouble finding the right angle to remove chin hairs. The thread also broke on me a couple of times. I watched several videos on the internet to try and figure out what I was doing wrong. A few videos noted that it would be difficult to remove facial hair because the skin needed to be pulled taught and you can&#x27;t do that when both hands are already in use. BUT, the Helix videos shows a woman using it on her face with ease, so I kept trying. On my last try, I cut myself and decided it was time to gave it up. Too difficult for me to use on my face. I was able to use it on my legs, but that&#x27;s not what I purchased the Helix for.</li>
            <li> I have been familiar with threading for a few years and it is my method of choice for tweezing facial hair. But I find this product useless because you can do the same thing with your fingers and get alot better result because this product is large and restrictive.</li>
            <li> I had been extremely excited to get this home and try it out. However, I haven&#x27;t removed it from the drawer since the first time I tried it...major fail. Perhaps I need to practice my technique some more, but I can&#x27;t say this made threading my eyebrows very easy at all. I actually had more precision and success when I threaded by hand in the past. The thread kept getting twisted up in itself the minute it grabbed onto a hair :/</li>
            <li> I love this kit. It does just what i expected.  Easy hair remover. I like this my fingers do not get the occasional thread burns like before.  With practice I am now able to remove hair from my chin and over my lip. I will practice more before I do my eyebrows, but I am confidence that it will work perfect just from the results I have achieved  already. I am happy when I think of all the money I will save it pays for itself.  Very happy customer</li>
            <li> Finally....i am happy i found this :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can do it all on my own.. It took around 45 minutes the first time I tried this...It doesn&#x27;t hurt much and works just perfect :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The threads in the pack are not too strong. It breaks every time I try doing... Otherwise it works just perfect..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portable, Durable, Easy to use...What else is expected...Very Very happy :))))</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work...ESPECIALLY on your own face. This is a total waste of money. It literally took off like two blond hairs. Any coarse or darker hairs....forget about it!</li>
            <li> I rather just thread regarly using my hands, doesn&#x27;t cut my fingers and is more precise than this helix.. The plastic scrapes the thread every time you open and close, so it rips easily. I wish I never bought this item. It also comes with thread but it&#x27;s not as great as thread in a fabric store.</li>
            <li> I have been getting my eyebrows threaded every two weeks for 4 years now. Making the time to travel to the place and all the money spent, I researched where I could learn to thread. Then I came across the Helix. Sure there are other threaders out there, but have you seen the price and read the reviews?  Not to mention its a fairly large gadget. If I put it to my eyebrow, I could easily remove all the hair....and the eyebrow itself. The Helix takes some time getting used to, but watching the video helps a great deal. Once you get coordinated hand movements, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> This threading tool is awesome and its great in every way! i recommend everybody to get it! its a huge money saver &amp; its great for sensitive skin! u can take it anywhere u want and u can use whenever u want! i love the thread that it comes with and it doesn&#x27;t even hurt as bad as i thought it would. its affordable and its so easy to use! i completely fell in love with this i suggest everybody who wants to get rid of their facial hair to BUY THIS PRODUCT! ITS A 5 STAR.</li>
            <li> It kept cutting the thread that was provided. The video is not included, so had to search it on the web. NOT helpful at all.&lt;br /&gt;Does not work!! waste of money.</li>
            <li> This tool does not work as claimed.  I have tried for over two hours to get this to work.  The frustration is not worth it to me.  I watched you tube videos, read tips and reviews.  I am a beauty tool savvy person.  I use a spring for hair removal, I can do my own waxing and can thread with my hands (which hurts and burns after a while).  To me, this is a gimmicky tool that does not function.  I will stick to my hair removal spring and eyebrow tweeting.  The thread they send with this breaks very easily.  I spent most of my time re threading the little tool.  If I used less pressure or held the tool looser then no hair comes up.</li>
            <li> Wonderful creation! Works just the way it suppose by removing hair without the burn or cuts that you get from the standard threading technique. Happy customer ! Definitely a must have ladies !</li>
            <li> i love this tool since i&#x27;ve seen the video... i bought 2 kits &lt; one for me and the other as a gift&gt; , so amazing! i&#x27;ve actually use it 3 days ago on the chin and guess what?! easy, quickly, and didn&#x27;t leave pimples on my sensitive skin!  i&#x27;ve recommended this tool to some of those who couldn&#x27;t do threading by themselves and they&#x27;ve paid me a good compliment!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have already use it even on my toes! I think if someone else does it for you it would be better.</li>
            <li> its very easy to use, and its give you amazing feeling after you clean your face bye it, its worth it</li>
            <li> I like the treading but not the pain it causes when you use your fingers to move the thread back and forth.  I opted for this it&#x27;s faster and cleaner, no holding thread in your mouth and it saves your fingers.</li>
            <li> So when I got this, I was really excited, since I had to wax my &#x27;stache every week.. which sucked and was a huge mess. Sometimes I would burn my face or sometimes it worked amazingly well. With the thread ease, i can take care of my facial hair in about ten-twenty minutes without too much pain or cleanup. The only problem I found with this was that the thread was too thin, but it did work better than a thicker thread. Also the thread put little ridges into the plastic caused by friction, so it is now very difficult to use. But I circumvented this problem by using one of the red plasticky things and wrapping the other thread that is holding the loop onto my fingers. This works even better because I can get closer to my skin. The thread, because of the ridges, is more likely to break, but since it works so well, I don&#x27;t mind looping another piece of thread through. I have also tried using a long piece of thread and then looping it twice around, and that actually works for the bigger hairs. Overall, I would recommend this product because it teaches one how to thread and after a while, you can do it with your fingers.. using a thicker thread of course.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I ordered the Helix Threadease after she had her eyebrows done with the process at the mall. We did purchase some stronger thread and find the product to be easy to use in the privacy of our home.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly, but was missing the thread. I give it a 3 out of 5, only because it was missing a piece of the order.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is very easy to use. Having carpal tunnel syndrome, it does not hurt my hands. I absolutely love this product and the money spent was well worth it. Also, if you are having issues using it got to youtube and search for the Helix channel.  It is very helpful.</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying this because of the mixed reviews and some people having trouble mastering this tool, but I needed to try something new in hair removal. After watching the demo videos, I tried threading for the first time with this tool and I am in love! This is so much more efficient than tweezing and much less painful than other hair removal techniques. I am so glad I decided to buy this! I would definitely recommend. Yes it takes a bit of practice, but after just a few minutes I got it down and now my face is smooth and I&#x27;m feeling good!&lt;br /&gt;Ashley</li>
            <li> I have gotten my face threaded before so I&#x27;m fairly familiar with how the general concept works. It does take a few tries to get the hang of it, but once you do, it&#x27;s very simple!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried using thread alone before, but it&#x27;s heck of a lot harder. This tool make it so much easier!&lt;br /&gt;Also, it was shipped/delivered very quickly, so that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product especially for beginners like me!</li>
            <li> You Have to know the technique how to use it. if you know how to do threading then I am sure you can use it very easily.It is saving me with the cuts on my figures which frequently happen during self threading. The only draw back is after some time the thread is cutting the plastic too.But no problem I will buy one more :)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kind of bulky and large so positioning the threads is difficult. I was expecting something a little more beginner friendly but the learning curve seems kind of steep. Maybe one day I&#x27;ll get more use out of it.</li>
            <li> Does not work! don&#x27;t buy this item.</li>
            <li> When i found this I was really excited to be able to do threading at home but, when I received it I was disappointed it didn&#x27;t work all. I watched the you tube video on how to use it to make sure I was using right but, nothing. Product just doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s suppose to</li>
            <li> This item is working for my wife she love it.&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product is great A++.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to all my friend.</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose of threading.... Practice makes the tool easy</li>
            <li> not a comfortable one. does not work if you really want it to work. not worth buying it.&lt;br /&gt;I returned after 1-trial but glad that I got refund.</li>
            <li> I  bought this Helix Threading System because I always thread my eyebrows and do not always have the time to go to the salon.  I do not have the patience nor the tolerance for tweezing as I find it to be painful to remove one hair at a time, whereas with threading, you are removing multiple hairs at once, making it quicker and less painful overall.  I have never waxed my eyebrows as I am afraid that if I get them waxed, one day someone might take off my whole eyebrow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this system for awhile now, and I have changed my mind about how I feel about it.  Before, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with it.  Now, I love it now!  Previously, I was using this system just for the purpose of doing a quick clean-up job on my eyebrows.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get all the hairs on the bottom side of my eyebrows because I had no hands free for holding the skin tight so I don&#x27;t pinch myself.  If you thread your eyebrows, you know what I am talking about.  Additionally, The system was not doing a good job threading my upper lip.  However, whether you are a beginner or expert, this system becomes easy to use with a little bit of practice.  If you have a brave family member who will let you practice on them, it is easier to learn how to thread on another person.  If not, it&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The red handles that come with this system help you control the movement of the thread.  When you pinch down on one side, it will grab the hairs and pull them out from the root.  In the beginning, if you are not able to thread the extra hairs under your eyebrows, just use a tweezer.  I learned to thread my eyebrows, including how to shape them, by watching A LOT of Youtube videos.  Just go on Youtube and search for videos on how to thread your eyebrows at home.  There are tons of them.  Helix Threading System has it&#x27;s own video, but the \\&quot;real users\\&quot; videos on Youtube are SO much better - especially as they give you invaluable tips and tricks.  Slowly, with the help of these videos and with practice, you will be able to thread and shape your own eyebrows!  Don&#x27;t get frustrated - it takes time.  Threading is a form of art that usually requires experts to take month long classes.  You can also thread your upper lips - when I go to the salon, I occasionally get my upper lips threaded instead of waxed.  It is more painful, but the end result is a much better one.  You can actually thread anywhere on your body, but most people stick to threading only on their face.  You can do your chin, cheeks, sideburns, hairline, etcetera, once you gain some practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few tips for everyone, but especially for beginners!&lt;br /&gt;1. If you have absolutely no tolerance for pain, stick to your current method.  I like threading because it is fast, effective, and lasts longer than other methods.  You can also thread on the go, whereas you can&#x27;t wax on the go, and tweezing often takes long if you are restricted by time.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you are light-skinned, turn red easily, or are of any other complexion and have never threaded before, I suggest you thread your eyebrows the day before you attend an important event or go to work...whatever the case may be.  That way, any redness will dissipate throughout the day, and you can judge whether you can handle threading and how your skin reacts to it. I have a medium complexion.  I have VERY sensitive skin.  I am usually red for 2-4 hours after a threading job, but it goes away.  You can apply some moisturizer and/or Aloe Vera to the spots you threaded afterward to help with the sting.&lt;br /&gt;3. If you know you will be threading your eyebrows or upper lips, try not to use moisturizer on your face until afterwards.  In the case of threading your upper lips, try not to use chapstick or anything similar around your lips, and wipe off any excess from the skin.  It IS OKAY if you do have moisturizer on your face.  You can apply some baby powder or talcum powder to the areas you want to thread.  This will absorb anymoisture and make it easier to pick up the hairs.  All you need is a light dust of powder - don&#x27;t pour it on.&lt;br /&gt;4. Use a wax pen to outline the shape you want your eyebrows to be.  Wax outside the line and you&#x27;ll be fine.  There are Youtube videos that will show you how to shape your eyebrows, whether you are threading or not.&lt;br /&gt;5. If you are threading your upper lip, stick your tongue under the part of your upper lip you are threading.  Since your upper lip area is \\&quot;indented\\&quot; between your nose and lips, it&#x27;ll be easier for you to see the hairs and to grab them.&lt;br /&gt;6. Whether you are threading or tweezing, use a MAGNIFIED mirror to better help you see the hairs you are trying to grab - especially the short, light, or baby hairs.&lt;br /&gt;7. I cannot stress these two items enough.  YOUTUBE, YOUTUBE YOUTUBE!  PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!  If you give up right away, you will definitely not like the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to you!</li>
            <li> kind of hard to get the threader to twist and grab hairs will keep trying I guess it takes a lot of practice</li>
            <li> Ok, first of all, I&#x27;d like to answer:&lt;br /&gt;Why wax? Why tweeze?&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s easier. It&#x27;s faster. It won&#x27;t take out our lashes, it won&#x27;t make us angry, it won&#x27;t take our precious time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, kinda like this.. Sometimes... Because it does make me able to thread my own eyebrows, which is very good, because threading is really expensive out here, in California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to people who REALLY insist on threading, but are broke.&lt;br /&gt;If you can do waxing, do waxing. If you can do tweezing, do that. I&#x27;m just saying.. This is really hard to get right.</li>
            <li> I was waxing my face all the time ...It just left a mess and took to long. I happened to come across the helix threadease tool and watched a video and decided to order this product. I will say that it was a little tricky to use at first but when I got the hang of it I am addicted to it. You just have to make sure when you use the tool that you place the V part of the thread near the hair you want to remove and wala its gone. I think it was less painful then waxing and healthier for my skin too. I definitely recommend this tool to use !!!</li>
            <li> it definitely doesn&#x27;t look as easy as it does.&lt;br /&gt;need practice to figure out the tension &amp; momentum etc.&lt;br /&gt;still practising when i can find the time...</li>
            <li> very hard to use - not really a substitute for the real thing. I feel like it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This thing is great to do it on yourself, however...it is difficult to do the eyebrow area by yourself, you definitely need someone to help you...especially the eyelid part as it is very sensitive. Also the cotton thread that they give you breaks easily, luckily I just happened to have some polyester thread that worked great.</li>
            <li> Love it and it works very well!</li>
            <li> Felt a kw ad and weird. I ended up using just thread around my fingers</li>
            <li> Tried it, didn&#x27;t work, threw it away. I&#x27;d rather tweeze my brows than try to use this.</li>
            <li> I COULDN&#x27;T GET IT TO WORK LIKE THE VIDEO DEMONSTRATED IT. NOT WORTH BUYING. UNCOMFORTABLE TO USE. I TRASH THE THING.</li>
            <li> Its very hard to use for EyeBrows, very disappointed with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this  to make the hair line of my beard straight. It works perfectly for me on the coarse hairs.</li>
            <li> I found this to be an effective tool for hair removal which is why I give it four stars. My only gripe is that the thread they give you is so thin that it breaks way too easily. Also the product is a bit on the pricy side for the quality. Seems like it should be no more than $15 maybe $20 max with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a bit of a learning curve but if you are persistent and use it more than two times you will soon figure out how to master it. One thing to note: the shorter the string the better, especially if you have small hands. Notice in the product picture that the string loop is as wide as her forehead.</li>
            <li> it never worked as it should and i know how to do threading on my face i wanted to get it so my finger don&#x27;t get hurt but this thing do not work what so ever</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and i love it! I&#x27;ve watched threading videos, but never could imagine doing all that with my hands. Plus when you do try it leaves your fingers sore...ehh. So i found this, Threading that uses hand grips that do a majority of the work?!? Cool. When i ordered it it came without directions but instructions to the website :/ however the videos online are pretty useful. After a lot of practice and some irritated skin i got the hang of it. It is wayyy better than tweezing and healthier than waxing! Only problem is the string rips too easy. While i am threading the string tends to pop and i often have to readjust it, however i still think it&#x27;s pretty Awesome. Not to mention when i use it right, my skin has far less irritation than tweezing and waxing! If your debating buying it, i&#x27;d say go for it!</li>
            <li> A good product. But you don&#x27;t need it if you know how to do  threading.</li>
            <li> This is the threading tool i have been searching for for so long now. When i first began looking on amazon for products that worked LIKE threading, i ran across the threadease but skimmed over it thinking it was nothing special. i came back to amazon to look for yet ANOTHER product (the first one failed miserably) and looked more into the threadease. i must say, THIS IS THE BEST THREADING PRODUCT THERE CAN BE. i have never been happier with a product like this. Now, the only money i spend on threading is for my eyebrows because 1) i dont have enough experience to shape my eyebrows the right way and 2) because i would need another person to hold my eyelid and forehead for me. Overall, this product is beautifully designed to get the same results you get done professionally from a threading salon. of course the thread breaks a lot but it isnt rough on the skin which i like (ill have to buy more of that)</li>
            <li> I watched tutorial videos but still very hard to use. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just me, but I could not get it to pull more than maybe one hair and that was after several tries.  It was just too much of a learning curve I guess. I&#x27;m glad it seems to work easily for others.  Too hard for me to figure out.</li>
            <li> I have lot of coarse hair on my chin and I have to go to a salon every week to get threading done. My eyebrows also need work every 10 days. I had been spending a lot a money and also finding time to go to salon every week was an issue. I did some research online and on amazon and found this product. I ordered it right away and tried it the day I received it. It works! Watch the video before you use it and if you have seen people thread you would kind of have an idea how to use it. Make sure the hair you want to pluck/thread are close to the loop/twists and just do the motion so that the loop/twists glides over the hair and catches it. Highly recommended!! I did not do eyebrows yet, but with practice I am sure I will be able to do that as well. I am skeptical about the bottom of eyebrows but am sure the top can be done easily.</li>
            <li> Now I can torcher myself instead of having to pay to get hair removed from my upper lip and chin area! LOL seriously! I used to have tears flowing down my face while getting this done at the mall and well, that&#x27;s a lil embarrassing! The lady would always ask if I&#x27;m OK. Plus I remember this one time I felt a bit of spit hit my face as a lady did the threading. I thought these was super weird looking from a distance but once I clicked on the link and looked on the website I thought what an amazing invention!  I can&#x27;t see how anyone who thread for a living can go hours using their fingers like that OUCH!!! Only down side so far to me is the sawing down of the product where the string hook on to, but why make anything so it can last forever?! That means after a while no one would have to re-order and companies would fall from not making any profits. I wonder if I do something ghetto like cut some duck tape and wrap it around that area so it wouldn&#x27;t saw down as fast, would work hmmmmm. So anyway, I&#x27;ve seen alot of tutorials on youtube about the product as well and see only so many can really do the brow area because you have to pull it up in order to get the hair and might get too much of it or whateva. What I do to the brow is use eyebrow stencils from eyebrowz.com and the rubber band they sell and use 2 of the same stencils so u can get an even arch when tweezing. So back to this product. It gets all the lil chin hairs and I wanna try it for the side burn area to see what will happen. I&#x27;ll update later about the results. What I don&#x27;t recommend is having a clean face, even though they tell you different, because after it&#x27;s done it keeps your face tender, longer. It&#x27;s going to hurt overall but in my opinion the pain was worse because I washed my face first rather then not doing that like I used to do when I went to the mall to get threaded. Another reason I&#x27;m so happy about this product is because this works 100x better than waxing and using products like Nair when it would leave some hair still. Even when I got it done at the mall I would have to check and tell them to go over areas again cause I could still see hairs. But when you do it yourself (in a lighted cosmetic mirror where one side is a 10x close up) then there&#x27;s virtually no reason to miss hairs. I highly recommend this product!ould leave some hair still. Even when I got it done at the mall I would have to check and tell them to go over areas again cause I could still see hairs. But when you do it yourself (in a lighted cosmetic mirror where one side is a 10x close up) then there&#x27;s virtually no reason to miss hairs. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I tried to return this product but I needed to have a confirmation number which never arrived.  I watched three videos but they were no assistance. Or, I am not agile enough to work this product.</li>
            <li> I needed a tool which would help me escape from the thread burns that I have while doing threading. Finally, i got it!!! Helix Threadease.. This is the tool. It&#x27;s so smooth in usage that I could do my entire face threading for the first time all by myself.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money!</li>
            <li> The Helix Threadease Hair Removal tool works exactly as described!  I watched a couple of videos online before deciding to buy the product mainly because I was wondering if it was worth 20 bucks + shipping (it is).&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a plastic zip-top pouch, the hair removal tools, an instruction card, and string.&lt;br /&gt;I found everything to work really well except for the string.  It is too thin and breaks easily.  For the price of the product Helix should have included higher quality string.  Not a big deal because you can buy your own, but just an annoying thing I had to go replace.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the string, everything was satisfactory.  Remember, threading is slightly painful and it&#x27;s easy for beginners to thread too much hair and botch their results.  Make sure you have plenty of time to learn how to thread if you&#x27;re a beginner.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been threading or are a beginner but have been using your fingers to do so you will not like this product. It takes some getting used to but personally, this product isn&#x27;t for me. It&#x27;s too bulky, using fingers is much easier for me. I would have to say NEVER attempt to use this product on your eyebrows. I didn&#x27;t even bother because it isn&#x27;t precise. Don&#x27;t even use it on someone else&#x27;s eyebrows, they will be very upset with the results! Best for face and neck. Didn&#x27;t try other parts of my body. The thread isn&#x27;t great either. Like I said, if you&#x27;ve been using your fingers to thread, you won&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job but it&#x27;s hard to get a hang of at first.  At first it&#x27;ll take a while to use and to actually get all the hairs</li>
            <li> not working great waste of money, mine still here never use it after one time</li>
            <li> its really good if you want to learn how to thread. i always wanted to learn but would give up pretty soon, not because the hair pulling was too much to handle, but because the thread always cuts into the fingers. this eliminates that problem. i can finally thread!!</li>
            <li> Did everything as instructed but still can&#x27;t get it to do why it&#x27;s supposed to do :(</li>
            <li> These worked okay I think I had high expectations for this.  But I think waxing will be faster and a little less painful.  You can take care of it at once instead of pulling hairs out individually.</li>
            <li> this device does not work well.  It constantly gets the skin caught in the thread.  Not worth the money at all</li>
            <li> I like this product, and it was worth the money, but It took a little while to get used to using it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective to remove even the most stubborn peach fuzz!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works, but for some reason I can not get the hang of it. It is a great idea and it will save a lot of fingers cuts from the thread.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work anything like the video, even after practicing for a few hours.  Way overpriced for what you get in the package.  The internet video instruction is poor without sound.</li>
            <li> finally able to thread my own face.  easy to set-up less than five minutes.  start with you leg for practice.  you have to use enough thread to create space between the &amp;#34;cutting section&amp;#34; of the thread in order to get into the small angled areas of your forehead.  i gave 4 stars only because the thread kept breaking so i just got a better quality at the beauty supply and it worked.  this product is worth getting.  fast shipping also.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I would get mine done about every two weeks. This is the best tool. It took a little bit of practice but it works great. I would definitely suggest trying it out.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t as easy as they make it seem!! I would still rather go to a salon to have this done!!</li>
            <li> To be honest, when I bought the product I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work but I wanted to try it. I watched the video online and in 2 minutes I was using it!!! After months I can tell you that I love this product! I am saving a lot of money in threading. I am using it in all my face. I gave my threading kit to my sister and I bought another for me. She is very happy with this product too.  It takes two or three times to become an expert :)&lt;br /&gt;I was paying between 10 and 20 dollars to get just my eyebrows threaded, this product has saved me hundreds of dollars. You should try it!!</li>
            <li> I watched the video many times. This product is difficult to master. I practiced but was unable to get the thread tight enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really on the fence with this item.  I have been practicing with this threader for about 2 weeks now and it is difficult to maneuver and use on your eyebrows.  The major problems I run into are the thread breaking and not being able to grasp the hair around my eyebrows.  I&#x27;m sure this would be easier if someone used it on you, but as far as going solo...it&#x27;s a real challenge.  I will continue to practice and maybe buy a different brand of thread than what came with this product but so far, very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this piece of garbage. It doesn&#x27;t work! I highly recommend  the R.E.M spring sprong instead. It&#x27;s cheaper, and more effective.</li>
            <li> It makes threading so easy it is hard when you d it by ur bare hands your fingers will scream! But this tool made it very easy.however, the thread wasnt that good i used another thread</li>
            <li> Tried enough, but doesn&#x27;t do anything. Total waste of money, not even worth 2 cents. I wish I could get my money back</li>
            <li> I regularly go to get my eyebrows and upper and lower lip threaded and thought I could save some money by buying this to thread myself.  However, I found it difficult to use.  I could get it to work, yes, but I wasn&#x27;t able to maneuver it very easily to get all the areas that I wanted to thread, and with accuracy.  It&#x27;s just easier to keep going to a professional.</li>
            <li> You get better with time and it is an absolute life saver....the learning curve is worth it.</li>
            <li> Really nice product. I had an issue with the thread being thin but they explained the reasoning behind it to me and it made sense. It&#x27;s a time-saver. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This thing is a flop.  I couldn&#x27;t get it to work and I over and over, save your money, buy wax.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to learn the technique... to thread at the bottom brow it is much mor complicated... the top part of the brow and mustache.... much easier.I guess practice... lots of it.</li>
            <li> And it actually did!&lt;br /&gt;I know it might sound a little bit too much for such a simple thing like hair removal tool BUT not for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have a very excessive hair growth on my face, and for me learning how to thread my whole face by myself was one of the main new years&#x27; resolutions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to go to a salon and get my face threaded, but it cost me Â£30 (I live in London) for full face+eyebrows and the worst thing is that I still had to wait until most of the hairs grow back, as going to the salon and paying Â£30 every week it&#x27;s just too much. Plus I felt really embarrassed when some people or even beauticianists would stare at me and get surprised how \\&quot;hairy\\&quot; I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatively, I used to do sugaring by myself (sugar wax paste, without strips) but hairs should be pretty grown in order to wax it clear.&lt;br /&gt;The last, and probably the worst method I used is plucking, which not only time consuming and quite painful (when you pluck hairs all over your face, not just eyebrows) but the worst thing is that plucking makes hairs grow back thicker and darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;two days ago, on my birthday, before we went out, I was able to thread all of my facial hair (neck, chin, upper lip,under the lower lip, sideburns,cheeks, forehead, under the eyes) and I could not believe it! I did it by myself! And even though it was my first time working with the tool, it took me only 15 mins to adapt and get really speedy &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt; I felt so relieved that I don&#x27;t have to depend on anyone! No salons, no people staring at me, no Â£30 from my pocket! But most importantly no more shame when going on the streets, chatting with my friends, going on a date and worrying if they can see that stubble on my face! Now I can thread even a very short hairs and don&#x27;t have to wait until they&#x27;ll grow in a beard.  I don&#x27;t have these problems anymore, I am FREE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to creators of Helix threadease for having this amazing idea and making it into such a lovely product!&lt;br /&gt;I can feel myself a real woman now!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and God Bless :) xx&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. ordered 2 more for my sisters &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Very good and easy to use, you just need to watch the video and follow the steps. I totally recommend it</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes threading at home so easy. It takes a few times to get use. I only go to the salon 3 time a year and do the rest at home. Much easier when you need a quick clean up before going out. I am saving so much money. Must buy for yourself!</li>
            <li> ok I got this product because I m tired to pay to much on my eyebrows and I need to save some money to .let me tell you is a good product and is very easy on the right side but the left is a little hard for me but it work good. I told my friends about this product and they want to buy too. The shipping it was on time no complain .</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just dumb, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to use this product.  I watched the video and tried several times to use...it just doesn&#x27;t work for me!  I guess I&#x27;ll just throw it away...I had so much hope for this :( product.  I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t wax or use chemicals, laser doesn&#x27;t work on blonde hairs, so that&#x27;s out.  Still on the search...</li>
            <li> Takes some practice but does the job - make sure to use regular threadand NOT tthe one it comes with</li>
            <li> I really like this product at first I didn&#x27;t know how to use it that well but then I went on youtube and checked out some videos of people  reviewing this product and it really helped me understand how to use this product.</li>
            <li> I would never recommend this product because it&#x27;s not a hair remover! It doesn&#x27;t remove anything. I watched all youtube directions and read the notes that came with it but nothing! I&#x27;m really sad that I didn&#x27;t use it earlier so I can return it in time.</li>
            <li> The best hair removal ever. this is my second kit i have one at oficce and one at home!!! Yo lo recomiendo!!!!</li>
            <li> Really like this. It&#x27;s a bit hard to use at first, but once you get the swing off things no problems. Pays for itself after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> First off, let me just tell you how great of a concept this is.. BUT: this is the freakin most worst grooming product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been threading my thick, dark, Filipino and Hispanic eyebrows for over 8 years, and I get what the inventor means about &amp;#34;minimizing finger aches, sores, etc.&amp;#34; I get it. I go into my salon  for a full face once a month, and normally do an at home touch up in between. Originally purchasing this kit to save money...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issues with the product:&lt;br /&gt;1. First impression: it comes with no directions, packaging is hideous, and the thread it comes with sucks. No where close to the quality and the type they use in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Their website for instructional videos: wtf, please include directions on how to set up and use, INSIDE the package I purchased. The videos suck too by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The product it self: sure, it&#x27;s simple to use, you open and close your hands. Got it. But: there are no guidelines on how much thread to use, the length, directions on how to do different areas, etc. I f*#*+ing almost took my eyebrow out. This product gives you ZERO control on areas you want to go after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your self some money and some tears: go to walmart: get your self some 1.65 cotton thread for $2, some band aids for your fingers, preferably the plastic ones (makes it easier to slide and control the thread), go YouTube some videos on &amp;#34;how to thread eyebrows&amp;#34;, and stay away from this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grrr..What&#x27;s your freakin return policy?</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a at home solution for facial hair removal.  I have tried laser hair removal but for me it was too painful and hair came back after a while.  I also have the GiGi wax system and it&#x27;s to messy and at times can discolor skin or burn if the heat settings aren&#x27;t right.  So I was on YouTube just searching and I came accross this product.  I also watched the tutorials as wells as videos from other reviewers of the product.  It looked promising so I ordered it and as soon as I received it yesterday, I tried it!  It does take a bit of skill but I feel I did a good job on my first try.  With a little bit more practice, I feel like I am going to become an expert threading.  For 5 years or longer, I was going to a salon to get my face threaded...average cost was $25 each time I visited the salon.  I needed to go at least every 3 weeks...so imagine how it all added up.  I am so glad to have found this tool!! :) I totally love it!! I just ordered another one to give to my niece.  I love being able to take care of this embarrassing issue in the privacy of my home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only improvement I would suggest for this product would be to make the bars on the handles softer, so it&#x27;s softer on my hands and knuckles! Like a rubber grip around the bar so it doesn&#x27;t hurt the hands if you use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive product, not easy to use. After I bought it I tried many time to use it, it was a hassle experience. I get back to use the tweezers.</li>
            <li> . . . to use this thing!  I couldn&#x27;t get the hang of it.  I suppose with practice (years of it!) one could&lt;br /&gt;make it work as well as the woman demoing it, but I personally don&#x27;t want to work that hard in my attempts&lt;br /&gt;to not look like a Sasquatch.</li>
            <li> Makes the threading service I offer sanitary and my clients love it. I&#x27;ve gained new clients by pointing out the benefits of my threading services.  You will need to buy a better thread than what comes with the kit. It kept breaking.</li>
            <li> Helix Threading Kit&lt;br /&gt;this product very easy to use and very light weight&lt;br /&gt;and it removes hair safely  in few minutes .&lt;br /&gt;This product fully take off the hair and the hair takes a long time to grow back&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the wax which was only cut hair and cause redness and sometimes skin infections&lt;br /&gt;I Recommend Using this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I prefer to hold the thread with my fingers. I feel like I have more control. I bought the Helix because the thread is sharp on your fingers but I find the Helix a little awkward to handle.</li>
            <li> I gave this gift to my mom and sister. the salon is about 20 miles away and now im saving them time and money. My mom loved it. She caught on right away, she did her cheek and lip. The chin area is difficult to do , but iits never seemed like it was easy to do even when the pros did it.. My sister is hopeful she&#x27;ll get it down. I have used it. I prefer using my hands as the threader tool because that is what i am used to, but the tthreader tool is alot faster to use. I like it i recommend it. I am happy for my purchases and they came with a storage pouch and thread.</li>
            <li> I used to wax all my face, but I stopped because I wanted to avoid this pulling process in my face each 15 days, and I started to feel worried for the aging signs than the hair. So I started to try threading but it was so painful, or &amp;#34;twice painful&amp;#34;: on fingers and face, because of this I only did it on the upper lip and the eyebrow, and was enough for my fingers. With Helix become easier to do it in all my face, in fact I didn&#x27;t feel too much pain. I just need to practice to have a better coordination in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;***********&lt;br /&gt;Yo solia depilar con cera toda mi cara, pero decidi dejar de hacerlo para evitar estar estirandola cada quince dias, comence a preocuparme mas por signos de edad que por cabello facial. Fue entonces cuando comence a interesarme en practicar la depilacion con hilo, pero era muy dolorosa, o &amp;#34;doblemente dolorosa&amp;#34;: en dedos y en cara. Por lo tanto decidi solo hacerlo en la parte superior de labios en la parte superior de ceja, y eso era demasiado para mis dedos. Al utilizar Helix fue mas sencillo hacerlo en toda la cara, de hecho no senti tanto dolor. Solamente necesito practicar para tener una mejor coordinacion con las manos.</li>
            <li> It is a piece of trash in my closet since I received it.  Never used it because it is awkward to hold and the string too thick and does not pull hair at all!!</li>
            <li> didnt like it very much, could be good for someone else found it vwry hrd to use or get used to</li>
            <li> it fits me well ...it is easy to use and it saved time and money...i like it very much ..</li>
            <li> I have never threaded before or been threaded on, but all my girlfriends have raved about it and how easy it is to do yourself.  So, I thought, I&#x27;ll give a go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Helix Threadease after reading reviews between it, other threading tools and the hand method.  Showed up a day earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, again, I have never threaded.  I have no clue what I am doing.  It&#x27;s the only method I have not tried/used, aside from electrolysis.  Laser (which did not work at all), shaving, waxing, sugaring, those awful depilatory creams and my favorite obsession tweezing.  I think I own 7 different pairs of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I watched all of the instructional videos before it even arrived, and again after it got here this afternoon.  Here&#x27;s my overall review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  SUPER easy to set up.  Was the simplest, most straightforward thing ever!&lt;br /&gt;2.  Portable.  This will fit neatly into my toiletry bag for travel, in my purse, will store neatly in the bathroom drawer.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Durable.  The plastic is NOT that crappy, thin, plastic.  This is heavy duty stuff, folks.  It&#x27;s not going to break any  time soon!&lt;br /&gt;4.  Most important- It WORKS.  After some practice.  As someone who has NEVER threaded, it took me about 4 minutes to get the basic gist of the motion and method and and pull my first few hairs.  Then I went to town.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Pain factor: negligible.  That&#x27;s not to say there is *no* pain to start, but it&#x27;s much less than other methods and with no residual pain.  My skin was red for a few seconds and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons (because nothing is perfect):&lt;br /&gt;1.  The thread broke.  This I can see is due to it rubbing on the plastic seam ridge from the manufacture process.  I&#x27;m going to take my Dremel to it and just smooth that ridge down on the inside and maybe swab a little almond or tea tree oil, just to lube it up and make the thread slide a little easier.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The grip...ouch.  My knuckles hurt from the plastic, but that&#x27;s still a lot less pain than one would get from rope burn or a string cut.  I&#x27;d like a little padding on the inside of the grip for comfort and better use.&lt;br /&gt;3.  There is some stubble/broken hairs.  I think this is due to me being a complete novice and not holding the string close to my skin, as well as trying to master the motion.  Instead of pulling all the hairs, I pulled some and broke others off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall-  This product ROCKS my socks OFF.  If the string hadn&#x27;t broken so quickly, because of that plastic manufacturing mold-seam, I would have given it a 5-star review, easily.  It will take much more practice.  I&#x27;m looking forward to tackling my eyebrows and the few coarse hairs I get on my chin and upper lip.  GREAT PRODUCT that I will DEFINITELY recommend to my girls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE-  It is only a few hours later and I have my eyebrows down pat.  You can&#x27;t mess them up.  The key- if you&#x27;re doing the TOP of your brown, just align the LOWER string with your brow arch.  UNDER the brow, align the TOP sting with your brow arch.  It&#x27;s SO easy.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to every one. I saved so much by using this tool. Try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> These are a contraption that makes threading maybe, more complicated than it needs to be, but then, hey. I watched people on youtube doing it and I figure, get these and it should be a snap! After earning the unenviable nickname of &amp;#34;Butterfingers&amp;#34; as a kid, I can&#x27;t tell you how many times me and my fumblefingers have messed up crafts projects, beading, etc. I thought this would work out for me, but by the time I got this thing to work, to tell you the truth, I was kind of anxious getting these things too near my face. I put them down and went to play with The Donut, my Wonder Cat. It&#x27;s probably just me, so I don&#x27;t want you to blast me with your comments about &amp;#34;What the hell is wrong with you?&amp;#34; and whatever other unpleasantries some like to dole out. (Not you, though. You&#x27;re fine.) Give this product a try, and I bet you&#x27;ll have better luck with it than I did. My rating, my experience, and I&#x27;m still not sure about using these. I tried again. I used them and ended up threading off half of my left eyebrow. It&#x27;s growing back in nicely. Thanks for reading my review!</li>
            <li> You have to try this awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the innovative Helix Threadease. The only thing that I may change is for a stronger thread to be supplied with the kit. It seems to break easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned about the Helix Threadease while searching for an alternative to waxing.  Professional waxing has ruined my skin by leaving scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool is the best method of hair removal from the face without pain or side effects for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before buying the product I tried threading without the tool and it really hurts your fingers after a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Helix Threadease is so easy and comfortable to use once you get the hang of it. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended it to my friends. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who gets threading, this is a MUST buy!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend watching the video so you are able to use the product correctly.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you thinking about getting this...you definitely should!!!</li>
            <li> Saves a lot of money and works great. I love it. I am used to going to the salon to get my brows and other facial hair done. It cost me a ton, and they didn&#x27;t always get it right. With this tool, I&#x27;m in control and can work on it as much as I would like until I&#x27;m satisfied. I think it was super clever how they came up with this tool, and highly recommend you give it a try. Also, it was delivered to me the next day, days earlier than expected. Wonderful service.&lt;br /&gt;I took one point off because it really didn&#x27;t work on my body hair, legs or armpits didn&#x27;t work. With the face, its great. Stay away from the eyebrows at first.</li>
            <li> I did not know how to used :( . really I was waiting it ASAP but it not worth the waiting time .</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, the rings are too big and bulky causing my hands to cramp. I love the look of threaded eyebrows but cannot always go because of my kids. I have larger hands and still had a hard time using this, I wish I would have gotten the electric version.</li>
            <li> Really I have tried And for the life of me cannot figure out how to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen the videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and tried and can&#x27;t even get it to get one hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the rem but the spring loses tension quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t figure out how to use this threading device....</li>
            <li> I can work fine on my upper lips. It gets a little complicated for the eyebows. I wish they were smoller.</li>
            <li> Unit is too large to use comfortably.  opened some of the sites about threading and it was easier w/o this device.  Threasd breaks easily and it is just too large to do eyebrows.  Very cheaply made and the handles cause blistering on thumbs.</li>
            <li> I love it ! It works amazing â™¡</li>
            <li> I have been threading facial hair for some time now. I use the old fashioned method with my fingers and cotton thread. I find the threadease is cumbersome and harder to control. Maybe I just need more practice. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good product that helps you with threading if you have difficulty doing it with just the thread. I&#x27;ve tried in the past to thread and was never able to but this is helping me and hopefully soon I will be able to thread without using this too!</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the Threadease It was very hard to use and the directions could have been better. Even after watching the video several time I found it difficult to use not at all like the write up.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, they do not work as you expected, I know how to thread and do the eyebrow on my friends, but cannot do it on myself this does not work very hard to work them don&#x27;t waste your money. I even tried them on side burn cannot do.</li>
            <li> I can say that these are exactly as pictured but for me they seem to get in the way. It could be my technique and it is definitely better than using your hands but I will have to go back to having them done at a salon because I just didn&#x27;t find them easy for me to use. I also wasn&#x27;t so sure about the thread that came with. It didn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as what they use in the salon.</li>
            <li> After watching online videos and much practice, I am happy to say this product works well for me. I do think it&#x27;s critical that you have some prior experience or exposure to threading to better understand the process to complete this on yourself. This gadget saves me lots of money, and I no longer have to go to threading salons. Pleased with my purchase, again after much practice.</li>
            <li> this product is revoultanry, canceled all upcoming laser hair  removal treatments.&lt;br /&gt;which is costly and time consuming.  I like the fact that i could use this prodcut at&lt;br /&gt;the most convience time for me.  I Love this product, and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> You need patience to do this. I was going to the mall to get my brows threaded all the time and it was so costly. I decided to do it myself. I saw this lifesafer and had to get it. Make sure you watch the videos. They help so much. it&#x27;s crazy how hard it is to do this and the ladies at the salons make it look so easy. just keep practicing. You will get it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what to really write. So many people said that it was easy. Maybe it is to those people that have experience with threading. The thread broke like 3 times in one use. I probably need to do a lot more practice for this to work for me.</li>
            <li> I jumped at the chance at buying this seeing that getting my upper lip threaded coats $8 each visit. Though not totally painless (and I don&#x27;t know a hair removal process that is) it works. Does require some practice, but is worth it. Best part is that it will same me money and time in the long run.</li>
