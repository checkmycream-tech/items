            <li>It is a bit bulky but still fits nicely in the wash kit bag I take to the gym.</li>
            <li>It arrived yesterday and the catch on the new one works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>AMAZON MADE UP FOR MY MISUNDERSTANDING, KEEPING ME A HAPPY CUSTOMER AND A LOYAL CUSTOMER</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for travel as it protects my razor in addition to extending the useful life of Harry&#x27;s razor blades.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many ways to extend the life of my Gillette Proglide razors so I decided to try the driblade case also.</li>
            <li>NEED BETTER INSTRUCTION SHEET.</li>
            <li>Its a bit more than I wanted to pay</li>
            <li>and it takes up more room than it should.</li>
            <li>top of that, I have also been using the DriBlade case for my razor</li>
            <li>so I would like to offer my sincere thanks to DriBiz for exceptional customer support.  </li>
            <li>If you are a frequent traveler like me, it is a great solution, and the company stands by the product.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this case for those who like to travel light.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit for womens razor.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t look or feel &#x27;cheap&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The shave is always smooth and the lifespan of my razor</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Looked everywhere for a razor case as I travel a lot...a little bulky but very nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>or so this is really making me rethink my 4-blades a month to your door shipping service!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised in all respects.</li>
            <li>With this step, and the DriBlade, my Harry&#x27;s cartridges last quite awhile--many more shaves than the Gilette Fusion Pro-Glide cartridges that I used to have.</li>
            <li>they can make a smaller case, it would be much better.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve suggested that Harry&#x27;s buy the company as it would be a natural fit</li>
            <li>It also protects the razor from damage due to the nice plastic case.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a few months now  and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>At first I was sceptical, but it really worked.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>downside is that, the inside micro hard foam which absorbs the wetness and water needs to be replaced often, good thing I bough another one along with the DriBlade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really works and makes the razor stay sharper over time.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>He gives this a high grade.</li>
            <li>This product comes highly reccomended.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of good quality plastic so while I&#x27;ve not done so yet, will have no problems putting it in the dishwasher to clean it when necessary (the inner blue plastic the razor sits in is a little thinner so</li>
            <li>But, the other razor holders didnt fit the dollar club razors based on the reviewers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper for me to use the DriBlade and purchase refill packs than it is to just buy new blades.  </li>
            <li>This product will practically pay for itself in less than a year due to me not having to buy a case of razors more than once a year!  </li>
            <li>Case is somewhat large (especially for traveling)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unexpectedly, I received an email reply from Pat at DriBiz, the company that manufactures the product.  </li>
            <li>I will provide an update latter on how long my razor did last, but what I do enjoy more than the fact that the case simply extends the life of the razor is that I get less razor burn and bumps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to evaluate the claims of longer blade life, but the product is very well made-</li>
            <li>This case, saved my IPhone 5s and potentially hundreds of dollars to buy a new smartphone, for only $10!!!</li>
            <li>I previously tried very hard to clear all water off the blades by dipping in oil, etc, and this works better.</li>
            <li>This is a great kit to keep your razors dry and fresh, preventing horrible things like razor burn!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned my driblade case for a little while now and wanted to wait it out to see if it really worked as advertised.  </li>

            <li> I do an extra step in preserving the sharpness of the blades and reducing corrosion: After rinsing the cartridge thoroughly with a forceful flow of water, I blow through the cartridge from back to front to blast out any remaining water; then dab (don&#x27;t stroke) the cartridge face on a dry towel.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is great.  It let me use the same razor for almost 2 months. One of the best products I have bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few months now  and am very satisfied. It keeps my razor dry and sharp and the silicone pack is lasting longer than expected. I am meticulous with drying my razor before storage tho</li>
            <li> On a previous review I made a comment that the catch was a bit loose.  Unexpectedly, I received an email reply from Pat at DriBiz, the company that manufactures the product.  He offered to replace the box at no cost to me.  It arrived yesterday and the catch on the new one works perfectly.  We often have horror stories about poor responsiveness so I would like to offer my sincere thanks to DriBiz for exceptional customer support.  The product works perfectly and is a great solution for storing my Harry&#x27;s razor and blade safe from the rigors of frequent travel.  It holds the razor and blade in a dry environment so that it doesn&#x27;t get banged around.  If you are a frequent traveler like me, it is a great solution, and the company stands by the product.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit to keep your razors dry and fresh, preventing horrible things like razor burn! It is a bit bulky but still fits nicely in the wash kit bag I take to the gym. It&#x27;s made of good quality plastic so while I&#x27;ve not done so yet, will have no problems putting it in the dishwasher to clean it when necessary (the inner blue plastic the razor sits in is a little thinner so will update this review if I made the wrong decision!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who shaves once every two days or so this is really making me rethink my 4-blades a month to your door shipping service!</li>
            <li> I like the concept, but for me I don&#x27;t see any efficacy in keeping my blades sharper longer. I tested with and without it, and my subjective opinion is that I cannot see a difference.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Seems like I am getting extra shaves from my blades.</li>
            <li> Have not had long so based on initial impressions it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Perfect case for fusion Gillette razor system. I recommend this case for those who like to travel light.</li>
            <li> Pays for itself over time.  Have used the DriBlade for 8 months to care for my Harry&#x27;s cartridge razor.Works exactly as advertised in all respects. Excellent value for the money. I do an extra step in preserving the sharpness of the blades and reducing corrosion: After rinsing the cartridge thoroughly with a forceful flow of water, I blow through the cartridge from back to front to blast out any remaining water; then dab (don&#x27;t stroke) the cartridge face on a dry towel. With this step, and the DriBlade, my Harry&#x27;s cartridges last quite awhile--many more shaves than the Gilette Fusion Pro-Glide cartridges that I used to have.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband to use in his gym bag.  He says it does what it advertises - keeps his blade dry and rust-free.  It also protects the razor from damage due to the nice plastic case.  He gives this a high grade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many ways to extend the life of my Gillette Proglide razors so I decided to try the driblade case also. What caught my attention is that this case keeps the razor dry, which makes sense. I&#x27;ve tried oils, a fan and stroping 10 times every morning on another product with no improvement. After using this case for about one month, I am still using the same Proglide razor compared to two weeks without. I will provide an update latter on how long my razor did last, but what I do enjoy more than the fact that the case simply extends the life of the razor is that I get less razor burn and bumps.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the driblade case:&lt;br /&gt;- Razor lasts longer&lt;br /&gt;- Less razor burn&lt;br /&gt;- A sanitary place to put my razor&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;- Case is somewhat large (especially for traveling)&lt;br /&gt;If they can make a smaller case, it would be much better. But overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Looked everywhere for a razor case as I travel a lot...a little bulky but very nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was just throwing my razor in a drawer with other items.  As I stated in a review of the Blade Buddy, I use this case along with dipping the blade in alcohol in order to prolong blade life.  I do not know if using this product alone would help prolong blade life to the extent I want to extend them.  I also use the case when I travel to protect the blade and the other items in the kit bag that the blade could also damage.</li>
            <li> I have a pro glide and buying blades is expensive.  I started using the DriBlade and noticed that I was getting TWICE as many shaves than before I used it!!  Also, I have a thick beard combined with sensitive skin which causes a lot of irritation.  The DriBlade has helped to reduce the irritation from shaving by prolonging the life of my blades.  It&#x27;s cheaper for me to use the DriBlade and purchase refill packs than it is to just buy new blades.  Definite must buy!!!</li>
            <li> Just two words! It works!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a MUST buy.  There&#x27;s not much more to say about this product besides that it works.  I&#x27;ve owned my driblade case for a little while now and wanted to wait it out to see if it really worked as advertised.  I can now say that I only had to replace my razor after FOUR months of use (compared to my usal two week replacement time)!  The driblade keeps the razor sharp and the shave is always the same too.  No more pulling or tugging or irratation of the skin.  The same shave every time.  This product will practically pay for itself in less than a year due to me not having to buy a case of razors more than once a year!  This product comes highly reccomended.  You won&#x27;t believe it until you try in, but you will not be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> The product was defective (he sealing was not good), and I was refunded very fast. I will consider buying another one</li>
            <li> SEEMS TO WORK--NOT SURE. NEED BETTER INSTRUCTION SHEET.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit for womens razor.</li>
            <li> AMAZON MADE UP FOR MY MISUNDERSTANDING, KEEPING ME A HAPPY CUSTOMER AND A LOYAL CUSTOMER</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to evaluate the claims of longer blade life, but the product is very well made- doesn&#x27;t look or feel &#x27;cheap&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My razor head lasts me more than 7-8 uses, when I used to throw them out at every 2-3 shaves !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that, the inside micro hard foam which absorbs the wetness and water needs to be replaced often, good thing I bough another one along with the DriBlade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Very good product.</li>
            <li> works as promised get 3 x life of my blades</li>
            <li> Stores and holds your shaver! I currently use the dollar club razors and I needed a holder for my razor for travel. This did the job. Its a bit more than I wanted to pay and it takes up more room than it should. But, the other razor holders didnt fit the dollar club razors based on the reviewers.</li>
            <li> This case, saved my IPhone 5s and potentially hundreds of dollars to buy a new smartphone, for only $10!!! After dropping my IPhone in the toilette, I put my phone in the DriBlade Case for about 1.5 days and it was fully functional again. At first I was sceptical, but it really worked.&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, I have also been using the DriBlade case for my razor and I probably cut my expenses in half. The shave is always smooth and the lifespan of my razor doubled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is just a no-brainer, it saved my smartphone and cut my razor cost in half!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> This really works and makes the razor stay sharper over time.  I previously tried very hard to clear all water off the blades by dipping in oil, etc, and this works better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DriBlade for a year and wouldn&#x27;t be caught without one for my Harry&#x27;s Razor. I have one in my travel bag and one in each apartment. It&#x27;s great for travel as it protects my razor in addition to extending the useful life of Harry&#x27;s razor blades. In fact, I&#x27;ve suggested that Harry&#x27;s buy the company as it would be a natural fit</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I expected it to do. However, I would have preferred a less bulky design for travel purposes.</li>
