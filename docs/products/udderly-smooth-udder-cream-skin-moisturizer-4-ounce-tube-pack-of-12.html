            <li>Thank you, Udderly Smooth Udder Cream!</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this product and will always use it.</li>
            <li>None better.  </li>
            <li>This is ok for me, my friend raves about</li>
            <li>Maybe a more purse friendly size tube would be nice.</li>
            <li>If you have severe, cracked, dry skin then this is perfect!</li>
            <li>but now they are silky smooth :)</li>
            <li>It is light, non-greasy and works FABULOUSLY!</li>
            <li>I love Udderly Smooth lotions.</li>
            <li>I just happen to like the rich creamy texture of the L&#x27;Occitane better.</li>
            <li>An added plus: the packaging made it easy to take on trips or with me in my bag.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs easily and does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years; easy to carry in purse in the tube.  </li>
            <li>It provides a smooth application and a clean finish!</li>
            <li>Very good for winter months when skin get dry and chappy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway--the lotion works great on hands, feet, pretty much any body part</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing!</li>
            <li>a suggestion, this cream is available in 2oz tubes at Dollar Tree for $1 each, making it cheaper than the price listed here.</li>
            <li>Not Udderly Smooth.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy don&#x27;t have this sticky sensation on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>I told all my crew u have to get udder smooth to fell smooth</li>
            <li>Husband works for a printing co. &amp; keeps a tube in his desk as it will not leave a mark on paper when he touches it after using Udderly Smooth.  </li>
            <li>This winter, while visiting at St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, our host, who is an artist who does ceramics and pottery, gave me a tube of Udderly Smooth, which he uses to keep his hands smooth.  </li>
            <li>Within 2 or 3 days, my hands were healed, pain free, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is far superior.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m still more of an avid fan of L&#x27;Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream.</li>
            <li>I ordered this &amp;#34;Udder Cream&amp;#34; and when I got it, it was not the original formula.</li>
            <li>It has a slight, very pleasant fragrance and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I carry this tube size when I travel, but also love the large tub it comes in for home.</li>
            <li>This product is great for very dry hands without being overly greasy.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion really helps me out in the winter keeps my hands from splitting.</li>
            <li>And to top it off, it is very</li>
            <li>I keep it handy in my purse and feel it&#x27;s even strong enough to moisturize my feet as well.</li>
            <li>its great, cheap, you r hands feel a little greasy after wards but that goes away quick</li>
            <li>Not only is this product awesome for dry chapped hands, it is also fantastic for use on irritated skin caused from incontinence.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quick too.  </li>
            <li>Soaks in quick.</li>
            <li>I used it on my pregnant belly</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it is a miracle worker, but it helped out tremendously.</li>
            <li>The lotion quickly absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li>My hands had already begun drying out, but after using Udderly Smooth for 2 days, I can REALLY tell a difference!</li>
            <li>This purchase was very efficient and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>I accidentally stumbled on this product when looking for a good lotion for dry feet</li>
            <li>It absorbs really fast, and makes my hands super smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, absorbs super fast, and stays on well.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really good for dry skin!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Udderly smooth penetrates really well.</li>
            <li>Great for harsh winter weather.  </li>
            <li>I am so thrilled with the last cream with urea for my son</li>
            <li>I hope this information has been useful to you.</li>
            <li>My friend who bought the same product described it as a warm milk smell.  </li>
            <li>The quality of Udderly Smooth is amazing compared to other lotions I&#x27;ve paid $15 for...</li>
            <li>grade,\\&quot; as one reviewer put it, is right.  </li>
            <li>Nothing but positive things to say about this cream!</li>
            <li>It seems like it could be great, but the one that I received however was a very watered down to the point where it was literally dripping off of my hands.  </li>
            <li>and I have never been able to find a lotion/cream mild enough to use after shaving my legs.</li>
            <li>but I would rather spend a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li>Works well by absorbing into your skin quickly and is not sticky on your skin and does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found udderly smooth works better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I saw this, I was like what?  </li>
            <li>Its actually pretty funny to give to someone who has never heard of it</li>
            <li>I found it first in a quilt shop.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid cross-stitcher and work a lot with cotton and silk fibers and linen and evenweave fabrics.  </li>
            <li>This Udderly Smooth Udder Cream makes my skin supple, soft, and hydrated.</li>
            <li>my skin is so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>that said I&#x27;m willing to try again ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Im not very happy with this company anymore as they took a great product and are now cheating the customers.</li>
            <li>The Udderly smooth product is fine, but it was more expensive than most other sites, over $2.00 more per container.</li>
            <li>His entire bottom was bright, blazing red from the urine burn.  </li>
            <li>I am almost positive, like myself, that you will be a repeat customer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy, non-sticky, and get my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m constantly touching patients and washing hands before and after contact, my hands get INCREDIBLY dry.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended Uddery Smooth Udder Cream Moisturizer and BAM!, two days into using it, my hands are back to normal.</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fragrance, which is like baby powder, but fairly strong.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Udder Cream&amp;#34; does not have any water in it, not does it have a large list of ingredients.</li>
            <li>love that it absorbs right away, really no greasy feeling better than any other hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried...</li>
            <li>Other positive attributes I love about this cream is that the scent is not overbearing to the nose, lacks greasiness, does not stain my clothes, and fits conveniently in my purse.</li>
            <li>- it really absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels very silky and moisturizes your hands within seconds.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and it really helped with stretch marks as well.</li>
            <li>This works really well on all body parts except feet.</li>
            <li>i have so much to choose from</li>
            <li>I have switched to Udderly Smooth Udder Cream not because it is very inexpensive, but because it is clearly superior to other more expensive moisturizers on the market.</li>
            <li>The original formula had only 4 ingredients and they were all emollients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ya don&#x27;t have to be a cow to love it.</li>
            <li>It was delivered on time and in good condition and the product was just as all the previous products I&#x27;ve used from the same company.</li>
            <li>Also, it soaks in quickly and does not leave your hands with that gross, greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different things and this one actually works.</li>
            <li>the case is waterproof &amp; doesn&#x27;t take up much room, plus it will hold enough Udderly Smooth for several uses!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much (lotions tend to be too watery) but was pleasantly surprised with how emollient this lotion is without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this product is that is does not smell like the perfumed hand lotions I am used to, but it&#x27;s worth the trade off.  </li>
            <li>Nice consistency, not too thick.  </li>
            <li>the texture changed and became thin so it doesn&#x27;t feel as good on the hands...</li>
            <li>I can put some on, rub it in, and go right back to stitching without a worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product was actually made for chapped cow udders (you can imagine how grumpy a cow can get when you are trying to milk a tender teat... lol).  </li>
            <li>My hands stay soft and smooth all day with minimal reapplication.</li>
            <li>first time ordered the big bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different lotions, creams, special soaps etc.</li>
            <li>your new soft skin.</li>
            <li>Most lotions make my hands feel slippery/oily, a feeling that I HATE, but my skin absorbed this easily without leaving any residue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a perfume smell that doesn&#x27;t appeal to me since I have a low tolerance to certain scents.</li>
            <li>Very high quality considering the low price.</li>
            <li>This product works better on dry feet than any of the other 20</li>
            <li>Clearly I would buy again.</li>
            <li>I use it about 5-6 times daily and know it has really helped reverse the chapped irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I guess, to keep your skin soft and supple or to heal chapped or chafed skin.</li>
            <li>The result is soft skin without that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff is professional industrial grade stuff that works when you need it.</li>
            <li>I called the staff this morning, and the nurse examined his skin and told me the redness was almost all gone, and what was left was only light red in color!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer self conscious about having chapped skin on them.</li>
            <li>It keeps them soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>It keeps those areas feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Even brands like Lubriderm and Eucerin marketed towards sensitive skin did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend NOT purchasing the product from the Direct Care Store.</li>
            <li>So, I made the purchase, have it a try and was pleasantly surprised by it&#x27;s softening affect on my hands.</li>
            <li>the old ad used to say about another product  &amp;#34;Try</li>
            <li>but since my skin is really sensitive to lotion stuff</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it is highly scented.</li>
            <li>They get so dry that they crack over the knuckles and none of the creams my dermatologist suggested helped much.  </li>
            <li>I am a 24 year old female with extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My hands were very dry and chapped and nothing I was using was helping me much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using it year-round and especially when the weather makes it a bit dryer outside.</li>
            <li>My hands no longer stay chapped in the winter or crack open and my skin is always so soft.</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion my 7 year old will wear on her hands.</li>
            <li>The Dionne is not cheap but worth it.</li>
            <li>This was highly recommended by my doctor for my severely dry hands and feet as a side effect of chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li>It takes the dryness and roughness out of skin so quickly, even rough heels!!!!</li>
            <li>This product has a pleasant scent but it is very faint.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hands soft for a long period of time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps hands soft and promotes healing of cracked and dry hands.</li>
            <li>has really helped our dry cracked fingers, even the tips and it&#x27;s not greasy and oily like other brands we have tried.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really good in the winter for chapped hands.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy, not smelly, does a great job of making your skin feel better.  </li>
            <li> Even when Udderly Smooth is more a hand cream, I tried it on my feet and it worked perfect!</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE hand cream!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin so well that I never have that \\&quot;I&#x27;m greasy, I&#x27;d better not touch anything for an hour\\&quot; feeling!  </li>
            <li> Love!</li>

            <li> Nice, non-sticky moisturizer.</li>

            <li> worth the money !!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hands nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> Udderly Smooth Udder Cream works fairly well.</li>
            <li> This does ok for me, but i have to apply a couple times.</li>
            <li> I use it about three to four times a day on my hands and my hands have never looked better.</li>
            <li> It is her favorite during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I will not buy this one again, it&#x27;s okay for the price</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this as a hand moisturizer.</li>

            <li> Love this hand cream..</li>
            <li> parents also love this product and keep a bottle of it around the house.  </li>
            <li> I received this item for review and must say that I am well pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> It protects my wife&#x27;s skin from many side effects of cancer treatment.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream.  </li>
            <li> It would be better unscented, for sure.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Udderly Smooth Udder Cream!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product and will always use it.</li>
            <li> None better.  </li>
            <li> This is ok for me, my friend raves about</li>
            <li> Maybe a more purse friendly size tube would be nice.</li>
            <li> If you have severe, cracked, dry skin then this is perfect!</li>
            <li> but now they are silky smooth :)</li>
            <li> It is light, non-greasy and works FABULOUSLY!</li>
            <li> I love Udderly Smooth lotions.</li>
            <li> I just happen to like the rich creamy texture of the L&#x27;Occitane better.</li>
            <li> An added plus: the packaging made it easy to take on trips or with me in my bag.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs easily and does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years; easy to carry in purse in the tube.  </li>
            <li> It provides a smooth application and a clean finish!</li>
            <li> Very good for winter months when skin get dry and chappy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway--the lotion works great on hands, feet, pretty much any body part</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing!</li>
            <li> a suggestion, this cream is available in 2oz tubes at Dollar Tree for $1 each, making it cheaper than the price listed here.</li>
            <li> Not Udderly Smooth.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy don&#x27;t have this sticky sensation on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I told all my crew u have to get udder smooth to fell smooth</li>
            <li> Husband works for a printing co. &amp; keeps a tube in his desk as it will not leave a mark on paper when he touches it after using Udderly Smooth.  </li>
            <li> This winter, while visiting at St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, our host, who is an artist who does ceramics and pottery, gave me a tube of Udderly Smooth, which he uses to keep his hands smooth.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 or 3 days, my hands were healed, pain free, and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is far superior.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;m still more of an avid fan of L&#x27;Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream.</li>
            <li> I ordered this &amp;#34;Udder Cream&amp;#34; and when I got it, it was not the original formula.</li>
            <li> It has a slight, very pleasant fragrance and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I carry this tube size when I travel, but also love the large tub it comes in for home.</li>
            <li> This product is great for very dry hands without being overly greasy.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion really helps me out in the winter keeps my hands from splitting.</li>
            <li> And to top it off, it is very</li>
            <li> I keep it handy in my purse and feel it&#x27;s even strong enough to moisturize my feet as well.</li>
            <li> its great, cheap, you r hands feel a little greasy after wards but that goes away quick</li>
            <li> Not only is this product awesome for dry chapped hands, it is also fantastic for use on irritated skin caused from incontinence.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quick too.  </li>
            <li> Soaks in quick.</li>
            <li> I used it on my pregnant belly</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is a miracle worker, but it helped out tremendously.</li>
            <li> The lotion quickly absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> My hands had already begun drying out, but after using Udderly Smooth for 2 days, I can REALLY tell a difference!</li>
            <li> This purchase was very efficient and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> I accidentally stumbled on this product when looking for a good lotion for dry feet</li>
            <li> It absorbs really fast, and makes my hands super smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, absorbs super fast, and stays on well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good for dry skin!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Udderly smooth penetrates really well.</li>
            <li> Great for harsh winter weather.  </li>
            <li> I am so thrilled with the last cream with urea for my son</li>
            <li> I hope this information has been useful to you.</li>
            <li> My friend who bought the same product described it as a warm milk smell.  </li>
            <li> The quality of Udderly Smooth is amazing compared to other lotions I&#x27;ve paid $15 for...</li>
            <li> grade,\\&quot; as one reviewer put it, is right.  </li>
            <li> Nothing but positive things to say about this cream!</li>
            <li> It seems like it could be great, but the one that I received however was a very watered down to the point where it was literally dripping off of my hands.  </li>
            <li> and I have never been able to find a lotion/cream mild enough to use after shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> but I would rather spend a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li> Works well by absorbing into your skin quickly and is not sticky on your skin and does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found udderly smooth works better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I saw this, I was like what?  </li>
            <li> Its actually pretty funny to give to someone who has never heard of it</li>
            <li> I found it first in a quilt shop.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid cross-stitcher and work a lot with cotton and silk fibers and linen and evenweave fabrics.  </li>
            <li> This Udderly Smooth Udder Cream makes my skin supple, soft, and hydrated.</li>
            <li> my skin is so smooth and soft</li>
            <li> that said I&#x27;m willing to try again ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Im not very happy with this company anymore as they took a great product and are now cheating the customers.</li>
            <li> The Udderly smooth product is fine, but it was more expensive than most other sites, over $2.00 more per container.</li>
            <li> His entire bottom was bright, blazing red from the urine burn.  </li>
            <li> I am almost positive, like myself, that you will be a repeat customer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy, non-sticky, and get my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m constantly touching patients and washing hands before and after contact, my hands get INCREDIBLY dry.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended Uddery Smooth Udder Cream Moisturizer and BAM!, two days into using it, my hands are back to normal.</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fragrance, which is like baby powder, but fairly strong.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Udder Cream&amp;#34; does not have any water in it, not does it have a large list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> love that it absorbs right away, really no greasy feeling better than any other hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried...</li>
            <li> Other positive attributes I love about this cream is that the scent is not overbearing to the nose, lacks greasiness, does not stain my clothes, and fits conveniently in my purse.</li>
            <li> - it really absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels very silky and moisturizes your hands within seconds.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and it really helped with stretch marks as well.</li>
            <li> This works really well on all body parts except feet.</li>
            <li> i have so much to choose from</li>
            <li> I have switched to Udderly Smooth Udder Cream not because it is very inexpensive, but because it is clearly superior to other more expensive moisturizers on the market.</li>
            <li> The original formula had only 4 ingredients and they were all emollients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ya don&#x27;t have to be a cow to love it.</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and in good condition and the product was just as all the previous products I&#x27;ve used from the same company.</li>
            <li> Also, it soaks in quickly and does not leave your hands with that gross, greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different things and this one actually works.</li>
            <li> the case is waterproof &amp; doesn&#x27;t take up much room, plus it will hold enough Udderly Smooth for several uses!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much (lotions tend to be too watery) but was pleasantly surprised with how emollient this lotion is without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is that is does not smell like the perfumed hand lotions I am used to, but it&#x27;s worth the trade off.  </li>
            <li> Nice consistency, not too thick.  </li>
            <li> the texture changed and became thin so it doesn&#x27;t feel as good on the hands...</li>
            <li> I can put some on, rub it in, and go right back to stitching without a worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was actually made for chapped cow udders (you can imagine how grumpy a cow can get when you are trying to milk a tender teat... lol).  </li>
            <li> My hands stay soft and smooth all day with minimal reapplication.</li>
            <li> first time ordered the big bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different lotions, creams, special soaps etc.</li>
            <li> your new soft skin.</li>
            <li> Most lotions make my hands feel slippery/oily, a feeling that I HATE, but my skin absorbed this easily without leaving any residue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a perfume smell that doesn&#x27;t appeal to me since I have a low tolerance to certain scents.</li>
            <li> Very high quality considering the low price.</li>
            <li> This product works better on dry feet than any of the other 20</li>
            <li> Clearly I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I use it about 5-6 times daily and know it has really helped reverse the chapped irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I guess, to keep your skin soft and supple or to heal chapped or chafed skin.</li>
            <li> The result is soft skin without that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff is professional industrial grade stuff that works when you need it.</li>
            <li> I called the staff this morning, and the nurse examined his skin and told me the redness was almost all gone, and what was left was only light red in color!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer self conscious about having chapped skin on them.</li>
            <li> It keeps them soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> It keeps those areas feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Even brands like Lubriderm and Eucerin marketed towards sensitive skin did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend NOT purchasing the product from the Direct Care Store.</li>
            <li> So, I made the purchase, have it a try and was pleasantly surprised by it&#x27;s softening affect on my hands.</li>
            <li> the old ad used to say about another product  &amp;#34;Try</li>
            <li> but since my skin is really sensitive to lotion stuff</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it is highly scented.</li>
            <li> They get so dry that they crack over the knuckles and none of the creams my dermatologist suggested helped much.  </li>
            <li> I am a 24 year old female with extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My hands were very dry and chapped and nothing I was using was helping me much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using it year-round and especially when the weather makes it a bit dryer outside.</li>
            <li> My hands no longer stay chapped in the winter or crack open and my skin is always so soft.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion my 7 year old will wear on her hands.</li>
            <li> The Dionne is not cheap but worth it.</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended by my doctor for my severely dry hands and feet as a side effect of chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li> It takes the dryness and roughness out of skin so quickly, even rough heels!!!!</li>
            <li> This product has a pleasant scent but it is very faint.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hands soft for a long period of time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps hands soft and promotes healing of cracked and dry hands.</li>
            <li> has really helped our dry cracked fingers, even the tips and it&#x27;s not greasy and oily like other brands we have tried.</li>
            <li> Uddery Smooth absorbs completely into the skin and does not leave a greasy, sticky residue behind like other lotions do.</li>
            <li> I expected something thicker, and was a little apprehensive when I used it the first time.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use this regularly during the winter, my hands get so dry &amp; chapped that my knuckles literally crack open and bleed.  </li>
            <li> Now I only used it once, so I don&#x27;t know about long term.</li>
            <li> Well! I have to say that when I finally can use my flip flops is when my feet are dryer than ever and couldn&#x27;t keep them hydrated for too long.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> They simply rubbed off and my chapped knuckles were just as dry</li>
            <li> Bought this at local store for my dry feet.  </li>
            <li> As the designated dishwasher in my household (I suppose that this is because no one has the mental or physical capacity to pour soap on a sponge and rub the dish and rinse it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t go on as thick as some lotions, but works into your skin really well and keeps it moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some other lotions I have tried, this product seems to last longer.  </li>
            <li> I used this product all year long and would never be without it!</li>
            <li> i s different than any other hand lotions or creams I have tried, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li> My hands get very rough and dry especially my palms.</li>
            <li> Before, my hands were always so dry that they would crack/</li>
            <li> These days it is sold as a hand cream and it works miracles on my chapped dry hands.  </li>
            <li> Helps with my dry hands that I get from handling lots of paper and stitching floss.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be without it in this dry Arizona desert.</li>
            <li> As a contractor, his hands are often chapped and dry and, as a man, he HATES putting on any type of cream.</li>
            <li> I have had dry cuticles for years and could not find a solution.</li>
            <li> While I think it&#x27;s a bit too heavy for overall body use, I use it on my hands every day, and several times a day during the winter.  </li>
            <li> With other creams I always had to re-apply but one application with udder cream is efficient for the whole day in hot or chilly temperatures.</li>
            <li> When I applied it on my hands it initially felt bland - lack of fancy scent and polished grease -</li>
            <li> Those areas are no longer dry and as rough.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and cracked heels and this did nothing.</li>
            <li> This cream works extremely well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> My rough areas are noticeably smoother now...</li>
            <li> helps rough, cracked skin</li>
            <li> Every winter, in our very dry Colorado climate, my hands get so dry that my fingertips and thumb tips crack open, and get so sore that I can hardly even type on my computer keyboard.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint is after a while (and not that long)</li>
            <li> The scent is not over powering and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hands sticky like other brands do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy again &amp; will be keeping it close year round!</li>
            <li> I bought this after a particularly rough NYC winter that just keeps on coming!</li>
            <li> so it does work on other places.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t use on any of your parts infected with cow pox.</li>
            <li> I usually only use all natural products, I feel guilty using it because it is loaded with parables/preservatives, it just works so well.</li>
            <li> They were thick and oily, but they didn&#x27;t seem to penetrate deeply enough to help.</li>
            <li> It always leaves my skin perfectly soft without leaving behind an oily or sticky mess.  </li>
            <li> so my hands dry out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I just put a \\&quot;glob\\&quot; of it on &amp; let it sit for a few minutes before rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li> She use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I turned him on his side and positioned him with pillows, then had a firm discussion with the nursing home staff about the situation.  </li>
            <li> Works well, except for the annoying light scent ...  </li>
            <li> SINCE IT IS SO DRY HERE IN COLORADO, THIS CREAM IS THE &amp;#34;ONLY&amp;#34; PRODUCT THAT WORKS TO KEEP MY SKIN MOISTURIZED!!!!!  </li>
            <li> all of them burn my raw irritated skin.</li>
            <li> but my hands still get dry and irritatingly itchy.</li>
            <li> if you have a small purse, buy a contact lens case &amp; squeeze some in each side -</li>
            <li> so I ordered a small tube to try it out.  </li>
            <li> I got a small tube of this stuff as a sample from a website order.</li>
            <li> My problem areas, which are usually my elbows and knees, stay moisturized all day after one application.</li>
            <li> It penetrates fully in just a few seconds, even when you apply a thick layer.</li>
            <li> I have a job where I am outdoors most of the time and especially in cold weather.</li>
            <li> do stitching and this leaves no stains on my creations and leaves my hands soft and helps prevents chaffing in the cold weather</li>
            <li> If you are troubled by dry skin, do yourself a favor and try just the small tube to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I have used it on my feet, hands, arms and lower legs - all of the areas where I am troubled by dry skin.  </li>
            <li> , it smells so bad especially after 10 or 15 min.</li>

            <li> I wash my hands a lot at work and I crochet so my hands dry out pretty bad. This does ok for me, but i have to apply a couple times.</li>
            <li> Best softening cream ever.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE hand cream!  I use it every time after washing my hands or doing the dishes because the water out her is very hard. Before, my hands were always so dry that they would crack/split but now they are silky smooth :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and found a good deal online to buy a case of it.  It was delivered on time and in good condition and the product was just as all the previous products I&#x27;ve used from the same company.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this moisturizer!  It&#x27;s non-greasy, non-sticky, and get my skin super soft.  It absorbs quick too.  This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> If you have severe, cracked, dry skin then this is perfect! I use it about three to four times a day on my hands and my hands have never looked better. I would never use anything else again!</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom, who works on her farm a lot. It is her favorite during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and now can&#x27;t find in the local market.  This purchase was very efficient and received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> You can purchase this cream at the dollar stores for a $1 per tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many moisturizers. I will not buy this one again, it&#x27;s okay for the price but I would rather spend a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this as a hand moisturizer. Most lotions make my hands feel slippery/oily, a feeling that I HATE, but my skin absorbed this easily without leaving any residue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a suggestion, this cream is available in 2oz tubes at Dollar Tree for $1 each, making it cheaper than the price listed here.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with UDDERLY anything. All of their skin products are wonderful. I am so thrilled with the last cream with urea for my son, I am now not going to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I also had no problems with shipping or the packaging. It all went fine.&lt;br /&gt;You will love these skin products. They are so silky and absorb so sweetly.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your new soft skin.</li>
            <li> This product was actually made for chapped cow udders (you can imagine how grumpy a cow can get when you are trying to milk a tender teat... lol).  These days it is sold as a hand cream and it works miracles on my chapped dry hands.  The only downside to this product is that is does not smell like the perfumed hand lotions I am used to, but it&#x27;s worth the trade off.  The New York winters can do cruel things to a ladies hands and I am happy to have this product, perfume or no perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nursing student and I also volunteer in my local hospital. Being in the health field, there is a habit that must be practiced each time we have patient contact-- to wash our hands as much as possible... (Infection control people) Because I&#x27;m constantly touching patients and washing hands before and after contact, my hands get INCREDIBLY dry. I&#x27;ve tried Aveeno, Nivea, Curel, Neutrogena, Vaseline etc. but my hands still get dry and irritatingly itchy. After trying this, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m settling for more expensive and commercially played out products. I&#x27;m sticking to this one-- it&#x27;s not only inexpensive (especially for students like myself), it also totally works. This never leaves my scrubs pockets, even the nurses I work with want a couple of tubes now. By the way, get them in your nearest dollar tree stores. You will never regret it!</li>
            <li> love it and no funky smeel</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It moisturizes and softens skin beautifully without leaving a sticky residue. It is great for chopped skin and works good as a moisturizer on all parts of the body. I have switched to Udderly Smooth Udder Cream not because it is very inexpensive, but because it is clearly superior to other more expensive moisturizers on the market.</li>
            <li> The first time I saw this, I was like what?  Udder cream?  Really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, all kidding aside, this is a very good lotion and I have bought it and used it for years and also given it as a gift.  Its actually pretty funny to give to someone who has never heard of it and then watch their double-take when they see the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this size so that I can take it with me on trips and keep some in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t go on as thick as some lotions, but works into your skin really well and keeps it moisturized.  Really great for the winter or if you work with paper or someplace where you have to wash your hands a lot.</li>
            <li> I use Dionne Udder Balm and this doesn&#x27;t come close to it.  The Dionne is not cheap but worth it.</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended by my doctor for my severely dry hands and feet as a side effect of chemotherapy.  Udderly Smooth smells very nice and moisturizes without that greasy feeling.  I use it about 5-6 times daily and know it has really helped reverse the chapped irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream.. No perfume and moisturizers my hands perfectly.. Use it after each time I wash my hands</li>
            <li> Works well by absorbing into your skin quickly and is not sticky on your skin and does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li> Well, I was initially confused by the directions telling me to wash udder and teat parts. \\&quot;Why,\\&quot; thought I, \\&quot;do I need to wash my teats just to put lotion on my hands?\\&quot; Nevertheless, I went ahead and did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway--the lotion works great on hands, feet, pretty much any body part I guess, to keep your skin soft and supple or to heal chapped or chafed skin. I&#x27;ve found udderly smooth works better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words of caution: keep out of your eyes. it hurts. Bad. Also, don&#x27;t use on any of your parts infected with cow pox.</li>
            <li> I found it first in a quilt shop.  I haven&#x27;t used anything else since!  It absorbs into the skin so well that I never have that \\&quot;I&#x27;m greasy, I&#x27;d better not touch anything for an hour\\&quot; feeling!  It has relieved some occurances of excema for me too - I just put a \\&quot;glob\\&quot; of it on &amp; let it sit for a few minutes before rubbing it in.  Not only did it stop the itching, but after about a week, the spot was virtually gone!  WooHoo!! &lt;br /&gt;And if you have a small purse, buy a contact lens case &amp; squeeze some in each side - the case is waterproof &amp; doesn&#x27;t take up much room, plus it will hold enough Udderly Smooth for several uses!</li>
            <li> I am an avid cross-stitcher and work a lot with cotton and silk fibers and linen and evenweave fabrics.  For anyone who is worried about staining their stitching projects with greasy products, this is a great option.  I use it all the time, and have no problems with it.  I can put some on, rub it in, and go right back to stitching without a worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parents also love this product and keep a bottle of it around the house.  Very good for winter months when skin get dry and chappy.</li>
            <li> Just what the label says!  I accidentally stumbled on this product when looking for a good lotion for dry feet so I ordered a small tube to try it out.  This stuff is really good for dry skin!  I have used it on my feet, hands, arms and lower legs - all of the areas where I am troubled by dry skin.  The result is soft skin without that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling.  Unlike some other lotions I have tried, this product seems to last longer.  This product has a pleasant scent but it is very faint.  So, it is a perfect product for men who do not want to smell like perfume!  If you are troubled by dry skin, do yourself a favor and try just the small tube to begin with.  I am almost positive, like myself, that you will be a repeat customer.  I hope this information has been useful to you.</li>
            <li> gift for friend who can&#x27;t find udder cream where she lives.  she loves it too.</li>
            <li> This cream works extremely well on dry skin. It always leaves my skin perfectly soft without leaving behind an oily or sticky mess.  It provides a smooth application and a clean finish! I highly recommend using it year-round and especially when the weather makes it a bit dryer outside. An added plus: the packaging made it easy to take on trips or with me in my bag.  Nothing but positive things to say about this cream!</li>
            <li> A friend bought this for herself but accidentally left it in my car.  One day when I was out of my own hand cream, I decided to give this a try and I was hooked!  It&#x27;s very thick but it doesn&#x27;t go on greasy - it really absorbs into the skin.  While I think it&#x27;s a bit too heavy for overall body use, I use it on my hands every day, and several times a day during the winter.  Keep a tube in your purse for those cold, hand-chapping months.</li>
            <li> I got a small tube of this stuff as a sample from a website order. I saw the name and the pathetic packaging and said I&#x27;ll try it later when I run out of my \\&quot;best\\&quot; stuff. This is no joke this is some of the best stuff I have ever used. I put on my feet and the skin crackes were literally gone overnight. When I applied it on my hands it initially felt bland - lack of fancy scent and polished grease - but this stuff is professional industrial grade stuff that works when you need it. Now I only used it once, so I don&#x27;t know about long term.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a lotion.  It&#x27;s a cream, and it works!!  It makes my hands soft for a long period of time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for an excellent product!!</li>
            <li> I received this item for review and must say that I am well pleased with the quality. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much (lotions tend to be too watery) but was pleasantly surprised with how emollient this lotion is without feeling greasy. I keep it handy in my purse and feel it&#x27;s even strong enough to moisturize my feet as well. Would definitely purchase.</li>
            <li> I am torn about this product, I got it cheaper at a mom and pop shop (ahem Amazon). It absorbs really fast, and makes my hands super smooth. I have a couple issues with it though, it smells so bad especially after 10 or 15 min. My friend who bought the same product described it as a warm milk smell.  It also has a ton of chemicals in it. I usually only use all natural products, I feel guilty using it because it is loaded with parables/preservatives, it just works so well.</li>
            <li> As the designated dishwasher in my household (I suppose that this is because no one has the mental or physical capacity to pour soap on a sponge and rub the dish and rinse it...I guess you can say I&#x27;m a bit hostile about that.) my hands go through a lot.  I&#x27;ve used several different lotions, creams, special soaps etc. to help keep my hands from drying out, but they either don&#x27;t work or the products are too greasy feeling.  Not Udderly Smooth.  Udderly Smooth is perfect for my hands.  The scent is not over powering and a little goes a long way.  Also, it soaks in quickly and does not leave your hands with that gross, greasy feeling.  An extra perk, the price.  The quality of Udderly Smooth is amazing compared to other lotions I&#x27;ve paid $15 for...you just can&#x27;t beat it! If you have dishpan hands, this is for you!</li>
            <li> Good stuff  it works. Made a mistake first time ordered the big bottle. Using it caused bottle to crack on side seam. Squeeze tube seems built stronger. Clearly I would buy again.</li>
            <li> It protects my wife&#x27;s skin from many side effects of cancer treatment. It is not greasy. She use it everyday.</li>
            <li> SINCE IT IS SO DRY HERE IN COLORADO, THIS CREAM IS THE &amp;#34;ONLY&amp;#34; PRODUCT THAT WORKS TO KEEP MY SKIN MOISTURIZED!!!!!  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Industrial grade,\\&quot; as one reviewer put it, is right.  This is the only stuff that works for me.  If I don&#x27;t use this regularly during the winter, my hands get so dry &amp; chapped that my knuckles literally crack open and bleed.  When I use this stuff regularly, no problem.  Note that their foot cream is recommended for diabetic patients because it contains no alcohol.  I keep it in both bathrooms at home; I keep it at the office; and I travel with it.  Any questions?</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Not greasy, not smelly, does a great job of making your skin feel better.  During winter, you&#x27;d want to set this up like an IV bottle so you can keep it dripping onto your hands.</li>
            <li> This product works better on dry feet than any of the other 20+ I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money !!!</li>
            <li> My boss gave this stuff to me one day when i left my hand cream at home, i will be a faithful customer from this point on.</li>
            <li> its great, cheap, you r hands feel a little greasy after wards but that goes away quick</li>
            <li> This Udderly Smooth Udder Cream makes my skin supple, soft, and hydrated. My problem areas, which are usually my elbows and knees, stay moisturized all day after one application. With other creams I always had to re-apply but one application with udder cream is efficient for the whole day in hot or chilly temperatures. Other positive attributes I love about this cream is that the scent is not overbearing to the nose, lacks greasiness, does not stain my clothes, and fits conveniently in my purse. Definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Well! I have to say that when I finally can use my flip flops is when my feet are dryer than ever and couldn&#x27;t keep them hydrated for too long. I tried coconut oil before but made them too sweat. Even when Udderly Smooth is more a hand cream, I tried it on my feet and it worked perfect! I enjoy don&#x27;t have this sticky sensation on my hands and feet. I work in an office handling paper all the time and this cream became my best friend, I have it in my desk using it anytime I need. Definitely a Good product!</li>
            <li> I love it my skin is so smooth and soft I told all my crew u have to get udder smooth to fell smooth</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hands sticky like other brands do. It feels very silky and moisturizes your hands within seconds. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Just in time for winter! My hands had already begun drying out, but after using Udderly Smooth for 2 days, I can REALLY tell a difference! I expected something thicker, and was a little apprehensive when I used it the first time. It is light, non-greasy and works FABULOUSLY! I&#x27;ll definitely buy again &amp; will be keeping it close year round!</li>
            <li> Best lotion/moisturizer available!</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing! Helps with my dry hands that I get from handling lots of paper and stitching floss.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested by my podiatrist.  I am undergoing chemotherapy and get a lot of hand and foot disease (redness and blisters on palms of hands and soles of feet)  This product has been the only thing that brings relief.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Podiatrist uses it too, he is undergoing chemo too</li>
            <li> I used it only once &amp; felt the difference ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t come back &amp; edit this, than it is still a 5 star review</li>
            <li> Not only is this product awesome for dry chapped hands, it is also fantastic for use on irritated skin caused from incontinence.  My dad is in a nursing home.  I turned him over last night and found him lying in a urine-soaked bed.  His entire bottom was bright, blazing red from the urine burn.  He was literally \\&quot;scalded\\&quot;!  I gently washed and dried the irritated skin, then applied a liberal amount of the Udder Cream.  I turned him on his side and positioned him with pillows, then had a firm discussion with the nursing home staff about the situation.  I called the staff this morning, and the nurse examined his skin and told me the redness was almost all gone, and what was left was only light red in color!!!  The nurse put a phone call into his doctor to get a permanent order for his chart to use this for treatment on his skin as needed.  I am MORE than impressed with the results of this product!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular with what type of cream I use, I drive all day and I can&#x27;t have my hands grease, this cream have work for me just great!</li>
            <li> This product is great for very dry hands without being overly greasy. Convenient size. Price is good for the product.</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream.  I keep one in my purse and one in the car.  Nice consistency, not too thick.  Absorbs easily and does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Stummbled on to this several years ago and have been hooked ever since. My hands no longer stay chapped in the winter or crack open and my skin is always so soft. I used this product all year long and would never be without it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve tried many different things and this one actually works. And it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after you use it. Soaks in quick.</li>
            <li> I love Udderly Smooth lotions. I&#x27;m a fan. Maybe a more purse friendly size tube would be nice. It&#x27;s thin but it moisturizes well. Scent-free. Still, I&#x27;m still more of an avid fan of L&#x27;Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream. This is heaps cheaper though. I just happen to like the rich creamy texture of the L&#x27;Occitane better.</li>
            <li> The tops of my hands suffer with multiple hand washings per day. They get so dry that they crack over the knuckles and none of the creams my dermatologist suggested helped much.  They were thick and oily, but they didn&#x27;t seem to penetrate deeply enough to help. They simply rubbed off and my chapped knuckles were just as dry underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Udderly smooth penetrates really well. It penetrates fully in just a few seconds, even when you apply a thick layer. It dries to a silky finish rather than a greasy one or a silicone-coated sticky feeling (like \\&quot;Working Hands\\&quot; does).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fragrance, which is like baby powder, but fairly strong. It would be better unscented, for sure. When I want fragrance, I use my perfume - and I prefer my lotion not to interfere with the scent.</li>
            <li> The Udderly smooth product is fine, but it was more expensive than most other sites, over $2.00 more per container.</li>
            <li> Nice, non-sticky moisturizer. Can&#x27;t be without it in this dry Arizona desert. My husband and I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Ya don&#x27;t have to be a cow to love it. Great for harsh winter weather.  It&#x27;s the best cream I know.</li>
            <li> this is a great product to soften and heal chapped hands, and elbows , does not leave them greasy and smells good</li>
            <li> love that it absorbs right away, really no greasy feeling better than any other hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried...my only complaint is after a while (and not that long) the texture changed and became thin so it doesn&#x27;t feel as good on the hands...that said I&#x27;m willing to try again ...this time in the pump...I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just packaging that made the texture weird...</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion really helps me out in the winter keeps my hands from splitting.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a particularly rough NYC winter that just keeps on coming! My hands were very dry and chapped and nothing I was using was helping me much. A friend recommended Uddery Smooth Udder Cream Moisturizer and BAM!, two days into using it, my hands are back to normal. I&#x27;m no longer self conscious about having chapped skin on them. Thank you, Udderly Smooth Udder Cream!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years; easy to carry in purse in the tube.  Husband works for a printing co. &amp; keeps a tube in his desk as it will not leave a mark on paper when he touches it after using Udderly Smooth.  Keeps hands soft and promotes healing of cracked and dry hands.</li>
            <li> For women who have had to undergo radiation of their breasts.  It keeps them soft and supple.  I bought for a friend who had breast cancer and underwent radiation.</li>
            <li> I was told about this incredible cream by my brother-in-law MANY years ago. As a contractor, his hands are often chapped and dry and, as a man, he HATES putting on any type of cream. This one is different, he said, because it works, period!!!  It has a slight, very pleasant fragrance and absorbs quickly.  I tried it then and there and have used it ever since because it works. I carry this tube size when I travel, but also love the large tub it comes in for home. It goes on smoothly, absorbs super fast, and stays on well. I use it in my hands and feet. Absolutely LOVE this product and will always use it.</li>
            <li> I suffer from eczema and my hands are cracked and bleeding. As a stay at home mom I am constantly washing my hands. As dry and painful as my hands are I HATE the greasy oily feel of lotion and cream and all of them burn my raw irritated skin. That feeling makes me wash my hands. This is the only thing that helps me. I use it head to toe. It doesn&#x27;t burn at all even after shaving. I used it on my pregnant belly and it really helped with stretch marks as well. This stuff is awesome. I keep the jar by my bed and tubes all around the house and car.</li>
            <li> Yup met my expectations</li>
            <li> I work in the medical field and constantly washing my hands,  this product is greaat! Makes my hands nice and smooth! Finally found a product that works well and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> I use Udderly on my hands and feet but my focal areas are my knees, elbows and the sole of my feet as these are the driest and roughest areas on my body. It keeps those areas feeling soft and hydrated. It&#x27;s simply wonderful and amazing!!! Those areas are no longer dry and as rough. this product is definitely a keeper. My rough areas are noticeably smoother now...Yay!!!</li>
            <li> helps rough, cracked skin</li>
            <li> has really helped our dry cracked fingers, even the tips and it&#x27;s not greasy and oily like other brands we have tried.</li>
            <li> I am a 24 year old female with extremely sensitive skin and I have never been able to find a lotion/cream mild enough to use after shaving my legs. Even brands like Lubriderm and Eucerin marketed towards sensitive skin did not work for me. My Mom introduced me to this product and I discovered that it works perfectly for use immediately after shaving! It doesn&#x27;t sting, doesn&#x27;t cause a rash, and is moisturizing! This has been the BEST find!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Not greasy and long lasting.  Really good in the winter for chapped hands.  None better.  Used Corn Huskers for years.  This is far superior.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. My wife has used this for four pregnancies, one with twins, and she still  does not have stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have had dry cuticles for years and could not find a solution. Udderly Smooth Udder Cream works fairly well. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is a miracle worker, but it helped out tremendously.</li>
            <li> Very high quality considering the low price. The only drawback is that it is highly scented. It has a perfume smell that doesn&#x27;t appeal to me since I have a low tolerance to certain scents.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand lotion I have found. It doesn&#x27;t have any perfumy smell. The lotion quickly absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> I ordered this &amp;#34;Udder Cream&amp;#34; and when I got it, it was not the original formula. The &amp;#34;Udder Cream&amp;#34; does not have any water in it, not does it have a large list of ingredients. The original formula had only 4 ingredients and they were all emollients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im not very happy with this company anymore as they took a great product and are now cheating the customers.</li>
            <li> This lotion really is amazing.  It takes the dryness and roughness out of skin so quickly, even rough heels!!!! Love!</li>
            <li> I have a friend that has sworn by this product for years. It seems like it could be great, but the one that I received however was a very watered down to the point where it was literally dripping off of my hands.  I would recommend NOT purchasing the product from the Direct Care Store.</li>
            <li> my daughter doesn&#x27;t complain that her hands hurt when applying lotion. This is the only lotion my 7 year old will wear on her hands.</li>
            <li> This cream works well and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on my hands.  My father used to milk cows and used udder cream all of the time on his hands.</li>
            <li> I have a job where I am outdoors most of the time and especially in cold weather. I also have to wash my hands numerous times in the course of the day and that is a problem as well. My hands get very rough and dry especially my palms. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of lotions but the results all seem to be temporary and my palms are sandpaper once again.&lt;br /&gt;I saw an ad for \\&quot;Udderly Smooth\\&quot; in a magazine and thought to myself; \\&quot;why not?\\&quot;. So, I made the purchase, have it a try and was pleasantly surprised by it&#x27;s softening affect on my hands. Uddery Smooth absorbs completely into the skin and does not leave a greasy, sticky residue behind like other lotions do. My hands stay soft and smooth all day with minimal reapplication. Love it, buy it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is like a miracle to me!  Every winter, in our very dry Colorado climate, my hands get so dry that my fingertips and thumb tips crack open, and get so sore that I can hardly even type on my computer keyboard.  This winter, while visiting at St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, our host, who is an artist who does ceramics and pottery, gave me a tube of Udderly Smooth, which he uses to keep his hands smooth.  Within 2 or 3 days, my hands were healed, pain free, and smooth.  I have been using it ever since.  And it i s different than any other hand lotions or creams I have tried, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy.  And to top it off, it is very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the old ad used to say about another product  &amp;#34;Try it, you&#x27;ll like it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My friend gave me this product for Christmas last year and it has become a regular product for me now. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought this at local store for my dry feet.  Works well, except for the annoying light scent ...  would give this a 5-star if it&#x27;s fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> This works really well on all body parts except feet. I have very dry and cracked heels and this did nothing. But, I now have the softest butt, legs and arms so it does work on other places. I like that it is not greasy and has a pleasant scent, not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again..</li>
            <li> This is ok for me, my friend raves about but since my skin is really sensitive to lotion stuff i forget to use it coz i have so much to choose from and i forget which one i had put on.</li>
            <li> do stitching and this leaves no stains on my creations and leaves my hands soft and helps prevents chaffing in the cold weather</li>
