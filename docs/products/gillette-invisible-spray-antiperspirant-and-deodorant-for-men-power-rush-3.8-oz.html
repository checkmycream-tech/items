            <li> Good keeping your dry even though it goes on wet. The gel last a long time. As well as the scent. Tried other, but this lasted so far the longest. The price was really good as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m working in the hospital and moving a lot. This stuff is awful. I don&#x27;t even know what is  better just sweat  or use this and smell like skunk sprayed with perfume. And when 7 more hours to work and you already start feeling that smell. It&#x27;s not much fun. Just tossed it to the trash. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Product as listed.  Prompt shipping</li>
            <li> And boy howdy, it hates hypoallergenic glycerin soap. I ended creating a new scent that was not pretty, it was like some type of cleaning chemical spill.  On the other hand, it does overpower the soap in about fifteen minutes. Medical professionals and members of the Military be warned, you do not want to waste money on this product, it is that overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great bargain. Works well too.</li>
            <li> Works great one small application and I am good for 24 hours if need be</li>

            <li> Thank you! Everything is super!!!!</li>
            <li> Have used this deodorant for years. All scents. Had to switch from old spice after years of use started giving me a rash. Love the clear gel soo much better than solid deodorant.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long as solid deodorant(in terms of how many uses) but the scent lasts in your pits all day.</li>
            <li> like always, gillette gel is the best deodorant ever.</li>
            <li> Amazingly awesome product. husband smells so much better now.</li>
            <li> The deodorant works well and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> great price and satisfied with product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gilette Clear gel for a long time and it always offered great protection. Just for curiosity, tried this scent. It&#x27;s a bit stronger that you should express from &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; gel. Will go back to &amp;#34;Cool wave&amp;#34; scent, after this one ends.</li>
            <li> Great manly smell. Great value for money.</li>
            <li> Great buy refreshing with a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> WORKS AND SMELLS GOOD.</li>
            <li> A good deodorant.  Long lasting, no residue, easy to apply. No real odor and a great value.</li>
            <li> They recently changed the \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; of this product so now is smells to me like I&#x27;ve been sweating all day right when I put it on.  I&#x27;ve used this for years, after they screwed up the dark green labeled product the same way, but now I switched to the orange labeled product.  I give it 3 starts just because the base product works well and most importantly is clear so there&#x27;s no white stuff flaking off all day.</li>
            <li> Good quality Thank you</li>
