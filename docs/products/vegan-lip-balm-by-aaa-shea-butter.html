    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Neither is the case with this wonderful lip balm.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Just not the best...</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell or taste very good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good lip product for a while now and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have found a vegan product that doesn&#x27;t taste like dirt.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and it are always shipped promptly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s vegan, which is great for me because I&#x27;m vegan.</li>
            <li>This works great.  </li>
            <li>While there is no doubt an interesting smell and taste to this lip balm, it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Very happy and will order more when I need it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thought I was buying a good vegan product.  </li>
            <li>My bet is if you are on Amazon looking for vegan lip-balm, then you would probably also care to know if the cocoa butter is Fair Trade.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly smooth vegan lip balm, it smells delicious too.</li>
            <li>and I love this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about a week, and I love it!</li>
            <li>I thought it would get better for some reason but no way!</li>
            <li>This one is unflavored and once you get used  to the shea butter flavor (easy to get used to), it is great.  </li>
            <li>It has done amazing things for me</li>
            <li>this lip balm felt nice on, but i could not get over the scent.</li>
            <li>I researched until I found this kind-</li>
            <li>The 1st time I order and use this item I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Smells kind of...</li>
            <li>I really liked this lip balm</li>
            <li>The texture is not quite as smooth as the more popular lip balms on the market, but it smells great and keeps my lips moisturized.</li>
            <li>Now I have shea butter in a stick, my lips are soft, moist, non-greasy, and wonderfully hydrated.</li>
            <li>and I love the ingredients, but it&#x27;s kind of clumply.</li>
            <li>it is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste great, but that&#x27;s OK because the way it keeps my lips moisturized with a pretty sheen makes up for the taste.</li>
            <li>This was a huge pass for me!</li>
            <li>I was confident it would work</li>
            <li>This meant I would end up with way more on my lips</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>in all, I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>What more could a person want?</li>
            <li>Better than the store bought stuff.</li>
            <li>This product is refreshing and soothing.  </li>
            <li>Love it, will buy again.</li>
            <li>It feels great on, so I really can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>SIMPLE YET MARVELOUS!!</li>
            <li>I was using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Organic Magic Lip Balm in Lemon Lime.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it and definitely plan to buy it again!</li>
            <li>I can say I love that it is vegan though...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure if you used it more than me it would work better.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>There are so many better lip balms out there.</li>
            <li>Within two weeks, the threads in the interior of the balm, for the plastic screw, must have worn out and I couldn&#x27;t even twist more up.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>I got 1 tube of this at first and loved it.</li>
            <li>hope this helps those like me who are trying to find a planet/body friendly lip balm!</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s smooth, it&#x27;s my favorite chapstick in the world.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural option.  </li>
            <li>I found an easy fix which is to just pop it in the fridge overnight</li>
            <li>This lip balm does not glide on easily.  </li>
            <li>With that said, this product is in a convenient and portable container, but again it&#x27;s something I could easily \\&quot;make myself.</li>
            <li>and then my lips were perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>so I find this stuff great but someone who has never used it before may find it off putting as shea butter has a definite smell to it that some may not appreciate.</li>
            <li>This  had such great reviews that I bought it, but it isn&#x27;t anything to write home about.  </li>
            <li>It feels gritty/sandy and not as smooth as I think it should be.</li>
            <li>He proceeded to tell his audience that coconut oil and shea butter are good, natural lip balms.</li>
            <li>so I can choose between the Original and Spearmint.</li>
            <li>It will probably work better for those in warmer climates ;)</li>
            <li>Before buying this lip balm be sure you don&#x27;t mind the taste or smell of pure shea butter on your lips.</li>
            <li>There is a chance I’ll buy it again, but with a full understanding that I may need to shelf the tube for a while before I can use it, or just always keep it in my pocket as opposed to bag.</li>
            <li>Great buy for a person with very dry lips!</li>
            <li>I was happy that the shea butter worked, but I could only use it at home since it&#x27;s in a large container.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, like many others, my first instinct was to wipe it off because of the taste.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy again and appreciate products like this since becoming vegetarian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cause an adverse reaction, and it helped calm the allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the smell/taste and grit factor aren&#x27;t a big deal when you consider how well the balm works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>IF YOU WANT SILKY SOFT LIPS :)</li>
            <li>I was more than surprised when I went to twist the bottom</li>
            <li>I love the strong smell personally because it smells so much like coconuts to me and doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I have a LOT of allergies, and have been searching for the right kind of lip balm for a long time.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and helps heal dry lips.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product--it is so hard to find a vegan lip balm.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - it actually moisturizes your lips without drying them out and doing more damage to them.</li>
            <li>THIS IS ALL NATURAL AND CHEMICAL FREE SOOO</li>
            <li>I used to purchase lipstick from a well known TV shopping channel years ago that featured &#x27;shea butter&#x27; and it was the first time my lips were NOT chapped once all winter.</li>
            <li>4 months later I tried it again – and both tubes have a nice soft consistency balm that I can use now!</li>
            <li>Also, as many have mentioned, it does glide on a bit gritty for a week or two, give or take depending on how much you use it.</li>
            <li>Was very crumbly when I first got it</li>
            <li>It smells earthy (not bad earthy) and makes my lips feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I love that stuff so much, and it was GREAT on my skin, but sadly I just developed a citrus allergy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a problem with some lip balms that seem to moisturize, but after I use them for a while my lips start to crack and peel (not pleasant or attractive).  </li>
            <li>I have literally bought every single lip balm at sephora and none were able to keep my lips moist.</li>
            <li>I also use pure shea butter too</li>
            <li>When it is warm enough to be a little soft it feels very nice and last much longer than beeswax or petroleum lip balms</li>
            <li>this very inexpensive stick of pure shea butter, so that I may wear with any lipstick or none.</li>
            <li>I applied a little before and after applying lipliner and the texture came out so nice that it was as if I had put on lipstick.</li>
            <li>(I actually didn&#x27;t mind the smell at all, but my boyfriend wasn&#x27;t a huge fan).</li>
            <li>have yet to figure out a way to make it go back to being all smooth.</li>
            <li>Very flakey and does not stay on lips very well.</li>
            <li>works very well to heal your lips</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change, tbh.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it as it was just too much work.</li>
            <li>or is it really old/expired?</li>
            <li>It was super hard and dry but all you gotta do is either warm it up by rubbing it on the back of your hand, Light a lighter and wave it over the tip of the chapstick (u do not want to melt it since it will destroy some of the beneficial properties), or dip it in some warm water.</li>
            <li>The Hugo lip balms actually taste and smell great and moisturize as well as any other regular balm.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>However, when I realized how much it soothed and moisturized my dry lips, I quickly got used to it</li>
            <li>My lips have stayed soft and supple, and the balm seems to stay on my lips much longer then any others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>(it probably doesn&#x27;t need that many hours, but that&#x27;s what works for my schedule), then it stays firm throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s the Shea butter, and maybe that&#x27;s normal,</li>
            <li>Is this normal?...</li>
            <li>It is a little grainy but it&#x27;s really moisturizing and smooth on.</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t found any other lip balm that&#x27;s as smooth as this one is.</li>
            <li>My new go to lip balm.</li>
            <li>Since there are other ingredients with higher melting points, it doesn&#x27;t go back to being smooth.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it seems to work ok after the initial stink and chunkiness.</li>
            <li>Most have beeswax....or are flavored with some weird, sweet concoction.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really bother me because the grits(all they are is the hardened lip balm that hasn&#x27;t been melted by body heat) quickly melted after a few seconds</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that the lip balm gets soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural...</li>
            <li>Excuse the exclamation points, but really!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>Must have gotten an old tube.</li>
            <li>The balm was soft and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I can only conclude that this is old stock, as the product will not come out of the tube, and will not go onto lips like normal lip balms do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lip balm addict, and was excited to try this, as I usually stick to the drug store stuff.</li>
            <li>Although \\&quot;chunky\\&quot; as others have described, it really did last a long time and result in soft, just-barely sheeny, kissable lips</li>
            <li>Honestly, as an avid user of raw shea butter that I get for five dollars off the streets of NYC, I felt I could easily place some shea butter in a small container and use on my lips instead of purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a natural lip balm for quite a while now, and I think I&#x27;ve finally found it!  </li>
            <li>NOT liquid, just a soft solid.  </li>
            <li>There are only four natural ingredients in it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 39 and want to continue to prevent any wrinkles, but because it&#x27;s all natural I find that it does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>the first few days I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually allergic to peppermint and sunflower oil, among other things, so that makes my selection pretty limited.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 more and at first became deeply disappointed: both tubes had a very dry balm that couldn&#x27;t be applied unless I melted it first with the heat of my finger (not something I would normally do due to hygiene considerations).</li>

            <li> I also use pure shea butter too</li>
            <li> When it is warm enough to be a little soft it feels very nice and last much longer than beeswax or petroleum lip balms</li>
            <li> this very inexpensive stick of pure shea butter, so that I may wear with any lipstick or none.</li>
            <li> I applied a little before and after applying lipliner and the texture came out so nice that it was as if I had put on lipstick.</li>
            <li> (I actually didn&#x27;t mind the smell at all, but my boyfriend wasn&#x27;t a huge fan).</li>
            <li> have yet to figure out a way to make it go back to being all smooth.</li>
            <li> Very flakey and does not stay on lips very well.</li>
            <li> works very well to heal your lips</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change, tbh.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it as it was just too much work.</li>
            <li> or is it really old/expired?</li>
            <li> It was super hard and dry but all you gotta do is either warm it up by rubbing it on the back of your hand, Light a lighter and wave it over the tip of the chapstick (u do not want to melt it since it will destroy some of the beneficial properties), or dip it in some warm water.</li>
            <li> The Hugo lip balms actually taste and smell great and moisturize as well as any other regular balm.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> However, when I realized how much it soothed and moisturized my dry lips, I quickly got used to it</li>
            <li> My lips have stayed soft and supple, and the balm seems to stay on my lips much longer then any others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> (it probably doesn&#x27;t need that many hours, but that&#x27;s what works for my schedule), then it stays firm throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s the Shea butter, and maybe that&#x27;s normal,</li>
            <li> Is this normal?...</li>
            <li> It is a little grainy but it&#x27;s really moisturizing and smooth on.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t found any other lip balm that&#x27;s as smooth as this one is.</li>
            <li> My new go to lip balm.</li>
            <li> Since there are other ingredients with higher melting points, it doesn&#x27;t go back to being smooth.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it seems to work ok after the initial stink and chunkiness.</li>
            <li> Most have beeswax....or are flavored with some weird, sweet concoction.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really bother me because the grits(all they are is the hardened lip balm that hasn&#x27;t been melted by body heat) quickly melted after a few seconds</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the lip balm gets soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural...</li>
            <li> Excuse the exclamation points, but really!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> Must have gotten an old tube.</li>
            <li> The balm was soft and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I can only conclude that this is old stock, as the product will not come out of the tube, and will not go onto lips like normal lip balms do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm addict, and was excited to try this, as I usually stick to the drug store stuff.</li>
            <li> Although \\&quot;chunky\\&quot; as others have described, it really did last a long time and result in soft, just-barely sheeny, kissable lips</li>
            <li> Honestly, as an avid user of raw shea butter that I get for five dollars off the streets of NYC, I felt I could easily place some shea butter in a small container and use on my lips instead of purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a natural lip balm for quite a while now, and I think I&#x27;ve finally found it!  </li>
            <li> NOT liquid, just a soft solid.  </li>
            <li> There are only four natural ingredients in it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 39 and want to continue to prevent any wrinkles, but because it&#x27;s all natural I find that it does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> the first few days I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually allergic to peppermint and sunflower oil, among other things, so that makes my selection pretty limited.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 more and at first became deeply disappointed: both tubes had a very dry balm that couldn&#x27;t be applied unless I melted it first with the heat of my finger (not something I would normally do due to hygiene considerations).</li>
            <li> when I open the next 2 tube it was the same, very dry and crusty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to keep it on constantly because, as I said, it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out.</li>
            <li> It crumbles and is unusable, completely dried out, like rubbing a regular old tree stick on my lips.</li>
            <li> When I open it the new tube of lip balm was very dry, hard and crusty.</li>
            <li> #34;warm up&amp;#34; enough to get it even remotely spread on my lips!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my lips had been extremely chapped my entire life.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, it stunk really bad and the first time i used it, chunks came off.</li>
            <li> This product was horribly dry.</li>
            <li> In fact, too dry to even apply.</li>
            <li> Dry, dry,</li>
            <li> The lip balm I received was crumbly and incredibly dry.</li>
            <li> I would agree initially, but once you go back and forth across your lips a few tips</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect Shea butter to be this dry!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to reapply nearly as often as in the past with other brands.</li>
            <li> In cold weather, it was nearly impossible to get on my lips, chunks would fall off the top of the balm, and I had trouble twisting more out of the tube.</li>
            <li> You need lots of coats to feel moisturized and even then it only lasts for a little bit.  </li>
            <li> So despite enjoying the effect, I was so frustrated after trying to get it on that I gave up.</li>
            <li> i would have rather spent my money on something else.</li>
            <li> It does have a smell, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a lip balm with just a few basic ingredients</li>
            <li> A few issues and both are related to the number one ingredient: Cocoa Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes LONG way.</li>
            <li> It is so dry and \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; that its hard to actually get it on your lips.</li>
            <li> If you are searching for a vegan product without beeswax (my need was due to an allergy to beeswax), I recommend HUGO NATURALS.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe it any other way.</li>
            <li> This felt weird when I first tried it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some tubes that were smooth and others that were hard, gritty, and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Now I will only use raw shea butter on my lips, and I will continue to buy this lip balm!</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s hard and gritty, I feel cheated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I feel like I need lip balm a lot less since using this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s suppose to be this way, or if I just happened to get a tube of WAY out-dated lip balm, but this stuff is SO dry that if I try to use it, little pieces just crumble off of it.</li>
            <li> I watched a clip of a famous tv doctor who stated how to tell if you&#x27;re addicted to lip balm... needless to say, i was!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few days and found that it keep my lips moist.  </li>
            <li> but after a few uses it was easier to glide on.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> the negative side, I feel like this product ran out way before any other lip balm I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on well at all and is stiff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an old one of these or what, but it&#x27;s hard as a rock and is difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I already owned raw shea butter that I used as moisturizer, but decided to put some on my lip to see if it would help.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I searched for raw shea butter lip balm and came across this one.</li>
            <li> I reads some reviews about it being a little hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks, I hardly noticed the taste.</li>
            <li> It does feel really nice, and lasts a long time, but it smells awful, like a dirty, musty room, on your lips.</li>
            <li> I purchased this specifically because it was fragrance and lanolin-free, which can be quite hard to find.  </li>
            <li> This consistency is hard and it crumbles when you try to use it.</li>
            <li> it was dreadfully hard &amp; hurt to try and rub it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to beeswax and it&#x27;s really hard to find lip balms without it.  </li>
            <li> I apply at least twice a day</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> My  lips didn&#x27;t chap at all during the long, cold winter.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not good either.</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;d take a bad smell over dry chapped lips any day!</li>
            <li> In the process of trying, I broke the plastic screw off of the base and couldn&#x27;t get it back on.</li>
            <li> Product is hard when cold, but I keep it in my pocket.</li>
            <li> do not buy vegan lip balm by aaa shea butter, not worth your money...   :(</li>
            <li> This stuff is very hard and feels like it&#x27;s tryiing to pull my lips off!</li>
            <li> Chap stick was dried out :(</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed this item is not consistent.</li>
            <li> It also has an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> it smells bad and as soon as i put it on my lips, i could taste it, yuck....</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> So I figure it was a bad tube.</li>
            <li> Tastes bad, smells bad and when you try to put it on your lips it crumbles all up.  </li>
            <li> Bad buy...</li>
            <li> I used to get really bad chapped lips too, to the point where they would bleed frequently!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I was soon disappointed.</li>
            <li> Petroleum base lip balm dries out my lips, this does not.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product...</li>
            <li> It does smell \\&quot;raw\\&quot; but it fades and it does not leave a nasty taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, way too crumbly, and not moisturizing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product was horribly dry. In fact, too dry to even apply. If you are searching for a vegan product without beeswax (my need was due to an allergy to beeswax), I recommend HUGO NATURALS. I&#x27;m so happy to have found a vegan product that doesn&#x27;t taste like dirt. The Hugo lip balms actually taste and smell great and moisturize as well as any other regular balm.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction on my lip, so I was scared to put anything on my lips fearing I would exacerbate the problem. I already owned raw shea butter that I used as moisturizer, but decided to put some on my lip to see if it would help. It didn&#x27;t cause an adverse reaction, and it helped calm the allergic reaction. I was happy that the shea butter worked, but I could only use it at home since it&#x27;s in a large container. That&#x27;s when I searched for raw shea butter lip balm and came across this one. I was confident it would work and it did! It doesn&#x27;t taste great, but that&#x27;s OK because the way it keeps my lips moisturized with a pretty sheen makes up for the taste. It also continued to heal the dermatitis on my lip. Now I will only use raw shea butter on my lips, and I will continue to buy this lip balm! Please never stop making it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a natural lip balm for quite a while now, and I think I&#x27;ve finally found it!  I&#x27;ve had a problem with some lip balms that seem to moisturize, but after I use them for a while my lips start to crack and peel (not pleasant or attractive).  Others would moisturize well, but I felt like I was forever re-applying.&lt;br /&gt;Neither is the case with this wonderful lip balm.  My lips have stayed soft and supple, and the balm seems to stay on my lips much longer then any others I&#x27;ve tried.  And it also has 4 simple ingredients, although Amazon lists them incorrectly, the package I received April 2012 lists: Cocoa Butter, Organic Coconut Oil, Candelilla Wax, Certified Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only 2 potential negatives I&#x27;ve found:&lt;br /&gt;1 - The smell.  I already use Shea Butter for my hair, so I knew (and like) what it smells like, but I understand that it&#x27;s not for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;2 - Now that it&#x27;s summer and I&#x27;m keeping my house warmer (72 degrees) I&#x27;ve noticed that the lip balm gets soft. NOT liquid, just a soft solid.  This meant I would end up with way more on my lips then I needed.  I found an easy fix which is to just pop it in the fridge overnight (it probably doesn&#x27;t need that many hours, but that&#x27;s what works for my schedule), then it stays firm throughout the day.  Problem solved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps those like me who are trying to find a planet/body friendly lip balm!</li>
            <li> Product is hard when cold, but I keep it in my pocket. When it is warm enough to be a little soft it feels very nice and last much longer than beeswax or petroleum lip balms</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on writing reviews but for this, I HAD to. Words cannot describe how moisturizing this lip balm is. I put it on before bed and woke up to kissable lips. I applied a little before and after applying lipliner and the texture came out so nice that it was as if I had put on lipstick. It does smell \\&quot;raw\\&quot; but it fades and it does not leave a nasty taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it are always shipped promptly. I purchased this specifically because it was fragrance and lanolin-free, which can be quite hard to find.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love it. Doesn&#x27;t go on well at all and is stiff. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> i would have rather spent my money on something else. it smells bad and as soon as i put it on my lips, i could taste it, yuck.... do not buy vegan lip balm by aaa shea butter, not worth your money...   :(</li>
            <li> While there is no doubt an interesting smell and taste to this lip balm, it works wonderfully. When I first put it on, like many others, my first instinct was to wipe it off because of the taste. However, when I realized how much it soothed and moisturized my dry lips, I quickly got used to it and it wasn&#x27;t as bad. After using it for a few weeks, I hardly noticed the taste. If you don&#x27;t like the taste, you might want to try the Spearmint flavor. I recently bought it to try so I can choose between the Original and Spearmint. Also, as many have mentioned, it does glide on a bit gritty for a week or two, give or take depending on how much you use it. It didn&#x27;t really bother me because the grits(all they are is the hardened lip balm that hasn&#x27;t been melted by body heat) quickly melted after a few seconds and then my lips were perfectly smooth. Honestly, the smell/taste and grit factor aren&#x27;t a big deal when you consider how well the balm works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this lip balm. It has done amazing things for me and I&#x27;m not just saying that. I&#x27;ve been searching for a good lip product for a while now and this is perfect. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - it actually moisturizes your lips without drying them out and doing more damage to them. I don&#x27;t have to keep it on constantly because, as I said, it doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out. There are only four natural ingredients in it and it&#x27;s vegan, which is great for me because I&#x27;m vegan. What more could a person want?</li>
            <li> This works great.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few days and found that it keep my lips moist.  I highly recommend this.  Better than the store bought stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is refreshing and soothing.  Petroleum base lip balm dries out my lips, this does not.  Love it, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan! It&#x27;s natural...so it&#x27;s not going to taste like candy. It definitely does the job, and the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; or \\&quot;chunkiness\\&quot; never bothered me. Great buy for a person with very dry lips!</li>
            <li> I can only conclude that this is old stock, as the product will not come out of the tube, and will not go onto lips like normal lip balms do. Dry, dry, dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought I was buying a good vegan product.  The smell is not good either. I cannot recommend at all, try something else if you can.</li>
            <li> this lip balm felt nice on, but i could not get over the scent. i wiped it off several minutes after applying it, and could still smell/taste it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a recommendation.  Even though I&#x27;m not fond of the smell, I like it.  It feels great on, so I really can&#x27;t complain.  It does have a smell, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  I probably will be purchasing another once I run out and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ALL NATURAL AND CHEMICAL FREE SOOO WHY WOULDN&#x27;T YOU WANT TO BUY THIS...SIMPLE YET MARVELOUS!! BUY THIS IF YOU WANT SILKY SOFT LIPS :)</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of allergies, and have been searching for the right kind of lip balm for a long time. I&#x27;m actually allergic to peppermint and sunflower oil, among other things, so that makes my selection pretty limited. I was using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Organic Magic Lip Balm in Lemon Lime. I love that stuff so much, and it was GREAT on my skin, but sadly I just developed a citrus allergy and I can&#x27;t use it anymore. I was looking for a lip balm with just a few basic ingredients and I love this! I love the strong smell personally because it smells so much like coconuts to me and doesn&#x27;t bother me. It is a little grainy but it&#x27;s really moisturizing and smooth on. I&#x27;m very happy with it and definitely plan to buy it again!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell. It doesn&#x27;t have that nice coco butter smell,it just smells dirty. I can&#x27;t describe it any other way. I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> Before buying this lip balm be sure you don&#x27;t mind the taste or smell of pure shea butter on your lips. I&#x27;m used to it so I find this stuff great but someone who has never used it before may find it off putting as shea butter has a definite smell to it that some may not appreciate.</li>
            <li> Because this product uses coconut oil, quality per tube may vary. For those that don&#x27;t know, coconut oil melts at a temperature of 78°F/25.5°C. Because of this, it can often melt and then reconstitute. When it does so, it often becomes gritty. Since there are other ingredients with higher melting points, it doesn&#x27;t go back to being smooth. I&#x27;ve had some tubes that were smooth and others that were hard, gritty, and unpleasant. When it&#x27;s smooth, it&#x27;s my favorite chapstick in the world. When it&#x27;s hard and gritty, I feel cheated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to figure out a way to make it go back to being all smooth. I even tried heating it until everything melted, hoping that it would reconstitute evenly but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It fell apart when I used it. Very flakey and does not stay on lips very well.</li>
            <li> This  had such great reviews that I bought it, but it isn&#x27;t anything to write home about.  You need lots of coats to feel moisturized and even then it only lasts for a little bit.  I can say I love that it is vegan though...</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, it stunk really bad and the first time i used it, chunks came off. Other than that, it seems to work ok after the initial stink and chunkiness.</li>
            <li> I watched a clip of a famous tv doctor who stated how to tell if you&#x27;re addicted to lip balm... needless to say, i was! He proceeded to tell his audience that coconut oil and shea butter are good, natural lip balms. I researched until I found this kind- which has both of his recommended ingredients! I&#x27;ve used it for about a week, and I love it! It hydrates well and I don&#x27;t have to reapply nearly as often as in the past with other brands. The smell, however, is another story. To me, it smells like almond butter. Just not the best... But, I&#x27;d take a bad smell over dry chapped lips any day!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this stuff! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s suppose to be this way, or if I just happened to get a tube of WAY out-dated lip balm, but this stuff is SO dry that if I try to use it, little pieces just crumble off of it. What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> The lip balm I received was crumbly and incredibly dry. I didn&#x27;t even bother putting it on my lips because as soon as I opened the tube, it fell everywhere. Be warned.</li>
            <li> Excuse the exclamation points, but really! I used to purchase lipstick from a well known TV shopping channel years ago that featured &#x27;shea butter&#x27; and it was the first time my lips were NOT chapped once all winter. Well, that lipstick line went out of business, or was no longer offered, and I had found Amazon, my #1 shopping site. Now I had to find lipstick with shea butter, and what did I find but this very inexpensive stick of pure shea butter, so that I may wear with any lipstick or none. Now I have shea butter in a stick, my lips are soft, moist, non-greasy, and wonderfully hydrated. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The 1st time I order and use this item I really liked it. So the 2nd time I order 3 sticks of the lip balm. When I open it the new tube of lip balm was very dry, hard and crusty. So I figure it was a bad tube. when I open the next 2 tube it was the same, very dry and crusty. I am very disappointed this item is not consistent.</li>
            <li> This consistency is hard and it crumbles when you try to use it. Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> This lip balm does not glide on easily.  Instead, it tends to break into tiny chunks instead of smoothing over my lips.</li>
            <li> My new go to lip balm. It smells earthy (not bad earthy) and makes my lips feel so soft. A little goes LONG way. I also use this around my eyes. I&#x27;m only 39 and want to continue to prevent any wrinkles, but because it&#x27;s all natural I find that it does not irritate my skin. I also use it on my cuticles. Try it, will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Tastes bad, smells bad and when you try to put it on your lips it crumbles all up.  I bought one for me and one for a friend and we both tried it one time each and then threw it away.  Bad buy...</li>
            <li> This is a great product--it is so hard to find a vegan lip balm. Most have beeswax....or are flavored with some weird, sweet concoction.  This one is unflavored and once you get used  to the shea butter flavor (easy to get used to), it is great.  My  lips didn&#x27;t chap at all during the long, cold winter.  Very happy and will order more when I need it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product...it was dreadfully hard &amp; hurt to try and rub it on. It took several seconds to &amp;#34;warm up&amp;#34; enough to get it even remotely spread on my lips!</li>
            <li> works very well to heal your lips but i have to use a lighter to melt it every time before using especially in winter, it just won&#x27;t come stick to your lips</li>
            <li> Was very crumbly when I first got it but after a few uses it was easier to glide on. Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change, tbh. I apply at least twice a day but I&#x27;m sure if you used it more than me it would work better. Smells kind of... Musty? I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my lips had been extremely chapped my entire life. I have literally bought every single lip balm at sephora and none were able to keep my lips moist. This felt weird when I first tried it out. It was super hard and dry but all you gotta do is either warm it up by rubbing it on the back of your hand, Light a lighter and wave it over the tip of the chapstick (u do not want to melt it since it will destroy some of the beneficial properties), or dip it in some warm water. This is the only lip balm I will ever buy. I also use pure shea butter too but shea dries out faster than this lip balm. Thank you for making such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Must have gotten an old tube. It crumbles and is unusable, completely dried out, like rubbing a regular old tree stick on my lips. I tried melting it a bit, but this doesn&#x27;t work, either.</li>
            <li> A few issues and both are related to the number one ingredient: Cocoa Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) There is nothing &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; about this flavor; it is cocoa. Your lips will taste like chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) This lip balm is vegan in that it contains no animal by-products.  However, the number one ingredient is cocoa butter which comes from the cocoa bean. My bet is if you are on Amazon looking for vegan lip-balm, then you would probably also care to know if the cocoa butter is Fair Trade.  At time of purchase, this information is not provided on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I got 1 tube of this at first and loved it. The balm was soft and moisturizing. I bought 2 more and at first became deeply disappointed: both tubes had a very dry balm that couldn&#x27;t be applied unless I melted it first with the heat of my finger (not something I would normally do due to hygiene considerations). But if I carry it in my jean pocket, body heat was enough to soften it. I stopped using it as it was just too much work. 4 months later I tried it again – and both tubes have a nice soft consistency balm that I can use now! There is a chance I’ll buy it again, but with a full understanding that I may need to shelf the tube for a while before I can use it, or just always keep it in my pocket as opposed to bag.</li>
            <li> I reads some reviews about it being a little hard to apply.  I would agree initially, but once you go back and forth across your lips a few tips it is very smooth.  It has a nice smell and helps heal dry lips.  I feel like I need lip balm a lot less since using this product.  I would absolutely buy again and appreciate products like this since becoming vegetarian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, I feel like this product ran out way before any other lip balm I have ever used.  I was more than surprised when I went to twist the bottom and there was nothing left.  Make me wonder if there was 2 oz in there when I received it....</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, way too crumbly, and not moisturizing. This was a huge pass for me! There are so many better lip balms out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm addict, and was excited to try this, as I usually stick to the drug store stuff. It does feel really nice, and lasts a long time, but it smells awful, like a dirty, musty room, on your lips. Maybe that&#x27;s the Shea butter, and maybe that&#x27;s normal, I don&#x27;t know, but I almost can&#x27;t stand it. This is an emergency tube for me now.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lip balm the first few days I used it. Although \\&quot;chunky\\&quot; as others have described, it really did last a long time and result in soft, just-barely sheeny, kissable lips (I actually didn&#x27;t mind the smell at all, but my boyfriend wasn&#x27;t a huge fan). However, I was soon disappointed. In cold weather, it was nearly impossible to get on my lips, chunks would fall off the top of the balm, and I had trouble twisting more out of the tube. Within two weeks, the threads in the interior of the balm, for the plastic screw, must have worn out and I couldn&#x27;t even twist more up. In the process of trying, I broke the plastic screw off of the base and couldn&#x27;t get it back on. So despite enjoying the effect, I was so frustrated after trying to get it on that I gave up. It will probably work better for those in warmer climates ;)</li>
            <li> I love the smell and I love the ingredients, but it&#x27;s kind of clumply. It feels gritty/sandy and not as smooth as I think it should be. Is this normal?... or is it really old/expired?</li>
            <li> Incredibly smooth vegan lip balm, it smells delicious too. I have a problem with chapped lips, especially living in Arizona, but this lip balm keeps my lips from drying out or chapping. I used to get really bad chapped lips too, to the point where they would bleed frequently!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must-have for anyone with lip problems, I haven&#x27;t found any other lip balm that&#x27;s as smooth as this one is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to beeswax and it&#x27;s really hard to find lip balms without it.  This is a great natural option.  Leaves lips feeling silky, and not addictive like some of the others out there.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect Shea butter to be this dry! It doesn&#x27;t glide, slide or anything else across your lips. I thought it would get better for some reason but no way! This stuff is very hard and feels like it&#x27;s tryiing to pull my lips off!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an old one of these or what, but it&#x27;s hard as a rock and is difficult to apply. Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell or taste very good. Waste of money. Regret purchase.</li>
            <li> Chap stick was dried out :(</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this balm is vegan and only has a handful of ingredients in it.  The texture is not quite as smooth as the more popular lip balms on the market, but it smells great and keeps my lips moisturized.</li>
            <li> Honestly, as an avid user of raw shea butter that I get for five dollars off the streets of NYC, I felt I could easily place some shea butter in a small container and use on my lips instead of purchasing this product.  With that said, this product is in a convenient and portable container, but again it&#x27;s something I could easily \\&quot;make myself.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the tube, chunks fell from it. It is so dry and \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; that its hard to actually get it on your lips. While applying, it crumbles apart. It also has an unpleasant smell. I opened two tubes and both had the same issues.</li>
            <li> A+ for being Vegan. I don&#x27;t like the smell though. That took two stars for me. My kids don&#x27;t mind though.</li>
