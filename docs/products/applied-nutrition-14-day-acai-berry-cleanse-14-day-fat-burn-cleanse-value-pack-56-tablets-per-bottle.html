    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Cardio and abdominal excercises work best.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to find this.</li>
            <li>This item might be good for others</li>
            <li>so over all it works along with good diet and exercise.</li>
            <li>and I felt good</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you whether it&#x27;s effective or not because..     </li>
            <li>You have to workout though it won&#x27;t work on its own.</li>
            <li>I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt my health is better because of the nice herb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to safely stick to well known name brand products which are FDA approved.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lose 3 lbs in as many days and truly feel like my body is cleansing itself.</li>
            <li>Make sure you drink alot of water and also keep your excercises in variety, cardio one day, sit ups another etc.</li>
            <li>When I take it I feel like my body has more energy and my workouts tend to be better.</li>
            <li>i have dropped about seven pounds with better dieting and exercise.</li>
            <li>i need more is fat burner.</li>
            <li>I have ordered the maxreducer product, is that better?</li>
            <li>I felt better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prompt shipping, good product, very satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Give it a go but make the commitment to work out and try to eat healthy, nothing after 6:30pm  with the exception of 1 or 2 minimal snacks- granola bar or rice cakes is good to have after 6:30 just 2 max!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you want a cleanse that will give you energy, help irregularity (very gently), and give you overall good health benefits then BUY IT!</li>
            <li>So make sure the first week you have access to the restroom because when it hits you have minutes if not seconds.  </li>
            <li>Everyone reacts differently to supplements so this product may or may not be for you, but I have had nothing but great results and highly recommend these products!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking Acai Berry for about two months with good results (related to weight loss).  </li>
            <li>&quot; My favorite part of the whole system is the fat burn cleanse.</li>
            <li>for some reason, I thought it would be good to try something different.</li>
            <li>didnt really make me go the bathroom, but it did give me more energy to work out.</li>
            <li>I purchased mine from CVS for $17.99, and its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but in the end it just wasn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li>I am thankful that I was able to take this product back and get a full refund.</li>
            <li>It certainly cleans you out!</li>
            <li>Let me say that this product is very gentle.</li>
            <li>Im not sluggish anymore which is rare for a 30yr old woman with a full time job.</li>
            <li>and I must say that I feel better than I have felt in several months.</li>
            <li>First of all, no where does it say if you should take them together or if you should do them separately but after reading a couple reviews from this website and another I was under the impression that you were supposed to take them together.</li>
            <li>Day one - I did exactly as the box said and took the pills in the morning before breakfast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably why so many people are having adverse reactions taking both at the same time....</li>
            <li>and I kept loosing weight first week</li>
            <li>I took this in the first place because I have problems going its been a problem since childhood and</li>
            <li>I guess this or any cleanse or diet pills work differently for different people but acai berry is truly a good cleanse</li>
            <li>But on the plus side, I found that my appetite was curved so staying on a low calories diet plan was pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty much the routine with plenty of water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these products together, as directed for a full 7 days so far.  </li>
            <li>AKA too much sugar adds to the benefits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m like most people, after careful review, decided to buy this product to assist in weightloss.</li>
            <li>I suggest if you really want to shed those pounds.</li>
            <li>I really like these products.  </li>
            <li>Did not see much difference if any.</li>
            <li>Added to my workout routine it really boost my metabolism.  </li>
            <li>it really does work,, you slim your waist fast buy</li>
            <li>/&gt;i felt that the fat burn works better than the other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It clearly states on the acai cleanse bottle, \\&quot;use for the first 7 days and always on SEPARATE days from the fat</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The second glass of water got it down but to make sure, I drank a glass of milk and a cup of hot coffee.</li>
            <li>Very natural.  </li>
            <li>This is my first and only time buying this brand.</li>
            <li>Its not nearly as harsh as some laxatives, and you will not need to \\&quot;live in the bathroom.\\</li>
            <li>Second time when I took it, the very first tablet (You&#x27;re supposed to take 4 at a time, twice daily!), got stuck in my throat.</li>
            <li>4 pills(2 green tea and 2 acai) in the morning before a light breakfast, light lunch, 2 green tea before diner and 2 acai before bed.</li>
            <li>Doing away with soft drinks, cookies, candies and cakes</li>
            <li>and I developed diarrhea.  </li>
            <li>Since they say to stop if this occurs since a natural laxative could increase the problem, there go the $20 I paid at BJs.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 years old.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve lost about 3-4lbs so far.</li>
            <li>When I took it the first time, I had tough time swallowing the huge tablets.</li>
            <li>my body is back to normal</li>
            <li>as for the acai berry cleanse it does make me go to the bathroom regularly and not excessively.</li>
            <li>Before getting pregnant, I would do a cleanse at least 1-2 times a year</li>
            <li>I pored down a full glass of water down my throat, but it was still stuck.</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t loose or gain weight after taking this product.</li>
            <li> In addition to that, I eat 1500 calories or less daily, and walk/jog for about 45 minutes, 4-6 times a week.    </li>
            <li> Again, just be careful if you&#x27;re going to use this product.</li>
            <li> I am a gym instructor and took this to cleanse my body (not really for the weight loss).</li>
            <li> The results like with any other diet or cleanse vary on your diet and exercise regimen.</li>
            <li> also the acai berry pill had a little bitter taste when i swallowed it down.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  </li>
            <li> It can be very hard to lose weight when you dont&#x27; have a lot to lose and are middle aged</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will do, without discomfort or unpredictable episodes.</li>
            <li> , I wasn&#x27;t exercising just doing little yoga</li>
            <li> so I went from almost 150lbs to 130 in little under 7 weeks</li>
            <li> I will update my review again in a few days</li>
            <li> My throat still feels heavy, and my legs are still shaking.    </li>
            <li> (For weight loss I suggest Mega Green T supplements with Acai, and exercise of course.)</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with harsher products.  </li>
            <li> I may continue to take this every other month or so just to keep my energy levels up like they have been lately.</li>
            <li> the pills were a little hard for me to take.</li>
            <li> after two days I can see no difference, not sure this works at this point.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a magic bullet.  </li>
            <li> but I had plauteaued and this moved me past that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this cleanse at least 3 times over the years.</li>
            <li> Committing to taking 8 pills a day for 14 days is seriously mind boggling.</li>
            <li> sick and simply didn\\&quot;t work</li>
            <li> but then about 2 hours later I was feeling very sick.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a cleanse that isn&#x27;t for everyone. Committing to taking 8 pills a day for 14 days is seriously mind boggling. Now if you are all in, I&#x27;ll say this system works. I&#x27;ve done this cleanse at least 3 times over the years. The results like with any other diet or cleanse vary on your diet and exercise regimen. 4 pills(2 green tea and 2 acai) in the morning before a light breakfast, light lunch, 2 green tea before diner and 2 acai before bed. That&#x27;s pretty much the routine with plenty of water. Doing away with soft drinks, cookies, candies and cakes AKA too much sugar adds to the benefits. 14 Days later either results or excuses, your choice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item two days ago and began taking it as per directions. after two days I can see no difference, not sure this works at this point.    I will update my review again in a few days</li>
            <li> I tried only the 14 day acai berry cleanse.  It&#x27;s been my 2.5 day and I developed diarrhea.  Since they say to stop if this occurs since a natural laxative could increase the problem, there go the $20 I paid at BJs.    Not worth it.  I know my bowel movements and in hindsight it was a mistake.  I&#x27;d ask my dr for ways to cleanse the colon before I swallow this stuff again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like most people, after careful review, decided to buy this product to assist in weightloss. I bought this at CVS Pharmacy. I can&#x27;t tell you whether it&#x27;s effective or not because..     When I took it the first time, I had tough time swallowing the huge tablets. Second time when I took it, the very first tablet (You&#x27;re supposed to take 4 at a time, twice daily!), got stuck in my throat. I thought I&#x27;d die (I was alone too, no one else was home). I pored down a full glass of water down my throat, but it was still stuck. The second glass of water got it down but to make sure, I drank a glass of milk and a cup of hot coffee. My throat still feels heavy, and my legs are still shaking.    I decided to write this review immediately so no one would risk losing his or her life trying to use this product.    I&#x27;m going to safely stick to well known name brand products which are FDA approved.    Again, just be careful if you&#x27;re going to use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Acai Berry for about two months with good results (related to weight loss).  I&#x27;d lost about 8 lbs.  It&#x27;s not a magic bullet.  I did increase my exercise but I had plauteaued and this moved me past that.  I then decided to try and colon cleanse/fat burning combination.  I&#x27;ve lose 3 lbs in as many days and truly feel like my body is cleansing itself. The fat burning pills have a bit too much caffiene in them for my liking (I hardly ever use caffeine) so I&#x27;m going to cut the dose in 1/2 on those.  I&#x27;m 45 years old.  I&#x27;m not over weight, but have about 10 or so pounds I want to get off at this point.  It can be very hard to lose weight when you dont&#x27; have a lot to lose and are middle aged---Acai Berry has worked for me when nothing else did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products together, as directed for a full 7 days so far.  In addition to that, I eat 1500 calories or less daily, and walk/jog for about 45 minutes, 4-6 times a week.    I have noticed the difference, I&#x27;ve lost about 3-4lbs so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the Acai Berry Cleanse and Fat Burn Cleanse for 5 days now, and notice some change. Let me say that this product is very gentle. Its not nearly as harsh as some laxatives, and you will not need to \\&quot;live in the bathroom.\\&quot; My favorite part of the whole system is the fat burn cleanse. This stuff will give you energy!!! But you will not lose a ton of weight using either of these products. Do NOT buy if you strictly want weight loss it doesn&#x27;t work! (For weight loss I suggest Mega Green T supplements with Acai, and exercise of course.) Personally, I bought this system for the overall health benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want a cleanse that will give you energy, help irregularity (very gently), and give you overall good health benefits then BUY IT! I purchased mine from CVS for $17.99, and its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of it this way, if it doesn&#x27;t help you then you haven&#x27;t wasted that much money. Try it.</li>
            <li> Alot of people Make reviews thinking that this supplement will just work if you contiinue to eat the same food and not work out at it. You need to take the 2 pills both in the morning and at the evening, You also need to work out, excercise will help you out. Make sure you drink alot of water and also keep your excercises in variety, cardio one day, sit ups another etc. thats how it will assist you in loosing weight.     I personally believe this wouldn&#x27;t work, but I tried it and Within the fact that i work out 5 days a week for 60 min a week I see a big difference. Im not as hungry And I feel refreshed. Im not sluggish anymore which is rare for a 30yr old woman with a full time job. I suggest if you really want to shed those pounds. Give it a go but make the commitment to work out and try to eat healthy, nothing after 6:30pm  with the exception of 1 or 2 minimal snacks- granola bar or rice cakes is good to have after 6:30 just 2 max!</li>
            <li> I really like these products.  Very natural.  I have had trouble with harsher products.  Didn&#x27;t loose or gain weight after taking this product.</li>
            <li> It did not work at all, I would not recommend anyone to buy this product!  Save your money!</li>
            <li> I have gotten on the band wagon for ACAI berry items.This is my first and only time buying this brand. The cleanse did not cleanse. The ACAI Berry did not increase my metabolism or burn calories. This item might be good for others but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Did not see much difference if any.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these two supplements for almost two weeks now and I must say that I feel better than I have felt in several months. I feel energized and \\&quot;cleansed\\&quot;. I may continue to take this every other month or so just to keep my energy levels up like they have been lately. Everyone reacts differently to supplements so this product may or may not be for you, but I have had nothing but great results and highly recommend these products!!</li>
            <li> I am a gym instructor and took this to cleanse my body (not really for the weight loss). When I take it I feel like my body has more energy and my workouts tend to be better. Added to my workout routine it really boost my metabolism.  I highly recommend it. You have to workout though it won&#x27;t work on its own. Cardio and abdominal excercises work best.</li>
            <li> After researching different cleanses I decided to try this one out. Before getting pregnant, I would do a cleanse at least 1-2 times a year and I would stick to the same brand but for some reason, I thought it would be good to try something different. Of course, it helped when I found the 2 pack at the local drug store as a BOGO deal. First of all, no where does it say if you should take them together or if you should do them separately but after reading a couple reviews from this website and another I was under the impression that you were supposed to take them together. Day one - I did exactly as the box said and took the pills in the morning before breakfast but then about 2 hours later I was feeling very sick. I figured it was my body adjusting to doing a cleanse again. I managed to last 3 days on this cleanse but after 2 nights of not sleeping at all and the third night of being up all night from severe stomach pains I decided to call it quits. The day after I stopped taking the cleanse my body is back to normal and I don&#x27;t have any stomach pains at all. I am thankful that I was able to take this product back and get a full refund. Buyers beware with this product!</li>
            <li> these product made me feel sick and simply didn\\&quot;t work and i tried to stick with it but in the end it just wasn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li> so i am trying to get back in shape for a wedding coming up. the fat burn cleanse didnt really make me go the bathroom, but it did give me more energy to work out. this is why i give a three. as for the acai berry cleanse it does make me go to the bathroom regularly and not excessively. i have dropped about seven pounds with better dieting and exercise. the pills were a little hard for me to take. i dont like taking pills. they were big to me. also the acai berry pill had a little bitter taste when i swallowed it down. it sometimes made me gag. so over all it works along with good diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i felt that the fat burn works better than the other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what i need more is fat burner. I have ordered the maxreducer product, is that better?</li>
            <li> whoever says there&#x27;s nowhere on the bottle that says whether to take the fat burner in conjunction with the cleanse can&#x27;t read. It clearly states on the acai cleanse bottle, \\&quot;use for the first 7 days and always on SEPARATE days from the fat burner.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably why so many people are having adverse reactions taking both at the same time....come on people</li>
            <li> it really does work,, you slim your waist fast buy it buy it buy it&lt;br /&gt;bvg juf kig kig kig.kiv kig</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and always have had success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prompt shipping, good product, very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend without a doubt.</li>
            <li> I did the Acai Berry Cleanse while on a 1500 calorie a day diet. It certainly cleans you out! So make sure the first week you have access to the restroom because when it hits you have minutes if not seconds.  But on the plus side, I found that my appetite was curved so staying on a low calories diet plan was pretty easy.  In two weeks, I lost about 7-8 pounds and this was without exercise. I plan to start my exercise in conjunction with the Fat Burn Cleanse.  I&#x27;ll let you know how it works out.</li>
            <li> My weight is the same. I was looking for something not chemical for my sister, but it does&#x27;t work to loss my weight at all. I felt my health is better because of the nice herb.</li>
            <li> I bought this in my country and it was only the 14 day cleanse , and it helped 100%, I wasn&#x27;t exercising just doing little yoga sometimes and I kept loosing weight first week I lost 2lbs and I was over weight so I went from almost 150lbs to 130 in little under 7 weeks I felt better I took this in the first place because I have problems going its been a problem since childhood and also im always bloated so this helped my stomach stayed flat and I felt good so I continued using once yearly for the 14 days  . I am 4ft 11&#x27;&#x27; and gained weight because of depression so I was happy to find this. I guess this or any cleanse or diet pills work differently for different people but acai berry is truly a good cleanse</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will do, without discomfort or unpredictable episodes. I especially recommend it to people over 50  who are beginning to experience inconsistent routines.</li>
