            <li>We use these dusters to remove hair from the neck and face, not for depositing more.</li>

            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>read the reviews and noticed that many said it shed, and mine did too.</li>
            <li>This duster itself looks like it&#x27;s a top of the notch neck duster, it has a metal gold ring that holds in the bristles and acts as a handle.</li>
            <li>I have 3 of these, I love them.  </li>

            <li>Works better with course hair as opposed to fine.  </li>
            <li>The most important thing of this neck duster is the quality.</li>
            <li>very nice soft feel to it</li>
            <li>Its easy to hold and when I am done</li>
            <li>I usually vacuum them all after I cut their hair, which they love, but this is great to brush them off as I cut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but it smells really funny</li>
            <li>A funny show and a nice price.</li>

            <li>Does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>Gets my neck cleaned off and feels fine on the skin</li>
            <li>To brush off the hairs on the neck after a haircut it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are very soft and the grip and weight is good.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft yet strong and are good at cleaning off my husband&#x27;s neck between haircuts when I have to trim him up.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but I also do my own nails and found this is great for sweeping away the gel dust after I remove the previous gel &amp; acrylics with a nail drill.</li>
            <li>great item, use it for after cutting hair and it does a great job!</li>
            <li>Absolutely must have if you cut your own hair or your families hair.</li>
            <li>Should have known it was this cheap for a reason</li>
            <li>because of the material that suits a comfortable usage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not absolutely essential, but it sure is lot softer and more effective than a washcloth.</li>
            <li>Seller did a fantastic job</li>
            <li>Holds the talc powder well and the bristles feel smooth.</li>
            <li>it fit into my clipper plastic box.</li>
            <li>Quality seems to be really good, would recommend this to a at home stylist or professional.</li>
            <li>Perfect, this makes it quick and fast for me to get fine hair that was just cut off the back of my childrens necks, face, and ears.  </li>
            <li>We could have lived without this, but it&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li>Couple of strands have come out, but nothing significant.</li>
            <li>I like how its small and Works just perfectly.</li>
            <li>I used it very lightly to clean myself after a haircut</li>
            <li>Though you won&#x27;t get a 100% clean skin, it does help quite a lot around the face and neck after a hair cut.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft bristles!</li>
            <li>First off, I received this in less than five days and that&#x27;s amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>Soft and handy for the home haircut.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and nice.</li>
            <li>good, obviously hairs fall out but</li>
            <li>Nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as your go to brush, but if you need something quick that you don&#x27;t care about...</li>
            <li>I received my order quickly.</li>
            <li>its inexpensive and came quite quick.</li>
            <li>Has nice solid handle - easy to hold, with a flat end to stand it up, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Love this neck duster super soft and full.</li>
            <li>If you cut hair, even if it&#x27;s just once a month, this is a great little inexpensive tool to have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large, soft and has a nice plastic handle.</li>
            <li>Product was Exactly what I wanted, and the Description was right on point!</li>
            <li>I needed this night duster really bad because I cut my own hair and it was a perfect product to order it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not necessary to brush cut hairs off the neck after a hair trim, but it is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>It is a useful product, it removes the hair without harming the skin.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like a shedding cat, if that can give you a visual description of how the bristles just &amp;#34;fall out&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t count any stars off because that&#x27;s the fault of my own substandard genetic makeup and not the fault of Diane, who makes these massive neck dusters!</li>
            <li>You get the sense that you are replacing your own cut hair, with the strands left on you from this duster.</li>
            <li>brushes hair right off of skin and clothes.</li>
            <li>I love the short handle, and the bristles are nice and soft for wiping my 11-month old&#x27;s face after I cut his hair!!</li>
            <li>This neck duster is smaller than expected but it is of very good quality.  </li>
            <li>It is well made and what I expected, love it!</li>
            <li>Soft, just like at the barber, but the strands come off pretty easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold, the bristles are soft, and it&#x27;s lots more fun than a dry rag.  </li>
            <li>Fell apart the first time it was cleaned.</li>
            <li>lose a lot of bristle at first</li>
            <li>but when you open ıts cover you see so many dropped hairs inside the cover box.</li>
            <li>First used, the threads or hairs, were coming off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>this was the first one iv bought.</li>
            <li>The handle is made of plastic which is pretty durable.</li>
            <li>This tool is extremely nice in grabbing that hair off gentlemen clients&#x27; foreheads and necks without being rough like a towel or blow dryer would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This duster works very well!</li>
            <li>does the job and still in good shape after a few months.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and it looks like it&#x27;ll be lasting a long time!</li>
            <li>The handle is nice and thick,  easy to hold on to</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it works fine and have saved me money because whenever I barber my hair I use the toilet tissues to clean.</li>
            <li>With very light and minor use the bristles fall out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li>The Black and Gold Diane Neck Duster seems to be a nice quality brush.  </li>
            <li>because I do like to give the benefit of the doubt since some products are made in large quantities and not all are up to par.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice little plastic box.</li>
            <li>Soft to the touch but shedding hairs even in the first use!</li>
            <li>I think the little ones get more fun out of playing with it.  </li>
            <li>It is soft, which feels good to the skin, but I do have to support it a little to pick up the bronzer on to the brush.</li>
            <li>Bit of bristle loss, not as much and</li>
            <li>It came fast.  </li>
            <li>This goat-hair brush is soft and has a showy golden handle.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for a low-end barber in Cuba and he really appreciated it.  </li>
            <li>if you really need it, buy it.</li>
            <li>I cut my husband&#x27;s hair as well as my son&#x27;s, and this has worked out very well for us.</li>
            <li>and there isn&#x27;t much else I can say about it.</li>
            <li>works very well for the price</li>
            <li>The brush is comfortable in my hand, and the bristles are lush and soft.</li>
            <li>Will report back if this has problems lasting but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It kind of look bigger in outside than in picture.</li>
            <li>; often times cuts his own hair (short but not shave all the way) and I help with cleaning the back up.</li>
            <li>all I totally suggest getting this if you want to be and look professional for your clients at your salon. :)</li>
            <li>like the other reviewers said, but it does a good enough  job for its purpose.</li>
            <li>Nice little brush!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, but had I known I would&#x27;ve spent a little bit more on something else.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty soft</li>
            <li>this particular one</li>
            <li>Gets the job done!:) I actually have only used it for putting baby powder on my skin before I wax..</li>
            <li>The duster sheds everytime you use it and just ends up creating more of a mess.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for people who do haircut at  home.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is large enough to get a good grip around the base, and it&#x27;s light weight makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can easily tell that it removes a lot of hair compared to just trying to wipe or using any other brush.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft, and when you put a little baby powder in them before hand its gets more of the hair off the neck and doesn&#x27;t stick as much to the duster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice looking jumbo neck duster with black &amp;#34;hairs.&amp;#34; Most look so awkward, but this is nice and full on top and round on bottom (some are super thin).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and really does it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li>They now enjoy getting haircuts knowing that this will be extra gentle on their face, neck area and back.</li>
            <li>the price is normal but is worthing it just need something additional.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about the quality versus the price, but now that I&#x27;ve seen it in person, it looks first class and best of all, very soft on my neck.  </li>
            <li>However, after I applied some crazy glue it has been doing a good job since!</li>
            <li>Very soft on the face</li>
            <li>Very soft and relaxing to use or touch.</li>
            <li>This brush  very soft and bristles.  </li>
            <li>Very Soft.</li>
            <li>No shedding very soft.  </li>
            <li>Very soft when dusting hair off your neck.</li>
            <li>Looks very classy.  </li>
            <li>This duster has very soft bristles but sheds a lot.</li>
            <li>My wife just started to cut my hair at home and did such a professional job that I wanted to give her all the tools to do it right.  </li>
            <li>But only the first two times</li>
            <li>Very soft and big enough for a clean neck.</li>
            <li>The price was fine and everything the only thing that was kind of disappointing was that the bristles keep falling off</li>
            <li>clearly a well built product</li>
            <li>The brush feels soft on my kneck which i can appreciate</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly soft and doesn&#x27;t seem to fall apart.</li>
            <li>Its soft, so there&#x27;s no complaints of the brush sticking them anywhere.  </li>
            <li>My mother is a Cosmetologist, that&#x27;s fancy for a professional hairdresser for those who don&#x27;t know yet.  </li>
            <li>My mother said that her clients like the soft feeling that this brush gives at the end of a hair cut (as opposed to using a towel), and it gets the hair off their necks in a couple of sweeps.</li>
            <li>This duster reminds me of the dusters my Barber used nearly 50 years ago.  </li>
            <li>She saw and ordered this, and it is ohh so soft.  </li>
            <li>Soft on neck.  </li>
            <li>He is 5 years old.</li>
            <li>It works great getting off all the tiny hairs from the back of the neck and face that the clippers leave behind.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft and not pocky at all.</li>
            <li>This brush sheds bristles far faster than it can remove hairs from your neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the highest/nicest quality but it will definitely do the job and it was really cheap compared to other neck dusters I found on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>You guys please don&#x27;t waste your money in items when you use it to clean the machine all the hair falling off one by one.......</li>
            <li>I use it everyday when i need to clean up my clients after their haircut .The</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>This little brush worked perfect to wipe off hair while I&#x27;m cutting my kid&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I admit I only bought it to go with the new set of clippers I also bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Truth is I don&#x27;t really use this brush that often, even after cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;ve used many kinds of neck dusters as a professional barber for 20 years, but this is the worse one.</li>
            <li>This neck duster cleans my neck, back, and head area completely in one swish!</li>
            <li>noticable,  the&#x27;re all over my friends face, although it is very funny but waste of money, hey it rhymes...</li>
            <li>Our son has sensory issues and has major issues during hair cuts.</li>
            <li>Love this leave no hair behind</li>
            <li>The bristle are software and weaved in pretty tight so they haven&#x27;t fallen out after using it.</li>
            <li>The brush is a tiny bit smaller than what I expected, but I have large hands</li>
            <li>I got it pretty quickly and there was nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li>The bristles are long enough so it can dust the back of the neck completely.</li>
            <li>The only real problem is the first couple times you use it you loose some of the little black hairs&#x27;</li>

            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> read the reviews and noticed that many said it shed, and mine did too.</li>
            <li> This duster itself looks like it&#x27;s a top of the notch neck duster, it has a metal gold ring that holds in the bristles and acts as a handle.</li>
            <li> I have 3 of these, I love them.  </li>

            <li> Its easy to hold and when I am done</li>
            <li> I usually vacuum them all after I cut their hair, which they love, but this is great to brush them off as I cut.</li>

            <li> Gets my neck cleaned off and feels fine on the skin</li>
            <li> To brush off the hairs on the neck after a haircut it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are very soft and the grip and weight is good.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft yet strong and are good at cleaning off my husband&#x27;s neck between haircuts when I have to trim him up.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but I also do my own nails and found this is great for sweeping away the gel dust after I remove the previous gel &amp; acrylics with a nail drill.</li>
            <li> great item, use it for after cutting hair and it does a great job!</li>
            <li> Absolutely must have if you cut your own hair or your families hair.</li>
            <li> Should have known it was this cheap for a reason</li>
            <li> because of the material that suits a comfortable usage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not absolutely essential, but it sure is lot softer and more effective than a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Seller did a fantastic job</li>
            <li> Holds the talc powder well and the bristles feel smooth.</li>
            <li> it fit into my clipper plastic box.</li>
            <li> Quality seems to be really good, would recommend this to a at home stylist or professional.</li>
            <li> Perfect, this makes it quick and fast for me to get fine hair that was just cut off the back of my childrens necks, face, and ears.  </li>
            <li> We could have lived without this, but it&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li> Couple of strands have come out, but nothing significant.</li>
            <li> I like how its small and Works just perfectly.</li>
            <li> I used it very lightly to clean myself after a haircut</li>
            <li> Though you won&#x27;t get a 100% clean skin, it does help quite a lot around the face and neck after a hair cut.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft bristles!</li>
            <li> First off, I received this in less than five days and that&#x27;s amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Soft and handy for the home haircut.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and nice.</li>
            <li> good, obviously hairs fall out but</li>
            <li> Nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as your go to brush, but if you need something quick that you don&#x27;t care about...</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly.</li>
            <li> its inexpensive and came quite quick.</li>
            <li> Has nice solid handle - easy to hold, with a flat end to stand it up, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Love this neck duster super soft and full.</li>
            <li> If you cut hair, even if it&#x27;s just once a month, this is a great little inexpensive tool to have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large, soft and has a nice plastic handle.</li>
            <li> Product was Exactly what I wanted, and the Description was right on point!</li>
            <li> I needed this night duster really bad because I cut my own hair and it was a perfect product to order it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessary to brush cut hairs off the neck after a hair trim, but it is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> It is a useful product, it removes the hair without harming the skin.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like a shedding cat, if that can give you a visual description of how the bristles just &amp;#34;fall out&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t count any stars off because that&#x27;s the fault of my own substandard genetic makeup and not the fault of Diane, who makes these massive neck dusters!</li>
            <li> You get the sense that you are replacing your own cut hair, with the strands left on you from this duster.</li>
            <li> brushes hair right off of skin and clothes.</li>
            <li> I love the short handle, and the bristles are nice and soft for wiping my 11-month old&#x27;s face after I cut his hair!!</li>
            <li> This neck duster is smaller than expected but it is of very good quality.  </li>
            <li> It is well made and what I expected, love it!</li>
            <li> Soft, just like at the barber, but the strands come off pretty easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold, the bristles are soft, and it&#x27;s lots more fun than a dry rag.  </li>
            <li> Fell apart the first time it was cleaned.</li>
            <li> lose a lot of bristle at first</li>
            <li> but when you open ıts cover you see so many dropped hairs inside the cover box.</li>
            <li> First used, the threads or hairs, were coming off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> this was the first one iv bought.</li>
            <li> The handle is made of plastic which is pretty durable.</li>
            <li> This tool is extremely nice in grabbing that hair off gentlemen clients&#x27; foreheads and necks without being rough like a towel or blow dryer would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This duster works very well!</li>
            <li> does the job and still in good shape after a few months.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it looks like it&#x27;ll be lasting a long time!</li>
            <li> The handle is nice and thick,  easy to hold on to</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it works fine and have saved me money because whenever I barber my hair I use the toilet tissues to clean.</li>
            <li> With very light and minor use the bristles fall out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li> The Black and Gold Diane Neck Duster seems to be a nice quality brush.  </li>
            <li> because I do like to give the benefit of the doubt since some products are made in large quantities and not all are up to par.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice little plastic box.</li>
            <li> Soft to the touch but shedding hairs even in the first use!</li>
            <li> I think the little ones get more fun out of playing with it.  </li>
            <li> It is soft, which feels good to the skin, but I do have to support it a little to pick up the bronzer on to the brush.</li>
            <li> Bit of bristle loss, not as much and</li>
            <li> It came fast.  </li>
            <li> This goat-hair brush is soft and has a showy golden handle.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a low-end barber in Cuba and he really appreciated it.  </li>
            <li> if you really need it, buy it.</li>
            <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair as well as my son&#x27;s, and this has worked out very well for us.</li>
            <li> and there isn&#x27;t much else I can say about it.</li>
            <li> works very well for the price</li>
            <li> The brush is comfortable in my hand, and the bristles are lush and soft.</li>
            <li> Will report back if this has problems lasting but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It kind of look bigger in outside than in picture.</li>
            <li> ; often times cuts his own hair (short but not shave all the way) and I help with cleaning the back up.</li>
            <li> all I totally suggest getting this if you want to be and look professional for your clients at your salon. :)</li>
            <li> like the other reviewers said, but it does a good enough  job for its purpose.</li>
            <li> Nice little brush!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, but had I known I would&#x27;ve spent a little bit more on something else.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty soft</li>
            <li> this particular one</li>
            <li> Gets the job done!:) I actually have only used it for putting baby powder on my skin before I wax..</li>
            <li> The duster sheds everytime you use it and just ends up creating more of a mess.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for people who do haircut at  home.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is large enough to get a good grip around the base, and it&#x27;s light weight makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can easily tell that it removes a lot of hair compared to just trying to wipe or using any other brush.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft, and when you put a little baby powder in them before hand its gets more of the hair off the neck and doesn&#x27;t stick as much to the duster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice looking jumbo neck duster with black &amp;#34;hairs.&amp;#34; Most look so awkward, but this is nice and full on top and round on bottom (some are super thin).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and really does it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> They now enjoy getting haircuts knowing that this will be extra gentle on their face, neck area and back.</li>
            <li> the price is normal but is worthing it just need something additional.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the quality versus the price, but now that I&#x27;ve seen it in person, it looks first class and best of all, very soft on my neck.  </li>
            <li> However, after I applied some crazy glue it has been doing a good job since!</li>
            <li> Very soft on the face</li>
            <li> Very soft and relaxing to use or touch.</li>
            <li> This brush  very soft and bristles.  </li>
            <li> Very Soft.</li>
            <li> No shedding very soft.  </li>
            <li> Very soft when dusting hair off your neck.</li>
            <li> Looks very classy.  </li>
            <li> This duster has very soft bristles but sheds a lot.</li>
            <li> My wife just started to cut my hair at home and did such a professional job that I wanted to give her all the tools to do it right.  </li>
            <li> But only the first two times</li>
            <li> Very soft and big enough for a clean neck.</li>
            <li> The price was fine and everything the only thing that was kind of disappointing was that the bristles keep falling off</li>
            <li> clearly a well built product</li>
            <li> The brush feels soft on my kneck which i can appreciate</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly soft and doesn&#x27;t seem to fall apart.</li>
            <li> Its soft, so there&#x27;s no complaints of the brush sticking them anywhere.  </li>
            <li> My mother is a Cosmetologist, that&#x27;s fancy for a professional hairdresser for those who don&#x27;t know yet.  </li>
            <li> My mother said that her clients like the soft feeling that this brush gives at the end of a hair cut (as opposed to using a towel), and it gets the hair off their necks in a couple of sweeps.</li>
            <li> This duster reminds me of the dusters my Barber used nearly 50 years ago.  </li>
            <li> She saw and ordered this, and it is ohh so soft.  </li>
            <li> Soft on neck.  </li>
            <li> He is 5 years old.</li>
            <li> It works great getting off all the tiny hairs from the back of the neck and face that the clippers leave behind.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft and not pocky at all.</li>
            <li> This brush sheds bristles far faster than it can remove hairs from your neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the highest/nicest quality but it will definitely do the job and it was really cheap compared to other neck dusters I found on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> You guys please don&#x27;t waste your money in items when you use it to clean the machine all the hair falling off one by one.......</li>
            <li> I use it everyday when i need to clean up my clients after their haircut .The</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This little brush worked perfect to wipe off hair while I&#x27;m cutting my kid&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I admit I only bought it to go with the new set of clippers I also bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Truth is I don&#x27;t really use this brush that often, even after cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve used many kinds of neck dusters as a professional barber for 20 years, but this is the worse one.</li>
            <li> This neck duster cleans my neck, back, and head area completely in one swish!</li>
            <li> noticable,  the&#x27;re all over my friends face, although it is very funny but waste of money, hey it rhymes...</li>
            <li> Our son has sensory issues and has major issues during hair cuts.</li>
            <li> Love this leave no hair behind</li>
            <li> The bristle are software and weaved in pretty tight so they haven&#x27;t fallen out after using it.</li>
            <li> The brush is a tiny bit smaller than what I expected, but I have large hands</li>
            <li> I got it pretty quickly and there was nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li> The bristles are long enough so it can dust the back of the neck completely.</li>
            <li> The only real problem is the first couple times you use it you loose some of the little black hairs&#x27;</li>
            <li> It is a very nice item to have when cutting hair especially when trying to get the little hairs of your neck or face.</li>
            <li> Can grip well due to size and the bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li> Soft and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> There we a few loose hairs right out of the box, but that is to be expected with any brush.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really dust off hair; not sure if it&#x27;s because I have think hair...</li>
            <li> Only bad thing about it is, the bristles fall out very easily</li>
            <li> This dusker is so soft and heavy duty.</li>
            <li> The downside is that the duster is so gargantuan in my tiny, stubby hands that it&#x27;s hard to hold and awkward to sweep my own immense neck-trunk without falling over or dropping it on the floor, even using two hands!</li>
            <li> only problem I have with it is how some hairs fall off the brush other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> But it does not have anything different to make it stand out than all of the other.</li>
            <li> This will due for a few months before I get a new one.  </li>
            <li> It removes all the loose hair after hair cuts.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and thick.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Not terribly much to say about it</li>
            <li> Not what i expected, the product was falling apart</li>
            <li> Hair duster received as expected per product image and description.</li>
            <li> clients leave with black hairs all over , not very professional looking !!</li>
            <li> Yes, I agree with the other reviewers that noticed it sheds and sheds and sheds and keeps on shedding.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small, I can get this duster brush for $5.00 for the local beauty supply without paying a shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> Being that it was nearly impossible to find an extra large kabuki brush, I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> I thought maybe there are just a few loose ones, so I tried to run my fingers through it, but they never stopped coming out.</li>
            <li> During cutting my boys hair I need something to help get the hair off otherwise they squirm, this is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> The black bristles fall out alllllll the time.</li>
            <li> It works but not good as the vacuum.  </li>
            <li> and I have a little arthritis.</li>
            <li> Bought this to \\&quot;paint\\&quot; the sand out of neck creases and from between the fingers and toes of little ones when they are done playing in the sandbox.</li>
            <li> you just need to add a little powder to slip into the skin</li>
            <li> It comes in a little plastic box that I keep it in.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After a little over a year of use, this product has held up.</li>
            <li> I do have lots of little hairs falling out,</li>
            <li> It comes in a little plastic box.</li>
            <li> 2 of them did shed a little.  </li>
            <li> Thumbs down!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I gave it a few month before writing this review too.</li>
            <li> What a stark improvement.  </li>
            <li> Every time my wife would cut my hair before there would be a lot of tears and crying, and she would also be upset.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The small black things used as duster comes out of the root as you dust.</li>
            <li> Holds hair within it and is not very effective at brushing off hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this since I was already purchasing a new hair cutting cape and it was an add-on item.</li>
            <li> We previously used the hard barber brush to wipe off hair, but my kids would complain about its stiff and hard hairs.</li>
            <li> Its soooo hard and rough it hurts!!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m too lazy, when i finish shaving my head, i just go to the bathroom and take a shower and never used it again.</li>
            <li> Now no more tissues</li>
            <li> No more, this will gleefully push those unwanted follicles which have already been separated from their strands off and onto the floor.</li>
            <li> While the brush seems high quality, I can&#x27;t help but notice it sheds, which can get a little annoying.  </li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair, and I had no issues wincing when she used a hard &amp;#34;neck duster&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> the negative reviews stated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll end up having just the wooden part!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would spend the money again!</li>
            <li> no more after buying this!</li>
            <li> The brush hair sheds a lot not very good for price !</li>
            <li> No good at all....  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this item at no good.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I wasted money.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t scrape the thin skinned.</li>
            <li> It does lose a few hairs here and there but nothing crazy.</li>
            <li> i was kinda shocked when i got it to see how small it was.</li>
            <li> probably the worse product I ever bought from Amazon!</li>
            <li> use this when cutting husbands and swirmy grandson.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for over a decade.</li>
            <li> For every barber or parents who enjoys cutting your sons&#x27; hair, this product is must have.</li>
            <li> it brushes the hair off of me when i&#x27;m cutting my hair.  </li>
            <li> This Neck Duster has helped out a lot with our hair cutting at home.  </li>
            <li> Its just as bad as having the cut hair everywhere.</li>
            <li> it has bad quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed</li>
            <li> It sheds the threads like crazy and the base fell off almost immediately after I used it...!!!</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> The base of the neck duster broke off after my fifth client.</li>
            <li> I do recommend cleaning the neck duster off after every use because it does hold the hair in its base if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you hate that awful itching?  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible buy!</li>
            <li> I tried rinsing it with water after I could not shake out the hair and that created a nasty smell and release of bristle dye.</li>

            <li> Works well.  The bristles are soft yet strong and are good at cleaning off my husband&#x27;s neck between haircuts when I have to trim him up.  The handle is very comfortable in my hand and I have a little arthritis.</li>

            <li> Love this leave no hair behind it said &amp;#34;everything must go&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> Works well.....fast delivery and great seller.</li>
            <li> Perfect, this makes it quick and fast for me to get fine hair that was just cut off the back of my childrens necks, face, and ears.  Its soft, so there&#x27;s no complaints of the brush sticking them anywhere.  Its easy to hold and when I am done I just brush it across my hand over the trash can and put it away until next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this to my stylist and she better use it!</li>
            <li> The brush part keeps coming out in clumps, but it does the job of removing hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this to \\&quot;paint\\&quot; the sand out of neck creases and from between the fingers and toes of little ones when they are done playing in the sandbox. It&#x27;s easy to hold, the bristles are soft, and it&#x27;s lots more fun than a dry rag.  Plus it&#x27;s faster. (Also good for getting sand out of things that weren&#x27;t meant to be sandbox toys.) Score! :)</li>
            <li> This neck duster is smaller than expected but it is of very good quality.  The bristles are very soft and thick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why but it sheds baddd</li>
            <li> This neck duster is nice, works great. The handle is nice and thick,  easy to hold on to</li>
            <li> lose a lot of bristle at first</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. I Love the feel and quality of this brush. It reminds me of going to the barber.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush.... works well.... clearly a well built product</li>
            <li> The brush is comfortable in my hand, and the bristles are lush and soft. It&#x27;s not necessary to brush cut hairs off the neck after a hair trim, but it is a nice touch. Very nice quality for a reasonable touch.</li>
            <li> Great product and great seller</li>
            <li> Holds hair within it and is not very effective at brushing off hair.  It mostly seems to move it around on the person once it has been used once or twice.  I tried rinsing it with water after I could not shake out the hair and that created a nasty smell and release of bristle dye.</li>
            <li> My mother is a Cosmetologist, that&#x27;s fancy for a professional hairdresser for those who don&#x27;t know yet.  This goat-hair brush is soft and has a showy golden handle.  My mother said that her clients like the soft feeling that this brush gives at the end of a hair cut (as opposed to using a towel), and it gets the hair off their necks in a couple of sweeps.</li>
            <li> It is a useful product, it removes the hair without harming the skin. you just need to add a little powder to slip into the skin</li>
            <li> use this when cutting husbands and swirmy grandson. brushes hair right off of skin and clothes.</li>
            <li> Works great for me!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two.</li>
            <li> Very soft and relaxing to use or touch.</li>
            <li> Love this neck duster super soft and full. Quality seems to be really good, would recommend this to a at home stylist or professional.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Just what I needed to get those tiny hairs off my kids necks and cheeks.  Well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny. It&#x27;s definitely the best stuff I&#x27;ve purchased on line, great price. I highly recommend it for people who do haircut at  home.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as expected. Great product.</li>
            <li> The duster sheds everytime you use it and just ends up creating more of a mess. Should have known it was this cheap for a reason</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She said my grandson love the feel of it. He always reminds her to use it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. It came and the bristles weren&#x27;t even. I don&#x27;t even use it. Go to Sally&#x27;s and buy one that you can tell is in good condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed a duster for a while and since my barber gets all of his supplies off Amazon I got the same one he uses. It&#x27;s large, soft and has a nice plastic handle. Great price too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This brush  very soft and bristles.  it doesn&#x27;t scrape the thin skinned. and hypoallergenic. The bristles are long enough so it can dust the back of the neck completely.</li>
            <li> This product works great in removing hair off the skin and clippers after a haircut. The bristle are software and weaved in pretty tight so they haven&#x27;t fallen out after using it.</li>
            <li> The hairs on the brush fall out</li>
            <li> because of the material that suits a comfortable usage. the price is normal but is worthing it just need something additional.</li>
            <li> Really good duster . Easy and practical fav duster of my collection , just enjoy the size makes it very enjoyable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for over a decade. I usually vacuum them all after I cut their hair, which they love, but this is great to brush them off as I cut. I haven&#x27;t experienced the bristle loss others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Great brush for a great price, very soft bristles for use on the face and neck. Well constructed and should last for decades.</li>
            <li> Very Soft. Good quality.  Works well getting rid of the pieces of hair that is left after a hair cut.</li>
            <li> With very light and minor use the bristles fall out.  It&#x27;s kind of like a shedding cat, if that can give you a visual description of how the bristles just &amp;#34;fall out&amp;#34;.  For the price it&#x27;s ok, but had I known I would&#x27;ve spent a little bit more on something else.  This will due for a few months before I get a new one.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as your go to brush, but if you need something quick that you don&#x27;t care about...maybe something to bring with you to a hotel or something every so often...this is the one.</li>
            <li> Highest possible recommendation.  No shedding very soft.  Does the job.  Have always been very impressed with Diane products and their performance.  Only problems have been longevity.  Will report back if this has problems lasting but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Honestly I gave this neck duster 2 stars because I do like to give the benefit of the doubt since some products are made in large quantities and not all are up to par. The duster looks great and sturdy, seems it would be awesome except all the bristles keep coming out and falling off. I purchased a similar one with a longer neck which I have had for several years and that never happened. Very disappointed. Not sure if I would spend the money again!</li>
            <li> Love this duster. I use it constantly for my son&#x27;s haircuts. Every now and then you find a hair or two that came ut but it&#x27;snot a big deal. Good item.</li>
            <li> Soft and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> It works great getting the hair off around the neck area. It&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair so this is great to sweep away the hairs gently!  He loves it too!</li>
            <li> The knob on the end fell off as I took it out of the package. What a piece of junk. don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Soft and handy for the home haircut. Stands up nicely on its own handle. Not terribly much to say about it, it just works :) Fits in the plastic case for my Wahl clippers, which is nice!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it , sheds like a cat :(&lt;br /&gt;My clients leave with black hairs all over , not very professional looking !!</li>
            <li> Used it twice and handle already fell off. Doesn&#x27;t really dust off hair; not sure if it&#x27;s because I have think hair...</li>
            <li> not bad but better spend $3 more for better one like a powder neck duster for exemple, much better!</li>
            <li> Cheap and effective. Exactly what I expected. Very good and extremely soft after you have a hair cut or shave!</li>
            <li> I have to cut my husbands hair all the time and it this helps out a lot to get hair off of his neck</li>
            <li> This neck duster is HUGE! I have an enormous, bulging neckbone that make my neck seem cartoonish in proportion to the rest of my frail body. This neck duster cleans my neck, back, and head area completely in one swish! The downside is that the duster is so gargantuan in my tiny, stubby hands that it&#x27;s hard to hold and awkward to sweep my own immense neck-trunk without falling over or dropping it on the floor, even using two hands! But I didn&#x27;t count any stars off because that&#x27;s the fault of my own substandard genetic makeup and not the fault of Diane, who makes these massive neck dusters!</li>
            <li> Great deal and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a low-end barber in Cuba and he really appreciated it.  The bristles are soft and nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing, but i rarely use it. i used it for 1st and 2nd time.... i&#x27;m too lazy, when i finish shaving my head, i just go to the bathroom and take a shower and never used it again. So, i&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not a must. if you really need it, buy it.</li>
            <li> the bristles fall out overtime you use it,  otherwise it alright.</li>
            <li> Great neck duster. Very soft when dusting hair off your neck.</li>
            <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair as well as my son&#x27;s, and this has worked out very well for us. It comes in a little plastic box that I keep it in. Works great!</li>
            <li> The Black and Gold Diane Neck Duster seems to be a nice quality brush.  It has a sorta plastic petroleum smell to it so I keep it in it&#x27;s nice little plastic box.</li>
            <li> My husband cuts his own hair, as well as, fades our son and nephew&#x27;s hair too. This works great along with the neck strips and the cape for when the cant shower right after.</li>
            <li> Works well, does what it is supposed to do. I think I got a fair price and there isn&#x27;t much else I can say about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for brushing the hair off my husbands face after I cut his hair. Works like it should. Nothing fancy.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the quality versus the price, but now that I&#x27;ve seen it in person, it looks first class and best of all, very soft on my neck.  My wife just started to cut my hair at home and did such a professional job that I wanted to give her all the tools to do it right.  It&#x27;s not absolutely essential, but it sure is lot softer and more effective than a washcloth.</li>
            <li> For every barber or parents who enjoys cutting your sons&#x27; hair, this product is must have. It work just fine.</li>
            <li> Does the job just fine. Gets my neck cleaned off and feels fine on the skin</li>
            <li> Just as described and works great.</li>
            <li> The price was fine and everything the only thing that was kind of disappointing was that the bristles keep falling off everytime I used it. I used it very lightly to clean myself after a haircut but it is not terrible just that but again for the price it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> The small black things used as duster comes out of the root as you dust. I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll end up having just the wooden part!</li>
            <li> a good neck brush for its price....</li>
            <li> I hate it. Its soooo hard and rough it hurts!!! The tips feel burn!</li>
            <li> No good at all....  I don&#x27;t like this item at no good. You guys please don&#x27;t waste your money in items when you use it to clean the machine all the hair falling off one by one.......</li>
            <li> good and cheap. works very well for the price</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it works fine and have saved me money because whenever I barber my hair I use the toilet tissues to clean. Now no more tissues</li>
            <li> First off, I received this in less than five days and that&#x27;s amazing!!!! Packaging was very good and the brush is exactly what I needed. The brush is a tiny bit smaller than what I expected, but I have large hands so I am use to everything being a tad smaller than I would like.  All in all this has been a most pleasant shopping experience and I will buy from this seller again. Oh, and this kneck duster is awesome.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected, the product was falling apart all the fibers fall on their own! Thumbs down!</li>
            <li> If you cut hair, even if it&#x27;s just once a month, this is a great little inexpensive tool to have. I use it on my Grandson&#x27;s hair and he thinks it&#x27;s awesome. Very soft and great at getting hair off the face and neck. Seller did a fantastic job and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li> it has bad quality. It is seen as all hairs in one box but when you open ıts cover you see so many dropped hairs inside the cover box. and when you use it, it s getting dropped still. i wish i hadnt bought it.</li>
            <li> Bristles falls out when dusting clients. It looks nice it just needs to not have the bristles falling out ion clients.</li>
            <li> I have four boys, so I started learning how to cut hair.  They need cuts every 4-6 weeks!  This has been a nice addition to my supplies! It works great, has a great weight to it!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I trim my own bangs but I also do my own nails and found this is great for sweeping away the gel dust after I remove the previous gel &amp; acrylics with a nail drill. Getting a 2nd one for that.</li>
            <li> The most important thing of this neck duster is the quality. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this neck Duster back in July and started to use it on my husband&#x27;s haircuts at home. Granted, I&#x27;ve used many kinds of neck dusters as a professional barber for 20 years, but this is the worse one. Yes, I agree with the other reviewers that noticed it sheds and sheds and sheds and keeps on shedding. We use these dusters to remove hair from the neck and face, not for depositing more.</li>
            <li> very nice soft feel to it</li>
            <li> The hair fall of when we use it.</li>
            <li> Works great for what it is.</li>
            <li> Great brush soft especially for kids, great buy!</li>
            <li> Very soft and big enough for a clean neck. I can easily tell that it removes a lot of hair compared to just trying to wipe or using any other brush. My son likes it too. Though you won&#x27;t get a 100% clean skin, it does help quite a lot around the face and neck after a hair cut. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very soft and great for cleaning up face after a haircut</li>
            <li> Nice soft easy to clean for price perfect</li>
            <li> Soft, just like at the barber, but the strands come off pretty easily. You get the sense that you are replacing your own cut hair, with the strands left on you from this duster.</li>
            <li> To brush off the hairs on the neck after a haircut it works just fine.  There we a few loose hairs right out of the box, but that is to be expected with any brush.  Bristles are very soft and the grip and weight is good.</li>
            <li> This neck duster works great. It feels good in the hand, and is easy to use. It also feels good on the neck and you almost don&#x27;t even feel it. It takes hair off your neck and face like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 2/24/16&lt;br /&gt;After a little over a year of use, this product has held up. It does lose a few hairs here and there but nothing crazy. For the price there are no complaints!</li>
            <li> Nice but does shed a bit.</li>
            <li> Hair duster received as expected per product image and description. I received my order quickly. I recommend this seller and hair duster.</li>
            <li> Great for removing excess hair!</li>
            <li> good, obviously hairs fall out but all of these do it im sure</li>
            <li> My clients love the feel of this on their neck!</li>
            <li> It does what it suppose to do.  It kind of look bigger in outside than in picture.</li>
            <li> This duster reminds me of the dusters my Barber used nearly 50 years ago.  It has very soft bristles and does a perfect job of brushing hair off of your neck and so on after a cut.  If you&#x27;re looking for such a brush, this is truly a perfect choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice looking jumbo neck duster with black &amp;#34;hairs.&amp;#34; Most look so awkward, but this is nice and full on top and round on bottom (some are super thin). My fianc&amp;eacute; often times cuts his own hair (short but not shave all the way) and I help with cleaning the back up. Trimming with clippers and shaving. We could have lived without this, but it&#x27;s very useful. I&#x27;m just disappointed this particular one because the hairs CONSTANTLY fall out while using. I thought maybe there are just a few loose ones, so I tried to run my fingers through it, but they never stopped coming out. I gave it a few month before writing this review too. Needless to say, I wasted money.</li>
            <li> Beautiful in design and function.  Works better with course hair as opposed to fine.  Nice to have this duster for the students that I cut hair for.</li>
            <li> Great price for this item love it</li>
            <li> Wth? First used, the threads or hairs, were coming off.&lt;br /&gt;Very noticable,  the&#x27;re all over my friends face, although it is very funny but waste of money, hey it rhymes...lol</li>
            <li> It is well made and what I expected, love it!</li>
            <li> While the brush seems high quality, I can&#x27;t help but notice it sheds, which can get a little annoying.  But for what I use it for, it serves its purpose.  Apply some Clubman talc to it and apply to my neck and face after shaving.  Holds the talc powder well and the bristles feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this for home use.  I have 4 boys whose hair I cut regularly.  I like the idea of this but I wish it came with some kind of container.  I found a tupperware I put baby powder in, then I can dip this in and tap it to the side so there isn&#x27;t too much left on the duster, then I use it on their necks.  It seems to work pretty well.  I do have lots of little hairs falling out, like the other reviewers said, but it does a good enough  job for its purpose.</li>
            <li> this is a must have if you do home hair cuts. Helps remove the hair from the face! Nice and soft bristles!</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair, and I had no issues wincing when she used a hard &amp;#34;neck duster&amp;#34;...had to be done.  She saw and ordered this, and it is ohh so soft.  What a stark improvement.  Looks very classy.  Couple of strands have come out, but nothing significant.</li>
            <li> The base of the neck duster broke off after my fifth client. However, after I applied some crazy glue it has been doing a good job since!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for application of an all over bronzer, and I think it&#x27;s going to be great. It is soft, which feels good to the skin, but I do have to support it a little to pick up the bronzer on to the brush. Being that it was nearly impossible to find an extra large kabuki brush, I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> great item, use it for after cutting hair and it does a great job!</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Product was Exactly what I wanted, and the Description was right on point!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use at home when I cut my husband&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s not the highest/nicest quality but it will definitely do the job and it was really cheap compared to other neck dusters I found on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I love the short handle, and the bristles are nice and soft for wiping my 11-month old&#x27;s face after I cut his hair!!</li>
            <li> It is what it is. A funny show and a nice price. Had to compete the collection</li>
            <li> Works well, great price. I admit I only bought it to go with the new set of clippers I also bought on Amazon. Truth is I don&#x27;t really use this brush that often, even after cutting my own hair. But it definitely works. Only bad thing about it is, the bristles fall out very easily</li>
            <li> Works well for cleanup of the face/neck as well as the surfaces around the chair.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described. Has nice solid handle - easy to hold, with a flat end to stand it up, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Nice addition to my grooming routine.  Sold handle for easy gripping &amp; storing.  Soft on neck.  Like being at the barber&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I needed this night duster really bad because I cut my own hair and it was a perfect product to order it came in on time I got it pretty quickly and there was nothing wrong with it I will order again from this company as soon as possible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small, I can get this duster brush for $5.00 for the local beauty supply without paying a shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> great quality and compact,  i do recommend</li>
            <li> i was kinda shocked when i got it to see how small it was. But is a good thing so i can take it anywhere.</li>
            <li> Well made, works great</li>
            <li> Perfect for the Clubman aftershave talc.</li>
            <li> Soft to the touch but shedding hairs even in the first use!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Beautifully takes all the hair away from neck after hair cut.  A treat!</li>
            <li> Our son has sensory issues and has major issues during hair cuts. He is 5 years old. This product has been a life saver. Highly recommend it. He uses it when he feels the itchy and we use it often during the hair cut. Works great. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Works great getting all the hair wiped off tour neck and I use it to also powder up the area as well</li>
            <li> Great product, hairs might fall out but very rarely, very soft on the face, sturdy handle.</li>
            <li> i didnt know what to expect cause this was the first one iv bought. i love it. and i ordered one for a friend. its inexpensive and came quite quick.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done!:) I actually have only used it for putting baby powder on my skin before I wax.. It works well.. I&#x27;ve used it once and lost a hair or 2.</li>
            <li> I like how its small and Works just perfectly. I use it everyday when i need to clean up my clients after their haircut .The only problem I have with it is how some hairs fall off the brush other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> This neck duster is one of the nicer ones that I have seen. But it does not have anything different to make it stand out than all of the other. The bristles are pretty soft I must say though and that I am happy about. The handle is made of plastic which is pretty durable. It is a very nice item to have when cutting hair especially when trying to get the little hairs of your neck or face. Over all I have happy with this purchase and would recommend this brush to any hair stylist out there.</li>
            <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft.  Works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost a year out of Cosmetology school and I needed to enhance my clients experience in my chair, especially concerning the male clients who get clipper cuts done. This tool is extremely nice in grabbing that hair off gentlemen clients&#x27; foreheads and necks without being rough like a towel or blow dryer would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and noticed that many said it shed, and mine did too. But only the first two times and it has since stopped. I do recommend cleaning the neck duster off after every use because it does hold the hair in its base if you don&#x27;t. And that would just be refuting the purpose of this tool if you didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I totally suggest getting this if you want to be and look professional for your clients at your salon. :)</li>
            <li> This product is A1... That all I have to say. Keep up the good service.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. It does work. though it shreds every use.</li>
            <li> Brushes off all stray hairs and feels great on the skin!</li>
            <li> the duster works as advertised.  it brushes the hair off of me when i&#x27;m cutting my hair.  no complaints here.</li>
            <li> I use this brush on my son and myself when I do haircuts.  It works great getting off all the tiny hairs from the back of the neck and face that the clippers leave behind.  Nice little brush!</li>
            <li> The brush hair sheds a lot not very good for price !</li>
            <li> It works but not good as the vacuum.  The short hairs are still kept around the neck.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I USE THIS ALL THE TIME!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome neck duster. If this broke I would totally buy another one.</li>
            <li> Sheds a lot. Not that great.</li>
            <li> This Neck Duster has helped out a lot with our hair cutting at home.  Every time my wife would cut my hair before there would be a lot of tears and crying, and she would also be upset.  No more, this will gleefully push those unwanted follicles which have already been separated from their strands off and onto the floor.</li>
            <li> Recently added this to my haircutting kit for my family. I like it. It dusts them off without feeling itchy. Good size and it fit into my clipper plastic box.</li>
            <li> This little brush worked perfect to wipe off hair while I&#x27;m cutting my kid&#x27;s hair. We previously used the hard barber brush to wipe off hair, but my kids would complain about its stiff and hard hairs. They now enjoy getting haircuts knowing that this will be extra gentle on their face, neck area and back.</li>
            <li> I cut my sons hair and needed one of these in my arsenal to give them the illusion that dad knows what he&#x27;s doing  😂. I&#x27;m clueless! This duster is a must have for the home barber.</li>
            <li> Just perfect! Works better than I thought it would for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this since I was already purchasing a new hair cutting cape and it was an add-on item. This duster works very well! It comes in a little plastic box. This duster itself looks like it&#x27;s a top of the notch neck duster, it has a metal gold ring that holds in the bristles and acts as a handle. The bristles are extremely soft and not pocky at all. It removes all the hair from your neck and I even use it to get hair off my machine. This is a great product and it looks like it&#x27;ll be lasting a long time!</li>
            <li> I have 3 of these, I love them.  2 of them did shed a little.  They&#x27;re soft, and when you put a little baby powder in them before hand its gets more of the hair off the neck and doesn&#x27;t stick as much to the duster.</li>
            <li> this item is great and easy to use</li>
            <li> Works great to remove the hair i cut for my kids and husband.  They used to gripe about the hair tickling...no more after buying this!</li>
            <li> Very good item to have. Especially if you&#x27;re starting to cut hair or just to maintain yours like me.</li>
            <li> This brush sheds bristles far faster than it can remove hairs from your neck. I have given up using it as it sheds constantly. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> A must have for every home Barber Shop</li>
            <li> Some hairs will fall out in the beginning, this happens with them all, after that it works great.</li>
            <li> Works well. Smells of chemicals.</li>
            <li> This duster has very soft bristles but sheds a lot. It is large enough to get a good grip around the base, and it&#x27;s light weight makes it easy to use. If only it didn&#x27;t shed, then I would give it 5 stars.</li>
