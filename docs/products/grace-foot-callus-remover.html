            <li>I am so impressed with this product, that I plan to do the exfoliation once a year before sandal season.</li>

            <li>Great!  </li>
            <li>In one word, this product is simply incredible.  </li>
            <li>incredible.</li>
            <li>Good thing there were pictures to follow!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product with the caveat that it will not remove all callus, but does a great job anyway.</li>
            <li>Makes a great holiday gift and stocking stuffer by the way.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This is truely a GREAT PRODUCT .</li>
            <li>I am happy it worked for others but for some reason (and I followed directions to a t)</li>
            <li>and I still had great results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I found this product</li>
            <li>its coming along great</li>
            <li>this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>My feet are maybe 10% softer if at all, but 10% result versus $18.00 every 2 months don’t seem to add up to a good deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i was good about vacumming.</li>
            <li>they haven&#x27;tlooked this good in years.</li>
            <li>This is an incredible product, i just ordered 3 more</li>
            <li>but hey for the price, its still a good deal.</li>
            <li>It is superior than any products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Good staff.</li>
            <li>Amazing, amazing product.  </li>
            <li>and I liked the gel.</li>
            <li>It feels so good to be able to wear flip flops and sandals again.  </li>
            <li>I used the pack.. waited four days and saw no change at all, then by today I had actually kind of forgotten about it so hadn&#x27;t looked at my feet.</li>
            <li>and I was so impressed with how soft my feet were after that I placed another order!</li>
            <li>I liked the Baby Foot better because size was not an issue</li>
            <li>Be sure to soak your feet every night.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, took off years of callus build up without any effort, pain and discomfort.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have used this product and the results are delightful.  </li>
            <li>They may have peeled better if I had soaked them.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I was able to walk around in the slippers by placing socks on my feet.</li>
            <li>They peeled for more than a week.</li>
            <li>All I can say is:  this better work.  </li>
            <li>I had a callus for about a year and it started to spread , I&#x27;ve tried many many things and nothing seemed to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>It removed most of my callus after just one use.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;asking them if it was going to take 2-3 more?  </li>
            <li>so I would recommend buying more than one..</li>
            <li>and I truly feel I&#x27;m gonna be able to wear sandals this year.</li>
            <li>Totally comfortable and kept them nice and snug against my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I found something that works even better for targeted removal.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34; slippers&amp;#34; with the product inside would fit someone with a women size 7-8 at most.</li>
            <li>Right now, the slippers are falling off, leaking, held together around my ankles with rubber bands!!</li>
            <li>tried other items in stores and this was the best.</li>
            <li>I heard about this product from a friend and at first it sounded too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>The smell reminded me exactly of the solution used in chemical peels on my face, which I liked.</li>
            <li>The product itself felt fine - cooling and tingly.  </li>
            <li>Fine send the product.&lt;br /&gt;If not please issue a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had huge patches of peeling skin flaking off day by day.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t even remember  when my feet looked and felt so smooth.</li>
            <li>It was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I am so, so thrilled with the results and highly recommend Grace Foot !</li>
            <li>your free to go about your business.</li>
            <li>They stay in place and are completely comfortable to walk around in.</li>
            <li>I suspect the price for this great find will double in no time.  </li>
            <li>It was actually funny because for a minute I freaked out wondering what happened to my feet?!!</li>
            <li>As usual, dont buy the &amp;#34;This is the best and the answer to all your prayers.</li>
            <li>After emailing them about my experience, they asked if I would like another one free of charge ...Or a full refund?  </li>
            <li>But then my reaction change to being excited.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this because of the reviews and let me tell you they were right !</li>
            <li>Then you are soaking your feet, but don&#x27;t have to set aside special time to do so</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m ordering another one right now!</li>
            <li>I wore the booties for a full two hours.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much...</li>
            <li>I loved the results and will definitely use it again in a couple of months as needed.  </li>
            <li>They had decided to issue a Full refund  and this product is no longer available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mostly on the outside corners of both the top and bottom of my feet.  </li>
            <li>I had read many many reviews of this and similar products and decided I should prep my feet.</li>
            <li>catching on everything.&lt;br /&gt;After using this just once, I was amazed at how my rough feet turned smooth!</li>
            <li>It works exactly as the detailed instructions on the package state.</li>
            <li>I work retail full time and work out and run a household, my feet are crazy,i have tried everything from creams to rechargable tools with verying degrees of success.</li>
            <li>I actually just ordered 2 more!</li>
            <li>This item would be great if you looking for a foot peel that removes dead skin</li>
            <li>The $20 price tag is so worth it.</li>
            <li>WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li>made my feet look so much better and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finding out that I was going to need $60 worth of this product to get the type of results they advertised has me writing this review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had calluses since I was 12 or so years old and like so many others have tried EVERYTHING to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably still use a peel once a year a month or so before the summer so my feet are nice and fresh for sandal season, but the Callus Eliminator is definitely going to be my go to product!!</li>
            <li>The product went through some changes since the last time I used it, and I am pretty happy with the results of the new product as well.  </li>
            <li>Does not work as good as other products .</li>
            <li>: When I put on the booties I didn&#x27;t bother with the tape strips, I just slid some spa socks on right over them.</li>
            <li>I am 15 and soo excited because i can now walk without pain and wear any shoes because my foot is smooth soft and now even pretty .</li>
            <li>peeled right off, painlessly and pretty effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>You think it&#x27;s not going to work at first</li>
            <li>first time was Baby Foot.</li>
            <li>worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I gifted it last year and everyone raved about it!</li>
            <li>Grace Foot really works!</li>
            <li>But that $20 price tag is pretty steep, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I soaked them in hot water for 30 mins before applying the booties .</li>
            <li>I left the booties on for an hour and since they contain a solution and not a slippery gel, I was able to walk around.</li>
            <li>I did add lotion to my feet every day after my shower, before I put on socks, as well as soaked my feet in hot water each night.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem like the product was working after the first day or two, but then it all happened at once.</li>
            <li>My feet are super soft and callous-free.  </li>
            <li>My heels, which were always the problem area for me in the past, look great and soft.  </li>
            <li>As long as its about 15 minutes or more, it should be really helpful.  </li>
            <li>Grace foot was so easy to use, you only have to slide your feet into the foot packs for about 2 hours then</li>
            <li>Took some skin off after a week, but all the large callouses were still there.</li>
            <li>They peeled for 4 days here and there and it kind of made a mess</li>
            <li>This is a great product, i spent so much money on foot creams, callas removers etc.. after using this once, I even forgot about it, until today when all my skin peeled including my rough spots.  </li>
            <li>[they will shed more when wet] and you don’t want to disgust your pedicurist</li>
            <li>My feet have also been very itchy after the use of this product.</li>
            <li>Works very well if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>The bummer was that it peeled where I didn&#x27;t have calluses and really didn&#x27;t peel where I did.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>the girl who did my pedicure said herself it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Two drops on each heel, three minutes later I lightly rubbed with a pumice in the shower and they are 80% gone.</li>
            <li>My foot became soft and the callus started to die and just peeled right off for itself .</li>
            <li>This product did peel the bottom and top of my feet, as a matter of fact I have been shedding skin for the last 2 weeks [not cool], yet the calluses remain strong and the edges of my heels are still cracked.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t believe one brand is better the the other</li>
            <li>It took off the first layer of skin and my feet are soft!</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this product I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my feet felt.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and had my expectations high on this product.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this product after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li>My feet felt funny after I took them off -- kind of tight and dry</li>
            <li>I soaked my feet most evenings and cut off the dead skin then as well as in the morning after my shower.</li>
            <li>It was SO fantastic to see all the old, yucky dry skin disappear!</li>
            <li>I have a shoe size of 14, so I was really hoping these would be large enough.</li>
            <li>It did peel the outer layer of skin off my feet however it did not really improve my heel calluses which was my original purpose for buying the product.</li>
            <li>I slide them on, first halfway because the back wouldn&#x27;t go around my heel.</li>
            <li>Did my husbands feet, they were soft as a babies bottom!</li>
            <li>Was so excited to try this based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>yes, my feet are soft!</li>
            <li>The balls of my feet and my heels were practically completely peeled and the calluses on my big toes were taken care of pretty well.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a week or so for the peeling to start, but soak your feet in warm water every evening and the dead dry skin will just slough off gently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This time it took nearly all the rougher spots off.</li>
            <li>So I had wonderfully soft feet all over except teh calloused parts.</li>
            <li>But was I surprised after using this product.</li>
            <li>(everyone is busy).  </li>
            <li>It took nearly a week before I noticed any change.</li>
            <li>The directions said to just let it come off naturally</li>
            <li>My feet were completely peeled by day five</li>
            <li>WoW...</li>
            <li>My feet have never been so soft.</li>
            <li>The Callus Eliminator Bundle from Be Natural ($14 on amazon) and</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was a slightly different feeling in my feet the first night, you would barely call it pain.</li>
            <li>but it totally took off the top layer of dead skin.  </li>
            <li>Except for some really heavy callus areas on my heel, it pretty much removed all my callus.</li>
            <li>The skin peeling part was a little offsetting at first, but that quickly passed once it set in that all of the rough skin was gone!</li>
            <li>It removed most callouses but not the tough heel callouses.</li>
            <li>once you see the skin start to peel, get in the tub and soak your feet as the skin peels off so much easier when your feet are wet.  </li>
            <li>And boy was there a lot of change and peeling and, wow, it was so gross.</li>
            <li>I still have some callouses on the balls of my feet, but overall, my feet feel soft.</li>
            <li>Years&#x27; worth of dead, cracked skin that had accumulated on my heels</li>
            <li>You should not be able to sell this item under false pretense.</li>
            <li>According to the instructions the new product needs to stay on for only 1 hr (instead of 2 hours before), and I have noticed that the peeling process started earlier this time, in about 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li>Your feet may look like a hot, nasty mess for a couple of weeks, but once this product is finished working its magic, you will be very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I know some reviewers said they had less success if they were a daily shower taker and never take baths</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical at first because most products you order over the internet just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Of course after I had put on the first little booty, I found the English instructions.</li>
            <li>Those calluses however were pretty thick, and they didn&#x27;t get completely removed.</li>
            <li>There are no clear instructions on how to open this tightly sealed plastic slipper and when you think you have it right</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Mostly on the outside corners of both the top and bottom of my feet.  </li>
            <li> I had read many many reviews of this and similar products and decided I should prep my feet.</li>
            <li> catching on everything.&lt;br /&gt;After using this just once, I was amazed at how my rough feet turned smooth!</li>
            <li> It works exactly as the detailed instructions on the package state.</li>
            <li> I work retail full time and work out and run a household, my feet are crazy,i have tried everything from creams to rechargable tools with verying degrees of success.</li>
            <li> I actually just ordered 2 more!</li>
            <li> This item would be great if you looking for a foot peel that removes dead skin</li>
            <li> The $20 price tag is so worth it.</li>
            <li> WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li> made my feet look so much better and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finding out that I was going to need $60 worth of this product to get the type of results they advertised has me writing this review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had calluses since I was 12 or so years old and like so many others have tried EVERYTHING to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably still use a peel once a year a month or so before the summer so my feet are nice and fresh for sandal season, but the Callus Eliminator is definitely going to be my go to product!!</li>
            <li> The product went through some changes since the last time I used it, and I am pretty happy with the results of the new product as well.  </li>
            <li> Does not work as good as other products .</li>
            <li> : When I put on the booties I didn&#x27;t bother with the tape strips, I just slid some spa socks on right over them.</li>
            <li> I am 15 and soo excited because i can now walk without pain and wear any shoes because my foot is smooth soft and now even pretty .</li>
            <li> peeled right off, painlessly and pretty effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> You think it&#x27;s not going to work at first</li>
            <li> first time was Baby Foot.</li>
            <li> worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I gifted it last year and everyone raved about it!</li>
            <li> Grace Foot really works!</li>
            <li> But that $20 price tag is pretty steep, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I soaked them in hot water for 30 mins before applying the booties .</li>
            <li> I left the booties on for an hour and since they contain a solution and not a slippery gel, I was able to walk around.</li>
            <li> I did add lotion to my feet every day after my shower, before I put on socks, as well as soaked my feet in hot water each night.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem like the product was working after the first day or two, but then it all happened at once.</li>
            <li> My feet are super soft and callous-free.  </li>
            <li> My heels, which were always the problem area for me in the past, look great and soft.  </li>
            <li> As long as its about 15 minutes or more, it should be really helpful.  </li>
            <li> Grace foot was so easy to use, you only have to slide your feet into the foot packs for about 2 hours then</li>
            <li> Took some skin off after a week, but all the large callouses were still there.</li>
            <li> They peeled for 4 days here and there and it kind of made a mess</li>
            <li> This is a great product, i spent so much money on foot creams, callas removers etc.. after using this once, I even forgot about it, until today when all my skin peeled including my rough spots.  </li>
            <li> [they will shed more when wet] and you don’t want to disgust your pedicurist</li>
            <li> My feet have also been very itchy after the use of this product.</li>
            <li> Works very well if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> The bummer was that it peeled where I didn&#x27;t have calluses and really didn&#x27;t peel where I did.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> the girl who did my pedicure said herself it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Two drops on each heel, three minutes later I lightly rubbed with a pumice in the shower and they are 80% gone.</li>
            <li> My foot became soft and the callus started to die and just peeled right off for itself .</li>
            <li> This product did peel the bottom and top of my feet, as a matter of fact I have been shedding skin for the last 2 weeks [not cool], yet the calluses remain strong and the edges of my heels are still cracked.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t believe one brand is better the the other</li>
            <li> It took off the first layer of skin and my feet are soft!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my feet felt.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and had my expectations high on this product.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li> My feet felt funny after I took them off -- kind of tight and dry</li>
            <li> I soaked my feet most evenings and cut off the dead skin then as well as in the morning after my shower.</li>
            <li> It was SO fantastic to see all the old, yucky dry skin disappear!</li>
            <li> I have a shoe size of 14, so I was really hoping these would be large enough.</li>
            <li> It did peel the outer layer of skin off my feet however it did not really improve my heel calluses which was my original purpose for buying the product.</li>
            <li> I slide them on, first halfway because the back wouldn&#x27;t go around my heel.</li>
            <li> Did my husbands feet, they were soft as a babies bottom!</li>
            <li> Was so excited to try this based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> yes, my feet are soft!</li>
            <li> The balls of my feet and my heels were practically completely peeled and the calluses on my big toes were taken care of pretty well.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a week or so for the peeling to start, but soak your feet in warm water every evening and the dead dry skin will just slough off gently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This time it took nearly all the rougher spots off.</li>
            <li> So I had wonderfully soft feet all over except teh calloused parts.</li>
            <li> But was I surprised after using this product.</li>
            <li> (everyone is busy).  </li>
            <li> It took nearly a week before I noticed any change.</li>
            <li> The directions said to just let it come off naturally</li>
            <li> My feet were completely peeled by day five</li>
            <li> WoW...</li>
            <li> My feet have never been so soft.</li>
            <li> The Callus Eliminator Bundle from Be Natural ($14 on amazon) and</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was a slightly different feeling in my feet the first night, you would barely call it pain.</li>
            <li> but it totally took off the top layer of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Except for some really heavy callus areas on my heel, it pretty much removed all my callus.</li>
            <li> The skin peeling part was a little offsetting at first, but that quickly passed once it set in that all of the rough skin was gone!</li>
            <li> It removed most callouses but not the tough heel callouses.</li>
            <li> once you see the skin start to peel, get in the tub and soak your feet as the skin peels off so much easier when your feet are wet.  </li>
            <li> And boy was there a lot of change and peeling and, wow, it was so gross.</li>
            <li> I still have some callouses on the balls of my feet, but overall, my feet feel soft.</li>
            <li> Years&#x27; worth of dead, cracked skin that had accumulated on my heels</li>
            <li> You should not be able to sell this item under false pretense.</li>
            <li> According to the instructions the new product needs to stay on for only 1 hr (instead of 2 hours before), and I have noticed that the peeling process started earlier this time, in about 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li> Your feet may look like a hot, nasty mess for a couple of weeks, but once this product is finished working its magic, you will be very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I know some reviewers said they had less success if they were a daily shower taker and never take baths</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first because most products you order over the internet just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Of course after I had put on the first little booty, I found the English instructions.</li>
            <li> Those calluses however were pretty thick, and they didn&#x27;t get completely removed.</li>
            <li> There are no clear instructions on how to open this tightly sealed plastic slipper and when you think you have it right</li>
            <li> I am staring at my foot right now and almost all the old skin is gone except for the really tough calluses on the edge of the heels</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the patience for 2 hours, but next time will keep them on that long.  </li>
            <li> will not recommend this product to anyone or use it again, feeling sad that the solution for callused feet is not so easy to find.</li>
            <li> Although it was kind of disgusting watching my feet peel for about a week, the end result was so worth it.</li>
            <li> but I definitely have rough, dry heels and callouses on my big toes.</li>
            <li> This product is for very dry, calloused feet only.</li>
            <li> All in all, not very helpful for such a high-priced product.</li>
            <li> The combination of sweat and rubbing left the inside of my black socks looking white!!</li>
            <li> Buy it for your significant others, and you will not be sorry.  </li>
            <li> Removes Dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li> I had really dry skin on my foot because winter causes havoc on my skin.</li>
            <li> I think stretched the bag, which is made of plastic, a little, and got it around my entire foot.</li>
            <li> I play hard on my feet since I live an active lifestyle and attempting to remove well-deserved calluses</li>
            <li> My only complaint was the my slippers were two different sizes.</li>
            <li> On the 4th day, I noticed some patches of dead skin starting to peel off my foot.</li>
            <li> I had them on for about an hour and a few days later, my feet started peeling.</li>
            <li> , there is a wet liquidy goo seeping out...</li>
            <li> Walking in them felt like walking in wet shoes.</li>
            <li> used to use foot files, but even the day after using a foot file, my feet would be rough like sandpaper....</li>
            <li> Once you get the package the Directions state that 2-3 application over a few months may be required if you have a larger buildup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I simply slipped these little sockie things on and put my regular socks over them and do my thing for 2 hours,rinse my feet and go about my business.after a few days the dead skin just peels off.</li>
            <li> It was pretty expensive and I was very let down with its false claims of removing calluses.</li>
            <li> Will be getting another for a second round soon!</li>
            <li> I would recommend  it to other people.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty expensive endeavor.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had results like this with any other foot smoothing</li>
            <li> The booties seemed a little weird, but other reviews were right...</li>
            <li> Grace foot worked to remove 90% of dead, dry skin and callus.</li>
            <li> Have average feet and did everything by instructions.</li>
            <li> so I looked down and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: That last little part of the really thick callus never did come off..</li>
            <li> After the first treatment, my feet looked pretty gruesome</li>
            <li> About half of the skin on the bottom of my feet were gone.</li>
            <li> They can be a little squishy, but with a snug pair of socks they stayed put.</li>
            <li> Your feet will peel for about a week, I wish the results lasted a little longer</li>
            <li> I did have a little struggle opening the booties as my pair were sealed at the ankle part</li>
            <li> My toes were a little itchy</li>
            <li> I peeled a few pieces off, they didn&#x27;t slide off or anything.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would remove all the layers of dead skin on my feet</li>
            <li> It did take off a layer of dead skin on the bottom of my foot.</li>
            <li> I had to scrub at it with a pumice stone to get the dead skin all the way off.</li>
            <li> I have heavily calloused feet though and that could be the issue.</li>
            <li> The dead skin just peeled off.  </li>
            <li> It did peel off the dead skin after a few days of applying it however, it did not remove my calluses.</li>
            <li> The dead skin just came off.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> by wearing the disposable callus removing packs once and only for about 2 hours, feet are freed of callus and dryness for approximately 1.5-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wait a few days and your feet will shed.</li>
            <li> I have size 13 and the bags are a little small for me, but with some stretching and toe curling I go them on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been soaking and peeling the past two nights as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just applied and went about my usual activities for two hours.  </li>
            <li> You might have to skip your pedicure during the shedding process [2 weeks in my case and still going]; you might feel uncomfortable showing your feet in public</li>
            <li> Not sure if this means I have to do it again?  </li>
            <li> It is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Dont waste any time , if u have a callus i seriously recommend this.</li>
            <li> I did add a pair of thick socks over the booties to keep them snug against my feet.</li>
            <li> TOTAL waste of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use to get my heels caught in nylons, no more of that!</li>
            <li> No more pumice stones for me!</li>
            <li> There is no excuse any longer to walk around with hard, cracked ugly heels.  </li>
            <li> Not something you want to do during bare feet season because it is ugly.</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist and I am on my feet in serious wedges/heels 10 hours a day, 5-6 days a week.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, because by the fifth day, my feet had not peeled at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second impression -- the booties are cold and wet feeling.</li>
            <li> but I do think if you have tough callouses</li>
            <li> Poor item!!!did nothing for my feet.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the result, being in a dry, cold climate, I&#x27;ll be doing this every month!</li>
            <li> I am 25 yrs old with horrible callus and corns on toes...</li>
            <li> I used this product and was skeptical about how it would work.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Because of the price tag and the side effect of peeling skin, I probably would only do this when my feet are at their worst, winter.</li>
            <li> So weird, but</li>
            <li> but I think I may have wanted the impossible.</li>
            <li> Then I had the itchy feet thing happen, nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> I have bad calluses after 8 years of ballet dancing [on pointes].</li>
            <li> Whoever has calluses knows that they can be extremely painful not to mention ugly-looking.</li>
            <li> I will admit I just opened the box but am already disappointed with the difficulty putting on the slippery acid-medicated &#x27;slipper&#x27;.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work for me. :(</li>
            <li> I have calluses on my feet but probably not the worst in the world.  </li>
            <li> Think of the worst sunburn you&#x27;ve had and how that peels when it&#x27;s healing.</li>
            <li> My feet aren&#x27;t horrible</li>
            <li> HOLY CRAP!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have a shoe size of 14, so I was really hoping these would be large enough. I slide them on, first halfway because the back wouldn&#x27;t go around my heel. I think stretched the bag, which is made of plastic, a little, and got it around my entire foot. Immediately my skin felt \\&quot;soft\\&quot; like it was mushy. I rinse my feet and wait. On the 4th day, I noticed some patches of dead skin starting to peel off my foot. I peeled a few pieces off, they didn&#x27;t slide off or anything. I then played volleyball that night and boy oh boy did my skin peel off! The combination of sweat and rubbing left the inside of my black socks looking white!! The balls of my feet and my heels were practically completely peeled and the calluses on my big toes were taken care of pretty well. Those calluses however were pretty thick, and they didn&#x27;t get completely removed. I plan on doing another run of this in a month or so. I&#x27;ve been soaking and peeling the past two nights as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a slightly different feeling in my feet the first night, you would barely call it pain. Then I had the itchy feet thing happen, nothing too bad. The night I played volleyball I felt like I was sliding around in my socks. It definitely requires some manual peeling IMO. Will be getting another for a second round soon!</li>
            <li> Worked Great!! I Recommend this one</li>
            <li> You think it&#x27;s not going to work at first but then wait a few days and your skin really starts to peel.  Be sure to soak your feet every night.  I think that&#x27;s critical.  Not something you want to do during bare feet season because it is ugly.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with foot callus problems for years.  I am a hair stylist and I am on my feet in serious wedges/heels 10 hours a day, 5-6 days a week.  A client of mine who&#x27;s a dancer and has the same callus issues has told me about this product and I decided to give it a try.  I absolutely love this product, took off years of callus build up without any effort, pain and discomfort.</li>
            <li> I used this product and was skeptical about how it would work. I have size 13 and the bags are a little small for me, but with some stretching and toe curling I go them on. I followed the instructions and had to wait 4 days before the peeling started. Except for some really heavy callus areas on my heel, it pretty much removed all my callus. I gave four stars only because it did not remove all the callus as stated, but I am buying another treatment to see if it will remove the rest. After the first treatment, my feet looked pretty gruesome and I got worried because of the severe cracking in the heel callus area, but as time went and the peeling began, these cracks got smaller and smaller. I recommend this product with the caveat that it will not remove all callus, but does a great job anyway. I will update this after the second usage.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions, and after reading reviews I added the daily soak.  My feet are super soft and callous-free.  This is the second time I have used this product and the results are delightful.  Highly recommend.  I just applied and went about my usual activities for two hours.  They can be a little squishy, but with a snug pair of socks they stayed put.</li>
            <li> I have used both Grace Foot and Baby Foot....first time was Baby Foot. It removed most callouses but not the tough heel callouses. I waited a month and used the Grace Foot. This time it took nearly all the rougher spots off. Both applications began working in 4 days and all the scaling was over 3 days later. So I don&#x27;t believe one brand is better the the other but I do think if you have tough callouses it will take 2 applications several weeks apart.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and had my expectations high on this product. I have bad calluses after 8 years of ballet dancing [on pointes]. Whoever has calluses knows that they can be extremely painful not to mention ugly-looking. This product did peel the bottom and top of my feet, as a matter of fact I have been shedding skin for the last 2 weeks [not cool], yet the calluses remain strong and the edges of my heels are still cracked. My feet are maybe 10% softer if at all, but 10% result versus $18.00 every 2 months don’t seem to add up to a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to know before you decide to use the treatment:&lt;br /&gt;1. The treatment will ruin your toenail polish, so skip your pedicure before you use the product.&lt;br /&gt;2. You might peel for 2 weeks, so put your sandals away and pull your snickers out.&lt;br /&gt;3. You might have to skip your pedicure during the shedding process [2 weeks in my case and still going]; you might feel uncomfortable showing your feet in public [they will shed more when wet] and you don’t want to disgust your pedicurist either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not recommend this product to anyone or use it again, feeling sad that the solution for callused feet is not so easy to find.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would remove all the layers of dead skin on my feet but I think I may have wanted the impossible. It did take off a layer of dead skin on the bottom of my foot. I had to scrub at it with a pumice stone to get the dead skin all the way off.</li>
            <li> In one word, this product is simply incredible.  I wore the booties for a full two hours.  I was a little skeptical, because by the fifth day, my feet had not peeled at all.  Then, low and behold, on the sixth day, the bottoms of my feet started to peel while I was taking a bath.  Years&#x27; worth of dead, cracked skin that had accumulated on my heels peeled right off, painlessly and pretty effortlessly.  Tip:  once you see the skin start to peel, get in the tub and soak your feet as the skin peels off so much easier when your feet are wet.  You can also use a pumice stone to help with the peeling process. I am so impressed with this product, that I plan to do the exfoliation once a year before sandal season. The $20 price tag is so worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried it. I was skeptical. I followed all the directions and tips and the parts of my foot that peeled were not the calloused parts of my feet. So I had wonderfully soft feet all over except teh calloused parts. I have heavily calloused feet though and that could be the issue.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing! i can&#x27;t even remember  when my feet looked and felt so smooth. worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Nothing was happening until Day 3 and then my feet started molting.  The dead skin just peeled off.  It was fantastic.  I actually just ordered 2 more!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 hours on my feet. They started peeling about a 4 days later. They peeled for 4 days here and there and it kind of made a mess but i was good about vacumming. I didn&#x27;t follow the instructions entirely, it says to soak your feet for 20-30 min once a day for a week or so and i didn&#x27;t do that but they still peeled. They may have peeled better if I had soaked them. The peeling did not hurt. It took off the first layer of skin and my feet are soft! they haven&#x27;tlooked this good in years. I was beginning to get a tiny crack on my left foot and it&#x27;s gone!! I use to get my heels caught in nylons, no more of that! I LOVE this product. In fact, I&#x27;m ordering another one right now!</li>
            <li> My feet were horrible....dry and cracked.  Grace foot worked to remove 90% of dead, dry skin and callus. For the effects of this product to fully work, I would need to do this once a month. Because of the price tag and the side effect of peeling skin, I probably would only do this when my feet are at their worst, winter. I was able to walk around in the slippers by placing socks on my feet. I left mine on for 1.5 hours, although the time ranged from 1.5-2 hours. I didn&#x27;t have the patience for 2 hours, but next time will keep them on that long.  My only complaint was the my slippers were two different sizes.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that has ever made a dent in my feet. I had them on for about an hour and a few days later, my feet started peeling. And peeling. They peeled for more than a week. It was SO fantastic to see all the old, yucky dry skin disappear! I have used everything, including urea at 40%, and NO results have ever come close to Grace Foot. WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are awesom! Did my husbands feet, they were soft as a babies bottom!</li>
            <li> Took some skin off after a week, but all the large callouses were still there. All in all, not very helpful for such a high-priced product.</li>
            <li> Does not work as good as other products . Would not buy again .You get what you pay for .</li>
            <li> Tried this product after using &amp;#34; Baby Foot&amp;#34; product. The &amp;#34; slippers&amp;#34; with the product inside would fit someone with a women size 7-8 at most. I liked the Baby Foot better because size was not an issue and I liked the gel. This product has its application soaked into the slippers like a baby wipe.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first because most products you order over the internet just don&#x27;t work. But was I surprised after using this product. Calluses I&#x27;ve had for years, that even my pedicurist couldn&#x27;t remove, were gone. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. I give it 10 stars.</li>
            <li> I love it so much...I&#x27;m ordering again....made my feet look so much better and soft. I would recommend  it to other people.</li>
            <li> I will admit I just opened the box but am already disappointed with the difficulty putting on the slippery acid-medicated &#x27;slipper&#x27;. What a joke!  There are no clear instructions on how to open this tightly sealed plastic slipper and when you think you have it right, there is a wet liquidy goo seeping out...it feels, and smells, like some sort of acid skin remover.  Right now, the slippers are falling off, leaking, held together around my ankles with rubber bands!! All I can say is:  this better work.  I will follow directions and if my big acre size callous is gone within said time, I will revise my review.</li>
            <li> I have discovered this product about a year ago and have been hooked ever since.  No more pumice stones for me! The product went through some changes since the last time I used it, and I am pretty happy with the results of the new product as well.  It seems to work faster.  According to the instructions the new product needs to stay on for only 1 hr (instead of 2 hours before), and I have noticed that the peeling process started earlier this time, in about 3-4 days.  My heels, which were always the problem area for me in the past, look great and soft.  I loved the results and will definitely use it again in a couple of months as needed.  Makes a great holiday gift and stocking stuffer by the way. I gifted it last year and everyone raved about it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, i spent so much money on foot creams, callas removers etc.. after using this once, I even forgot about it, until today when all my skin peeled including my rough spots.  This is an incredible product, i just ordered 3 more so i can use it once a month...</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works were well. Removes Dry skin on feet.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I&#x27;m a shower person too, here&#x27;s a hint...Partially plug your tub stopper (or fully plug it if you must) after application is complete.  Then you are soaking your feet, but don&#x27;t have to set aside special time to do so (everyone is busy).  As long as its about 15 minutes or more, it should be really helpful.  At the end of the shower, I just drained the tub and let the shower continue to run (after the peeling started) and gently rubbed the dead skin away with a washcloth. I was amazed at the result, being in a dry, cold climate, I&#x27;ll be doing this every month!</li>
            <li> I got this item hoping that it would get rid of the calluses that I have on my heels and the ball of my foot. I had really dry skin on my foot because winter causes havoc on my skin. It did peel off the dead skin after a few days of applying it however, it did not remove my calluses. It was pretty expensive and I was very let down with its false claims of removing calluses. This item would be great if you looking for a foot peel that removes dead skin but if you are using it for callus removal it does not hold up to expectations. My feet have also been very itchy after the use of this product.</li>
            <li> I had a callus for about a year and it started to spread , I&#x27;ve tried many many things and nothing seemed to get rid of it. I was excited to try this because of the reviews and let me tell you they were right ! My foot became soft and the callus started to die and just peeled right off for itself . I am 15 and soo excited because i can now walk without pain and wear any shoes because my foot is smooth soft and now even pretty . This is truely a GREAT PRODUCT . Dont waste any time , if u have a callus i seriously recommend this.</li>
            <li> Works very well if you follow the instructions. Your feet will peel for about a week, I wish the results lasted a little longer but hey for the price, its still a good deal.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to try this based on other reviews.  I have calluses on my feet but probably not the worst in the world.  Mostly on the outside corners of both the top and bottom of my feet.  The product itself felt fine - cooling and tingly.  After about 6 days skin definitely started to peel off (toes included).  The bummer was that it peeled where I didn&#x27;t have calluses and really didn&#x27;t peel where I did.  Not sure if this means I have to do it again?  At $20 per use it&#x27;s a pretty expensive endeavor.  I am happy it worked for others but for some reason (and I followed directions to a t) it didn&#x27;t work for me. :(</li>
            <li> Grace Foot really works! I have a lot of callus on my feet from aerobic classes so I&#x27;ve tried every callus remover products from the drug stores.  I heard about this product from a friend and at first it sounded too good to be true.  I decided to give it a try.  Wow! It removed most of my callus after just one use.  It is superior than any products I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m recommending this Grace Foot to everyone!</li>
            <li> Grace Foot Callus Remover saved my feet and I can wear sandals again!  Within a week of applying this foot mask I was callus-free and I watched all my calluses peel away and disappear.  It feels so good to be able to wear flip flops and sandals again.  I have found the Callus Cure!</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product after reading all the reviews. As soon as it arrived, I put it to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression -- everything is in Korean. Good thing there were pictures to follow! Of course after I had put on the first little booty, I found the English instructions. Anyway, I was not expecting that this was going to be packaged this way. No problem, just unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second impression -- the booties are cold and wet feeling. I put socks on over them and sat. Walking in them felt like walking in wet shoes. Yuck. My feet felt funny after I took them off -- kind of tight and dry feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third impression -- oh no, they&#x27;re not working! It took nearly a week before I noticed any change. And boy was there a lot of change and peeling and, wow, it was so gross. Think of the worst sunburn you&#x27;ve had and how that peels when it&#x27;s healing. The dead skin just came off. Like big, popped blisters. Seriously gross. No pain, just gross. I soaked my feet most evenings and cut off the dead skin then as well as in the morning after my shower. I used a lot of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final impression -- yes, my feet are soft! Especially my heels. I still have some callouses on the balls of my feet, but overall, my feet feel soft. Will I buy them again? Maybe....once a year. But that $20 price tag is pretty steep, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The day I received this in the mail I tried it, it has been almost a week and my feet are the softest they have ever been!! I&#x27;ve still been soaking them every night (they started peeling after 2 days) and my feet just keep getting softer!!! I will be using this product religiously!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for fast delivery.  Good staff. Recommend</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on a Thursday with an estimated delivery date of the next Wed-Fri. I received the product on Saturday......TWO DAYS after ordering! I was so impressed with the speed of shipping! I had read many many reviews of this and similar products and decided I should prep my feet. I soaked them in hot water for 30 mins before applying the booties . I did have a little struggle opening the booties as my pair were sealed at the ankle part and I had to rip them open. The smell reminded me exactly of the solution used in chemical peels on my face, which I liked. It made me feel like these would do something to my feet. My feet aren&#x27;t horrible but I definitely have rough, dry heels and callouses on my big toes. I left the booties on for an hour and since they contain a solution and not a slippery gel, I was able to walk around. I did add a pair of thick socks over the booties to keep them snug against my feet. Once the hour was up, I removed the booties and rinsed my feet. I did add lotion to my feet every day after my shower, before I put on socks, as well as soaked my feet in hot water each night. I saw peeling after only two days! I had huge patches of peeling skin flaking off day by day. The directions said to just let it come off naturally but I peeled it anyway and there was no pain or discomfort at all, during any of the process. My feet were completely peeled by day five and I was so impressed with how soft my feet were after that I placed another order! I know some reviewers said they had less success if they were a daily shower taker and never take baths but I NEVER take baths and I still had great results.  I am so, so thrilled with the results and highly recommend Grace Foot !</li>
            <li> It did peel the outer layer of skin off my feet however it did not really improve my heel calluses which was my original purpose for buying the product. I&#x27;m still looking for a product to address that issue.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my feet felt. I play hard on my feet since I live an active lifestyle and attempting to remove well-deserved calluses is a daunting task -- a job never finished. Grace foot was so easy to use, you only have to slide your feet into the foot packs for about 2 hours then your free to go about your business. They stay in place and are completely comfortable to walk around in. My back is thanking me because I don&#x27;t have to bend over and use foot tools anymore. I&#x27;m happy I found this product and I will be purchasing them again.</li>
            <li> Your feet may look like a hot, nasty mess for a couple of weeks, but once this product is finished working its magic, you will be very pleased.  I tried Baby Foot also, and that product does not work as well.  This product is for very dry, calloused feet only.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t need a pumice stone, a foot file, or anything when you use this product. It is unbelievable. It works so well I want to buy it in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use foot files, but even the day after using a foot file, my feet would be rough like sandpaper....catching on everything.&lt;br /&gt;After using this just once, I was amazed at how my rough feet turned smooth! It&#x27;s like a \\&quot;peel\\&quot; for your feet....and I&#x27;ve never had results like this with any other foot smoothing product.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a week or so for the peeling to start, but soak your feet in warm water every evening and the dead dry skin will just slough off gently.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Have average feet and did everything by instructions. It&#x27;s been three weeks since I wore these, and there is no sign of peeling whatsoever. Not even slightest improvement. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a product that every man and woman should know about.  There is no excuse any longer to walk around with hard, cracked ugly heels.  It works exactly as the detailed instructions on the package state. Amazing, amazing product.  Buy it for your significant others, and you will not be sorry.  I am buying it for all my friends for Christmas.  I suspect the price for this great find will double in no time.  You have been warned.</li>
            <li> As usual, dont buy the &amp;#34;This is the best and the answer to all your prayers. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Poor item!!!did nothing for my feet. TOTAL waste of money!!!!! You should not be able to sell this item under false pretense.</li>
            <li> My personal experience ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just by wearing the disposable callus removing packs once and only for about 2 hours, feet are freed of callus and dryness for approximately 1.5-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is what they advertise...Once you get the package the Directions state that 2-3 application over a few months may be required if you have a larger buildup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After reading the Description...WoW...Great!  $20 I can solve my issues&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding out that I was going to need $60 worth of this product to get the type of results they advertised has me writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After emailing them about my experience, they asked if I would like another one free of charge ...Or a full refund?  I put the ball back in their court...&lt;br /&gt;asking them if it was going to take 2-3 more?  Fine send the product.&lt;br /&gt;If not please issue a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  They had decided to issue a Full refund  and this product is no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Maybe they are having the description rewritten?</li>
            <li> I am 25 yrs old with horrible callus and corns on toes... I use to wear heels daily and it has made my feet embarrassing.. I can not wear sandals and stopped wearing heels so I can correct this issue.. I have tried everything .. Everything.. And nothing has worked as well as this.. It does not take away everything in one use so I would recommend buying more than one.. I&#x27;ve struggled with this for 6 yrs so I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle.. I&#x27;m on my 2nd use and its coming along great I will continue monthly till its gone and I truly feel I&#x27;m gonna be able to wear sandals this year.</li>
            <li> Although it was kind of disgusting watching my feet peel for about a week, the end result was so worth it. My feet have never been so soft. Will definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> flaking was kinda a pain but it totally took off the top layer of dead skin.  the girl who did my pedicure said herself it worked very well.  will order it again fo sho!</li>
            <li> What a product. I work retail full time and work out and run a household, my feet are crazy,i have tried everything from creams to rechargable tools with verying degrees of success.I simply slipped these little sockie things on and put my regular socks over them and do my thing for 2 hours,rinse my feet and go about my business.after a few days the dead skin just peels off. soaking my feet does help it along. but that&#x27;s it. incredible.</li>
            <li> I have had calluses since I was 12 or so years old and like so many others have tried EVERYTHING to get rid of them. I did a web search and saw this product mentioned on a forum for dancers. I&#x27;ve seen some of those feet... I figured if it worked for them, it would work for me. I used the pack.. waited four days and saw no change at all, then by today I had actually kind of forgotten about it so hadn&#x27;t looked at my feet. My toes were a little itchy so I looked down and HOLY CRAP!!! About half of the skin on the bottom of my feet were gone. It was actually funny because for a minute I freaked out wondering what happened to my feet?!! But then my reaction change to being excited. I am staring at my foot right now and almost all the old skin is gone except for the really tough calluses on the edge of the heels but I can see that it is going to peel off too, probably will just take a couple days. So weird, but so cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: When I put on the booties I didn&#x27;t bother with the tape strips, I just slid some spa socks on right over them. Totally comfortable and kept them nice and snug against my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: That last little part of the really thick callus never did come off.. but I found something that works even better for targeted removal. The Callus Eliminator Bundle from Be Natural ($14 on amazon) and this stuff is probably enough to last me 10 years. Two drops on each heel, three minutes later I lightly rubbed with a pumice in the shower and they are 80% gone. I&#x27;ll probably still use a peel once a year a month or so before the summer so my feet are nice and fresh for sandal season, but the Callus Eliminator is definitely going to be my go to product!!</li>
            <li> The booties seemed a little weird, but other reviews were right...wait a few days and your feet will shed. It didn&#x27;t seem like the product was working after the first day or two, but then it all happened at once. It was like having newborn feet all over again! The skin peeling part was a little offsetting at first, but that quickly passed once it set in that all of the rough skin was gone!</li>
            <li> tried other items in stores and this was the best. would definately use it again. thank you very much. kim</li>
