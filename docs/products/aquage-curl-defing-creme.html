            <li>I really like this product it gives a beautiful friz free curl with incredible shine, my daughter has Shirley Temple hair and it friz&#x27;s very very easily, while this product does tend to wear out it&#x27;s claim at the end of the day, (say 10 hours) which is still a great deal of time, over all it does</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will be buying more!</li>

            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but it arrived with a crack in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for days</li>
            <li>So far, it is the best product that I have found to shape my curls instead of having a head full of frizz.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even buy mousse anymore because this stuff makes my hair super soft, not frizzy and gives me the BEST &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li>If your hair is like mine, chances are pretty good</li>
            <li>I have very natural curly hair and this product does a great job of taming the curls.  </li>
            <li>Great for keeping curls soft not crunchy.  </li>
            <li>Great for natural curls&#x3D;have used it for years.</li>
            <li>So go easy on the amount and apply evenly.</li>
            <li>The product  worked for my friend just fine .</li>
            <li>Great for those with mixed hair</li>
            <li>totally worth every penny you pay !</li>
            <li>Comparable to Aveda or B&amp;B, but definitely took some time to find the best way to use it (no other products).  </li>
            <li>It really does create more defined curls.</li>
            <li>My hair is more frizzy than curly but this product really reduces the frizz and increases the curl.  </li>
            <li>I love what this does for my naturally very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>(which I call high lights :))  </li>
            <li>For the first time I am not tied to a hair dryer and curling iron!  </li>
            <li>I have tried several of the Aquage products and all are amazing.</li>
            <li>even days later it&#x27;ll still look nice and curly.</li>
            <li>After the right hair cut you need the right product, a product that tames the friz and encourages the curl without being sticky or stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flip upright again, just kind of scrunch the curls from bottom upward, and I have ringlets all day long -</li>
            <li>First you have to have the right hair cut</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Good product for shaping and sculpting, without being too stiff.  </li>
            <li>I have alot of hair but the individual hairs are fine.</li>
            <li>But for my hair, it is an absolute dud.</li>
            <li>I gave it a real shot, used it for a while, giving it a chance.</li>
            <li>The bottle had a tape to keep it seal ;however , I guess duie to the heat of shipping it just sticked and made the bottle very sticky .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also VERY curly (corkscrew curls here).</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>Coming from someone who has tried just about every hair care product under the sun for my crazy curly hair this stuff is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have very wavy/frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is wavy and it didn&#x27;t really seem to do that much for it</li>
            <li>Even the days I was half-way satisfied with it, the next day was a complete disaster.</li>
            <li>Used without conditioner or any other post-shampoo product and it works ok.  </li>
            <li>Love other Aquage products but this doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>The Aquage product I had used before was very light and did not feel as if it weighed down my hair.  </li>
            <li>I usually use it with a mix of either Bumble and Bumble defrizz or with Momo curl defining creme but even by itself it holds curls nicely without making them crunchy or greasy.</li>
            <li>just a tiny amount is more than enough.</li>
            <li>, the curls look kinda wet (like a gelled curl) and I have to run my fingers through it to get a more natural looking curl.  </li>
            <li>I will most definitely use this product in the future</li>
            <li>Like this a lot; great for naturally curly hair to enhance the curls and only need a small amount to work through hair.</li>
            <li>Still get a little frizz on more humid days.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>, it is very very soft and natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or sticky and leaves my hair looking very natural.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have had with it is if you put to much in front or on your roots, it gives hair a greasy look.</li>
            <li>but I always had to buy it my cousin&#x27;s salon far away.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair movable and soft.</li>
            <li>i have naturally curly hair with some breakage, so my hair gets a frizzy look sometimes.  </li>
            <li>I helps my hair feel soft while managing the frizz and taming my curls.</li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair - and LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>its required small amount  of cream ( i put it on wet hair)  and when my hair gets dry looks naturally  curly for several days , very good product.</li>
            <li>I put it on my freshly washed towel dried hair-</li>
            <li>Some of my hair is naturally curly - especially underneath in the back.  </li>
            <li>I just put it in my hair, &amp;#34;define the curls&amp;#34; as I want, and let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>I just want to wash and let my hair dry naturally.</li>

            <li> It leaves your hair looking natural and not crunchy like some of the other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> and I really like it, even adds a little detangler to the hair for some reason, not much</li>
            <li> I used to straighten it but have decided to let it go natural - this allows the curl to be a little looser and hang nicer instead of having ringlets all over my head.</li>
            <li> I find I use it, then let hair dry</li>
            <li> If you put it in your hair and just let it air dry</li>
            <li> If you dry it (as directions indicate)</li>
            <li> Also works well for blow drying straight (my hair is thin, coarse, dry and prone to frizz).</li>
            <li> My hair: coarse, thick, naturally curly.</li>
            <li> put some in wet hair and let air dry.  </li>
            <li> I always use this to create curls on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> it remains looking wet and feels crunchy all day.</li>
            <li> it with other products, nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I only used a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I have to air dry my hair and when using this product my hair does not feel sticky or stiff</li>
            <li> I have natural curl and it can be very hard to tame.</li>
            <li> This product was heavy and not as I remembered.  </li>
            <li> I am still using it since it was expensive.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have very natural curly hair and this product does a great job of taming the curls.  I have to air dry my hair and when using this product my hair does not feel sticky or stiff, it is very very soft and natural.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good product for shaping and sculpting, without being too stiff.  Can be combed after hair dries for a softer look.  Also great for African-American hair that has been texturized.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping curls soft not crunchy.  It really does create more defined curls. Still get a little frizz on more humid days.  So far, it is the best product that I have found to shape my curls instead of having a head full of frizz.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me and I decided to try it out. I put it on my freshly washed towel dried hair-just a tiny amount is more than enough. It works great and brings out the best of my natural curls. The only problem I have had with it is if you put to much in front or on your roots, it gives hair a greasy look. So go easy on the amount and apply evenly.</li>
            <li> Used without conditioner or any other post-shampoo product and it works ok.  Comparable to Aveda or B&amp;B, but definitely took some time to find the best way to use it (no other products).  I find I use it, then let hair dry, the curls look kinda wet (like a gelled curl) and I have to run my fingers through it to get a more natural looking curl.  Also works well for blow drying straight (my hair is thin, coarse, dry and prone to frizz).</li>
            <li> This supposed to be curl defining cream. But I received defining cream... I am still using it since it was expensive.</li>
            <li> Love other Aquage products but this doesn&#x27;t work as well. I bought this product based on  the reviews and this sounded like the perfect product, but didn&#x27;t worked as well as stated.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it gives a beautiful friz free curl with incredible shine, my daughter has Shirley Temple hair and it friz&#x27;s very very easily, while this product does tend to wear out it&#x27;s claim at the end of the day, (say 10 hours) which is still a great deal of time, over all it does it&#x27;s job and I really like it, even adds a little detangler to the hair for some reason, not much but still it helps. Overall I rate this at 5 star product.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair - and LOVE this product.  (I have also tried Aquage&#x27;s Illuminating Gelade, and also like it - but the Curl Defining Creme is my favorite.)&lt;br /&gt;When I step out of the shower, I towel-dry my hair so it&#x27;s damp, comb it with my fingers, then put maybe a nickel-sized amount in my palm.  Rub my palms together, flip my hair and comb it through my hair while my head is upside-down.  Flip upright again, just kind of scrunch the curls from bottom upward, and I have ringlets all day long - but you can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;ve used any styling product.  Like another reviewer said, it&#x27;s truly touchable.&lt;br /&gt;Really, a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> My hair: coarse, thick, naturally curly. Lives in coastal SC, humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;I can see the potential for the product to work for someone that does not have coarse hair. But for my hair, it is an absolute dud. For me, it offered no curl or frizz control, no shine. I tried it alone, tried different amounts, combo&#x27;d it with other products, nothing worked. I gave it a real shot, used it for a while, giving it a chance. Even the days I was half-way satisfied with it, the next day was a complete disaster. No lasting hold. If your hair is like mine, chances are pretty good you should move on to something else. Otherwise, this may work for you.</li>
            <li> My hair is more frizzy than curly but this product really reduces the frizz and increases the curl.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this before but I always had to buy it my cousin&#x27;s salon far away.  I was happy I could order it on line.</li>
            <li> Great for those with mixed hair</li>
            <li> holds up well in all types of weather, especially rainy and humid.  I just put it in my hair, &amp;#34;define the curls&amp;#34; as I want, and let it dry naturally.  For the first time I am not tied to a hair dryer and curling iron!  I have tried several of the Aquage products and all are amazing.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit, and it goes along way, even days later it&#x27;ll still look nice and curly.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair movable and soft.</li>
            <li> I always use this to create curls on wet hair.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great for natural curls&#x3D;have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I love what this does for my naturally very curly hair.  I used to straighten it but have decided to let it go natural - this allows the curl to be a little looser and hang nicer instead of having ringlets all over my head.</li>
            <li> The bottle had a tape to keep it seal ;however , I guess duie to the heat of shipping it just sticked and made the bottle very sticky . The product  worked for my friend just fine . i would just reccomend  finding a different sealer. Thank you</li>
            <li> I starting using this recently - after getting layers cut into my shoulder length hair.  I have thick blonde fluffy hair - with gray coming in - mostly in the front. (which I call high lights :))  Some of my hair is naturally curly - especially underneath in the back.  My hair dresser said I could go without blow drying - and just put Aquage in my hair.  (I could use defuser to quicken drying).  Wow!  My hair is full of nice curls everywhere!  Looks like a beautiful perm :)  I love it!  So - that&#x27;s my experience.  - age -64</li>
            <li> i have naturally curly hair with some breakage, so my hair gets a frizzy look sometimes.  this product is great!!  put some in wet hair and let air dry.  curls look so good</li>
            <li> I have natural curl and it can be very hard to tame. First you have to have the right hair cut but that is not enough. After the right hair cut you need the right product, a product that tames the friz and encourages the curl without being sticky or stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is so perfect I&#x27;ve been using it for years and when my hairdresser stopped carrying it I did a search online and found it. Thank goodness!</li>
            <li> This was an impressive, and great, product and what I expected when I place the order! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it arrived with a crack in the bottle.  The company offered a replacement if I sent it back, but I&#x27;d rather avoid the hassle and just deal with it even though I lose product out of the hole every time I use it.  I will most definitely use this product in the future but I probably won&#x27;t buy it online.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find Detailing Cream so I bought this. Totally wrong product for my hair. Has no &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; to it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is great! I usually use it with a mix of either Bumble and Bumble defrizz or with Momo curl defining creme but even by itself it holds curls nicely without making them crunchy or greasy. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have alot of hair but the individual hairs are fine. It&#x27;s also VERY curly (corkscrew curls here). My hairdresser told me this product is the answer to my nightmares of frizz and curl separation etc.  Not so much. If you put it in your hair and just let it air dry it remains looking wet and feels crunchy all day. If you dry it (as directions indicate) your hair is a pile of frizzed out hay. So dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Coming from someone who has tried just about every hair care product under the sun for my crazy curly hair this stuff is wonderful. I helps my hair feel soft while managing the frizz and taming my curls. It leaves your hair looking natural and not crunchy like some of the other products I have tried. Plus it smells great! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have very wavy/frizzy hair.  After scrunching this cream into still damp hair it immediately defines my waves and manages the frizz.  It&#x27;s not heavy or sticky and leaves my hair looking very natural.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> i had been looking  for almost 2 years for a muse that would work for my hair( my hair is permed)  and finally found it !  does not make your hair  tangle, look oily or anything like that. its required small amount  of cream ( i put it on wet hair)  and when my hair gets dry looks naturally  curly for several days , very good product. i would say its the best stuff ! totally worth every penny you pay !</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and it didn&#x27;t really seem to do that much for it but it did hold up to the claim of not making my hair sticky or crunchy. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair does not get as curly as I&#x27;d expect versus when I use the TGI &amp;#34;foxy curls&amp;#34;. This one does seem to get my hair smoother though.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a while and it hasn&#x27;t lost its ability to make my curly permed hair look great.</li>
            <li> This product was heavy and not as I remembered.  I may have ordered the wrong one.  The Aquage product I had used before was very light and did not feel as if it weighed down my hair.  I only used a small amount.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try using a pea-sized amount.</li>
            <li> Works great on curly hair, the best I have found for your hair</li>
            <li> Like this a lot; great for naturally curly hair to enhance the curls and only need a small amount to work through hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product for days I just want to wash and let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using anything on my hair, but you never know this product is there. It just really helps define the curls without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time in the larger bottle. This size was great for travel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years and I&#x27;m so glad I found it to buy online!!!!! I don&#x27;t even buy mousse anymore because this stuff makes my hair super soft, not frizzy and gives me the BEST &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34;!!! I love this stuff and will be buying more!</li>
