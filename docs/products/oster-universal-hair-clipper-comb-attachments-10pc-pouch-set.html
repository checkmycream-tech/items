            <li>Works well and does a very nice job.</li>
            <li>Have cut my own hair for 30 years and this has greatly simplified the process.</li>
            <li>They fit my 76 perfectly ...</li>
            <li>They glide nicely through the hair and don&#x27;t get clogged or tangled.  </li>
            <li>so I can keep them tidy in my grooming tote.</li>
            <li>This set is a real Oster product and it fits the Model 25 perfectly.  </li>
            <li>nice clippers</li>
            <li>work great, get a #1 clipper, a set of these and your good to go for a large range of cuts.</li>
            <li>These combs easily attach to my Oster clipper and come in a handy storage bag.  </li>
            <li>Love this clipper.</li>
            <li>Had an Oster model 25 that I acquired back in the &#x27;70s that works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would have been better if they had a variety of packs where you could choose the combs</li>
            <li>Love these attachments.</li>
            <li>The bag is nice, but I make sure to clean the combs</li>
            <li>Easy to use once you figure out</li>
            <li>Easy to use lots of sizes</li>
            <li>Easy to snap on and off.</li>
            <li>Nice item exactly as described.....</li>
            <li>Heads clip on quite securely.  </li>
            <li>A drop of light oil might help until you get used to them.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t fit the oster 76</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy on and off.</li>
            <li>They fit the Fast Feed, but</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Love the ranges of sizes that are offered and so far they work very well.  </li>
            <li>tricky at first to figure out how they go one.  </li>
            <li>With so many hair clipper comb attachments, my only problem now is deciding what length to cut my lynx&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>For the most part, I keep my hair relatively close cropped, so don&#x27;t use the large combs.  </li>
            <li>variety of comb lengths permits a pretty good selection for different lengths of hair on different parts of the head, and hair styling for the do-it-yourselfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality is first rate, and they seem very well made.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, works great, this is not original item but work properly with our hair cutters machine, work with with price</li>
            <li>Very cost effiecient.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery and as advertised</li>
            <li>The bag they come in is throw away but wasn&#x27;t expecting much from it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe Oster doesn&#x27;t make any that fit these clippers properly.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Got this for my Oster Classic.</li>
            <li>Only negative is the larger sizes have metal clips that don&#x27;t align to any kind of grove or indent on the clippers and most times they wedge between metal plates on the clipper.  </li>
            <li>so it would have been nice if Oster included \\&quot;all\\&quot; common sizes in the package.</li>
            <li>The retention clips are strong and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re most likely to use, though, since I have a big collection of combs, but only use about three or four of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>barely and it&#x27;s a real pain getting them on and off.  </li>
            <li>Combs go on the A5 easily and stay on firmly.  </li>
            <li>They are well made and snap on and off easily and stay on firmly...</li>
            <li>I am suprised at how well these work and how much they saved me from buying different blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I DO miss, however, is a tapered comb that I had on another (considerably cheaper) clipper brand.  </li>
            <li>These arrived quickly, initially I was please, but after having used them a few times it is clear that these are cheaply built.</li>
            <li>That one had one side of the comb with long tines, tapering to short tines on the other side - so that one could easily do a tapered cut around the ears.  </li>
            <li>The tips are a little sharp, but otherwise they work just fine.</li>
            <li>The spring clips on these clipper combs are sort of stiff at first, but after you flex them some they snap on like</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These work great.  I just got them and I used them for clipping my Pom/Chi.  I used my Oster Turbo A5 with a #10 blade.  I used a #3 on his body, #4 on his tail and neck ruff.  Combs go on the A5 easily and stay on firmly.  They glide nicely through the hair and don&#x27;t get clogged or tangled.  I like that they come with the pouch so I can keep them tidy in my grooming tote.</li>
            <li> Love the ranges of sizes that are offered and so far they work very well.  Only negative is the larger sizes have metal clips that don&#x27;t align to any kind of grove or indent on the clippers and most times they wedge between metal plates on the clipper.  But they seem to work and stay on.</li>
            <li> Bought these to clip my poodle (nothing fancy, just an all over puppy cut).  They were just not sturdy enough for the job, and caught in her hair.  Maybe not the product&#x27;s problem - should have gotten metal combs.</li>
            <li> Product was great. Amazon&#x27;s shipping policy leaves something to be desired. Product was placed in holding to be shipped later as we choose for \\&quot;free\\&quot; shipping. Waited ten days for no reason. Received tracking number and item was not let for shipping. Appeared to be method of \\&quot;selling\\&quot; us on paid shipping method next time. BAD POLICY</li>
            <li> I give my Bichon haircuts, inbetween grooming to cut costs and these attachments work great.  tricky at first to figure out how they go one.  Easy to use once you figure out how.  Very cost effiecient.  Also purchased the Oster Clipper from Amazon.  Works well and does a very nice job.</li>
            <li> fast delivery and as advertised</li>
            <li> I did not like them, I was expecting something completely different.They interfere with my oster clipper and 76er. Not fond of what I received.</li>
            <li> Love this clipper. Have cut my own hair for 30 years and this has greatly simplified the process. Clip on the 3/4 inch attachment and zip my entire head and I&#x27;m done. Did have to buy an extra attachment set to get all the sizes I wanted so it would have been nice if Oster included \\&quot;all\\&quot; common sizes in the package. Only real complaint is the cord is heavy and stiff. Constanly have to keep straightening it out or it gets hung up and catches on everything.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  Heads clip on quite securely.  Well made.  Five stars!  What else is there to say. The end.</li>
            <li> I am suprised at how well these work and how much they saved me from buying different blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: They are solid, hold tight, haven&#x27;t ever slipped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: The bag they come in is throw away but wasn&#x27;t expecting much from it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work great, get a #1 clipper, a set of these and your good to go for a large range of cuts.</li>
            <li> These combs easily attach to my Oster clipper and come in a handy storage bag.  With 10 different sizes, you can get just the length you need.</li>
            <li> The spring clips on these clipper combs are sort of stiff at first, but after you flex them some they snap on like they mean it and they do mean it. A drop of light oil might help until you get used to them. This matters to me because I had the comb of a competitor&#x27;s clipper fall off just as it reached my head and wound up having to go cueball until the next cut.   The points are contoured enough so that they won&#x27;t snag on my naps and the long ones are long enough to even-out my Natural without cutting it too short. I would prefer to replace a  couple of the intermediate sizes with some taper combs, which this set does not include. The bag is nice, but I make sure to clean the combs well so the bag doesn&#x27;t collect clippings.</li>
            <li> Just acquired a small herd of puppies that need grooming.  Had an Oster model 25 that I acquired back in the &#x27;70s that works perfectly.  But I needed combs.  This set is a real Oster product and it fits the Model 25 perfectly.  Great Price too!</li>
            <li> I bought this set to go with an Oster clipper, and have been happy with the variety of combs. For the most part, I keep my hair relatively close cropped, so don&#x27;t use the large combs.  What I DO miss, however, is a tapered comb that I had on another (considerably cheaper) clipper brand.  That one had one side of the comb with long tines, tapering to short tines on the other side - so that one could easily do a tapered cut around the ears.  The absence of those combs, for me, is the one shortcoming of this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than simply sliding on, these combs are spring-loaded, so you need to pull them on by hooking the clips at the base against the clipper head, and pulling the plastic comb up, over the cutting edge of the clipper.  Simple, once you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variety of comb lengths permits a pretty good selection for different lengths of hair on different parts of the head, and hair styling for the do-it-yourselfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have been better if they had a variety of packs where you could choose the combs you&#x27;re most likely to use, though, since I have a big collection of combs, but only use about three or four of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is first rate, and they seem very well made.  I suspect that these will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> They fit the Fast Feed, but barely and it&#x27;s a real pain getting them on and off.  I can&#x27;t believe Oster doesn&#x27;t make any that fit these clippers properly.  The sliding mechanism that grips the clippers bends when sliding on and causes it to stick.  I lift weights, but have trouble getting these on.</li>
            <li> With so many hair clipper comb attachments, my only problem now is deciding what length to cut my lynx&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly, initially I was please, but after having used them a few times it is clear that these are cheaply built. I can&#x27;t imagine these things lasting very long. They work, but only just. The spring loaded piece that hold these attachments to the back of the blades is an obvious weak point. I can&#x27;t recommend purchasing these.</li>
            <li> They fit my 76 perfectly ... They are well made and snap on and off easily and stay on firmly...</li>
            <li> Easy to use lots of sizes</li>
            <li> The tips are a little sharp, but otherwise they work just fine. The retention clips are strong and will last a long time. Got this for my Oster Classic.</li>
            <li> Nice item exactly as described.....Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks, works great, this is not original item but work properly with our hair cutters machine, work with with price</li>
            <li> This item never arrived, my account was to be reimbursed.  was hoping to have this to replace the broken ones in my set.</li>
            <li> The sliding attachment parts do not slide easily and are a little difficult to attach.</li>
            <li> Worked great with my Oster hair clipper.  I use them every time I use my Oster hair clippers.  Easy to snap on and off.</li>
            <li> nice clippers but they don&#x27;t fit the oster 76</li>
            <li> Love these attachments. Quick and easy on and off. Easy to clean and maintain. Could find them at the hair show, but I got them here. Came ahead of schedule.</li>
