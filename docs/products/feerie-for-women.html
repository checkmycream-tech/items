            <li>Quick arrival.</li>
            <li>, I was pretty confident that the scent was going to work on me after looking at what the top, middle and bottom notes were, and it did.</li>

            <li>It was supposed to be a nice gift, but now with the cap broken</li>
            <li>I was expecting something thick and floral, but for me this perfume is actually rather light and mysterious.  </li>

            <li> I bought this Parfum for my wife for a Christmas gift. I got it super fast, and she loved it! We had been to Nieman Marcus a few days before I bought it here and it was $170 for 1 ounce. I got 3.3 for less than 1/2 of that price. Thank you!</li>

            <li> I love the perfume. It was shipped very quickly. Very satisfied.  I want to get other fragrances from Perfufu. The price was unbeatable! !!</li>
            <li> This Christmas my daughter and I were trying to decide which perfumes we were going to try this year and we are both very satisfied that we ordered Van Cleef &amp; Arpels.  The bottle itself sold me, but when I sprayed it on wow what a great smell. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just lovely. Quick arrival.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous bottle! Perfume smells good, but not for me. I feel silly for saying this, but, I bought the bottle and hoped the perfume was to my liking. I found that it had too much of a spicy undertone for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and scrumptious perfume. The bottle itself is of course beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have worn this for years and get compliments every day. It is so fresh and feminine without smelling like a vanilla/cotton candy factory.</li>
            <li> Nice lite scent. I really love the cute bottle and leave it out on the counter to see. Price was really good would buy again.</li>

            <li> Came fast and as described. The bottle is beautiful, I would recommend to every anyone, the scent is great for spring and summer, nice and light. Have had many complments.</li>
            <li> The bottle is beautiful, very pretty, on my vanity!  The scent is nice and light will be a good one for spring and summer.  Good addition to my perfume  collection.  I do have to admit I did buy it for the bottle, I was pretty confident that the scent was going to work on me after looking at what the top, middle and bottom notes were, and it did.</li>
            <li> never hear about this , but mi mother love this lotion, and now everybody ask about the smell i like</li>
            <li> I loved it!!! fast delivery!! good packaging!! and good price My husband loved it</li>
            <li> This was for my child&#x27;s bday and she loved it</li>
            <li> I bought this product from amazon. First when I received it was making some weird noise like if it had different parts, to my surprise, when I opened the packaging box, it was poorly enveloped in just paper, which is weird when sending fragile things like a perfume, My boyfriend and I are used to buy perfumes on Amazon.com and they have always been wrapped with bubbles to avoid any damage to the bottle, this wasn&#x27;t the case this time. Finally when I opened the perfume box, the cap of the bottle was floating around and the supposedly beautiful cap that is part of the charm of this perfume was broken in two pieces. It was supposed to be a nice gift, but now with the cap broken it just looks like any other perfume bottle and give the feeling of dissappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume smells nice, it seems to be the real deal, but it&#x27;s a bad experience to know that Amazon.com packaging and handling is of so poor quality when dealing with so obvious fragile merchandise like a perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the grade is due to the packaging and handling.</li>

            <li> It was delivered on time and in perfect condition. Saved so much money, will reorder.</li>
            <li> Terrific deal on a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle!  the fragrance is not my favorite but the bottom notes are really nice.</li>
