            <li>Great size, smell, and price.</li>
            <li>I got the Cologne 4 or 5 years ago and loved it.</li>

            <li>and also one I get most compliments on) and</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to find it since it is all my husband likes to wear.</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>My favorite curve scent.</li>
            <li>Was not at all pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>It has a great mixture of sweet and masculine scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet smelling, but feels more manly when I use it compared to the original.</li>
            <li>This smells good but like an old fasioned shaving cream or aftershave smell.</li>
            <li>Smells great and the scent doesn&#x27;t fade like some other colognesz</li>
            <li>I love all of the Curve scents I have purchased so far.</li>
            <li>Smell is great but not strong!</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;m excited to try this new fragrance out.</li>
            <li>Pretty packaging.</li>
            <li>this is like a sweeter version of that which is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only fond of the original scent and was disappointed in the others, but when I tried this I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>It has enough sweetness to not be overbearing while at work and enough masculinity to be able to attract the opposite sex.</li>
            <li>Would not order it again online unless directly from Liz Claiborne.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have the peppery smell that immediately turns me off of certain colognes.</li>

            <li> Smells great. Pretty packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a Curve cologne to wear at work for management and I think I&#x27;ve found the perfect one. It has a great mixture of sweet and masculine scents. As soon as I opened the package and sprayed the bottle I instantly said \\&quot;This is it.\\&quot; I&#x27;m excited to try this new fragrance out. It has enough sweetness to not be overbearing while at work and enough masculinity to be able to attract the opposite sex. I have Curve Connect which in my opinion is the best smelling Curve yet (and also one I get most compliments on) and this is like a sweeter version of that which is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> Great size, smell, and price. Bah!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product</li>
            <li> Great price and quick service. Glad I was able to find it since it is all my husband likes to wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I&#x27;m only fond of the original scent and was disappointed in the others, but when I tried this I was very impressed. It&#x27;s sweet smelling, but feels more manly when I use it compared to the original. It also doesn&#x27;t have the peppery smell that immediately turns me off of certain colognes. Buy it for your husband or boyfriend ladies, I guarantee you will like it, or if you are a man buy it for yourself you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Smell is great but not strong!</li>
            <li> I love all of the Curve scents I have purchased so far. Hadn&#x27;t had this one in a while. I currently have 6 varieties on the counter. I always get compliments on how I smell.</li>
            <li> My favorite curve scent. Smells great and the scent doesn&#x27;t fade like some other colognesz</li>
            <li> Everything was satisfactory</li>
            <li> I am a fan of curve and even some of the other curve scents. This is not one of them. It smells too musky.</li>
            <li> Was not at all pleased with this purchase.  When comparing it to the one I purchased from a department store/fragrance department, it looked like this one was a knock off.  Bottle was different. It was a gift for my son and he and his wife both even said the fragrance was not the same. Would not order it again online unless directly from Liz Claiborne.</li>
            <li> This smells good but like an old fasioned shaving cream or aftershave smell. I gave it away</li>
            <li> Always get compliments.</li>
            <li> I got the Cologne 4 or 5 years ago and loved it. So, I bought it again, and it smells completely different. As in not good. Disappointed.</li>
