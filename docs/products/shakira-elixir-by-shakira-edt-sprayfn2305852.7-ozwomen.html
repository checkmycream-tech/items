            <li> I love the scent! It&#x27;s so feminine..... Not too heavy..... I get so many compliments on it.  The price I was able to get was terrific also!</li>
            <li> Not my go to perfume but I do like it. It reminds me of that \\&quot;angels\\&quot; perfume from Victoria secret but with a tiny tiny Tiny last hidden hint of some type of sweet. Its not the main note but after a wiff that will be the last quick thing that hits you. Is a small kiss of something sweet. If you&#x27;re looking for something more woman, not sweet don&#x27;t let this review scare you off because that&#x27;s exactly what it is. Its a woman flower scent. I had smelled this at the store and decided to add it to my amazon list, somebody nice had brought this for me. I am a little perfume collector and this is the perfume ill be going to when I am doing business. This is not a party perfume. recommended for older mature ladies.</li>
