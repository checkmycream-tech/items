            <li>and it should work perfectly?</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and faster than others LED Lamps.</li>
            <li>It works great!</li>
            <li>This is the greatest at home LED lamp!  </li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for my daughter and she is happy with it.</li>
            <li>After some research I learned that not all polished can be cured by led and that most polishes need at lest 24watt for best curing.</li>
            <li>This product works phenomenally!</li>
            <li>but it works with most gel color brands!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>Looking for another lamp with more wattage.</li>
            <li>I made sure that they were gel polishes that were</li>
            <li>Love love love this lamp.</li>
            <li>Awesome little lamp.</li>
            <li>I bought a salon quality 36 watts UV light on OfferUp</li>
            <li>Do not buy this cheap product.</li>
            <li>The light runs on a motion sensor, so when your fingers are still, the light goes off</li>
            <li>I was looking for a decent, cost effective lamp to save some money on manicures.  </li>
            <li>I have the lamp from the original kit.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Ok everyone said this worked....not so much.</li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t read enough good reviews to buy the polish</li>
            <li>Then I tried my sisters dashing diva LED lamp using all the same steps and my nails looked amazing just like they would on my clients at work.</li>
            <li>Just get the right polish type.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it had a 2 minute timer option as well, but again, I think my nails weren&#x27;t drying fast because of the cheap Chinese polish LOL.</li>
            <li>Although I bought it after hearing good reviews about it and was told to &amp;#34;not waste my money&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Anyway, this little LED lamp is perfect and works just as expected.</li>
            <li>Enough room to fit all 5 fingers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this nail dryer!</li>
            <li>Fast.</li>
            <li>well I tried this whole routine again, and it did not make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend 100%</li>
            <li>Very good product but taje care is a little small ..</li>
            <li>I tried time and again, adding time to my drying time, putting my fingers back in the lamp hoping that just one more minute would eventually dry up the polish.  </li>
            <li>The filing, the cleaning the wiping, and light coats of primer and polish- nails still did not dry after 20 minutes of putting my fingers back under the lamp.  </li>
            <li>Bought used but content looked new.</li>
            <li>and you have to constantly wiggle them to get the light to come back on.</li>
            <li>Make sure to cure for at least 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>My nails still never dried, and I did every step.  </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as some of the other professional lamps.</li>
            <li>I simply put my big toes in first (one at a time)</li>
            <li>You can do as many layers as you would like, just keep them thin</li>
            <li>When I tried it, my nail polish would not dry.  </li>

Enough room to fit all 5 fingers. My only wish is that it had a 2 minute timer option as well, but again, I think my nails weren&#x27;t drying fast because of the cheap Chinese polish LOL.

            <li> I have the lamp from the original kit. I had no difficulty using this for my feet. I simply put my big toes in first (one at a time) and then there is no issue for the other toes. I simply keep the big toe out while the others are curing. I wear size 10 shoes.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Fast. 60 second tops. Just get the right polish type.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as some of the other professional lamps. Make sure to cure for at least 3 minutes. Also have to do thumb separately.</li>
            <li> Ok everyone said this worked....not so much. Wouldn&#x27;t cure and I had done a lot of research so that I could do a home shellac manicure. It didn&#x27;t cure because it is only 4.5 watts!!! That&#x27;s a joke. Like JOKE when salons use 36 watts. I bought a salon quality 36 watts UV light on OfferUp and I&#x27;m satisfied. I didn&#x27;t use the SensatioNail polish. Maybe that had something to do with it but i didn&#x27;t read enough good reviews to buy the polish</li>
            <li> This lamp sucks. I used to work at a salon, did shellac on our clients and never had an issue. Bought this lamp used CND shellac polish with it and did every step we would do at work. Went to wipe it off with NAS 99 and it looked like crap!!! It took the color off, and dulled it out. It wasn&#x27;t shiny and looked awful. Then I tried my sisters dashing diva LED lamp using all the same steps and my nails looked amazing just like they would on my clients at work.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of my money doesn&#x27;t even work. I would return it if it was possible. Totally disappointed. I wouldn&#x27;t give it a star if at all possible</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter and she is happy with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a starter kit. Followed the instructions but used a different brand polish. Nothing cured - it was sticky even cured for 120s but still sticky. After some research I learned that not all polished can be cured by led and that most polishes need at lest 24watt for best curing. Looking for another lamp with more wattage.</li>
            <li> Works like it describes!! Bought used but content looked new. If you looking to cut cost on going to spa to pay $26 for only pedicure, I would suggest get your LED lamp and do it yourself save the money. I would recommend this product. Shipping also arrived as estimated.</li>
            <li> This product works phenomenally! For those of you having trouble, my suggestion is try doing really thin layers. The first two times I painted on the  base and polish as I would normally and each nail ended up peeling off entirely the next day. You can do as many layers as you would like, just keep them thin and it should work perfectly?</li>
            <li> Awesome little lamp. Cures my gel polish in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Very good product but taje care is a little small ..</li>
            <li> I was looking for a decent, cost effective lamp to save some money on manicures.  This lamp was NOT GOOD.  Although I bought it after hearing good reviews about it and was told to &amp;#34;not waste my money&amp;#34; on more expensive lamps, to my disappointment, it did not work well at all.  When I tried it, my nail polish would not dry.  I tried time and again, adding time to my drying time, putting my fingers back in the lamp hoping that just one more minute would eventually dry up the polish.  Nope.  So, I thought, maybe it was the polish?  So I went ahead and bought a few different nail polishes of a different brand, (I made sure that they were gel polishes that were LED compatible- and those get expensive!)- well I tried this whole routine again, and it did not make a difference.  My nails still never dried, and I did every step.  The filing, the cleaning the wiping, and light coats of primer and polish- nails still did not dry after 20 minutes of putting my fingers back under the lamp.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Do not buy this cheap product.</li>
            <li> The light runs on a motion sensor, so when your fingers are still, the light goes off and you have to constantly wiggle them to get the light to come back on.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and faster than others LED Lamps. Highly recommend 100%</li>
            <li> Works for a vert short time even when replaced</li>
            <li> Love love love this lamp. It works great! All 5 finger nails can be dried at once.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest at home LED lamp!  It was just what I was looking for in a lamp!</li>
            <li> This works I used it with gelish but it works with most gel color brands! Totally worth it!</li>
