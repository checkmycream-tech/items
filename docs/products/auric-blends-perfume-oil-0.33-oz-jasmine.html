    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I had some concern during the warm months of the year that the product might arrive a bit &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; in scent, but I&#x27;ve always had excellent bottles</li>
            <li>I heard Jasmine was a very good scent for depression, stress, and that kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as listed, great price, and a wonderful smell :)</li>
            <li>Would be getting more!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Nice smell not overpowering.</li>
            <li>When I tried this at the store I really liked it so of course bought it.  </li>
            <li>She was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>It also works nicely with Sandalwood Vanilla and Love, but also with just a dab.</li>
            <li>Now that is fantastic jasmine!</li>
            <li>Smell the sandalwood more</li>
            <li>Egyptian Goddess is my favorite</li>
            <li>When the package arrived, it was clad in bubble wrap along with a free box of incense cones (my dad was thrilled), but the container somehow leaked during transport, and just reeked.</li>
            <li>This is a sexy scent I found 12+ years ago.</li>
            <li>I love how it implants</li>
            <li>Perfect for a light scented perfume on the wrists or any other use you may find for a scented oil.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the scent but wish it would stay longer.</li>
            <li>The jasmine scent isn&#x27;t that strong but still smells good, with a hint of vanilla actually.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to add another to my variety of perfume oils.  </li>
            <li>Comes in a super convenient small bottle with rolling applicator, perfect for bringing with you and freshening up on the go.</li>
            <li>This perfume is good for the low price.</li>
            <li>quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a very nice fragrance and extremely affordable.</li>
            <li>Sun&#x27;s Eye Herbal Essentials offers a fantastic jasmine rose option at an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Perfectly balanced, long lasting jasmine scent.</li>
            <li>Worth buying</li>
            <li>Roll on perfume allows just the right amount of perfume to be applied, rather than relying on spraying bottle that often overkills.</li>
            <li>but if you really want a strong jasmine scent I would recommend looking for a more pure jasmine essential oil.</li>
            <li>And very very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very synthetic!</li>
            <li>and I refused to mix anything with it before because it is magical all by itself, but mixed with this</li>
            <li>Well actually, its a pretty overwhelming smell, but it doesn&#x27;t register as Jasmine to me.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like Jasmine.</li>
            <li>My dad (who is in his 60s, and who&#x27;s senses aren&#x27;t as sharp as they used to be) thinks it smells amazing</li>
            <li>However, I find it to be a bit strong, but I still wear it occasionally.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong and last all day.</li>
            <li>Very summery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly the only perfume I enjoy wearing.</li>
            <li>The price is right, doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Gave this particular perfume to a friend since she wanted a scent of Jasmine.</li>
            <li>It is so strong, and doesn&#x27;t last very long by itself.</li>
            <li>Smelled like my grandma xP old and musty.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Jasmine scent because I wanted to try something new (my signature smell is \\&quot;Aphrodesia\\&quot; by Song of India), but I&#x27;m totally underwhelmed by the smell.</li>
            <li>A little strong and musky, but after a while the smell tones down.</li>

            <li> (I think it makes me smell like a hotel bathroom (y&#x27;know that generic soap/air freshener smell?)), but my boyfriend (who is a big fan of my usual scented oil) can&#x27;t seem to smell it at all, so I&#x27;m quite dumbfounded.</li>

            <li> It always goes on nicely with the little roller and maintains its fragrance without turning bad.</li>

            <li> it enhances the EG and tones this down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to nail a true jasmine scent, and Auric Blends fails to measure up.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like a heavy smell, and also feeling sticky on my skin.</li>
            <li> I mean a dab of Jasime...</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m gonna get this again, and I feel bad, but I&#x27;ve considered never purchasing from this brand again.</li>

            <li> When I put it on, I kept forgetting, and so would periodically wonder what the terrible smell was.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very synthetic! It&#x27;s very hard to nail a true jasmine scent, and Auric Blends fails to measure up. Since ordering this roll-on, I have discovered a jasmine scent named \\&quot;Zen\\&quot; by Indikah. Now that is fantastic jasmine!</li>
            <li> Nice smell not overpowering. The jasmine smell I was looking for is not sttong enough. Smell the sandalwood more</li>
            <li> This perfume is good for the low price. And very very fast shipping. I got it only two days after ordering, even before the items that I ordered the same day with prime 2-day shipping.Comes in a super convenient small bottle with rolling applicator, perfect for bringing with you and freshening up on the go. The jasmine scent isn&#x27;t that strong but still smells good, with a hint of vanilla actually. Very summery. Worth buying but if you really want a strong jasmine scent I would recommend looking for a more pure jasmine essential oil. Sun&#x27;s Eye Herbal Essentials offers a fantastic jasmine rose option at an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this.  It actually stinks.  I don&#x27;t smell Jasmine at all, unless Jasmine is a sweaty hippie.  Gross.</li>
            <li> When I tried this at the store I really liked it so of course bought it.  I&#x27;m addicted to Auric Blends fragrance so I was excited to add another to my variety of perfume oils.  When I got home however, I started to get a headache and I realized that it was the Jasmine oil.  It is so strong, and doesn&#x27;t last very long by itself. I started to experiment mixing it with some of the other ones I have.  Egyptian Goddess is my favorite and I refused to mix anything with it before because it is magical all by itself, but mixed with this it enhances the EG and tones this down.  I mean a dab of Jasime...like 6 parts Egyptian Goddess one part Jasmine otherwise it overpowers.  The way that combination mixes with my body it smells alot like Chanel No 5. Recreation of a $100 perfume for 14 dollars, can&#x27;t argue with that...It also works nicely with Sandalwood Vanilla and Love, but also with just a dab.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like a heavy smell, and also feeling sticky on my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Jasmine scent because I wanted to try something new (my signature smell is \\&quot;Aphrodesia\\&quot; by Song of India), but I&#x27;m totally underwhelmed by the smell. Well actually, its a pretty overwhelming smell, but it doesn&#x27;t register as Jasmine to me. My dad (who is in his 60s, and who&#x27;s senses aren&#x27;t as sharp as they used to be) thinks it smells amazing (I think it makes me smell like a hotel bathroom (y&#x27;know that generic soap/air freshener smell?)), but my boyfriend (who is a big fan of my usual scented oil) can&#x27;t seem to smell it at all, so I&#x27;m quite dumbfounded. When the package arrived, it was clad in bubble wrap along with a free box of incense cones (my dad was thrilled), but the container somehow leaked during transport, and just reeked. I had to wash my hands several times to get the smell off them. When I put it on, I kept forgetting, and so would periodically wonder what the terrible smell was. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m gonna get this again, and I feel bad, but I&#x27;ve considered never purchasing from this brand again. Perhaps I&#x27;m just a Song of India gal through and through...</li>
            <li> Smelled like my grandma xP old and musty. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this, unless its for someone you don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Exactly as listed, great price, and a wonderful smell :) Perfect for a light scented perfume on the wrists or any other use you may find for a scented oil.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the scent but wish it would stay longer. I have trouble with fragrances being long lasting. They seem to&lt;br /&gt;fade quickly. I have to say that roll on essentials oils last longer than others.  Gave this particular perfume to a friend since she wanted a scent of Jasmine. She was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered on time and was as described.  However, I find it to be a bit strong, but I still wear it occasionally.</li>
            <li> This is a sexy scent I found 12+ years ago. I love how it implants it&#x27;s essence on the mind. It&#x27;s truly the only perfume I enjoy wearing.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like Jasmine. Would be getting more! And already got asked what smell I was wearing. Would recommend to all</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and last all day. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. The price is right, doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin. A little strong and musky, but after a while the smell tones down.</li>
            <li> I heard Jasmine was a very good scent for depression, stress, and that kind of thing.  I will wear it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this jasmine perfume oil for some years now and have been just recently purchasing it through Amazon this last year. I had some concern during the warm months of the year that the product might arrive a bit &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; in scent, but I&#x27;ve always had excellent bottles delivered.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very nice fragrance and extremely affordable. It always goes on nicely with the little roller and maintains its fragrance without turning bad.</li>
            <li> Perfectly balanced, long lasting jasmine scent. Roll on perfume allows just the right amount of perfume to be applied, rather than relying on spraying bottle that often overkills. Would definitely  purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t like the smell... Smells nothing like the jasmine smell that I like...</li>
