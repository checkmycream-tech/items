            <li>and it is amazing on tangles!!</li>
            <li>However, Amazon.com was very good about refunding me</li>
            <li>On the good side, exchange with company was flawless, though.</li>
            <li>IntraKera is a great leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to see I can get it through Amazon.  </li>

            <li>I also noticed while on vacation that it tamed fly aways in humid weather.</li>
            <li>Works great for conditioning your hair........</li>

            <li>I am not the one that uses it, but I think she says it is good stuff,  If she is happy.</li>
            <li>Buying it here at Amazon is the best price and with the 1 litre bottle, and dividing it between three people, it still lasts for six months or more.</li>

            <li>handled as agreed and love my IntraKera!</li>
            <li>People are always commenting on how nice and healthy my hair looks!</li>
            <li>what I do know is that when I skip the step [running a dime-sized dab through semi-wet hair], my hair does not style as well, and in fact, looks kind of flyaway and then flattens out.  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY THE BEST FOR YOUR HAIR!!</li>
            <li>and I really liked that I could purchase a salon-sized bottle at the price I paid.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the BEST stuff on the market for curly hair.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best leave-in conditioner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>A great value for the large bottle too!</li>
            <li>When I changed stylists I didn&#x27;t want to stop using such a great product, and was happy to find it even cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is good as a leave in conditioner specially for relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is simply magic on my hair - makes it shiny, easy to manage and adds body!</li>
            <li>anyone who wants healthy beautiful hair should use this product.</li>
            <li>Everyone was so nice and easy to contact.</li>
            <li>Try IntraKera and you will love it.  </li>
            <li>I am a product junkie and are always looking to try the next best thing, this is it.  </li>
            <li>I would have paid more for this.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>If you have permed and/or colored hair, and most leave-in conditioners leave your hair sticky, then THIS is the product for you.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love love this product.</li>
            <li>Nothing else has ever made my hair look so healthy.</li>
            <li>and I love it .</li>
            <li>I like it better than the Paul Mitchel leave in.  </li>
            <li>this is one of the best deep penetrating conditioners I have ever used</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Arrived well packaged, padded with bubble wrap, top taped securely.</li>
            <li>I received it in a very   timely fashion in good condition and it was everything they said it would be.</li>
            <li>Have tried other leave-in conditioners, but IntraKera is the best I have found.  </li>
            <li>It makes hair tangle free and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I have really fine, processed hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I sound like a commercial, but this product is great.  </li>
            <li>works great, don&#x27;t have to use extra conditioner!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightweight and silky smooth...</li>
            <li>Works great for taming frizzy or extra wavy hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative and the 32 ounce last me approx 10 months.</li>
            <li>This helps it lay down beautifully and is extremely light yet moisturizing!</li>
            <li>best stuff for my long straight hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair from being fly-away and gives a nice shine, without weighing it down--which is important in humid Florida where I live.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of Paul Mitchell original leave-in moisturizer at my salon as recommended by my stylist as I had run out of IntraKera.  </li>
            <li>I started an Internet search and found it was available on line at much more reasonable prices.  </li>
            <li>I love love love it on my naturally curly hair and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>and when I received it, it was the exact same in most respects except the nice, light smell I fondly remembered</li>
            <li>It makes combing easier and makes my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>i have super fizzy hair, i use this after shampooing and comb my hair and out IntraKera.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length curly hair of mild coarseness</li>
            <li>In the morning I can just dampen my naturally wavy hair with wet hands as I finger comb it, and it dries perfectly styled every time.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Intrakera for the past 12 years and it is an incredible product.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s really not good for your hair and weakens it), and this is PERFECT for creating a smoothness when I airdry my hair and run a small-toothed comb through it</li>
            <li>Product was delivered a couple of days before I expected: always a nice thing!</li>
            <li>and I still love it as much as I did when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li>(that would have got 5 stars), but it is pretty close!</li>
            <li>Makes hair easy to comb, soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This was well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>and I use this every day when blow drying my hair to leave it feeling soft, light, and leaving my hair tangle free.</li>
            <li>I notice if I skip a day it tends to be much more frizzy and wild.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair smooth, soft, and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Long-term use of the product has kept my hair healthy, soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>I color my hair and it makes my hair so soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>, I have long hair and in the winter the static is a pain in the @#$ this stuff really controlls the static.  </li>
            <li>so I appreciate their efforts to make it right.</li>
            <li>Our family may single handedly keep this product in business we love it!</li>
            <li>It detangles clumpy wet hair like magic, without breakage, and leaves hair really smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have not found any product I like better for my daily hair product.</li>
            <li>Outside of this, I&#x27;m, pleased.</li>
            <li>With this leave-in conditioner, it is now softer and in better condition -- and better than when I used a more expensive product from the hair salon.</li>
            <li>I have two girls with very curly hair - this product is amaxing!</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product by my stylist, who used it herself.  </li>
            <li>The product keeps my colored hair soft, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I have used this product for more than ten years.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>And, I hope I can continue to get it in the future as it is no longer available in stores or salons.</li>
            <li>there really isn&#x27;t anything to rinse out because your hair absorbs the keratin.</li>
            <li>and this really does the trick for me.</li>
            <li>so it dries fairly straight.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated</li>
            <li>This product was not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Really controls the split ends too.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Not much of a floral fan... love my fruity smells.</li>
            <li>I have used IntraKera for years and this was product was not the same consistency, color or fragrance as the original product should be.  </li>
            <li>have tried many other products, but they don&#x27;t control my curly frizzy hair as well as this.</li>
            <li>My hair is very processed and this smooths and adds volume without weighing down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful, little expensive but worth every penny</li>
            <li>It gives a gentle hold while leaving you hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Has become difficult to find in the beauty supply store, so was happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS TO HIGH$ looking for a new product.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live w/o this product.</li>
            <li>In my experience with many years of using this product, it has always been a clear, see-through green.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft  </li>
            <li>IntraKera gives body and makes my find hair manageable, with a natural look.</li>
            <li>Its unfortunate that I can only find it online now, but I&#x27;m glad its still available.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft and manageable and when I introduced it to my senior mother who still gets perms, and she couldn&#x27;t believe how soft her hair was as well.    </li>
            <li>To get my edges straight, I just slap a little more of this stuff on the sides, comb, brush with a boar bristle, and tightly wrap around a satin/non-absorbent sash on my hairline.</li>
            <li>A tiny bit goes a long way......way worth the money.</li>
            <li>I put high and low lights in my hair every 6 weeks</li>
            <li>so takes very little--a quart lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>No more tangles and all our hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it right away,  as I still had a little left in the old bottle.      </li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t need to use much, so a 33 oz bottle will last me at least a year and probably much longer.</li>
            <li>so I really like that it does not weigh my hair down.</li>

            <li> Long-term use of the product has kept my hair healthy, soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> I color my hair and it makes my hair so soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> , I have long hair and in the winter the static is a pain in the @#$ this stuff really controlls the static.  </li>
            <li> so I appreciate their efforts to make it right.</li>
            <li> Our family may single handedly keep this product in business we love it!</li>
            <li> It detangles clumpy wet hair like magic, without breakage, and leaves hair really smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have not found any product I like better for my daily hair product.</li>
            <li> Outside of this, I&#x27;m, pleased.</li>
            <li> With this leave-in conditioner, it is now softer and in better condition -- and better than when I used a more expensive product from the hair salon.</li>
            <li> I have two girls with very curly hair - this product is amaxing!</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my stylist, who used it herself.  </li>
            <li> The product keeps my colored hair soft, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I have used this product for more than ten years.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> And, I hope I can continue to get it in the future as it is no longer available in stores or salons.</li>
            <li> there really isn&#x27;t anything to rinse out because your hair absorbs the keratin.</li>
            <li> and this really does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> so it dries fairly straight.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very concentrated</li>
            <li> This product was not the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Really controls the split ends too.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not much of a floral fan... love my fruity smells.</li>
            <li> I have used IntraKera for years and this was product was not the same consistency, color or fragrance as the original product should be.  </li>
            <li> have tried many other products, but they don&#x27;t control my curly frizzy hair as well as this.</li>
            <li> My hair is very processed and this smooths and adds volume without weighing down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful, little expensive but worth every penny</li>
            <li> It gives a gentle hold while leaving you hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Has become difficult to find in the beauty supply store, so was happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS TO HIGH$ looking for a new product.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live w/o this product.</li>
            <li> In my experience with many years of using this product, it has always been a clear, see-through green.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft  </li>
            <li> IntraKera gives body and makes my find hair manageable, with a natural look.</li>
            <li> Its unfortunate that I can only find it online now, but I&#x27;m glad its still available.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair soft and manageable and when I introduced it to my senior mother who still gets perms, and she couldn&#x27;t believe how soft her hair was as well.    </li>
            <li> To get my edges straight, I just slap a little more of this stuff on the sides, comb, brush with a boar bristle, and tightly wrap around a satin/non-absorbent sash on my hairline.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way......way worth the money.</li>
            <li> I put high and low lights in my hair every 6 weeks</li>
            <li> so takes very little--a quart lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> No more tangles and all our hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it right away,  as I still had a little left in the old bottle.      </li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t need to use much, so a 33 oz bottle will last me at least a year and probably much longer.</li>
            <li> so I really like that it does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the only stuff that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and makes my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry, especially where it is gray.</li>
            <li> I have long hair trust me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of this product for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> As a long time user of IntraKera, I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for as long as I remember.  </li>
            <li> It is not sticky, oily or gummy like some other conditioners, and I find it actually makes my hands feel softer too.  </li>
            <li> It is a really good \\&quot;base coat\\&quot; to use before gel and other products.</li>
            <li> compared it to my previous bottle, lighter in color and consistency is not the same.</li>
            <li> I use it every night, applying it to my wet hair after washing, combing it through, and letting it dry.  </li>
            <li> Product was not the same as previously ordered.</li>
            <li> Then I take a wide-tooth plastic comb specialized for wet hair and comb it through before blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I have long mid-back hair and use about a quarter-size dollop in the palm of my hand and rub through the hair from about neck down.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Yes, I have tried other products, but none compare with IntraKera.    </li>
            <li> We use it as a leave in conditioner after washing or wetting the hair down, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the scent they use.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t compare and weighs my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair all soapy and weighted down .Also</li>

            <li> I have loved this product in the past,  but think I got a bad bottle.  :(</li>
            <li> No more tumbleweed look to curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The cap was all tapped up and difficult to open.</li>
            <li> it \\&quot;foams up\\&quot; when I rub it between my palms,  in the past its been thick.     </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i have super fizzy hair, i use this after shampooing and comb my hair and out IntraKera. works great, don&#x27;t have to use extra conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;FYI I have long hair trust me a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> IntraKera is a great leave-in conditioner.  I bought a bottle of Paul Mitchell original leave-in moisturizer at my salon as recommended by my stylist as I had run out of IntraKera.  But it doesn&#x27;t compare and weighs my hair down.  I was so happy to see I can get it through Amazon.  Try IntraKera and you will love it.  And, I hope I can continue to get it in the future as it is no longer available in stores or salons.</li>
            <li> Not as thick as it use to be. USED TO BE A LOT THICKER. THE PRICE IS TO HIGH$ looking for a new product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best leave-in conditioner I have ever used.  I put high and low lights in my hair every 6 weeks and it tends to get a little frizzy.  This is the best stuff ever.  I am a product junkie and are always looking to try the next best thing, this is it.  This was well worth the price.  I would have paid more for this.</li>
            <li> Intakara is a leave in conditioner that helps to manage your hair. Helps with styling.  Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> anyone who wants healthy beautiful hair should use this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years and will not use anything else. I&#x27;ve recommended it to my stylist who has used it for a month and cannot believe the difference in his hair. depending on your type of hair you can leave it in or risne it out. there really isn&#x27;t anything to rinse out because your hair absorbs the keratin. don&#x27;t need to use alot to see the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not  sure if they changed the formula -  or if I got a bad bottle.   I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 8 years.   This bottle is watery - and it \\&quot;foams up\\&quot; when I rub it between my palms,  in the past its been thick.     I would have returned it,  but I threw out the packing slip with the box.   I didn&#x27;t use it right away,  as I still had a little left in the old bottle.      I have loved this product in the past,  but think I got a bad bottle.  :(</li>
            <li> best stuff for my long straight hair.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when my local beauty supply shop stopped carrying IntraKera and could find nothing to replace it.  I started an Internet search and found it was available on line at much more reasonable prices.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years -- it&#x27;s not a mousse or a stiffening gel, nor is it greasy.  In fact, I don&#x27;t know how it works...what I do know is that when I skip the step [running a dime-sized dab through semi-wet hair], my hair does not style as well, and in fact, looks kind of flyaway and then flattens out.  I&#x27;ve been a fan of this product for as long as I can remember.  PLEASE don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Intrakera for the past 12 years and it is an incredible product.  It is good as a leave in conditioner specially for relaxed hair.  I have tried others during this time because it had been so difficult to find it ( it is not sold in supermarkets or beauty stores) but nothing like Intrakera from Image.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Wonderful fragrance.  Makes hair easy to comb, soft and smooth.  No more tumbleweed look to curly hair.  Arrived well packaged, padded with bubble wrap, top taped securely.</li>
            <li> As a long time user of IntraKera, I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without this product. It makes hair tangle free and easy to manage. A great value for the large bottle too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this leave-in conditioner for over 15 years and can&#x27;t imagine what I&#x27;d do without it. I put a bit on my towel dried (but still very damp) hair after every shampoo. It keeps my hair from being fly-away and gives a nice shine, without weighing it down--which is important in humid Florida where I live. And you don&#x27;t need to use much, so a 33 oz bottle will last me at least a year and probably much longer. I wear my hair short but in the Florida summers (April through October!) I wash my hair every day. Yes, I have tried other products, but none compare with IntraKera.    [[ASIN:B000EMDKT2 Image IntraKera, Deep Penetrating Leave-In Conditioning Complex, 33.8 fl oz (1 lt)]]</li>
            <li> Arrive on time. But this is not a true product. I think this is diluted with regular conditioner. Makes my hair all soapy and weighted down .Also compared it to my previous bottle, lighter in color and consistency is not the same.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this leave-in conditioner.  My hair feels so soft  and it protects my hair from the heat styling.  I received it in a very   timely fashion in good condition and it was everything they said it would be.</li>
            <li> IntraKera has been a critical part of my hair care for years.  My hair is find.  IntraKera gives body and makes my find hair manageable, with a natural look.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years. It gives a gentle hold while leaving you hair feeling soft. I have not found any product I like better for my daily hair product.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length curly hair of mild coarseness and I use this every day when blow drying my hair to leave it feeling soft, light, and leaving my hair tangle free. Best of all it distributes evenly and doesn&#x27;t leave any &#x27;crackle&#x27; on my curls after it dries.</li>
            <li> One of the best leave-in products for your hair. Lightweight and silky smooth... Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and minimizes split ends. Seller is great to work with and product arrived before scheduled and was in great condition.</li>
            <li> I loooovvvvveeee this.... thank goodness I got it in the largest size too for a discount! I&#x27;m African-American with 4b relaxed, coarse hair and this really does the trick for me. I&#x27;ve been getting away from blowdrying my hair since I have to go back and flatiron it anyway (it&#x27;s really not good for your hair and weakens it), and this is PERFECT for creating a smoothness when I airdry my hair and run a small-toothed comb through it so it dries fairly straight. To get my edges straight, I just slap a little more of this stuff on the sides, comb, brush with a boar bristle, and tightly wrap around a satin/non-absorbent sash on my hairline. This helps it lay down beautifully and is extremely light yet moisturizing!</li>
            <li> If you have permed and/or colored hair, and most leave-in conditioners leave your hair sticky, then THIS is the product for you.  I love this conditioner, and have been using it for years.  It detangles clumpy wet hair like magic, without breakage, and leaves hair really smooth.  I sound like a commercial, but this product is great.  A tiny bit goes a long way......way worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used this product over 17 years ago but I moved and could not find it and I was looking for leave in conditioner and I was so happy when I found the IntraKera!!! It is wonderful, little expensive but worth every penny</li>
            <li> I used this product 10+ years ago and LOVED IT!! (Back in the days when spiral perms were hip) My hair now is getting dryer so I thought I would use it again (looking forward to it actually) and when I received it, it was the exact same in most respects except the nice, light smell I fondly remembered is now a strong, nasty, perfume smell. VERY disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years.  I have really fine, processed hair and it&#x27;s the only stuff that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and makes my hair soft and silky.  I also noticed while on vacation that it tamed fly aways in humid weather.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I am a swimmer and use this every day! I don&#x27;t use anything else for styling because this seems to do the trick!&lt;br /&gt;The cost is better than I can get anywhere else too! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the only leave in conditioner I will use.  I am a shampoo/conditioner snob and this does the trick!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I love it. It is a really good \\&quot;base coat\\&quot; to use before gel and other products. Its unfortunate that I can only find it online now, but I&#x27;m glad its still available. The amazon packaging job was so-so. The cap was all tapped up and difficult to open. Outside of this, I&#x27;m, pleased.</li>
            <li> Works great for taming frizzy or extra wavy hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this product. My hair tends to be dry, especially where it is gray. With this leave-in conditioner, it is now softer and in better condition -- and better than when I used a more expensive product from the hair salon.</li>
            <li> Works great for conditioning your hair........Would recommend it to anyone looking for a good conditioner</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in store anymore so this is my go to place.  Love love this product. Takes all the knots out!</li>
            <li> I have two girls with very curly hair - this product is amaxing! We use it as a leave in conditioner after washing or wetting the hair down, a little goes a long way and it is sort of slimy in consistency - just apply it to hair  and their curls stay together all day!  Not crispy or flaky when it dries either and the fragrance is not overpowering. Our family may single handedly keep this product in business we love it!</li>
            <li> My salon stopped carrying this so I ordered online. It&#x27;s very concentrated so takes very little--a quart lasts a long time. My hair is very processed and this smooths and adds volume without weighing down my fine hair. Nothing else has ever made my hair look so healthy. I was so relieved to find it online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years on my fine hair. Nothing compares</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my stylist, who used it herself.  I use it every night, applying it to my wet hair after washing, combing it through, and letting it dry.  In the morning I can just dampen my naturally wavy hair with wet hands as I finger comb it, and it dries perfectly styled every time.  The product keeps my colored hair soft, smooth and shiny.  I notice if I skip a day it tends to be much more frizzy and wild.  It is not sticky, oily or gummy like some other conditioners, and I find it actually makes my hands feel softer too.  When I changed stylists I didn&#x27;t want to stop using such a great product, and was happy to find it even cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product was not the real thing.  I have used IntraKera for years and this was product was not the same consistency, color or fragrance as the original product should be.  However, Amazon.com was very good about refunding me so I appreciate their efforts to make it right.</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS IN MY HAIR.....MAKES IT SHINEY AND GIVES ME BODY....MY SUPPLIER STOPPED CARRYING IT AND I HAD TO GO TO AMAZON</li>
            <li> I am not the one that uses it, but I think she says it is good stuff,  If she is happy.</li>
            <li> good product, good quality, I have more than 5 years using it and I love it . I do recommend it</li>
            <li> I  have used this product for over ten years. Now even my granddaughters use it. No more tangles and all our hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.  Has become difficult to find in the beauty supply store, so was happy to find it on Amazon.  I like it better than the Paul Mitchel leave in.  Makes hair smooth, soft, and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I have used Intrakera since the autumn of 1994. I have curly, red hair which tended toward dryness. Within a month (2.5 inches of growth) I noticed great improvement. Long-term use of the product has kept my hair healthy, soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> This the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found....been using it for 20 years.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have used this product for more than ten years.  It leaves hair soft and manageable and when I introduced it to my senior mother who still gets perms, and she couldn&#x27;t believe how soft her hair was as well.    I have long mid-back hair and use about a quarter-size dollop in the palm of my hand and rub through the hair from about neck down. Then I take a wide-tooth plastic comb specialized for wet hair and comb it through before blow drying.  Have tried other leave-in conditioners, but IntraKera is the best I have found.  Love it!!    Buying it here at Amazon is the best price and with the 1 litre bottle, and dividing it between three people, it still lasts for six months or more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!, I have long hair and in the winter the static is a pain in the @#$ this stuff really controlls the static.  Plus it controls tangles you get when windy out.  Really controls the split ends too.  Great product i hope they keep making this!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!  I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS...ABSOLUTELY THE BEST FOR YOUR HAIR!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product religiously for 20+ years and hope they never discontinue it! I color my hair and it makes my hair so soft and healthy looking. You can also use it to shave. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using IntraKera leave in conditioner for years. I love love love it on my naturally curly hair and highly recommend it.  Leaves my hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  It tames the frizzies, ads shine, and conditions. I keep a big stock on hand.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best deep penetrating conditioners I have ever used</li>
            <li> This product works great for me and I really liked that I could purchase a salon-sized bottle at the price I paid.  Product was delivered a couple of days before I expected: always a nice thing!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and I still love it as much as I did when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li> Product was not the same as previously ordered. This bottle seemed to be mixed with something like a conditioner to make it milky green-looking. In my experience with many years of using this product, it has always been a clear, see-through green. On the good side, exchange with company was flawless, though. Everyone was so nice and easy to contact. After 2 exchanges, I finally gave up and kept it. Because of the great service, I may try again when I run out of this bottle.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the BEST stuff on the market for curly hair. Controls and defines curls, even in humid florida weather. I have been using this for about 15 Years now... nothing compares! The only complaint I have is the scent they use. Gardenia I think. Not much of a floral fan... love my fruity smells.</li>
            <li> It is the best product to keep my hair done. It is not gummy and just some drops are enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> I love his product and have used it for years!  It conditions my hair without leaving any film or allowing build up and it is amazing on tangles!!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. I use it daily. My hair type is thin so I really like that it does not weigh my hair down. I used to use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s. This is a great alternative and the 32 ounce last me approx 10 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this leave in for years and it is great for my daughter who is biracial and myself. It makes combing easier and makes my hair nice and soft. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same product I used 20+ years ago (that would have got 5 stars), but it is pretty close!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for as long as I remember.  I will continue to use it for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;It is simply magic on my hair - makes it shiny, easy to manage and adds body! People are always commenting on how nice and healthy my hair looks!</li>
            <li> My hair won&#x27;t settle for anything else and you deliver at a great price</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live w/o this product. have tried many other products, but they don&#x27;t control my curly frizzy hair as well as this.</li>
            <li> handled as agreed and love my IntraKera!</li>
