    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Mom was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>And the best yet, 100% of women notice a difference!!  </li>
            <li>my closest friends I&#x27;ve shared the wonderful news about Aveeno Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day Treatment.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this stuff and gave to my sister as a gift she said she was very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Aveeno makes wonderful products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>While the packaging tells you touse the product for 4 weeks to get the best results, I ended my trial run with both components of the system after 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>My wife is a beautiful over-50 woman with just the start of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>So to recap, this is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I also like that it contains a good sunscreen, which I&#x27;m sure is excellent for prevention.    </li>
            <li>A good thing for under makeup prep in AMs.  </li>
            <li>That being said, it smells great and had a nice texture, so if they made one specifically for oily/combination skin I would be all for it.     </li>
            <li>good things: I do like the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I felt that the Aveena Ageless Vitality treatment was a great moisturizer, but I need more time to determine if it truly reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It smells good, comes in a nice package.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use and it feels very nice on your face.</li>
            <li>to use, Nice feeling when it is going on and once it has been on, noticable difference to my husband.</li>
            <li>If you want it to obliterate all your fine lines and discoloration, I recommend using it in tandem with a good retinol product that you apply at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with this and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>It is very light</li>
            <li>If you can follow the regimen, I would say the creams are smooth and feel nice on your skin, but I don&#x27;t know if they work since I was so sporadic about my use of them.  </li>
            <li>Spots from acne scars and sun did seem to blend in more than before I used the product.</li>
            <li>I was really pleased after trying this system.</li>
            <li>For me, the most difference happened immediately with the having softer skin--but it wasn&#x27;t softer after week 4 than after week 1.    </li>
            <li>I have bought this product 2 more times since running out and will continue to use, I love the results.</li>
            <li>Well, maybe it will work better for you.</li>
            <li>I was actually really pleased with this Aveeno system.</li>
            <li>I do not look \\&quot;Ageless\\&quot; as the name of the product claims, but better and healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my skin shows a better \\&quot;vitality\\&quot; or healthy glow.</li>
            <li>My opinion is that this product works wonderfully for firmness and an overall smoother complexion.  </li>
            <li>Greater resiliency and firmness    </li>
            <li>but I saw greater improvement the longer</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get the top off, so you have no idea if there&#x27;s product in there after the pump stops working.    </li>
            <li>I cannot attest to its effectiveness in rejuvenating skin or making your face more youthful.</li>
            <li>In fact, I thought my skin looked like it had more wrinkles.</li>
            <li>For the most part we were underwhelmed.</li>
            <li>All said, I have been most pleased with the performance of the Nutritioniste products.  </li>
            <li>However, so far, so good! :)</li>
            <li>This is another hit for the JNJ Aveeno line, there is reduced lines with continued use, the moisturizer is really great, the consistency is not thick and sticky, but smooth and effective.  </li>
            <li>If your skin can handle it, the product has a nice scent and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>because I know you sometimes need more than one of a particular product to give it a good try.    </li>
            <li>but I guess my husband said I looked more smooth.</li>
            <li>However, Aveeno has given me a reason to believe that there are ways to be more comfortable in in our skin as we move through life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, the laugh wrinkles around my eyes seem significantly diminished.</li>
            <li>The other cream is SPF 30 and makes a great moisturizing sun screen on its own.</li>
            <li>When I first started I thought it would be best to experiment by using the treatment on one side only.</li>
            <li>Have all my fine lines disappeared?  </li>
            <li>I had ordered this product through the Vine program in hopes of finding a non-greasy moisturizer that helped reduce the look of fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>While I thought I saw some signs of fine lines fading a bit, I came to realize that the ingredients in the biomineral concentrate contain chemicals that \\&quot;puff</li>
            <li>With all the products and claims out there, it is great to find one that actually performs as promised.</li>
            <li>I used the product on the problem areas: spots, discolorations, between the eyes, and the lovely smile parenthesis around the mouth.</li>
            <li>It promises to recharge elastin-deficient skin, dramatically reduce appearance of lines and wrinkles, smooth skin texture, increase firmness, and diminish the look of age spots.  </li>
            <li>I read about the Ageless Vitality line before this product was available on the market in Allure Magazine (I believe).  </li>
            <li>and I was hesitant to continue using the product given that others had experienced similar effects.  </li>
            <li>The scent was light and when applied, it felt light on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice significant difference after week 1 compared to after week 4.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well this system would work for deep lines and wrinkles, but it was pretty great for fine ones.</li>
            <li>You might not feel as special buying CVS moisturizers, but truth be known, the ingredients are often comparable.</li>
            <li>but it was a good present.</li>
            <li>I have only good things to say about the product as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was not in the least impressed.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t an effect that faded quickly once the product evaporated or wore off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>as I get older, I am more aware of how important it is to protect my skin from the sun&#x27;s damaging rays.  </li>
            <li>I love that it makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I will say that my skin feels softer and brighter, but I can&#x27;t say I see any real difference in fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li>love it and the scent of the facial cream is pleasant and the SPF is an added bonus that is helpful in preventing further damage.  </li>
            <li>I have Rosacea and these products calm my skin and the brightening effect from the moisturizer reduces redness.  </li>
            <li>so it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>If your skintone tends to be ruddy, this might be a good thing, but it&#x27;s not very flattering if you have sallow skin.      </li>
            <li>With only a light amount of daytime make-up I go out into the world with more self-confidence.</li>
            <li>After using two month&#x27;s worth of this product, what I saw was:    1)</li>
            <li>best thing that&#x27;s happened to me is hearing several friends tell me I&#x27;ve been looking great lately and asking if I&#x27;ve done something different to myself.</li>
            <li>Honestly though my wife looks much younger than her years</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin as many of the reviewers seem to so</li>
            <li>Once the serum was applied, I used the fresh smelling anti-aging lotion and applied it all over my face.</li>
            <li>It works better if you use more bio-mineral concentrate, so you always run the risk of running out of one component of this product line before you use the up the other.    </li>
            <li>I have used it for about 3-4 weeks and the first thing I noticed was it was not greasy and soaked into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>It was not as dry or flaky, had a good color and also seemed a better texture, a little more youthful feeling.  </li>
            <li>You must mix the two products in the package together for use, and this makes it tricky to get the right amount.</li>
            <li>so maybe she wasn&#x27;t the right person to try it on.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>This is the most wonderful day time moisturizer, The small tubes, the bio-mineral complex makes my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>After a couple weeks though I noticed a very real difference in my skin appearance and feel.  </li>
            <li>Not so great, so I checked out the ingredients list to see what was going on, and to my surprise,  Aveeno, who promotes itself as a \\&quot;Pioneer in Active Naturals\\&quot;, is about as natural as a hot dog.  </li>
            <li>You just push the top and enough for your face comes out.</li>
            <li>Price seemed a bit higher but maybe this is a testing size rather than a selling sized package.</li>
            <li>This product makes your skin feel soft and smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>(unless you are using similar products)    I did not see more definition in my face or a change in my jawline.  </li>
            <li>I can really see and feel the difference it has made in my skin!  </li>
            <li>I used the day cream consistently for about three months.      </li>
            <li>(The third month produced even better results than month two).  </li>
            <li>Using the white cream without the presence of chemical sunscreens might be interesting.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if people have read this review up to this point, they&#x27;re probably wondering why I only gave it three stars.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using Aveeno Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day Treatment</li>
            <li>When the first signs of a rash broke out around my mouth</li>
            <li>You may be able to access them with coupons from some Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond stores or your local grocery store.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t apply consistently for four weeks.</li>
            <li>And that is exactly what happened.  </li>
            <li>I believe that it can probably maintain your current skin condition and would be a good part of your daily skin treatment regime.  </li>
            <li>When I first started to use this system, I thought it didn&#x27;t offer anything more than a standard off-the-shelf decent moisturizer.   </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be as positive about the promised rejuvenation.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but much better than paying for a spa treatment!</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend Aveeno Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day</li>
            <li>The daily moisturizer was not sticky or oily and was fine under my make-up.  </li>
            <li>but overall, it did not reduce the look of fine lines/wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a little handy pumping bottle.</li>
            <li>The actual moisturizer smelled great, but was a bit heavy for my skin.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this as I&#x27;m a fan of the brand.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference on the wrinkles</li>
            <li>and she really likes the effects</li>
            <li>I thought I would give it a try as $40 seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li>Too much cardboard and plastic.  </li>
            <li>I rated it three stars as the cream was gentle to the skin and seemed to even provide a bit of moisturizing to the mix.</li>
            <li>I bought this product really wanting to like it.</li>
            <li>recommend this product to anyone who wants an improved feeling and look.</li>
            <li>Pros:  Gentle to skin.  </li>
            <li>What is nice is that it has also added elasticity to her skin making it look and feel younger and has added a brightness to her overall skin color.  </li>
            <li>For other needs, Aveeno is an excellent company that offers solid products such as the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t seem to work any better than any other face cream.  </li>
            <li>I might be willing to do it at night, but since this product has sunscreen, it&#x27;s clearly a day cream.     </li>
            <li>although, are there really any products that live up to that statement?    </li>
            <li>One is a small tube of super fine lotion.</li>
            <li>I selected this product mainly for the benefits it was supposed to give for sunspots and discolorations.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and feels light, and I have not had any negative reactions to the product.</li>
            <li>Overall I believe that there are better alternatives on the market such as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very light, which means it tends to wash off if you sweat even a little.  </li>
            <li>It may be best used by someone who has extremely wrinkled and tough skin.</li>
            <li>I do not believe that for me the product lived up to its price (over thirty dollars and as high as forty).        </li>
            <li>Wrinkles maybe have gone a little but not any more so than what I now use from L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re simply looking for a basic moisture cream that also brightens your skin, this will do fine.</li>
            <li>Basically, though, I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this and any other anti-aging creams or lotions available at the drug store.</li>
            <li>That perhaps it&#x27;s my new hat or nail</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t live without their scrub, their new mask, the moisturizer and the eye cream.</li>
            <li>used it on my problem areas such as forehead, crows&#x27; feet by my eyes, and the curved laugh lines near my cheek bones.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this product, I apparently did not pay attention to the description, because I thought it was a full face-cleansing system, which I was eager to try because I currently use a variety of products on my face (including Aveeno cleansing pads, biore scrub, garnier moisturizer, burt&#x27;s bees blemish control...).</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I like the daily treatments very much.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The small tube of gray-green stuff I was told to apply just where needed, but it lasted more than a week.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased them because of a medical recommendation to use products on your skin with vitamins.</li>
            <li>the first second I applied this product, I felt relief.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>The dry, lusterless appearance was replaces by toned, fresh skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend clear tubes with calibrations for easier use.     </li>
            <li>To go from clear skin to blemished skin after one use?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young</li>
            <li>Do I see the results it offers.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, I&#x27;ve been going through some high-tech procedures that promise some of these same effects -- my jowls are much diminished, if you want to know.  </li>
            <li>I can tell you that I have sensitive skin, and this preparation irritates it.  </li>
            <li>Busy women who don&#x27;t have the time to combine the products (or would prefer an all-in-one) might be happier with something else.</li>
            <li>The deeper wrinkles at the bridge of the nose, above the lips and on the sides of the mouth may not seem to be all that much changed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as the directions go... there was nothing helpful in the package--</li>
            <li>The point of this product line is to regenerate elastin, the protein that gives skin that snap-back consistency when we&#x27;re young.     </li>
            <li>However, i have fairly sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>This product worked great--made a big difference in my skin after just a couple of weeks of daily use--more even skin tone and even some visible tightening around the jaw line I read that the product works by making a light electrical current when the two products combine (you don&#x27;t feel it) which is supposed to stimulate elastin and collagen regrowth--I will buy it again</li>
            <li>Nutritioniste is also much easier to use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>Nutritioniste also offers coupons and drug stores run specials on them, as well.  </li>
            <li>Also, the \\&quot;proven results\\&quot; did not occur with me - I have not noticed a considerable difference in texture, firmness, or reduced appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Anyone looking for a truly natural moisturizer along the lines of Burt&#x27;s Bees will want to avoid this product.    </li>
            <li>The moisturizer left my skin very greasy, and within 4 days of using it, my skin broke out in a rash around my eyes, and on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely took the lines away, but left me looking \\&quot;bloated\\&quot; around my eyes, and I stopped using that product as well.   </li>
            <li>This is an overpriced moisturizing skin treatment product that I can not recommend, and if you have sensitive skin, I would avoid buying it altogether.</li>
            <li>29 other items are in higher concentrations in the make up of this product than the highly advertised \\&quot;blackberry leaf\\&quot; and \\&quot;dill extract\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I also like the consistency, which is more the thickness of night creams than the typical day-time use product, and even though it&#x27;s thick, it&#x27;s also non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found out how to buy just some more of the gray-green little tubes, which I will be out of long before I finish the pump jar.  </li>
            <li>The gel that you apply under the moisturizing is pretty fantastic at filling in small lines and keeping them that way all day long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve never really put much product on it.</li>
            <li>So my results are not typical.</li>
            <li>After a few days, I got puffs under my eyes that looked pretty unusual.  </li>
            <li>second product, the daily mosturizer is the one that feels a little bit heavier and you get more than you need when you push the pump top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pay to keep buying the entire system, and have way too much of the pump jar cream left over.</li>
            <li>I found that I had results much like another reviewer in that the lotion irritated my skin after limited usage.  </li>
            <li>Increased overall smoothness  2) areas where fine lines were  deepening and turning red became less so  3)</li>
            <li>The special tubes of cream that are meant to reduce fine lines and wrinkles were also a disappointment.  </li>
            <li>They apparently can and do put everything imaginable into their products.  </li>
            <li>moisturizer sinks into the layers of skin rapidly leaving my skin feeling like light and soft skin, heavy and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used at bedtime, I woke up to soft, younger feeling skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing I had done differently from my normal routine was use this product.</li>
            <li>Another is I have combinationn skin, and even though the pump jar cream feels like I&#x27;m putting on something really rich and moisturizing, the dry section of my skin starting getting dry again after I bought the second box of the product.  </li>
            <li>While the cream did not irritate her skin as other reviewers have found, it also didn&#x27;t really affect the wrinkles either.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable compared to other over the counter skin treatments.      </li>
            <li>Money is tight right now, so I&#x27;ve skipped it the last month.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it was touted as having \\&quot;active naturals\\&quot; was what really caught my attention, and the reason that I ordered it.    </li>
            <li>my skin is experiencing all the typical changes the last few years (lines deepening, greater discoloration, etc.).  </li>
            <li>I have had success with other Aveeno products in the past, and have had mostly positive results with them, but the Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day Treatment left me disheartened, and questioning its claims that \\&quot;100% of the women\\&quot; who used it in their trial \\&quot;showed improved skin vitality in 4</li>
            <li>I am a 57 year old white female with relatively moist facial skin.  </li>
            <li>As someone with normal life wrinkles I have been suspicious of creams and other products claiming to reduce or eliminate wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have the money to buy any of these products, but found that Relastin and Vitality were very expensive...and with little or no results after trying them each for over a month.  </li>
            <li>For Aveeno to create such a fine product but pay for someone to package it so poorly is a shame.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I needed four little tubes instead of one bigger tube and there was just too much box and plastic for me.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Mom was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> And the best yet, 100% of women notice a difference!!  </li>

            <li> I received a sample of this stuff and gave to my sister as a gift she said she was very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Aveeno makes wonderful products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> While the packaging tells you touse the product for 4 weeks to get the best results, I ended my trial run with both components of the system after 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> My wife is a beautiful over-50 woman with just the start of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> So to recap, this is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I also like that it contains a good sunscreen, which I&#x27;m sure is excellent for prevention.    </li>
            <li> A good thing for under makeup prep in AMs.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it smells great and had a nice texture, so if they made one specifically for oily/combination skin I would be all for it.     </li>
            <li> good things: I do like the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I felt that the Aveena Ageless Vitality treatment was a great moisturizer, but I need more time to determine if it truly reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It smells good, comes in a nice package.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and it feels very nice on your face.</li>
            <li> to use, Nice feeling when it is going on and once it has been on, noticable difference to my husband.</li>
            <li> If you want it to obliterate all your fine lines and discoloration, I recommend using it in tandem with a good retinol product that you apply at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is very light</li>
            <li> If you can follow the regimen, I would say the creams are smooth and feel nice on your skin, but I don&#x27;t know if they work since I was so sporadic about my use of them.  </li>
            <li> Spots from acne scars and sun did seem to blend in more than before I used the product.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased after trying this system.</li>
            <li> For me, the most difference happened immediately with the having softer skin--but it wasn&#x27;t softer after week 4 than after week 1.    </li>
            <li> I have bought this product 2 more times since running out and will continue to use, I love the results.</li>
            <li> Well, maybe it will work better for you.</li>
            <li> I was actually really pleased with this Aveeno system.</li>
            <li> I do not look \\&quot;Ageless\\&quot; as the name of the product claims, but better and healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my skin shows a better \\&quot;vitality\\&quot; or healthy glow.</li>
            <li> My opinion is that this product works wonderfully for firmness and an overall smoother complexion.  </li>
            <li> Greater resiliency and firmness    </li>
            <li> but I saw greater improvement the longer</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get the top off, so you have no idea if there&#x27;s product in there after the pump stops working.    </li>
            <li> I cannot attest to its effectiveness in rejuvenating skin or making your face more youthful.</li>
            <li> In fact, I thought my skin looked like it had more wrinkles.</li>
            <li> For the most part we were underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> All said, I have been most pleased with the performance of the Nutritioniste products.  </li>
            <li> However, so far, so good! :)</li>
            <li> This is another hit for the JNJ Aveeno line, there is reduced lines with continued use, the moisturizer is really great, the consistency is not thick and sticky, but smooth and effective.  </li>
            <li> If your skin can handle it, the product has a nice scent and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> because I know you sometimes need more than one of a particular product to give it a good try.    </li>
            <li> but I guess my husband said I looked more smooth.</li>
            <li> However, Aveeno has given me a reason to believe that there are ways to be more comfortable in in our skin as we move through life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, the laugh wrinkles around my eyes seem significantly diminished.</li>
            <li> The other cream is SPF 30 and makes a great moisturizing sun screen on its own.</li>
            <li> When I first started I thought it would be best to experiment by using the treatment on one side only.</li>
            <li> Have all my fine lines disappeared?  </li>
            <li> I had ordered this product through the Vine program in hopes of finding a non-greasy moisturizer that helped reduce the look of fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> While I thought I saw some signs of fine lines fading a bit, I came to realize that the ingredients in the biomineral concentrate contain chemicals that \\&quot;puff</li>
            <li> With all the products and claims out there, it is great to find one that actually performs as promised.</li>
            <li> I used the product on the problem areas: spots, discolorations, between the eyes, and the lovely smile parenthesis around the mouth.</li>
            <li> It promises to recharge elastin-deficient skin, dramatically reduce appearance of lines and wrinkles, smooth skin texture, increase firmness, and diminish the look of age spots.  </li>
            <li> I read about the Ageless Vitality line before this product was available on the market in Allure Magazine (I believe).  </li>
            <li> and I was hesitant to continue using the product given that others had experienced similar effects.  </li>
            <li> The scent was light and when applied, it felt light on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice significant difference after week 1 compared to after week 4.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well this system would work for deep lines and wrinkles, but it was pretty great for fine ones.</li>
            <li> You might not feel as special buying CVS moisturizers, but truth be known, the ingredients are often comparable.</li>
            <li> but it was a good present.</li>
            <li> I have only good things to say about the product as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was not in the least impressed.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t an effect that faded quickly once the product evaporated or wore off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> as I get older, I am more aware of how important it is to protect my skin from the sun&#x27;s damaging rays.  </li>
            <li> I love that it makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I will say that my skin feels softer and brighter, but I can&#x27;t say I see any real difference in fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> love it and the scent of the facial cream is pleasant and the SPF is an added bonus that is helpful in preventing further damage.  </li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and these products calm my skin and the brightening effect from the moisturizer reduces redness.  </li>
            <li> so it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> If your skintone tends to be ruddy, this might be a good thing, but it&#x27;s not very flattering if you have sallow skin.      </li>
            <li> With only a light amount of daytime make-up I go out into the world with more self-confidence.</li>
            <li> After using two month&#x27;s worth of this product, what I saw was:    1)</li>
            <li> best thing that&#x27;s happened to me is hearing several friends tell me I&#x27;ve been looking great lately and asking if I&#x27;ve done something different to myself.</li>
            <li> Honestly though my wife looks much younger than her years</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin as many of the reviewers seem to so</li>
            <li> Once the serum was applied, I used the fresh smelling anti-aging lotion and applied it all over my face.</li>
            <li> It works better if you use more bio-mineral concentrate, so you always run the risk of running out of one component of this product line before you use the up the other.    </li>
            <li> I have used it for about 3-4 weeks and the first thing I noticed was it was not greasy and soaked into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> It was not as dry or flaky, had a good color and also seemed a better texture, a little more youthful feeling.  </li>
            <li> You must mix the two products in the package together for use, and this makes it tricky to get the right amount.</li>
            <li> so maybe she wasn&#x27;t the right person to try it on.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful day time moisturizer, The small tubes, the bio-mineral complex makes my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> After a couple weeks though I noticed a very real difference in my skin appearance and feel.  </li>
            <li> Not so great, so I checked out the ingredients list to see what was going on, and to my surprise,  Aveeno, who promotes itself as a \\&quot;Pioneer in Active Naturals\\&quot;, is about as natural as a hot dog.  </li>
            <li> You just push the top and enough for your face comes out.</li>
            <li> Price seemed a bit higher but maybe this is a testing size rather than a selling sized package.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin feel soft and smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> (unless you are using similar products)    I did not see more definition in my face or a change in my jawline.  </li>
            <li> I can really see and feel the difference it has made in my skin!  </li>
            <li> I used the day cream consistently for about three months.      </li>
            <li> (The third month produced even better results than month two).  </li>
            <li> Using the white cream without the presence of chemical sunscreens might be interesting.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if people have read this review up to this point, they&#x27;re probably wondering why I only gave it three stars.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using Aveeno Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day Treatment</li>
            <li> When the first signs of a rash broke out around my mouth</li>
            <li> You may be able to access them with coupons from some Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond stores or your local grocery store.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t apply consistently for four weeks.</li>
            <li> And that is exactly what happened.  </li>
            <li> I believe that it can probably maintain your current skin condition and would be a good part of your daily skin treatment regime.  </li>
            <li> When I first started to use this system, I thought it didn&#x27;t offer anything more than a standard off-the-shelf decent moisturizer.   </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be as positive about the promised rejuvenation.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but much better than paying for a spa treatment!</li>
            <li> I certainly recommend Aveeno Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day</li>
            <li> The daily moisturizer was not sticky or oily and was fine under my make-up.  </li>
            <li> but overall, it did not reduce the look of fine lines/wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a little handy pumping bottle.</li>
            <li> The actual moisturizer smelled great, but was a bit heavy for my skin.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this as I&#x27;m a fan of the brand.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference on the wrinkles</li>
            <li> and she really likes the effects</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try as $40 seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li> Too much cardboard and plastic.  </li>
            <li> I rated it three stars as the cream was gentle to the skin and seemed to even provide a bit of moisturizing to the mix.</li>
            <li> I bought this product really wanting to like it.</li>
            <li> recommend this product to anyone who wants an improved feeling and look.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Gentle to skin.  </li>
            <li> What is nice is that it has also added elasticity to her skin making it look and feel younger and has added a brightness to her overall skin color.  </li>
            <li> For other needs, Aveeno is an excellent company that offers solid products such as the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to work any better than any other face cream.  </li>
            <li> I might be willing to do it at night, but since this product has sunscreen, it&#x27;s clearly a day cream.     </li>
            <li> although, are there really any products that live up to that statement?    </li>
            <li> One is a small tube of super fine lotion.</li>
            <li> I selected this product mainly for the benefits it was supposed to give for sunspots and discolorations.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and feels light, and I have not had any negative reactions to the product.</li>
            <li> Overall I believe that there are better alternatives on the market such as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very light, which means it tends to wash off if you sweat even a little.  </li>
            <li> It may be best used by someone who has extremely wrinkled and tough skin.</li>
            <li> I do not believe that for me the product lived up to its price (over thirty dollars and as high as forty).        </li>
            <li> Wrinkles maybe have gone a little but not any more so than what I now use from L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re simply looking for a basic moisture cream that also brightens your skin, this will do fine.</li>
            <li> Basically, though, I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this and any other anti-aging creams or lotions available at the drug store.</li>
            <li> That perhaps it&#x27;s my new hat or nail</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t live without their scrub, their new mask, the moisturizer and the eye cream.</li>
            <li> used it on my problem areas such as forehead, crows&#x27; feet by my eyes, and the curved laugh lines near my cheek bones.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I apparently did not pay attention to the description, because I thought it was a full face-cleansing system, which I was eager to try because I currently use a variety of products on my face (including Aveeno cleansing pads, biore scrub, garnier moisturizer, burt&#x27;s bees blemish control...).</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I like the daily treatments very much.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The small tube of gray-green stuff I was told to apply just where needed, but it lasted more than a week.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased them because of a medical recommendation to use products on your skin with vitamins.</li>
            <li> the first second I applied this product, I felt relief.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> The dry, lusterless appearance was replaces by toned, fresh skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend clear tubes with calibrations for easier use.     </li>
            <li> To go from clear skin to blemished skin after one use?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young</li>
            <li> Do I see the results it offers.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, I&#x27;ve been going through some high-tech procedures that promise some of these same effects -- my jowls are much diminished, if you want to know.  </li>
            <li> I can tell you that I have sensitive skin, and this preparation irritates it.  </li>
            <li> Busy women who don&#x27;t have the time to combine the products (or would prefer an all-in-one) might be happier with something else.</li>
            <li> The deeper wrinkles at the bridge of the nose, above the lips and on the sides of the mouth may not seem to be all that much changed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as the directions go... there was nothing helpful in the package--</li>
            <li> The point of this product line is to regenerate elastin, the protein that gives skin that snap-back consistency when we&#x27;re young.     </li>
            <li> However, i have fairly sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li> This product worked great--made a big difference in my skin after just a couple of weeks of daily use--more even skin tone and even some visible tightening around the jaw line I read that the product works by making a light electrical current when the two products combine (you don&#x27;t feel it) which is supposed to stimulate elastin and collagen regrowth--I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Nutritioniste is also much easier to use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Nutritioniste also offers coupons and drug stores run specials on them, as well.  </li>
            <li> Also, the \\&quot;proven results\\&quot; did not occur with me - I have not noticed a considerable difference in texture, firmness, or reduced appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Anyone looking for a truly natural moisturizer along the lines of Burt&#x27;s Bees will want to avoid this product.    </li>
            <li> The moisturizer left my skin very greasy, and within 4 days of using it, my skin broke out in a rash around my eyes, and on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely took the lines away, but left me looking \\&quot;bloated\\&quot; around my eyes, and I stopped using that product as well.   </li>
            <li> This is an overpriced moisturizing skin treatment product that I can not recommend, and if you have sensitive skin, I would avoid buying it altogether.</li>
            <li> 29 other items are in higher concentrations in the make up of this product than the highly advertised \\&quot;blackberry leaf\\&quot; and \\&quot;dill extract\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I also like the consistency, which is more the thickness of night creams than the typical day-time use product, and even though it&#x27;s thick, it&#x27;s also non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found out how to buy just some more of the gray-green little tubes, which I will be out of long before I finish the pump jar.  </li>
            <li> The gel that you apply under the moisturizing is pretty fantastic at filling in small lines and keeping them that way all day long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve never really put much product on it.</li>
            <li> So my results are not typical.</li>
            <li> After a few days, I got puffs under my eyes that looked pretty unusual.  </li>
            <li> second product, the daily mosturizer is the one that feels a little bit heavier and you get more than you need when you push the pump top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pay to keep buying the entire system, and have way too much of the pump jar cream left over.</li>
            <li> I found that I had results much like another reviewer in that the lotion irritated my skin after limited usage.  </li>
            <li> Increased overall smoothness  2) areas where fine lines were  deepening and turning red became less so  3)</li>
            <li> The special tubes of cream that are meant to reduce fine lines and wrinkles were also a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> They apparently can and do put everything imaginable into their products.  </li>
            <li> moisturizer sinks into the layers of skin rapidly leaving my skin feeling like light and soft skin, heavy and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used at bedtime, I woke up to soft, younger feeling skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing I had done differently from my normal routine was use this product.</li>
            <li> Another is I have combinationn skin, and even though the pump jar cream feels like I&#x27;m putting on something really rich and moisturizing, the dry section of my skin starting getting dry again after I bought the second box of the product.  </li>
            <li> While the cream did not irritate her skin as other reviewers have found, it also didn&#x27;t really affect the wrinkles either.</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable compared to other over the counter skin treatments.      </li>
            <li> Money is tight right now, so I&#x27;ve skipped it the last month.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it was touted as having \\&quot;active naturals\\&quot; was what really caught my attention, and the reason that I ordered it.    </li>
            <li> my skin is experiencing all the typical changes the last few years (lines deepening, greater discoloration, etc.).  </li>
            <li> I have had success with other Aveeno products in the past, and have had mostly positive results with them, but the Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day Treatment left me disheartened, and questioning its claims that \\&quot;100% of the women\\&quot; who used it in their trial \\&quot;showed improved skin vitality in 4</li>
            <li> I am a 57 year old white female with relatively moist facial skin.  </li>
            <li> As someone with normal life wrinkles I have been suspicious of creams and other products claiming to reduce or eliminate wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have the money to buy any of these products, but found that Relastin and Vitality were very expensive...and with little or no results after trying them each for over a month.  </li>
            <li> For Aveeno to create such a fine product but pay for someone to package it so poorly is a shame.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I needed four little tubes instead of one bigger tube and there was just too much box and plastic for me.</li>
            <li> If I am the slightest bit careless, and get any of these products near my eyelids, they sting, until I wash them clean.</li>
            <li> The natural products that Aveeno claims in its advertising are a whopping list of two items (other than water), and are the 30th and 31st of 37 ingredients on the ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> B001N8G8D6 RoC, Retinol Correxion, Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30, 1 fl oz]] which has produced better than average results over the past few years.  </li>
            <li> first follow \\&quot;quickly\\&quot; by the thick, white cream.</li>
            <li> The smaller tubes are hard to figure out how much you have used or that is left after a couple of spot uses.  </li>
            <li> It may sound pathetic since its only a two step process, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s others out there just like me.</li>
            <li> I am not generally the type of person who uses daily mosturizer and often fear the numerous bottles that other skin care treatments want to give you in order to keep yourself looking young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like other reviewers, I feel that the small tubes could have been combined into one larger tube, and that the packaging is very wasteful.</li>
            <li> However, I will say that my wife does not have a lot of wrinkles to begin with, so she made of not noticed minor differences.  </li>
            <li> There is not much that is \\&quot;natural\\&quot; about this product, and I feel as though the tag line claiming as such borders on deceptive advertising.  </li>
            <li> Certainly no one has said to me, what are you using, you look younger.    </li>
            <li> The serum immediately filled my creases an took away those random dry spots.</li>
            <li> The other part is a daily mosturizing lotion with sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not surprised, but you can&#x27;t blame a girl for trying!     </li>
            <li> A big box that opens like a book, with plastic molds individually holding a pump dispenser of lotion and a bunch of little tubes.  </li>
            <li> There are comparable priced anti wrinkle creams from other brands but some of them do not have the same refined consistency to their creams that I have found in the Aveeno line.</li>
            <li> The lotion tends to dry out inside it, meaning you end up with dried-up clumps on your face.    </li>
            <li> B001459IEE Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 18 Ounce Pump]].</li>
            <li> I nearly gave it three because of the poor, nearly absent directions for use as well as the wretched packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only do I think the wrinkles are a bit less noticeable</li>
            <li> I actually thought this was working, once I re-did the instructions a little.  </li>
            <li> Problem is, the bigger pump jar lasts way longer than four weeks, way longer than the four little tubes.  </li>
            <li> Also, the little tubes of \\&quot;biomineral concentrate\\&quot; last a lot longer than week.</li>
            <li> only complaint is with the daily mosturizer product.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have also broken out in an unusual number of pimples for a woman my age, and, to add insult to injury, they itch.  </li>
            <li> Even by using heavy kitchen scissors I struggled to get the plastic wrapper open.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also curious to see how the nighttime version of this product works.  </li>
            <li> I just thank them and tell them no, not really.</li>
            <li> I was curious to see how this product stands up to its claims.</li>
            <li> So I think it rather unlikely that any benefits of Aveeno would make themselves visible in my situation, and, perhaps, I ought not to be trying this product right now, or at any time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes first off in a fairly large box for the product inside, with unneeded extra plastic packaging inside, and four irritating, inconvenient, wasteful little tubes, non-see through, that hold the &#x27;biomineral concentrate.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers</li>
            <li> And yes, like other reviewers have said, the packaging seems wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after about four or five days I observed an improvement to the skin tone on the Aveeno side, so I began using it around both eyes and other wrinkled parts of my 66 year-old face.</li>
            <li> Although I cannot report on the Biomineral Concentrate as I have just recently tried this system but the Rejuvenating Day Moisture does not seem to penetrate my skin and leaves a greasy residue which made my skin look unbelievably oily.  </li>
            <li> I try a variety of things to soften the blow and am most often disappointed.</li>
            <li> I also think the product is extremely overpriced, and I will not be purchasing once this runs out.</li>
            <li> Turns out, this is just a moisturizing system that claims to have \\&quot;active naturals\\&quot; to \\&quot;recharge elastin-deficient skin\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As other users have already remarked, I can&#x27;t see why the &#x27;biomineral concentrate&#x27; can&#x27;t be mixed in with the moisturizer, or at least packaged in one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find any facial cream with spf.  </li>
            <li> The next day I noticed small little bumps on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> but I wish the small tubes were a little bigger as I ran out of those two weeks into the four week supply.</li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes have diminished!I am a man in my fifties who doesn&#x27;t want surgery.</li>
            <li> It almost feels invisible putting it on and a very little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> (I wish I had written down the date I started using the product, but I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> So I decided to just spread a very thin layer over my whole face.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the price, which would be a steal for a wrinkle eraser, is a little much for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this item last weekend and started using it as directed thinking it would work no better than a drawer full of Avon and Clinique products that I already have tried and been disappointed with in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After three and a half weeks of using this product my skin is irritated with a reddish hue.  </li>
            <li> This is not to say I&#x27;m unhappy with the product, and I actually like that it uses natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It uses typical chemical sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> With the sunscreen, makeup, and the summer heat, I felt like my face was a slippery mess.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product before traveling and forgot half of it at home (rejuvenating day moisturizer with blackberry and dill) and half (the green tubes) in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> The stuff in the little tubes is dark green.  </li>
            <li> Despite the overly chemical ridden list of ingredients, how the product works is really the reason to review the product, and that left me extremely disappointed as well.  </li>
            <li> This is a little bit heavier going on.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how this compares to other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to use the stuff in the little tubes on problem areas, then use the lotion all over your face.  </li>
            <li> I find the hard container of the white secondary lotion to be ludicrous.  </li>
            <li> It seems crazy to have so much packaging for face cream.    </li>
            <li> Once it is on however, you do not have that cakey, makupy feeling that you often get with heavy sunscreen or</li>
            <li> IMO, this is too much trouble for the morning, when I&#x27;m rushing out of the house.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few weeks since my order arrived.</li>
            <li> Not very effective as sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Immediately I saw a textural and youthfulness return to my dry tired looking skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure how it feels</li>
            <li> Not sure.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product, it is expensive however this package last almost 3 months</li>
            <li> Aveeno Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day Treatment comes bearing excessive promises, and excessive packaging.  </li>
            <li> treatment comes in two parts: a small tube of grayish-green ointment goes on the wrinkled area</li>
            <li> I gave the  Aveeno Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day Treatment 1 star because I was not able to give it 0.  </li>
            <li> In the treatment package, I felt that there was a small amount of the Step 1 Biomineral Concentrate compared to the night cream.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was unable to continue use of this product since it irritated my skin so much.</li>
            <li> I will admit that since I do not have wrinkles that effects would be hard to judge, but my aunt tried the product with me</li>
            <li> The packaging sucks.  </li>
            <li> I hope some else has already mentioned this, or at least this helps to inform someone else&#x27;s opinion.    </li>
            <li> Wrinkles began to slowly soften and disappear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The amount of packaging is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I don&#x27;t want to give a bad review because I didn&#x27;t follow through on the regimen.  </li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s not necessarily all bad.  </li>
            <li> I never leave feedback on items but hated this product so much that I felt I had to write something.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> The reaction I had to both products was disappointing, to say the least.    </li>
            <li> sorry, but it does not work....</li>
            <li> That expensive department store product doesn&#x27;t create these side effects, so, perhaps, you get what you pay for in this case?</li>
            <li> retired, after all -- where I&#x27;ve been treating my skin with some very expensive department store products, which, hopefully, had already achieved the results Aveeno promises.  </li>
            <li> bad things:</li>
            <li> Not so painful that I needed to wash it off, but almost there.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is so easy to use and it feels very nice on your face. I am not generally the type of person who uses daily mosturizer and often fear the numerous bottles that other skin care treatments want to give you in order to keep yourself looking young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is two steps. One is a small tube of super fine lotion. It almost feels invisible putting it on and a very little bit goes a very long way. It is very light and you don&#x27;t feel it once it is on your face. The other part is a daily mosturizing lotion with sunscreen in it. It comes in a little handy pumping bottle. You just push the top and enough for your face comes out. This is a little bit heavier going on. Once it is on however, you do not have that cakey, makupy feeling that you often get with heavy sunscreen or mosturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband said he noticed a difference in my face. I don&#x27;t know that I did but I guess my husband said I looked more smooth. Works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is with the daily mosturizer product.&lt;br /&gt;This second product, the daily mosturizer is the one that feels a little bit heavier and you get more than you need when you push the pump top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, Nice feeling when it is going on and once it has been on, noticable difference to my husband. I&#x27;m pretty happy with this and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Mom was very happy with it. It smells good, comes in a nice package. I&#x27;m not exactly sure how it feels but she doesn&#x27;t use a lot of different things but she definitely did not mind using this frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry I don&#x27;t have additional insight but it was a good present.</li>
            <li> After three and a half weeks of using this product my skin is irritated with a reddish hue.  Not so great, so I checked out the ingredients list to see what was going on, and to my surprise,  Aveeno, who promotes itself as a \\&quot;Pioneer in Active Naturals\\&quot;, is about as natural as a hot dog.  There are about 25 or so, scientific chemically based unpronounceable ingredients, and almost at the end, you&#x27;ll find the Blackberry leaf and Dill extract. I looked up on Google and found that in the 1920&#x27;s about 1 in eight hundred people got cancer.  Today about 9 out of 10 people get some form of cancer.  In part, this comes from the unregulated cosmetic industry - make-up, creams, lotions, hair products, etc. They apparently can and do put everything imaginable into their products.  Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> With all the products and claims out there, it is great to find one that actually performs as promised.</li>
            <li> I felt that the Aveena Ageless Vitality treatment was a great moisturizer, but I need more time to determine if it truly reduces wrinkles. However, so far, so good! :)</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this as I&#x27;m a fan of the brand.  After two weeks using of Step 1 (intensive step) I started to break out where I was applying the step one serum.  It has a neutral smell and blends in well.  I just can&#x27;t make it through the last two weeks with all the skin irritation.  I do like the day lotion with SPF!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I don&#x27;t want to give a bad review because I didn&#x27;t follow through on the regimen.  A two step process puts me over the edge, especially in the morning.  I just don&#x27;t have time for products like these and one is supposed to follow through on doing it day after day, which I also didn&#x27;t do.  If you can follow the regimen, I would say the creams are smooth and feel nice on your skin, but I don&#x27;t know if they work since I was so sporadic about my use of them.  It may sound pathetic since its only a two step process, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s others out there just like me.</li>
            <li> I selected this product mainly for the benefits it was supposed to give for sunspots and discolorations. I&#x27;m young so I&#x27;m in between the acne and the wrinkle years. I do use an anti-wrinkle cream on my eyes as a preventative measure. I used the product on the problem areas: spots, discolorations, between the eyes, and the lovely smile parenthesis around the mouth. Like other reviewers I did experience irritation. I am not a regular user of sunscreen (shame on me, I know) so I&#x27;m not sure how this compares to other sunscreens. I did find the sunscreen greasy though. With the sunscreen, makeup, and the summer heat, I felt like my face was a slippery mess. And yes, like other reviewers have said, the packaging seems wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all said, I did notice the spots improve a bit. Spots from acne scars and sun did seem to blend in more than before I used the product. I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference on the wrinkles but like I mentioned mine are not very deep. Overall I would not be likely to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased after trying this system. Immediately I saw a textural and youthfulness return to my dry tired looking skin. I found that after one month I can look better,and even friends and lovers are commenting on the change in my complection.My upper eyelids have improved in appearance.The dark circles under my eyes have diminished!I am a man in my fifties who doesn&#x27;t want surgery.I am going to continue this product!</li>
            <li> I always use moisturizer with a sunscreen to prevent skin damage. But this product promises to go beyond prevention to rejuvenation in two steps. Step one is to apply a separate cream to problem areas, such as wrinkles and age spots, before applying the moisturizer.     I have only good things to say about the product as a moisturizer. I love that it makes my skin feel very soft. I also like the consistency, which is more the thickness of night creams than the typical day-time use product, and even though it&#x27;s thick, it&#x27;s also non-greasy and absorbs quickly. I also like that it contains a good sunscreen, which I&#x27;m sure is excellent for prevention.    I can&#x27;t be as positive about the promised rejuvenation. My jawline, lines and wrinkles, and age spots have remained unchanged. They are not the promised firmer, reduced and diminished, respectively. I&#x27;m really not surprised, but you can&#x27;t blame a girl for trying!     So to recap, this is a great moisturizer. Unfortunately, the price, which would be a steal for a wrinkle eraser, is a little much for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I actually thought this was working, once I re-did the instructions a little.  The small tube of gray-green stuff I was told to apply just where needed, but it lasted more than a week.  So I decided to just spread a very thin layer over my whole face.  Each tube is supposed to last a week. Problem is, the bigger pump jar lasts way longer than four weeks, way longer than the four little tubes.  So I bought another one of this product, in part because I know you sometimes need more than one of a particular product to give it a good try.    I haven&#x27;t found out how to buy just some more of the gray-green little tubes, which I will be out of long before I finish the pump jar.  So that&#x27;s one problem.    Another is I have combinationn skin, and even though the pump jar cream feels like I&#x27;m putting on something really rich and moisturizing, the dry section of my skin starting getting dry again after I bought the second box of the product.  Do I see the results it offers.  Maybe.  Not sure.  Certainly no one has said to me, what are you using, you look younger.    I think, for all these problems, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again - UNLESS I do find some of the gray-green stuff sold separately.  It doesn&#x27;t pay to keep buying the entire system, and have way too much of the pump jar cream left over.</li>
            <li> Jeff, my husband, handed me this product to test.  So, I tried it and here are my results.     I have used it for about 3-4 weeks and the first thing I noticed was it was not greasy and soaked into my skin quickly.  A good thing for under makeup prep in AMs.  The smaller tubes are hard to figure out how much you have used or that is left after a couple of spot uses.  I&#x27;d recommend clear tubes with calibrations for easier use.     I will say that my skin does feel smoother and silky.  Wrinkles maybe have gone a little but not any more so than what I now use from L&#x27;Oreal.  Price seemed a bit higher but maybe this is a testing size rather than a selling sized package.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful day time moisturizer, The small tubes, the bio-mineral complex makes my skin silky smooth.  I have Rosacea and these products calm my skin and the brightening effect from the moisturizer reduces redness.  I recommend this product, it is expensive however this package last almost 3 months so it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought me this for Mother&#x27;s Day...she said 100% of women see a difference...we took before pics...After 4 weeks we saw no difference...The brown spots were still there...the only thing i can say is that the pump is well designed that you do get every last drop of lotion out of it....sorry, but it does not work....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product and would not use it again.  The amount of packaging is ridiculous.  A big box that opens like a book, with plastic molds individually holding a pump dispenser of lotion and a bunch of little tubes.  It seems crazy to have so much packaging for face cream.    You&#x27;re supposed to use the stuff in the little tubes on problem areas, then use the lotion all over your face.  IMO, this is too much trouble for the morning, when I&#x27;m rushing out of the house. I might be willing to do it at night, but since this product has sunscreen, it&#x27;s clearly a day cream.     The stuff in the little tubes is dark green.  If your skintone tends to be ruddy, this might be a good thing, but it&#x27;s not very flattering if you have sallow skin.      I didn&#x27;t care for the pump dispenser, either.  The lotion tends to dry out inside it, meaning you end up with dried-up clumps on your face.    This didn&#x27;t seem to work any better than any other face cream.  And it&#x27;s very light, which means it tends to wash off if you sweat even a little.  Not very effective as sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin feel soft and smooth and moisturized.  I believe that it also helps reduce wrinkles--however--it doesn&#x27;t eliminate wrinkles.      I do not believe that for me the product lived up to its price (over thirty dollars and as high as forty).        I personally wouldn&#x27;t consider this \\&quot;ageless vitality\\&quot;.....although, are there really any products that live up to that statement?    I didn&#x27;t notice significant difference after week 1 compared to after week 4.  For me, the most difference happened immediately with the having softer skin--but it wasn&#x27;t softer after week 4 than after week 1.    If someone was asking me for advice, I&#x27;d say give it a try if you don&#x27;t mind the price.  See for yourself how it works with your skin--i suspect it works differently on different people.  At a minimum you would probably experience softer skin. (unless you are using similar products)    I did not see more definition in my face or a change in my jawline.  I do not have visible age spots so I can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day Treatment comes bearing excessive promises, and excessive packaging.  It promises to recharge elastin-deficient skin, dramatically reduce appearance of lines and wrinkles, smooth skin texture, increase firmness, and diminish the look of age spots.  It comes first off in a fairly large box for the product inside, with unneeded extra plastic packaging inside, and four irritating, inconvenient, wasteful little tubes, non-see through, that hold the &#x27;biomineral concentrate.&#x27;  As other users have already remarked, I can&#x27;t see why the &#x27;biomineral concentrate&#x27; can&#x27;t be mixed in with the moisturizer, or at least packaged in one larger tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the promised effects, I believe I have used it for the recommended four weeks, and I do not see any change in my skin. However, that&#x27;s not necessarily all bad.  I have reached the age --I&#x27;m retired, after all -- where I&#x27;ve been treating my skin with some very expensive department store products, which, hopefully, had already achieved the results Aveeno promises.  Furthermore, I&#x27;ve been going through some high-tech procedures that promise some of these same effects -- my jowls are much diminished, if you want to know.  So I think it rather unlikely that any benefits of Aveeno would make themselves visible in my situation, and, perhaps, I ought not to be trying this product right now, or at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can tell you that I have sensitive skin, and this preparation irritates it.  If I am the slightest bit careless, and get any of these products near my eyelids, they sting, until I wash them clean. I have also broken out in an unusual number of pimples for a woman my age, and, to add insult to injury, they itch.  That expensive department store product doesn&#x27;t create these side effects, so, perhaps, you get what you pay for in this case?</li>
            <li> When I first started to use this system, I thought it didn&#x27;t offer anything more than a standard off-the-shelf decent moisturizer.   After a couple weeks though I noticed a very real difference in my skin appearance and feel.  It was not as dry or flaky, had a good color and also seemed a better texture, a little more youthful feeling.  I have bought this product 2 more times since running out and will continue to use, I love the results.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few weeks since my order arrived. I will say that my skin feels softer and brighter, but I can&#x27;t say I see any real difference in fine lines or wrinkles. This is not to say I&#x27;m unhappy with the product, and I actually like that it uses natural ingredients. And to note, I am 48, so don&#x27;t expect miracles. You must mix the two products in the package together for use, and this makes it tricky to get the right amount. Busy women who don&#x27;t have the time to combine the products (or would prefer an all-in-one) might be happier with something else. Basically, though, I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this and any other anti-aging creams or lotions available at the drug store. If you&#x27;re simply looking for a basic moisture cream that also brightens your skin, this will do fine. If you hope to see reduced lines and wrinkles? Well, maybe it will work better for you.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife to try.  She diligently used the product for four weeks.  After the four weeks were up I asked her how it worked.  She said that it did make her skin feel softer.  But it did nothing for the wrinkles.  To quote, \\&quot;my skin does feel softer, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it did anything to make me say &#x27;my skin looks younger.&#x27;\\&quot;    So, based upon my wife&#x27;s experience.  I would say that the product does not reduce wrinkles or age spots.  However, I will say that my wife does not have a lot of wrinkles to begin with, so she made of not noticed minor differences.  But, based upon my wife&#x27;s experience, I would not recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I was actually really pleased with this Aveeno system. The gel that you apply under the moisturizing is pretty fantastic at filling in small lines and keeping them that way all day long. I would purchase them separately if I could!     The actual moisturizer smelled great, but was a bit heavy for my skin. I have somewhat oily skin and after an hour of using the moisturizer and putting on makeup, I had a sheen already showing up on my cheeks and chin. That being said, it smells great and had a nice texture, so if they made one specifically for oily/combination skin I would be all for it.     I don&#x27;t know how well this system would work for deep lines and wrinkles, but it was pretty great for fine ones. A little pricey, but much better than paying for a spa treatment!</li>
            <li> As someone with normal life wrinkles I have been suspicious of creams and other products claiming to reduce or eliminate wrinkles. But I agreed to test the Aveeno Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day Treatment as part of the Amazon Vine Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the two part cream system almost daily-- except when I forget-- for a month. Honestly, the laugh wrinkles around my eyes seem significantly diminished. The deeper wrinkles at the bridge of the nose, above the lips and on the sides of the mouth may not seem to be all that much changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment comes in two parts: a small tube of grayish-green ointment goes on the wrinkled area first follow \\&quot;quickly\\&quot; by the thick, white cream. When I first started I thought it would be best to experiment by using the treatment on one side only. But after about four or five days I observed an improvement to the skin tone on the Aveeno side, so I began using it around both eyes and other wrinkled parts of my 66 year-old face. I do not look \\&quot;Ageless\\&quot; as the name of the product claims, but better and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Not only do I think the wrinkles are a bit less noticeable but my skin shows a better \\&quot;vitality\\&quot; or healthy glow. With only a light amount of daytime make-up I go out into the world with more self-confidence. I certainly recommend Aveeno Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why do I give it 4 stars instead of five? I nearly gave it three because of the poor, nearly absent directions for use as well as the wretched packaging. Even by using heavy kitchen scissors I struggled to get the plastic wrapper open. For Aveeno to create such a fine product but pay for someone to package it so poorly is a shame. As far as the directions go... there was nothing helpful in the package-- no leaflet, brochure or literature. By reading the very tiny print on the cream jar I figured out some of the steps in usage. This part of the product needs to be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I like the daily treatments very much.</li>
            <li> This is another hit for the JNJ Aveeno line, there is reduced lines with continued use, the moisturizer is really great, the consistency is not thick and sticky, but smooth and effective.  I will admit that since I do not have wrinkles that effects would be hard to judge, but my aunt tried the product with me and she really likes the effects and I have seen it reduce her wrinkles.  What is nice is that it has also added elasticity to her skin making it look and feel younger and has added a brightness to her overall skin color.  There are comparable priced anti wrinkle creams from other brands but some of them do not have the same refined consistency to their creams that I have found in the Aveeno line.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Aveeno Ageless Vitality line of products for about a year now.  I can really see and feel the difference it has made in my skin!  This Day lotion has 30spf!  It&#x27;s hard to find any facial cream with spf.  And the best yet, 100% of women notice a difference!!  What can I say, the facts say it all.</li>
            <li> I am not one to buy into product hype, often because I simply can&#x27;t afford to.  I read about the Ageless Vitality line before this product was available on the market in Allure Magazine (I believe).  I thought I would give it a try as $40 seemed reasonable. I used the day cream consistently for about three months.      My opinion is that this product works wonderfully for firmness and an overall smoother complexion.  I&#x27;m going on 38, so my skin is experiencing all the typical changes the last few years (lines deepening, greater discoloration, etc.).  The point of this product line is to regenerate elastin, the protein that gives skin that snap-back consistency when we&#x27;re young.     After using two month&#x27;s worth of this product, what I saw was:    1) Increased overall smoothness  2) areas where fine lines were  deepening and turning red became less so  3) Greater resiliency and firmness    Have all my fine lines disappeared?  No, but I saw greater improvement the longer I used it (The third month produced even better results than month two).  Money is tight right now, so I&#x27;ve skipped it the last month.  Do I regret no using it?  Yes.  I&#x27;m also curious to see how the nighttime version of this product works.  Using the white cream without the presence of chemical sunscreens might be interesting.    I&#x27;m sure if people have read this review up to this point, they&#x27;re probably wondering why I only gave it three stars.  I&#x27;ll list the reasons here:    1) The packaging sucks.  Too much cardboard and plastic.  I find the hard container of the white secondary lotion to be ludicrous.  You can&#x27;t get the top off, so you have no idea if there&#x27;s product in there after the pump stops working.    2) It uses typical chemical sunscreens.  I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but any perspiration sends that into my eyes and irritates the heck out of them.  I&#x27;d like them to work on using gentler sunscreens    3) I suspect that the 28 day claim on the packing is correct if you use all three versions of this product: the day cream, the night cream, and the eye cream.  Suddenly the $40 pricing jumps to over $120, and maybe misleads consumers a bit.  I hope some else has already mentioned this, or at least this helps to inform someone else&#x27;s opinion.    4) It works better if you use more bio-mineral concentrate, so you always run the risk of running out of one component of this product line before you use the up the other.    So, if you are looking for a skin regimen to give springiness back to your skin, along with a smoother texture, I definitely recommend this product.  If you want it to obliterate all your fine lines and discoloration, I recommend using it in tandem with a good retinol product that you apply at night.</li>
            <li> I never leave feedback on items but hated this product so much that I felt I had to write something.  Although I cannot report on the Biomineral Concentrate as I have just recently tried this system but the Rejuvenating Day Moisture does not seem to penetrate my skin and leaves a greasy residue which made my skin look unbelievably oily.  I gave the  Aveeno Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day Treatment 1 star because I was not able to give it 0.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I found that I had results much like another reviewer in that the lotion irritated my skin after limited usage.  However, i have fairly sensitive combination skin and I was hesitant to continue using the product given that others had experienced similar effects.  I cannot attest to its effectiveness in rejuvenating skin or making your face more youthful.</li>
            <li> When I first started using Aveeno Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day Treatment I was not in the least impressed. In fact, I thought my skin looked like it had more wrinkles. But, I gave it some time and gradually I actually began noticing a big difference. Wrinkles began to slowly soften and disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer sinks into the layers of skin rapidly leaving my skin feeling like light and soft skin, heavy and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing that&#x27;s happened to me is hearing several friends tell me I&#x27;ve been looking great lately and asking if I&#x27;ve done something different to myself. I just thank them and tell them no, not really. That perhaps it&#x27;s my new hat or nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my closest friends I&#x27;ve shared the wonderful news about Aveeno Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day Treatment.</li>
            <li> I was curious to see how this product stands up to its claims. My wife is a beautiful over-50 woman with just the start of wrinkles. So we decided to try it and see how it works. For the most part we were underwhelmed. While the cream did not irritate her skin as other reviewers have found, it also didn&#x27;t really affect the wrinkles either. Honestly though my wife looks much younger than her years so maybe she wasn&#x27;t the right person to try it on. It may be best used by someone who has extremely wrinkled and tough skin. For the results, or lack of, that we saw I would say it&#x27;s overpriced at its current cost. I rated it three stars as the cream was gentle to the skin and seemed to even provide a bit of moisturizing to the mix. But as a wrinkle reducing product it left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this stuff and gave to my sister as a gift she said she was very happy with it.  She said that it made her skin look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was unable to continue use of this product since it irritated my skin so much. I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve never really put much product on it. Immediately after applying my skin started to sting. Not so painful that I needed to wash it off, but almost there. The next day I noticed small little bumps on my cheeks. The only thing I had done differently from my normal routine was use this product. To go from clear skin to blemished skin after one use? Not gonna happen. I threw the rest of this in the trash. I&#x27;ll stick with my Oil of Olay Age Defying cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this product really wanting to like it. When the first signs of a rash broke out around my mouth I hoped it was a temporary reaction. Two weeks later the rash had worsened and I returned the product.   If your skin can handle it, the product has a nice scent and absorbs quickly. The daily moisturizer was not sticky or oily and was fine under my make-up.  Also, the packaging was sort of a problem for me. I don&#x27;t know why I needed four little tubes instead of one bigger tube and there was just too much box and plastic for me.</li>
            <li> This product worked great--made a big difference in my skin after just a couple of weeks of daily use--more even skin tone and even some visible tightening around the jaw line I read that the product works by making a light electrical current when the two products combine (you don&#x27;t feel it) which is supposed to stimulate elastin and collagen regrowth--I will buy it again but I wish the small tubes were a little bigger as I ran out of those two weeks into the four week supply. The other cream is SPF 30 and makes a great moisturizing sun screen on its own. I do not have sensitive skin as many of the reviewers seem to so I can not rate it for that.</li>
            <li> I am a 57 year old white female with relatively moist facial skin.  I have used Victoria Principal moisturizing products, Nutritioniste, Relastin and now the Aveeno Vitality products.  All said, I have been most pleased with the performance of the Nutritioniste products.  I first purchased them because of a medical recommendation to use products on your skin with vitamins. I have the money to buy any of these products, but found that Relastin and Vitality were very expensive...and with little or no results after trying them each for over a month.  Nutritioniste continues to improve and add products.  It appears that CVS may even be making a mirror product that looks like these products.  You might not feel as special buying CVS moisturizers, but truth be known, the ingredients are often comparable. You will save a lot of money sticking to a product like Nutritioniste. You don&#x27;t need to spend the hundreds of dollars it costs to buy the more expensive products, when the result is not what you are expecting. Nutritioniste is also much easier to use on a daily basis.  The Aveeno products are cumbersome (several tubes to use).  I simply did not find any advantage to using them over the Nutritioniste. Nutritioniste also offers coupons and drug stores run specials on them, as well.  You may be able to access them with coupons from some Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond stores or your local grocery store. [[ASIN:B001FB5NFU Garnier Nutritioniste  Skin Renew Moisturizing Lotion,  2.5-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)]]  I wouldn&#x27;t live without their scrub, their new mask, the moisturizer and the eye cream. I only wish they had travel size packaging.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product before traveling and forgot half of it at home (rejuvenating day moisturizer with blackberry and dill) and half (the green tubes) in my travel bag. So my results are not typical. I didn&#x27;t apply consistently for four weeks. Nevertheless, when I did apply I could see that my skin glowed and felt firmer. Aveeno makes wonderful products and this is no exception. The rejuvenating day moisturizer feels sliky and luxurious.</li>
            <li> I bought this item last weekend and started using it as directed thinking it would work no better than a drawer full of Avon and Clinique products that I already have tried and been disappointed with in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my problem areas such as forehead, crows&#x27; feet by my eyes, and the curved laugh lines near my cheek bones. After only 5 days of use it is already working and diminishing the lines and wrinkles without any adverse side affects and I will be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and the scent of the facial cream is pleasant and the SPF is an added bonus that is helpful in preventing further damage.  Aveeno has made me a believer!</li>
            <li> I struggle with my age -55- and do not meet it gracefully. I try a variety of things to soften the blow and am most often disappointed. However, Aveeno has given me a reason to believe that there are ways to be more comfortable in in our skin as we move through life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first second I applied this product, I felt relief. The serum immediately filled my creases an took away those random dry spots. Once the serum was applied, I used the fresh smelling anti-aging lotion and applied it all over my face. With the remainder, I finished it over my hands. WOW! The products at once toned, refreshed and reduced the effects of aging on the skin. The dry, lusterless appearance was replaces by toned, fresh skin. Used at bedtime, I woke up to soft, younger feeling skin. It wasn&#x27;t an effect that faded quickly once the product evaporated or wore off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who wants an improved feeling and look.They won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I apparently did not pay attention to the description, because I thought it was a full face-cleansing system, which I was eager to try because I currently use a variety of products on my face (including Aveeno cleansing pads, biore scrub, garnier moisturizer, burt&#x27;s bees blemish control...). Turns out, this is just a moisturizing system that claims to have \\&quot;active naturals\\&quot; to \\&quot;recharge elastin-deficient skin\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good things: I do like the moisturizer. It goes on smooth and feels light, and I have not had any negative reactions to the product. I also like that it has SPF in it... as I get older, I am more aware of how important it is to protect my skin from the sun&#x27;s damaging rays.  Also, the little tubes of \\&quot;biomineral concentrate\\&quot; last a lot longer than week. (I wish I had written down the date I started using the product, but I didn&#x27;t and I can&#x27;t remember.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad things: like other reviewers, I feel that the small tubes could have been combined into one larger tube, and that the packaging is very wasteful. Also, the \\&quot;proven results\\&quot; did not occur with me - I have not noticed a considerable difference in texture, firmness, or reduced appearance of wrinkles. I also think the product is extremely overpriced, and I will not be purchasing once this runs out.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product through the Vine program in hopes of finding a non-greasy moisturizer that helped reduce the look of fine lines around my eyes.  The fact that it was touted as having \\&quot;active naturals\\&quot; was what really caught my attention, and the reason that I ordered it.    There is not much that is \\&quot;natural\\&quot; about this product, and I feel as though the tag line claiming as such borders on deceptive advertising.  The natural products that Aveeno claims in its advertising are a whopping list of two items (other than water), and are the 30th and 31st of 37 ingredients on the ingredient list.  That&#x27;s right.  29 other items are in higher concentrations in the make up of this product than the highly advertised \\&quot;blackberry leaf\\&quot; and \\&quot;dill extract\\&quot;. They are bested by the likes of Polysorbate 60,  Xantham Gum, Disodium EDTA, and Hydroxyethyl Acetate/ Sodium Acryloldimethyl Taurate Copolymer.   Anyone looking for a truly natural moisturizer along the lines of Burt&#x27;s Bees will want to avoid this product.    Despite the overly chemical ridden list of ingredients, how the product works is really the reason to review the product, and that left me extremely disappointed as well.  The moisturizer left my skin very greasy, and within 4 days of using it, my skin broke out in a rash around my eyes, and on my forehead.  I stopped using it, and within a week or so, my skin cleared up.  The special tubes of cream that are meant to reduce fine lines and wrinkles were also a disappointment.  While I thought I saw some signs of fine lines fading a bit, I came to realize that the ingredients in the biomineral concentrate contain chemicals that \\&quot;puff out\\&quot; your skin, in order to make the wrinkles and lines disappear.  And that is exactly what happened.  After a few days, I got puffs under my eyes that looked pretty unusual.  It absolutely took the lines away, but left me looking \\&quot;bloated\\&quot; around my eyes, and I stopped using that product as well.   While the packaging tells you touse the product for 4 weeks to get the best results, I ended my trial run with both components of the system after 2 weeks.  The reaction I had to both products was disappointing, to say the least.    I have had success with other Aveeno products in the past, and have had mostly positive results with them, but the Ageless Vitality Rejuvenating Day Treatment left me disheartened, and questioning its claims that \\&quot;100% of the women\\&quot; who used it in their trial \\&quot;showed improved skin vitality in 4 weeks\\&quot;.    This is an overpriced moisturizing skin treatment product that I can not recommend, and if you have sensitive skin, I would avoid buying it altogether.</li>
            <li> My wife used this product for 45 days and provided the following review:     The Aveeno-Ageless Restoration Treatment does not turn back the clock.  The product has a lot of pros but overall, it did not reduce the look of fine lines/wrinkles.  I believe that it can probably maintain your current skin condition and would be a good part of your daily skin treatment regime.  Here are my pros &amp; cons:    Pros:  Gentle to skin.  I have very sensitive skin.  After using this product, I didn&#x27;t break-out and it did not irritate my skin.     The scent was light and when applied, it felt light on my skin.  Price is reasonable compared to other over the counter skin treatments.      Cons:  It did not reduce the look of my wrinkles.  In the treatment package, I felt that there was a small amount of the Step 1 Biomineral Concentrate compared to the night cream.  I ran out of the Biomineral Concentrate in a short time and had a lot of the cream left over.    Overall I believe that there are better alternatives on the market such as [[ASIN:B001N8G8D6 RoC, Retinol Correxion, Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30, 1 fl oz]] which has produced better than average results over the past few years.  For other needs, Aveeno is an excellent company that offers solid products such as the [[ASIN:B004L5JCZ4 Aveeno Baby Wash &amp; Shampoo, 18-Fluid Ounces Bottle]] and [[ASIN:B001459IEE Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 18 Ounce Pump]].</li>
