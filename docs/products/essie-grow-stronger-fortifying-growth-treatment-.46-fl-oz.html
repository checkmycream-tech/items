    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
            <li>This growth treament is wonderful and solved the problem.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>I never, ever thought my nails could look this nice!</li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>So glad I did!</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, great price.</li>
            <li>Honestly my nails were fine until I bought this.</li>
            <li>I love Essie products.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product, after all it sounded like the solution to all of my nail issues.</li>
            <li>Most I&#x27;ve tried have come from beauty supply stores, and</li>
            <li>My nails chipped and broke a lot more when I wore this product.</li>
            <li>looks great without any polish on top and really helps your nails grow.</li>
            <li>so i wear this to work by itself most of the time.</li>
            <li>(And that was the most bearable</li>
            <li>I would like it even more if it actually made them stronger instead of longer though lol.</li>
            <li>I use this with OPI Nail Envy and they make my nails twice as strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly like their polishes.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>FINALLY I founded the one that works, love essie</li>
            <li>but it literally makes my nails grow 2-3x faster compared to when not using anything (or just regular polish with a top coat).</li>
            <li>My nails are the all or nothing type - they are either really healthy and grow long &amp; strong quickly, or they aren&#x27;t - they&#x27;re very sensitive to changes in health, stress, etc., so to find a product that helps to strengthen them (especially coming off of acrylics) and grow them out in a relatively short amount of time is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>However, when I was recently put on many medications that I had not taken before, it REALLY affect my nails.  </li>
            <li>The grow stronger formula I used to use would get really sticky</li>
            <li>yeah, they work, but I&#x27;ve NEVER seen a product work as well (and as fast) as Essie Grow</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Makes my nails a bit stronger when I use it, but what it really does is make them grow longer FASTER.</li>
            <li>Dries really fast/easy to use.</li>
            <li>This feels like it really helps my extra-dry fingernails.</li>
            <li>Helped tremendously growing my nails back after I ruined them by getting acrylics!</li>
            <li>Of course some are still rather weak at the tips (the damaged part from the acrylic), but the majority of each nail is in quite good shape</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but it is clear.</li>
            <li>I have always had fast growing, long nails.  </li>
            <li>The light pink color can also benefit if I am just doing a simple french manicure.</li>
            <li>My nails were extremely weak and after spending money on all different kind of nails grown polish</li>
            <li>Really upset I wasted so much.</li>
            <li>, I would wear it every day with two coats, never leaving my nails bare.</li>
            <li>Now my nails could barely grow.</li>
            <li>I have it a four however due to the fact that it didn&#x27;t work as fast as the product I purchased from store.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that I&#x27;m looking for a new nail treatment, one thats method of protection other than just layers of polish.</li>
            <li>it is mostly clear, but has a touch of pink</li>

            <li> Helped tremendously growing my nails back after I ruined them by getting acrylics!</li>
            <li> The grow stronger formula I used to use would get really sticky so I tried this bc I love Essie products.  It&#x27;s awesome.  It goes on smoothly like their polishes.  It looks pink but it is clear.</li>

            <li> I wanted to love this product, after all it sounded like the solution to all of my nail issues. I have thin nails (thin to the point where they bend in a way which reminds me of thin sheets of plastic), my nails also crack and snap very easily. In addition to this my nails grow very slow, making it so that it takes for them seemingly forever to grow out after they break. I&#x27;ve gone through over a bottle of the Essie Grow Stronger Treatment, I would wear it every day with two coats, never leaving my nails bare. As far as I can tell the only reason it helped my nails was because the extra coats of polish made my nails thicker, but my nails would still break, as well as a new problem my nails started to peal, while I had had this problem a couple of times it had never been as bad as it is now.

The bottom line is that I&#x27;m looking for a new nail treatment, one thats method of protection other than just layers of polish.</li>
            <li> I decided to take off my acrylic nails, and of course, I needed some sort of growth/renewal product for my nails. I wouldn&#x27;t say that the state of my nails were horrible, but they were definitely soft and sensitive, and peeling. I&#x27;ve used the &#x27;After Acrylics&#x27; set of fiber/strengthener from Sally&#x27;s a couple of times after coming off of acrylics, but I was out of the product and didn&#x27;t want to cough out the money for all 3 products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a number of other &#x27;growth&#x27; products - Sally Hansen, Nail Tech, Rock Solid, Formula 10, etc. Most I&#x27;ve tried have come from beauty supply stores, and yeah, they work, but I&#x27;ve NEVER seen a product work as well (and as fast) as Essie Grow Stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I debated buying a couple of times, but ultimately gave in (because I had this nagging urge every time I was in Target), and coughed up the $13 for it. So glad I did! The label claims that your nails will grow x% stronger (I&#x27;m sorry, I can&#x27;t remember the percentage) in 5 days, and x% longer in 5 days - and it DOES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed! My nails are the all or nothing type - they are either really healthy and grow long &amp; strong quickly, or they aren&#x27;t - they&#x27;re very sensitive to changes in health, stress, etc., so to find a product that helps to strengthen them (especially coming off of acrylics) and grow them out in a relatively short amount of time is simply amazing. Of course some are still rather weak at the tips (the damaged part from the acrylic), but the majority of each nail is in quite good shape and I&#x27;ve never had this reaction from other nail growth products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might just come down to my nails - that they reacted well to the substances that make up this product, but I&#x27;d definitely suggest giving it a try. I was going to invest in the Essie Grow Longer product as well, but this nifty little Grow Stronger bottle took care of both issues for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I don&#x27;t think I have seen any change in my nail growth.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT-I THINK. I&#x27;ve been using this along with an OPI nail strengthening product after having acrylic s removed.  Something seems to be working but not sure which one gets the credit.</li>
            <li> I was excited to finally get this in the mail, It actually leaves a pretty color even though its a base coat, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t help with making my nails grow or get stronger. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> My nails were extremely weak and after spending money on all different kind of nails grown polish FINALLY I founded the one that works, love essie my nails are now much harder and stronger!</li>
            <li> Noticed a change in my nails and with repetition as indicated, my nails have improved and become stronger. I use this with OPI Nail Envy and they make my nails twice as strong. The light pink color can also benefit if I am just doing a simple french manicure.</li>
            <li> Works great. My nails are longer and stronger! I have it a four however due to the fact that it didn&#x27;t work as fast as the product I purchased from store.</li>
            <li> Really upset I wasted so much. They didn&#x27;t help my nails at all and in fact made them worse. My nails chipped and broke a lot more when I wore this product. Very dissapointed. I think you only pay for the name, b.c this did not work at all</li>
            <li> looks great without any polish on top and really helps your nails grow. it is mostly clear, but has a touch of pink so i wear this to work by itself most of the time. i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails a bit stronger when I use it, but what it really does is make them grow longer FASTER. I don&#x27;t know how but it literally makes my nails grow 2-3x faster compared to when not using anything (or just regular polish with a top coat). It&#x27;s pretty amazing. Worth the price. Dries really fast/easy to use. I would like it even more if it actually made them stronger instead of longer though lol.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, my nails were a nightmare. I could literally press some of my nails flush to my finger. YEAH. (And that was the most bearable part!)&lt;br /&gt;I tried some nail strengtheners off and on, but nothing worked well enough to bother, until I grabbed a bottle of this a few weeks ago on a lark. This stuff is AMAZING. I never, ever thought my nails could look this nice! I noticed a difference after one use. Why couldn&#x27;t I have found this sooner?&lt;br /&gt;To use: Just put a coat (or two, for serious cases) on underneath your nail polish (it makes a decent base coat, so no worries) or just by itself, and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great price. This feels like it really helps my extra-dry fingernails.</li>
            <li> Honestly my nails were fine until I bought this. Now my nails could barely grow. Constantly chipping and whatnot. The way people were talking about this is a big misinterpreting.</li>
