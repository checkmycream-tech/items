            <li>Otherwise, excellent product so far.</li>
            <li>Great value for the size of the bottle and price was well worth it.</li>
            <li>I also warm mine in the microwave (it feels 10x better)</li>

            <li>/&gt;Anyways, as for the oil itself, I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>and Im not bladed on the sides any more..</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using the oil to massage my scalp because it increases blood flow to my scalp in order for my hair to grow.</li>
            <li>so it says what it say that it will do which is promote healthy hair growth.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t miss out :)</li>
            <li>Maybe need to do it more often.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The coconut oil smells much better also, because the JBCO has a burnt wood type of smell.</li>
            <li>then a shippin tab that cost more than the product itself, I expect a valued customer experience.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>but I love the results.  </li>
            <li>Changed my breakage pattern on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I got this oil in hopes my hair would grow but it did more</li>
            <li>I Love applicator bottle that comes with this</li>
            <li>Hair is noticeably more manageable and stylish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased before but from a different seller, that didn&#x27;t include the applicator so this was perfect.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>YOU MIGHT SEE FASTER AND BETTER RESLTS</li>
            <li>its ok with me..</li>
            <li>Love the bottle.</li>

            <li>I love it as well.  </li>
            <li>So glad the supplied an applicator bottle as well.  </li>

            <li>love love this stuff, but you have to understand the product you are working with</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this oil.</li>
            <li>I am a straight product junkie (lol), but I am working to change that in 2013 (lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love the application container that comes with it.</li>
            <li>Interesting smell.</li>
            <li>Its challenging and</li>
            <li>I am still at the top of the bottle a month into use.</li>
            <li>i feel like it works more on my eyebrows than my scalp hair.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the applicator bottle as well.  </li>
            <li>I love it for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>What more could it hurt?</li>
            <li>but I think I like using it all by itself better.  </li>
            <li>And from what I can tell, this is definitely authentic.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s how authentic oil smells</li>
            <li>Many people complain about the smell</li>
            <li>You can rub in the product on the hair you want to see more growth</li>
            <li>Love this oil.  </li>
            <li>I want to try this castor oil because so many reviewers love it.</li>
            <li>Will surely recommend .</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>, I had a chance to smell in a store and it was much better than then</li>
            <li>I love this and the applicator bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love the ease of the applicator.</li>
            <li>and I love this product I will order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good for natural hair, the size, with applicator bottle was a good deal.</li>
            <li>Jamaican castro oil was ok.</li>
            <li>I use it on just about everything, including my Hair, eyelashes, skin and more.</li>
            <li>I love the moisture this oil gives my hair.</li>
            <li>this: 3 parts of another oil.</li>
            <li>I will be making more purchases.</li>
            <li>It has became my favorite oil and go to solution for everything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>My hair feel alot more healthy with this I recommend using head and shoulders 2 n 1 either anti breakage or the the one for athletes</li>
            <li>BUT you must poke a hole through the top to get the oil out (using a knife)</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I have 4d 4c hair love it</li>
            <li>I love that the bottle came with it.</li>

            <li>I love the smell, it reminds me of home in Jamaica.  </li>
            <li>I love how this oil makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>It was pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced new growth from my scalp where my hair was thinning out.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and product seems to be working effectively.</li>
            <li>Another great natural product.</li>
            <li>My hair is becoming thicker</li>
            <li>I love this stuff it helps your hair feel full and healthy</li>
            <li>I use this on my natural hair and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer/sealant.</li>
            <li>Works great for natural or relaxed hair</li>
            <li>So far, the castro oil Is doing a great job.</li>
            <li>but I loved it sooo much</li>
            <li>I look forward to more significant growth.</li>
            <li>The applicator made this product soooo easy to use.</li>
            <li>I did have to dilute it with olive oil because it was too strong and causing my scalp to itch.</li>
            <li>Works well on getting hair to grow but it has a strong smell to it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a good oil.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent rubbing product for sour muscels.</li>
            <li>This is the best hair detangler I&#x27;ve ever used hands down.</li>
            <li>I would suggest to use it on the scalp only using an aapplication bottle and the massage it to distribute it, if you use this method your h s ir will not smell, but if you want to use it as hot oil treatment I think its best to add coconut oil and leave it for a couple of hours before shampooing.</li>
            <li>For some people JBCO may work fine for them</li>
            <li>This is an awesome black castor oil.</li>
            <li>The Applicator is great for  concentrating on specific areas.</li>
            <li>If they were giving a product away for free then that would be one thing</li>
            <li>The oil has been working great for growing my edges back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Along with living a Allergy pill popping, perfume-dye free, lukewarm shower taking life-</li>
            <li>I am using this to regrow my over plucked brows and the regrowth is amazing, and fast.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased because I read great reviews on how it can help grow and thicken your hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend this because it is a great product that brings your hair back to life.</li>
            <li>There were others on youtube that said they experienced the same thing</li>
            <li>I hear this is a great oil to use to grow my edges back.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my eyelashes too, though I don&#x27;t use it near my eyes too much because I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product and my hair grows and grows and grows and grows and grows and grows.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Wow this was really good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waiting to use this product and it arrived right on time to adopt into my healthy hair routine.</li>
            <li>I use it on my scalp, when I do hot oil treatments, and sometimes on my eyebrows and eyelashes!!</li>
            <li>I am honest is not bad smell... and is really working..</li>
            <li>Gave some to my husband and mother and they live its many uses too!</li>
            <li>it better work fast!</li>
            <li>I have seen significant improvements with my hair.  </li>
            <li>the original.</li>
            <li>but I love this stuff I only use this on my ends and scalp and use the beauty solid castor oil on my hair perfect combo</li>
            <li>Great for ethnic or dry hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff right here is the bomb.com!</li>
            <li>However, I am giving myself until October 1st to determine if this product is really working as many of these individuals have described.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my curly hair and have noticed that my hair feels thicker and full of volume.</li>
            <li>The oil keeps my hair nice a soft, also it moisturizes my hair.</li>
            <li>Not quite sure this really works for growth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to this wonderful oil, they are growing slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>True?</li>
            <li>I have been using it since January faithfully (nightly) and still have a good amount left</li>
            <li>but my crown really needs some love...</li>
            <li>Good product for helping hair stay moisturized and come back thicker.</li>
            <li>it will sweet almond oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good things about this and had to finally try it out</li>
            <li>No edges run in my family and it didn&#x27;t help that i was wearing full head sewins</li>
            <li>This oil has really moisturized and has kept my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this product for hair growth the package was put together very well .</li>
            <li>I went from a buzz cut to shoulder length hair faster than I thought I would, and I really think that it&#x27;s because the JBCO has protected my hair from getting as many split ends.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>This product is great so far, i have seen new hair growth in my temple area.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for hair, personally it smells like kerosene but that shows that its truly pure and organic, i had used one that a friend brought from Jamaica</li>
            <li>Luckily it tends to dissipate over time, so I&#x27;d recommend adding it to your hair before bed and then wrapping your hair and letting it sit so it does not get on your pillows.</li>
            <li>It has really made my skin look and feel good &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>This oil is super</li>
            <li>The oil shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>My item came really quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this oil better than the regular castor oil.  </li>
            <li>The seller was quick and I got my shipment within 2 days.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that an applicator bottle came with the Jamaican black castor oil because it makes applying the oil very easy to use on your scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the castor oil is great, but the applicator bottle you receive is not the same size as the castor oil bottle, it is much much smaller that the picture suggests.</li>
            <li>And no lie, no over exaggeration, in two weeks I went from barely able to comb my edges to be able to do flat twists on them!</li>
            <li>I use this on my scalp to make my new growth more manageable and thicken up my hair.</li>
            <li>But my new growth is much more manageble using this on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I use this product for my hair and though it keeps it from getting dry, it is a bit thinker than I had anticipated, but that could be a good thing because my hair would stay moisturized longer.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised to see that this product wasn&#x27;t runny like most hair oils.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li>Definitely will order more!</li>
            <li>I mixed it with vitamin E and grapeseed oil, and I absolutely love how it feels on my scalp!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much either!!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li>I honestly was not expecting much of a difference, however I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>The smell takes a little getting use to but definitely a great product.</li>
            <li>It seems more pure and whole than the lighter colored version.</li>
            <li>and it definitely is working amazing on my hair.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this product even though I had problems with the seller and sending my package back, but thankfully amazon customer service is so amazing.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Yea I look cute,, but it took all of my sides completely out..</li>
            <li>but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li>so I find myself just opening the top and pouring directly in my hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I kept my old bottle.</li>
            <li>Applicator bottle is useful.</li>
            <li>Although it does have an odor for about an hour after applying, it is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite oils in the winter for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>but honestly I didn&#x27;t see any difference in results then my prior products.</li>
            <li>If u can hang in there it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase and shipping since i cant find it on any shelf in my town or surrounding 50  miles.</li>
            <li>So glad it came early</li>
            <li>I have used it in my hair and my younger cousins hair and seems to be effective</li>
            <li>but I probably have a more sensitive scalp...</li>
            <li>The castor oil is good and what I expected.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.  </li>
            <li>The oil quickly absorbed into my scalp and didn&#x27;t leave any greasy stains on my scarf.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried other oils so don&#x27;t have a good comparison, but this worked well for me.</li>
            <li>The applicator bottle is very convenient and useful for applying to scalp!</li>
            <li>As of right now I have braids</li>
            <li>The applicator works well and releases just the right amount of oil.</li>
            <li>but I burned a hole in it right away sitting it to close to my curling iron.</li>
            <li>this product made my hair very soft and easy to manage, I also saw some growth in my hair</li>
            <li>I love jamaican black love it.</li>
            <li>I love the Jamaican Black Castor Oil and will be ordering more soon.  </li>
            <li>I also feel it works better because it&#x27;s a little potent.</li>
            <li>this is a good product it has make my hair very thick love it</li>
            <li>My new growth grew in thicker and softer and it even filled in my thinning edges.</li>
            <li>I have African American textlaxed hair and the product has helped me greatly in growing my hair thicker and stronger while keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love it,  leaves my hair shiny and soft, really like this stuff and appreciate the applicator</li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft and strong.</li>
            <li>16 oz would be ideal because with the coconut oil I get much more product for a little less cost.</li>
            <li>Well I received this very fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>and I am experiencing some very promising regrowth of my edges.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and the applicator bottle is perfect.</li>
            <li>The applicator is very useful because it makes it very easy to apply the Oil on a scalp without it being messy.</li>
            <li>Loving the castor oil, but the bonus applicator bottle was an empty ketchup bottle you would see at a country diner.</li>
            <li>Love adding this to my deep conditioners!</li>
            <li>I am pleased and will likely purchase again.</li>
            <li>first I bought the 4oz</li>
            <li>I saw growth after the first week.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly does the job right.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to tell if my hair has thickened up yet as I am currently 10 weeks post.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I dont mind it most of the time though its not a big deal.</li>
            <li>Works very well on hair and nails!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need a lot to moisturize my hair and keep it soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>I know I have to be consistent and continue using this product</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this at first</li>
            <li>IT WORKS ;)</li>
            <li>WHEN MIXED WITH WATER IN A SPRAY BOTTLE HAIR STAYED HEALTHY AND SHINY</li>
            <li>Since Sep 2012 to the present.. I use it mostly on my ends and scalp...</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my scalp really well, does the job!</li>
            <li>I love this product currently on my second bottle and the fact that this one came with an applicator is a plus.</li>
            <li>It does exactly whats</li>
            <li>Besides getting accustomed to the smell when used it for the first time, there are no complaints.  </li>
            <li>Love it and wish I could find it in local stores.</li>
            <li>After using this product my hair feels much softer!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working for me thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using JBC Oil though but already...</li>
            <li>At this point, I was willing to try just about anything.</li>
            <li>but my sister has been natural for a few years now and her hair looks beautiful</li>
            <li>It is more than enough oil.</li>
            <li>The Red Pimento Oil was a better alternative for me and did not make my scalp itch at all.</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I would suggest using it like a hot oil treatment then wash it out or massage it on your edges/napes ( leave in).</li>
            <li>The applicator bottle that came with this product ended up cracking after the first use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this stuff is any better than white castor oil.  </li>
            <li>The product has proven to work very well!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>What I found is that this is a product the you need to buy more than one bottle at a time for it to be used properly and work like you want it to.  </li>
            <li>The one that came with my order wasn&#x27;t secure, no matter how tight I screwed the top on.  </li>
            <li>I heard a lot of praise about JBCO; it thickens new growth and help repair damaged ends and all of these other good things...</li>
            <li>My new growth has been coming in thicker and it does moisturize my scalp tremendously.</li>
            <li>my hair are soft clean and have Shine...</li>
            <li>I like the Jamaican Black Castor Oil MUCH better!</li>
            <li>So use it lightly if using on your scalp and don&#x27;t put directly on your hair (unless using an exceptional small amount or after diluting in a lighter oil).</li>
            <li>so much way before she has used the first bottle.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>so my edges were pretty much nonexistent.</li>
            <li>Too early to give a true rating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, expected amazing results after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li>I would suggest you look up the process of making black castor oil and its differences from clear/yellow castor oil and come up with your own conclusion</li>
            <li>this review is purely on smell.</li>
            <li>the picture made me think the applicator was a large bottle</li>
            <li>maybe its because the pimento oil is a mixture and not just pure castor oil.</li>
            <li>Its not unpleasant and should not be noticed by others unless they&#x27;re putting their nose directly in your hair immediately after you use it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do the big chop, but love the thickness of the new growth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it that regularly, but I&#x27;ve used it a great deal over the course of a year and a half</li>
            <li>I have blond, fine hair and this worked well on my hair, though I will keep it away from my roots next time</li>
            <li>(same rule as with conditioner on fine hair).  </li>
            <li>The little bottle is nice</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this Castro oil and hot regrowth hair treatments it helps with dry hair</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the applicator bottle also.</li>
            <li>Didnt really do much for me.</li>
            <li>I have been useing this product for months now and it has really grown my hair.</li>
            <li>did not smell like the real Jamaican castor oil</li>
            <li>I use it for my hair and it works really well as a heat protectant before I straighten it.</li>
            <li>Very generous amount.</li>
            <li>It is packaged very well.</li>
            <li>My edges are growing and my hair has so much shine.</li>
            <li>but i can say that i haven seen much change since using it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil!</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair and dye my hair often</li>
            <li>but this stuff has helped sooooooo much.......</li>
            <li>This is really making my hair grow.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have a smell really..</li>
            <li>so i can&#x27;t give detail on how much my hair has grown</li>
            <li>mind too much.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It arrived in 5 days which is fast for me since I&#x27;m stationed in Germany.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I guess I appreciated it for that</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend using in your hair/ on skin alone, as it is very greasy and somewhat sticky.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and product was intact.</li>
            <li>This oil is very soothing.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>the real verdict is still out.</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>It really works and I don&#x27;t mind the woodsy smell.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to use and control.  </li>
            <li>NOTHING never seemed to work the whole 11 years that I have had my locs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flimsy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Its helping my skin and hair very well</li>
            <li>I recommend the product, but suggest you do not use too much at one time.</li>
            <li>I was smiling so much to see this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real greasy.</li>
            <li>I use it in my hair and it holds moisture in really well.</li>
            <li>Other than the smell of this product, I am still satisfied.</li>
            <li>Please note that it&#x27;s very thick (especially perfect for winter), and the smell isn&#x27;t exactly yummy, but brushes in and used in concoction with my other hair products, it works well.</li>
            <li>I got this product after doing a lot of research since becoming newly &#x27;natural&#x27; (I did the big chop).</li>
            <li>It is a little heavy, but really softens your hair, and is perfect for natural hair.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the product is of high quality.  </li>
            <li>Only giving 4 stars right now because this is my first day using the product</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really soft and strong at the same time!</li>
            <li>So far exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at one month, and I really do think my hair is a little thicker, and the bald spot in the top of my head is getting thicker.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new applicator!  </li>
            <li>Love the jamaican Black Castor oil, the applicator bottle was not the size shown online</li>
            <li>Love this black castor oil as a pre-treatment before washing with anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>Less breakage and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I used the oil on my scalp, particularly in areas where my hair was thinning</li>
            <li>The picture shows a decent sized bottle while the one that arrived is a two ounce bottle.</li>
            <li>The oil is classic and always works.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand the thought of going thru that when I get older</li>
            <li>I had waited a long time b/c ordering this and was excited to start using it once it came.</li>
            <li>smells to high hell just like cigarettes .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if asked.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone who is having a problem growing their sides out.</li>
            <li>It goes away, but if you need a protectant for your hair, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The applicator bottle is helpful because it helps u have a little more control over where u want to apply the product.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in the manageability of my new growth which is the main reason I purchased this oil.</li>
            <li>Bad thing is that it does not bring instructions on to use for best benefit</li>
            <li>This is an absolute must if you want a natural way to grow your hair</li>
            <li>Nice oil for sealing in moisture, hot oil treatments and prepoos but irritated my scalp when used directly as a scalp oil...left my scalp itchy by the third day of use had to wash my hair out coz the itching had turned into a burning sensation which was not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li>I love this black castor oil!</li>
            <li>Jamaican black is my favorite product it has been with me from the beginning of my natural journey.</li>
            <li>great oil in a glass jar, smells awful but my hair is already looking much much better!</li>
            <li>I use this as a moisturizer for my hair, if you have fine straight hair, this would be too heavy.  </li>
            <li>For some people that may seem like a long time, but being that it normally takes my forever to grow, these were pretty fast results.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I am getting new growth.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it for hairl oss and notice that my hair seems to be thickening and new growth is faster.</li>
            <li>So I have new hair growth along my hairline.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a lot of new hair growing and my longer hair looking thicker.</li>
            <li>I do see some new hair in my temple part.</li>
            <li>I rate the product 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the smell and the size, I wish it was available in a larger size for the price.</li>
            <li>I see major improvements on my hair thanks to jbco.</li>
            <li>I only ordered 1 bottle of JBCO &amp; 1 applicator , and I received 2 bottles of JBCO thank you very much .</li>
            <li>a blast from the past for most Haitians and Nouveau Haitians.  </li>
            <li>I also use it as a hot oil treatment .I will now be using this as my ONLY hair oil.</li>
            <li>My first use: I added this product to my deep conditioning regime.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a mixture of old gym shoes, musk, and an essence of cigarette butts!</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong to me</li>
            <li>Love this castor oil so nice and thick!!!!</li>
            <li>Who would have known that this famed and fabled Jamaican Black Castor Oil that everyone was talking about is our tried and true old school cureall that was usually stored in a bottle under our mom&#x27;s beds when we were growing up back in the homeland.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read sooooo many good reviews from African Americans but nothing from caucasians :(</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I have dry hair, so I was looking for something light that would give us back moisture.</li>
            <li>As far as the oil having a smell is concerned, there is a slight odor, but that I&#x27;m comfortable with.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to cut the whole in the tip of the applicator bottle to large.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and that recently (in the last several months) has had some breakage around my edges, and in the temple and nape areas.</li>
            <li>Helps aid in keeping my face clear of blemishes and moisturized as well.</li>
            <li>Had to see a dermatologist to clear acne.</li>
            <li>Maybe my damaged hair is too far gone.</li>
            <li>so ladies whatcha waiting 4 go &amp; order plus its not heavy on your head or smells THXS</li>
            <li>So, far I am seeing growth and it the product seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use a lot and it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>I going from having a wave nouveau to natural.</li>
            <li>But the benefits far outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li>and so far hasn&#x27;t helped my spouse with his hair growth.</li>
            <li>It soaks in and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I’d recommend the product, so far.</li>
            <li>, I thought it would be a heavy oil, but it was light and no odor, which is a plus because I do not like products with scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product on myself and my daughter&#x27;s natural hair for about a month now, and I can truly see that our hair has grown faster with it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 8 years.  </li>
            <li>JBCO soothes my scalp and keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am using it as a scalp oil and so far no complaints.  </li>
            <li>As far as the smell</li>
            <li>Staple product for moisturizing my 4a natural coils.</li>
            <li>Use it in my natural hair....makes it soft and manageable</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and managable.  </li>
            <li>If you need to repair hair or twist some natural hair</li>
            <li>My edges are really growin back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works well with Natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I went natural....</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>It keeps the hair&#x27;s natural oils from being depleted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural 4c type and when I straighten my hair with heat, castor oil keeps it from reverting.</li>
            <li>so she suggested I try the castor oil since she heard a lot of reviews from natural gals on how well it grows in hair.  </li>
            <li>Well as they say it&#x27;s better late</li>
            <li>I use it now on just the hair( not the scalp) and it does wonders on my ends and leaves the hair soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is starting to thicken, but I really purchased it as a recommendation for my thinning edges.  </li>
            <li>I used it once and my hair felt soft and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I use it on natural kinky hair to oil my scalp and &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; in moisture.  </li>
            <li>Yes it does have a nutty smell, but my hair grew so much longer in the short three weeks</li>
            <li>I want to start off by saying that I&#x27;m a total skeptic when it comes to hair products that are aimed to produce \\&quot;fast growing</li>
            <li>My coils are so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>I had been taking a hair vitamin (Hairfinity) to help with my journey to accepting my natural hair and the hair vitamin alone</li>
            <li>I just ended up using an old applicator bottle that I already had.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend&#x27;s hair grows so fast when she uses this mixed with coconut oil.</li>
            <li>this is my second time ordering this, but this time the smell is weaker and the oil itself is way much thinner</li>
            <li>I like it thus far, it is somewhat greasy</li>
            <li>I purchased this product with the hope of curing my adult cradle cap.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for all my natural sisters and all my relaxed sisters too.</li>
            <li>This product helps make my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>They should include an option to add-on a natural fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>I am only giving it a 4 because I still haven&#x27;t seen much growth on my hairline.</li>
            <li>However it makes my hair soft and keeps it moisturized.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell if it aides in growth,</li>
            <li>so it takes alot more if u have thick hair like me....</li>
            <li>I love how thick this oil is.</li>
            <li>I love the thickness of texlaxed hair instead of the bone straight thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Hair was thinning growing slow and she told me after using this for a month how she has notice her hair growing back and easy to manage since at times she would use it as hot oil treatment</li>
            <li>and it made my bleached blonde dry locks super soft and shiny, as far as growth goes</li>
            <li>I also suffered from dry and itchy scalp, I saw results within the first use</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to mix it with a slightly lighter oil (like coconut or olive) in order to make full use of your applicator bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was nervous about trying it because of all the complaints of the strong smell, but I don&#x27;t know who could complain about something so small when nail polish and nail remover is way stronger than this and so is coffee.</li>
            <li>So far, I don&#x27;t notice much change there, but I have not been using it long.  </li>
            <li>I keep no less than five differents kinds of lotions/creams for emergencies - none of them soothed me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m noticing a major difference in my hair!</li>
            <li>It was nicely packaged, did not smell bad like others said, and was the same size relevant to the picture.</li>
            <li>I normally use regular castor oil and my friend told me there was no difference between the 2</li>
            <li>Since going natural I&#x27;ve learned that my hair likes thick oils and Blue Magic hair grease.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be working on my hair  because I cut my hair way down (like a guy) to grow it fresh as it Was shedding like Craaazy, Every part was damaged and since I have been using it for two weeks</li>
            <li>Great quality, but the applicator bottle is impossible to squeeze.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps seal my dry ends.</li>
            <li>Purchased this castor oil to use on my natural hair, in particular, my edges which were dry and peeling.</li>
            <li>It is growing strong and thick.</li>
            <li>No other product works like JBCO.</li>
            <li>its hard for me to know how to style my hair withour heat, but I am getting the hang of flat twists :)</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not a fan of is the smokey smell that it has, other than that this product is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I love it no more dry itchy scalp!</li>
            <li>It also last long, you do not have to use much.</li>
            <li>I ALWAYS BUY THIS PRODUCT SINCE I LEARNED OF IT BECAUSE I HAVE CLEARLY SEEN THE BIG DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li>I order several for my natural hair growth and friends who asked me about what I&#x27;m using because my hair is growing</li>
            <li>So I bought some and have been using for about a month so far and low and behold</li>
            <li>Cheap &amp; can&#x27;t even be used with this thick oil.</li>
            <li>Product is thick so apply lightly.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my hair adapts to products within 6 months and they are no longer effective.</li>
            <li>Hope to notice stronger hair, and more filling in of thin areas within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>So far, my hair and scalp is really digging Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil.</li>
            <li>I used it quite frequently last year in between my different hairstyle transitions (braids, extensions, natural hair) and it did wonders!</li>
            <li>I was already almost bald and as an african american woman, I truly value my natural hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done, so don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a bald spot right in the middle of my head for years and have tried quite a few things to grow it in</li>
            <li>Typically use it as an all-day hot oil treatment or just locally on those two areas.</li>
            <li>For the past week the patches on my eyelids, under my nose and inside my right elbow have been flaring up something fierce.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s natural, curly hair had become a bit dry and her ends were breaking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all natural kinky and coily the castor oil helps prevents hair being dry.</li>
            <li>its is super thick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using it on my edges, but not long enough to say whether or not it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>not only have i noticed a slight growth but my hair feels so much healthier and stronger...</li>
            <li>/&gt;You only need a little if you are using it all over your scalp, just place strategically in certain areas and massage throughout the scalp.  </li>

            <li> The applicator bottle came in handy as well.</li>
            <li> Good because it washes out easy after use.</li>
            <li> The applicator was a plus, very easy to use for your hair and whatever else needed for.  </li>

            <li> oil is excellent and it softens my 4b, 4c natural hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working wonderfully thus far.</li>
            <li> Ok so this oil is amazing.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, excellent product so far.</li>
            <li> Great value for the size of the bottle and price was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I also warm mine in the microwave (it feels 10x better)</li>
            <li> Seller got it to me very quickly, in two days!</li>
            <li> And the applicator makes it so easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I love the application bottle,  it makes usage and storage very easy.</li>
            <li> The applicator is also great and very helpful for application!</li>
            <li> Great for hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this product and it has been great.</li>
            <li> The product came wrapped up and very secure and the shipping wasn&#x27;t delayed.</li>
            <li> The smell is very light to me and does not stink AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Such a great oil!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it came with an applicator, HUGE plus!</li>
            <li> Love the applicator with this product</li>

            <li> Love the applicator plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Works magic~</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, as for the oil itself, I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> and Im not bladed on the sides any more..</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using the oil to massage my scalp because it increases blood flow to my scalp in order for my hair to grow.</li>
            <li> so it says what it say that it will do which is promote healthy hair growth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t miss out :)</li>
            <li> Maybe need to do it more often.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The coconut oil smells much better also, because the JBCO has a burnt wood type of smell.</li>
            <li> then a shippin tab that cost more than the product itself, I expect a valued customer experience.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> but I love the results.  </li>
            <li> Changed my breakage pattern on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I got this oil in hopes my hair would grow but it did more</li>
            <li> I Love applicator bottle that comes with this</li>
            <li> Hair is noticeably more manageable and stylish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Have purchased before but from a different seller, that didn&#x27;t include the applicator so this was perfect.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> YOU MIGHT SEE FASTER AND BETTER RESLTS</li>
            <li> its ok with me..</li>
            <li> Love the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product comes with an applicator, cause you&#x27;ll need it.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love the jamaican castor oil.</li>
            <li> It ok.</li>
            <li> I love it as well.  </li>
            <li> So glad the supplied an applicator bottle as well.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous and effective product for moisturizing your scalp and encouraging hair growth.  </li>
            <li> love love this stuff, but you have to understand the product you are working with</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this oil.</li>
            <li> I am a straight product junkie (lol), but I am working to change that in 2013 (lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love the application container that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Interesting smell.</li>
            <li> Its challenging and</li>
            <li> I am still at the top of the bottle a month into use.</li>
            <li> i feel like it works more on my eyebrows than my scalp hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the applicator bottle as well.  </li>
            <li> I love it for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> What more could it hurt?</li>
            <li> but I think I like using it all by itself better.  </li>
            <li> And from what I can tell, this is definitely authentic.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s how authentic oil smells</li>
            <li> Many people complain about the smell</li>
            <li> You can rub in the product on the hair you want to see more growth</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  </li>
            <li> I want to try this castor oil because so many reviewers love it.</li>
            <li> Will surely recommend .</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> , I had a chance to smell in a store and it was much better than then</li>
            <li> I love this and the applicator bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love the ease of the applicator.</li>
            <li> and I love this product I will order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good for natural hair, the size, with applicator bottle was a good deal.</li>
            <li> Jamaican castro oil was ok.</li>
            <li> I use it on just about everything, including my Hair, eyelashes, skin and more.</li>
            <li> I love the moisture this oil gives my hair.</li>
            <li> this: 3 parts of another oil.</li>
            <li> I will be making more purchases.</li>
            <li> It has became my favorite oil and go to solution for everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> My hair feel alot more healthy with this I recommend using head and shoulders 2 n 1 either anti breakage or the the one for athletes</li>
            <li> BUT you must poke a hole through the top to get the oil out (using a knife)</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I have 4d 4c hair love it</li>
            <li> I love that the bottle came with it.</li>
            <li> I used this for a month and her hair is shiny and her ends are in much better shape.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it reminds me of home in Jamaica.  </li>
            <li> I love how this oil makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> It was pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced new growth from my scalp where my hair was thinning out.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and product seems to be working effectively.</li>
            <li> Another great natural product.</li>
            <li> My hair is becoming thicker</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it helps your hair feel full and healthy</li>
            <li> I use this on my natural hair and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer/sealant.</li>
            <li> Works great for natural or relaxed hair</li>
            <li> So far, the castro oil Is doing a great job.</li>
            <li> but I loved it sooo much</li>
            <li> I look forward to more significant growth.</li>
            <li> The applicator made this product soooo easy to use.</li>
            <li> I did have to dilute it with olive oil because it was too strong and causing my scalp to itch.</li>
            <li> Works well on getting hair to grow but it has a strong smell to it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a good oil.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent rubbing product for sour muscels.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair detangler I&#x27;ve ever used hands down.</li>
            <li> I would suggest to use it on the scalp only using an aapplication bottle and the massage it to distribute it, if you use this method your h s ir will not smell, but if you want to use it as hot oil treatment I think its best to add coconut oil and leave it for a couple of hours before shampooing.</li>
            <li> For some people JBCO may work fine for them</li>
            <li> This is an awesome black castor oil.</li>
            <li> The Applicator is great for  concentrating on specific areas.</li>
            <li> If they were giving a product away for free then that would be one thing</li>
            <li> The oil has been working great for growing my edges back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Along with living a Allergy pill popping, perfume-dye free, lukewarm shower taking life-</li>
            <li> I am using this to regrow my over plucked brows and the regrowth is amazing, and fast.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased because I read great reviews on how it can help grow and thicken your hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this because it is a great product that brings your hair back to life.</li>
            <li> There were others on youtube that said they experienced the same thing</li>
            <li> I hear this is a great oil to use to grow my edges back.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my eyelashes too, though I don&#x27;t use it near my eyes too much because I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and my hair grows and grows and grows and grows and grows and grows.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Wow this was really good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to use this product and it arrived right on time to adopt into my healthy hair routine.</li>
            <li> I use it on my scalp, when I do hot oil treatments, and sometimes on my eyebrows and eyelashes!!</li>
            <li> I am honest is not bad smell... and is really working..</li>
            <li> Gave some to my husband and mother and they live its many uses too!</li>
            <li> it better work fast!</li>
            <li> I have seen significant improvements with my hair.  </li>
            <li> the original.</li>
            <li> but I love this stuff I only use this on my ends and scalp and use the beauty solid castor oil on my hair perfect combo</li>
            <li> Great for ethnic or dry hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff right here is the bomb.com!</li>
            <li> However, I am giving myself until October 1st to determine if this product is really working as many of these individuals have described.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my curly hair and have noticed that my hair feels thicker and full of volume.</li>
            <li> The oil keeps my hair nice a soft, also it moisturizes my hair.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure this really works for growth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to this wonderful oil, they are growing slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> True?</li>
            <li> I have been using it since January faithfully (nightly) and still have a good amount left</li>
            <li> but my crown really needs some love...</li>
            <li> Good product for helping hair stay moisturized and come back thicker.</li>
            <li> it will sweet almond oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about this and had to finally try it out</li>
            <li> No edges run in my family and it didn&#x27;t help that i was wearing full head sewins</li>
            <li> This oil has really moisturized and has kept my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this product for hair growth the package was put together very well .</li>
            <li> I went from a buzz cut to shoulder length hair faster than I thought I would, and I really think that it&#x27;s because the JBCO has protected my hair from getting as many split ends.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> This product is great so far, i have seen new hair growth in my temple area.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for hair, personally it smells like kerosene but that shows that its truly pure and organic, i had used one that a friend brought from Jamaica</li>
            <li> Luckily it tends to dissipate over time, so I&#x27;d recommend adding it to your hair before bed and then wrapping your hair and letting it sit so it does not get on your pillows.</li>
            <li> It has really made my skin look and feel good &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> This oil is super</li>
            <li> The oil shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> My item came really quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this oil better than the regular castor oil.  </li>
            <li> The seller was quick and I got my shipment within 2 days.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that an applicator bottle came with the Jamaican black castor oil because it makes applying the oil very easy to use on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the castor oil is great, but the applicator bottle you receive is not the same size as the castor oil bottle, it is much much smaller that the picture suggests.</li>
            <li> And no lie, no over exaggeration, in two weeks I went from barely able to comb my edges to be able to do flat twists on them!</li>
            <li> I use this on my scalp to make my new growth more manageable and thicken up my hair.</li>
            <li> But my new growth is much more manageble using this on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my hair and though it keeps it from getting dry, it is a bit thinker than I had anticipated, but that could be a good thing because my hair would stay moisturized longer.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see that this product wasn&#x27;t runny like most hair oils.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> Definitely will order more!</li>
            <li> I mixed it with vitamin E and grapeseed oil, and I absolutely love how it feels on my scalp!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much either!!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li> I honestly was not expecting much of a difference, however I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> The smell takes a little getting use to but definitely a great product.</li>
            <li> It seems more pure and whole than the lighter colored version.</li>
            <li> and it definitely is working amazing on my hair.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product even though I had problems with the seller and sending my package back, but thankfully amazon customer service is so amazing.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Yea I look cute,, but it took all of my sides completely out..</li>
            <li> but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> so I find myself just opening the top and pouring directly in my hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I kept my old bottle.</li>
            <li> Applicator bottle is useful.</li>
            <li> Although it does have an odor for about an hour after applying, it is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite oils in the winter for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> but honestly I didn&#x27;t see any difference in results then my prior products.</li>
            <li> If u can hang in there it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase and shipping since i cant find it on any shelf in my town or surrounding 50  miles.</li>
            <li> So glad it came early</li>
            <li> I have used it in my hair and my younger cousins hair and seems to be effective</li>
            <li> but I probably have a more sensitive scalp...</li>
            <li> The castor oil is good and what I expected.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.  </li>
            <li> The oil quickly absorbed into my scalp and didn&#x27;t leave any greasy stains on my scarf.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried other oils so don&#x27;t have a good comparison, but this worked well for me.</li>
            <li> The applicator bottle is very convenient and useful for applying to scalp!</li>
            <li> As of right now I have braids</li>
            <li> The applicator works well and releases just the right amount of oil.</li>
            <li> but I burned a hole in it right away sitting it to close to my curling iron.</li>
            <li> this product made my hair very soft and easy to manage, I also saw some growth in my hair</li>
            <li> I love jamaican black love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Jamaican Black Castor Oil and will be ordering more soon.  </li>
            <li> I also feel it works better because it&#x27;s a little potent.</li>
            <li> this is a good product it has make my hair very thick love it</li>
            <li> My new growth grew in thicker and softer and it even filled in my thinning edges.</li>
            <li> I have African American textlaxed hair and the product has helped me greatly in growing my hair thicker and stronger while keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love it,  leaves my hair shiny and soft, really like this stuff and appreciate the applicator</li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft and strong.</li>
            <li> 16 oz would be ideal because with the coconut oil I get much more product for a little less cost.</li>
            <li> Well I received this very fast in the mail.</li>
            <li> and I am experiencing some very promising regrowth of my edges.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the applicator bottle is perfect.</li>
            <li> The applicator is very useful because it makes it very easy to apply the Oil on a scalp without it being messy.</li>
            <li> Loving the castor oil, but the bonus applicator bottle was an empty ketchup bottle you would see at a country diner.</li>
            <li> Love adding this to my deep conditioners!</li>
            <li> I am pleased and will likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> first I bought the 4oz</li>
            <li> I saw growth after the first week.  </li>
            <li> but it certainly does the job right.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to tell if my hair has thickened up yet as I am currently 10 weeks post.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I dont mind it most of the time though its not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Works very well on hair and nails!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a lot to moisturize my hair and keep it soft and tangle free.  </li>
            <li> I know I have to be consistent and continue using this product</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this at first</li>
            <li> IT WORKS ;)</li>
            <li> WHEN MIXED WITH WATER IN A SPRAY BOTTLE HAIR STAYED HEALTHY AND SHINY</li>
            <li> Since Sep 2012 to the present.. I use it mostly on my ends and scalp...</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my scalp really well, does the job!</li>
            <li> I love this product currently on my second bottle and the fact that this one came with an applicator is a plus.</li>
            <li> It does exactly whats</li>
            <li> Besides getting accustomed to the smell when used it for the first time, there are no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Love it and wish I could find it in local stores.</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair feels much softer!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working for me thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using JBC Oil though but already...</li>
            <li> At this point, I was willing to try just about anything.</li>
            <li> but my sister has been natural for a few years now and her hair looks beautiful</li>
            <li> It is more than enough oil.</li>
            <li> The Red Pimento Oil was a better alternative for me and did not make my scalp itch at all.</li>
            <li> I saw results within the first 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I would suggest using it like a hot oil treatment then wash it out or massage it on your edges/napes ( leave in).</li>
            <li> The applicator bottle that came with this product ended up cracking after the first use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this stuff is any better than white castor oil.  </li>
            <li> The product has proven to work very well!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> What I found is that this is a product the you need to buy more than one bottle at a time for it to be used properly and work like you want it to.  </li>
            <li> The one that came with my order wasn&#x27;t secure, no matter how tight I screwed the top on.  </li>
            <li> I heard a lot of praise about JBCO; it thickens new growth and help repair damaged ends and all of these other good things...</li>
            <li> My new growth has been coming in thicker and it does moisturize my scalp tremendously.</li>
            <li> my hair are soft clean and have Shine...</li>
            <li> I like the Jamaican Black Castor Oil MUCH better!</li>
            <li> So use it lightly if using on your scalp and don&#x27;t put directly on your hair (unless using an exceptional small amount or after diluting in a lighter oil).</li>
            <li> so much way before she has used the first bottle.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> so my edges were pretty much nonexistent.</li>
            <li> Too early to give a true rating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, expected amazing results after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> I would suggest you look up the process of making black castor oil and its differences from clear/yellow castor oil and come up with your own conclusion</li>
            <li> this review is purely on smell.</li>
            <li> the picture made me think the applicator was a large bottle</li>
            <li> maybe its because the pimento oil is a mixture and not just pure castor oil.</li>
            <li> Its not unpleasant and should not be noticed by others unless they&#x27;re putting their nose directly in your hair immediately after you use it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do the big chop, but love the thickness of the new growth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it that regularly, but I&#x27;ve used it a great deal over the course of a year and a half</li>
            <li> I have blond, fine hair and this worked well on my hair, though I will keep it away from my roots next time</li>
            <li> (same rule as with conditioner on fine hair).  </li>
            <li> The little bottle is nice</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this Castro oil and hot regrowth hair treatments it helps with dry hair</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the applicator bottle also.</li>
            <li> Didnt really do much for me.</li>
            <li> I have been useing this product for months now and it has really grown my hair.</li>
            <li> did not smell like the real Jamaican castor oil</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair and it works really well as a heat protectant before I straighten it.</li>
            <li> Very generous amount.</li>
            <li> It is packaged very well.</li>
            <li> My edges are growing and my hair has so much shine.</li>
            <li> but i can say that i haven seen much change since using it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil!</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and dye my hair often</li>
            <li> but this stuff has helped sooooooo much.......</li>
            <li> This is really making my hair grow.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have a smell really..</li>
            <li> so i can&#x27;t give detail on how much my hair has grown</li>
            <li> mind too much.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It arrived in 5 days which is fast for me since I&#x27;m stationed in Germany.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I guess I appreciated it for that</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using in your hair/ on skin alone, as it is very greasy and somewhat sticky.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and product was intact.</li>
            <li> This oil is very soothing.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> the real verdict is still out.</li>
            <li> The real deal.</li>
            <li> It really works and I don&#x27;t mind the woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to use and control.  </li>
            <li> NOTHING never seemed to work the whole 11 years that I have had my locs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flimsy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Its helping my skin and hair very well</li>
            <li> I recommend the product, but suggest you do not use too much at one time.</li>
            <li> I was smiling so much to see this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real greasy.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair and it holds moisture in really well.</li>
            <li> Other than the smell of this product, I am still satisfied.</li>
            <li> Please note that it&#x27;s very thick (especially perfect for winter), and the smell isn&#x27;t exactly yummy, but brushes in and used in concoction with my other hair products, it works well.</li>
            <li> I got this product after doing a lot of research since becoming newly &#x27;natural&#x27; (I did the big chop).</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy, but really softens your hair, and is perfect for natural hair.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the product is of high quality.  </li>
            <li> Only giving 4 stars right now because this is my first day using the product</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft and strong at the same time!</li>
            <li> So far exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at one month, and I really do think my hair is a little thicker, and the bald spot in the top of my head is getting thicker.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new applicator!  </li>
            <li> Love the jamaican Black Castor oil, the applicator bottle was not the size shown online</li>
            <li> Love this black castor oil as a pre-treatment before washing with anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Less breakage and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I used the oil on my scalp, particularly in areas where my hair was thinning</li>
            <li> The picture shows a decent sized bottle while the one that arrived is a two ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> The oil is classic and always works.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the thought of going thru that when I get older</li>
            <li> I had waited a long time b/c ordering this and was excited to start using it once it came.</li>
            <li> smells to high hell just like cigarettes .</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if asked.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who is having a problem growing their sides out.</li>
            <li> It goes away, but if you need a protectant for your hair, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The applicator bottle is helpful because it helps u have a little more control over where u want to apply the product.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in the manageability of my new growth which is the main reason I purchased this oil.</li>
            <li> Bad thing is that it does not bring instructions on to use for best benefit</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must if you want a natural way to grow your hair</li>
            <li> Nice oil for sealing in moisture, hot oil treatments and prepoos but irritated my scalp when used directly as a scalp oil...left my scalp itchy by the third day of use had to wash my hair out coz the itching had turned into a burning sensation which was not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> I love this black castor oil!</li>
            <li> Jamaican black is my favorite product it has been with me from the beginning of my natural journey.</li>
            <li> great oil in a glass jar, smells awful but my hair is already looking much much better!</li>
            <li> I use this as a moisturizer for my hair, if you have fine straight hair, this would be too heavy.  </li>
            <li> For some people that may seem like a long time, but being that it normally takes my forever to grow, these were pretty fast results.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I am getting new growth.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it for hairl oss and notice that my hair seems to be thickening and new growth is faster.</li>
            <li> So I have new hair growth along my hairline.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a lot of new hair growing and my longer hair looking thicker.</li>
            <li> I do see some new hair in my temple part.</li>
            <li> I rate the product 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the smell and the size, I wish it was available in a larger size for the price.</li>
            <li> I see major improvements on my hair thanks to jbco.</li>
            <li> I only ordered 1 bottle of JBCO &amp; 1 applicator , and I received 2 bottles of JBCO thank you very much .</li>
            <li> a blast from the past for most Haitians and Nouveau Haitians.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a hot oil treatment .I will now be using this as my ONLY hair oil.</li>
            <li> My first use: I added this product to my deep conditioning regime.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a mixture of old gym shoes, musk, and an essence of cigarette butts!</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong to me</li>
            <li> Love this castor oil so nice and thick!!!!</li>
            <li> Who would have known that this famed and fabled Jamaican Black Castor Oil that everyone was talking about is our tried and true old school cureall that was usually stored in a bottle under our mom&#x27;s beds when we were growing up back in the homeland.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read sooooo many good reviews from African Americans but nothing from caucasians :(</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I have dry hair, so I was looking for something light that would give us back moisture.</li>
            <li> As far as the oil having a smell is concerned, there is a slight odor, but that I&#x27;m comfortable with.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to cut the whole in the tip of the applicator bottle to large.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and that recently (in the last several months) has had some breakage around my edges, and in the temple and nape areas.</li>
            <li> Helps aid in keeping my face clear of blemishes and moisturized as well.</li>
            <li> Had to see a dermatologist to clear acne.</li>
            <li> Maybe my damaged hair is too far gone.</li>
            <li> so ladies whatcha waiting 4 go &amp; order plus its not heavy on your head or smells THXS</li>
            <li> So, far I am seeing growth and it the product seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a lot and it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> I going from having a wave nouveau to natural.</li>
            <li> But the benefits far outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> and so far hasn&#x27;t helped my spouse with his hair growth.</li>
            <li> It soaks in and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I’d recommend the product, so far.</li>
            <li> , I thought it would be a heavy oil, but it was light and no odor, which is a plus because I do not like products with scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on myself and my daughter&#x27;s natural hair for about a month now, and I can truly see that our hair has grown faster with it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 8 years.  </li>
            <li> JBCO soothes my scalp and keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am using it as a scalp oil and so far no complaints.  </li>
            <li> As far as the smell</li>
            <li> Staple product for moisturizing my 4a natural coils.</li>
            <li> Use it in my natural hair....makes it soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and managable.  </li>
            <li> If you need to repair hair or twist some natural hair</li>
            <li> My edges are really growin back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works well with Natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I went natural....</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> It keeps the hair&#x27;s natural oils from being depleted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural 4c type and when I straighten my hair with heat, castor oil keeps it from reverting.</li>
            <li> so she suggested I try the castor oil since she heard a lot of reviews from natural gals on how well it grows in hair.  </li>
            <li> Well as they say it&#x27;s better late</li>
            <li> I use it now on just the hair( not the scalp) and it does wonders on my ends and leaves the hair soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is starting to thicken, but I really purchased it as a recommendation for my thinning edges.  </li>
            <li> I used it once and my hair felt soft and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I use it on natural kinky hair to oil my scalp and &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; in moisture.  </li>
            <li> Yes it does have a nutty smell, but my hair grew so much longer in the short three weeks</li>
            <li> I want to start off by saying that I&#x27;m a total skeptic when it comes to hair products that are aimed to produce \\&quot;fast growing</li>
            <li> My coils are so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> I had been taking a hair vitamin (Hairfinity) to help with my journey to accepting my natural hair and the hair vitamin alone</li>
            <li> I just ended up using an old applicator bottle that I already had.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend&#x27;s hair grows so fast when she uses this mixed with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> this is my second time ordering this, but this time the smell is weaker and the oil itself is way much thinner</li>
            <li> I like it thus far, it is somewhat greasy</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with the hope of curing my adult cradle cap.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for all my natural sisters and all my relaxed sisters too.</li>
            <li> This product helps make my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> They should include an option to add-on a natural fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> I am only giving it a 4 because I still haven&#x27;t seen much growth on my hairline.</li>
            <li> However it makes my hair soft and keeps it moisturized.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if it aides in growth,</li>
            <li> so it takes alot more if u have thick hair like me....</li>
            <li> I love how thick this oil is.</li>
            <li> I love the thickness of texlaxed hair instead of the bone straight thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair was thinning growing slow and she told me after using this for a month how she has notice her hair growing back and easy to manage since at times she would use it as hot oil treatment</li>
            <li> and it made my bleached blonde dry locks super soft and shiny, as far as growth goes</li>
            <li> I also suffered from dry and itchy scalp, I saw results within the first use</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to mix it with a slightly lighter oil (like coconut or olive) in order to make full use of your applicator bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was nervous about trying it because of all the complaints of the strong smell, but I don&#x27;t know who could complain about something so small when nail polish and nail remover is way stronger than this and so is coffee.</li>
            <li> So far, I don&#x27;t notice much change there, but I have not been using it long.  </li>
            <li> I keep no less than five differents kinds of lotions/creams for emergencies - none of them soothed me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing a major difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> It was nicely packaged, did not smell bad like others said, and was the same size relevant to the picture.</li>
            <li> I normally use regular castor oil and my friend told me there was no difference between the 2</li>
            <li> Since going natural I&#x27;ve learned that my hair likes thick oils and Blue Magic hair grease.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be working on my hair  because I cut my hair way down (like a guy) to grow it fresh as it Was shedding like Craaazy, Every part was damaged and since I have been using it for two weeks</li>
            <li> Great quality, but the applicator bottle is impossible to squeeze.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps seal my dry ends.</li>
            <li> Purchased this castor oil to use on my natural hair, in particular, my edges which were dry and peeling.</li>
            <li> It is growing strong and thick.</li>
            <li> No other product works like JBCO.</li>
            <li> its hard for me to know how to style my hair withour heat, but I am getting the hang of flat twists :)</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not a fan of is the smokey smell that it has, other than that this product is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love it no more dry itchy scalp!</li>
            <li> It also last long, you do not have to use much.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS BUY THIS PRODUCT SINCE I LEARNED OF IT BECAUSE I HAVE CLEARLY SEEN THE BIG DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li> I order several for my natural hair growth and friends who asked me about what I&#x27;m using because my hair is growing</li>
            <li> So I bought some and have been using for about a month so far and low and behold</li>
            <li> Cheap &amp; can&#x27;t even be used with this thick oil.</li>
            <li> Product is thick so apply lightly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my hair adapts to products within 6 months and they are no longer effective.</li>
            <li> Hope to notice stronger hair, and more filling in of thin areas within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> So far, my hair and scalp is really digging Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> I used it quite frequently last year in between my different hairstyle transitions (braids, extensions, natural hair) and it did wonders!</li>
            <li> I was already almost bald and as an african american woman, I truly value my natural hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done, so don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a bald spot right in the middle of my head for years and have tried quite a few things to grow it in</li>
            <li> Typically use it as an all-day hot oil treatment or just locally on those two areas.</li>
            <li> For the past week the patches on my eyelids, under my nose and inside my right elbow have been flaring up something fierce.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s natural, curly hair had become a bit dry and her ends were breaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all natural kinky and coily the castor oil helps prevents hair being dry.</li>
            <li> its is super thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it on my edges, but not long enough to say whether or not it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> not only have i noticed a slight growth but my hair feels so much healthier and stronger...</li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need a little if you are using it all over your scalp, just place strategically in certain areas and massage throughout the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Start using once I got my microbraids, and started seeing results within two weeks,  actually taking braids out earlier than expected due to so much growth.</li>
            <li> I have tried another brand and can completely tell the difference in how it&#x27;s working in my hair from the other.</li>
            <li> I can mix in other oils with this one and apply directly to my scalp.</li>
            <li> I can see improvements in areas where my hair was always thin, and significant growth and thickening.</li>
            <li> so that is how I started doing an oil mixture to be able to put Jamaican black on my thin hair without it being pulled out.</li>
            <li> I had a spot on my edges that was super thin from braids that I done in August of 2013 that wasnt growing back in.</li>
            <li> Cant tell you if it works yet because it has not been long enough .</li>
            <li> You know I just have not had the product long enough to see how it is working.  </li>
            <li> Where there had been absolutely no growth (barely even hair)</li>
            <li> A minor inconvenience to the actual product&#x27;s value.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough for those results.</li>
            <li> The plastic is not soft enough to squeeze the oil out.</li>
            <li> The smell goes does not last long</li>
            <li> I undetstand the logic behind the big chop and starting fresh bk</li>
            <li> This product really moisturize the  scalp but the only  drawback is the  smell not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s messy and makes hair feel thicker but haven&#x27;t seen new growth.</li>
            <li> I have really, really dry hair and scalp and prior to using this product, I have been experiencing some thinning around the edges of my front</li>
            <li> It instantly soothes my scalp if dry.</li>
            <li> and Wow this package was tripled packaged, tight.</li>
            <li> I apply to my scalp only daily to every other day including after my wash.</li>
            <li> , I apply a little every day directly to my edges .  </li>
            <li> I use it on my daughters hair with Argan oil to blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li> Just a brief reminder: Authentic castor oil is thick, VERY thick.</li>
            <li> I was just desperate along with better hair care on my part and</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Im going to give another review in a few months as far as my growth results</li>
            <li> I will continue to use as long as I see results.  </li>
            <li> I didnt take long for it to work.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order again when I finally empty the bottle.</li>
            <li> and I even received it earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Too thick to use for any real application.  </li>
            <li> The applicator is not the same size as the bottle, only half the size if that so picture is deceiving.</li>
            <li> The only reason it is back is because the nut is roasted and what make it black is the &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; from the roasting.</li>
            <li> : I think you should dilute the castro oil with extra virgin olive oil as you may experience some scalp irritation due to the oil cleansing the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have some bald spots on the side due to I recently had braids along with</li>
            <li> The other deduction in stars (2) is for the actual smell.</li>
            <li> but I must admit I DO NOT use it regular, maybe about 3-4 times a month due to</li>
            <li> The JBCO has lasted me a long time though!</li>
            <li> I tend to use this very sparingly and blended with some essential oils to cut that smokey fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product is VERY thick and kinda sticky, I actually blend this with other lighters oils to dilute.</li>
            <li> My hair has been natural for a year its hard finding products for my dry scalp that ACTUALLY work.  </li>
            <li> And it heals my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from getting dry and breaking off.</li>
            <li> It lasts long and keeps my hair from becoming dry and brittle during the cold months...and by the way...makes my hair grow like weeds...</li>
            <li> Also this product kept my scalp from itching and feeling dry.</li>
            <li> The dry scalp has even somewhat stunted my growth.</li>
            <li> It does help my daughter hair is extremely dry</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning and dry.  </li>
            <li> This oil keeps my hair strands moisturized and keep my scalp from being dry.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about using a product that claims to grow hair, however I am pleasantly surprised it is very moisturizing and seems to be helping to grow my hair out.</li>
            <li> I could not live without the applicator.</li>
            <li> My first order was in s glass bottle and had a very thick consistency.</li>
            <li> You definitely won&#x27;t need to buy it for a long time as a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This leads me to believe that this is a lesser, watered down product.</li>
            <li> My hair was noticeably less frizzy the day after and is still so after a second washing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing long box braids right now, so I&#x27;m using it on my edges everyday in hopes that they don&#x27;t dry and thin out.  </li>
            <li> I use to have very dry and crunchy, 3c hair.</li>
            <li> cause my skin is very dry</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with a very dry and itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I use this regularly and there is new growth in the crown of my head where stress had caused it to thin dramatically.</li>
            <li> (i mix it with evco to lighten it up a bit), i&#x27;ve used it as a &amp;#34;cleanse&amp;#34;;  mixed it with a little rosemary and peppermint for my spot alopecia treatments.  </li>
            <li> and it had the same smell and consistency of texture, just a little darker color.</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> The product is ok, The smell is not that bad</li>
            <li> It smells horrible but works great for hair growth</li>
            <li> This does smell terrible lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, but can post an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a lot so for me it will last a few months.</li>
            <li> Not fantastic enough to buy again.</li>
            <li> then I expected.....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works like I expected or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it as a moisturizer for my African American natural hair, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about using this product since I&#x27;ve lost quite a lot of hair the last few years from stress</li>
            <li> so my eyebrows and hairline can get really thin from that, and putting a dab on JBCO on my eyebrows and massaging it into my hairline has made a really noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> My second purchase arrived in a plastic bottle and has very thin consistency and much lighter color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil for about 2 weeks, I am definitely experiencing less hair breakage, and my hair appears healthier looking.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> a little go a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to see if it would actually grow my edges back, they&#x27;re in very embarrassingly bad shape.  </li>
            <li> Appears to be helping my sides grow which had become bald due to years of braiding.</li>
            <li> and I Mix it with other stuff</li>
            <li> Both my friends and I use this product every other day and we have seen changes in our hair</li>
            <li> Using on five heads and due to</li>
            <li> I apply to my enitre scalp every other night and sleep in a satin cap.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair the next day.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known this came in other fragrances</li>
            <li> Used with other oils as well when doing a prepoo</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural , it made my hair thick and longer!</li>
            <li> Not weighed down like some other products.</li>
            <li> It comes in a dark glass bottle and a plastic squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> As expected the caster oil makes me hair heavy and stuff.</li>
            <li> IT left the hair shiny and it wasn&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this product.</li>
            <li> But good grief why wasn&#x27;t I warned about the smell?!</li>
            <li> but for me I have to mix it with other oil to cut the harsh thickness.</li>
            <li> It smells too odd for me to use it on my hair, so I ordered the lavender version.  </li>
            <li> I had read some previous reviews saying that the applicator bottle was &amp;#34;stupid&amp;#34; or that it &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t work well&amp;#34; etc.</li>
            <li> I like Jamaican Black Castor Oil</li>
            <li> I use Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Used a small drop on my edges daily and a small amount on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Black castor oil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I used it, and I don&#x27;t know if it helped my skin, but I like the idea of black castor oil.</li>
            <li> And on every one utube page they suggested Jamaican Black Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil and Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell a slight difference.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less shedding for the both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> does have a slight smell, but nothing so drastic, u can get use to it, as it goes away after a while.</li>
            <li> A little over priced for the process to make the castor oil black.  </li>
            <li> but it is great.it&#x27;s lasted very long because it&#x27;s really thick</li>
            <li> makes things much less messy</li>
            <li> It gets a little gooey.</li>
            <li> I just apply the Oil on my edges a little bit and on spots where I feel there needs to be.</li>
            <li> I put it on my edges morning and night, just a little and sprinkle water for moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a little.</li>
            <li> It does smell a little like smoke if used by itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to just put it on &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34; for hours on end, and then I add a little bit of JBCO to my shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little thicker than before.</li>
            <li> but I have had little hair loss since I began using this product.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, so only use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> so i put just a little in my trouble areas every couple of days and massage with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Since diluting the oil (75% olive oil and 25% castro), I have not experienced any further irritations from my scalp.</li>
            <li> If you put it in an applicator bottle by itself, it&#x27;s gonna come out like heavy</li>
            <li> It has only been approximately one month</li>
            <li> Smelly and messy...</li>
            <li> I HAVE TOLD QUITE A FEW OF MY FRIENDS ABOUT IT AND THEY TOO</li>
            <li> I use this everyday at night as well as part of my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I put it on every night and massage it into my head and within a few weeks</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and its growning but it always grows I want it to get thicker ill</li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil is the truth!</li>
            <li> This oil is very thick, so I only used small amounts on my scalp</li>
            <li> The smell is not strong in my opinion.</li>
            <li> but i usually apply on damp or semi wet hair so it not as thick.</li>
            <li> The thick consistency of the oil keeps it from running down your face when applied to your edges.</li>
            <li> I feel I use less of it because it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I do believe it is a combo of the hair vitamin and the JBCO because my growth seems to be a little faster than other reviews and in the past my hair was very slow to grow.</li>
            <li> I do use virgin coconut oil on my hair itself because the JBCO is a little too thick for me to evenly spread on my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little thick</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little thick</li>
            <li> but I am definitely anxious to see the results of my hair health in 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and</li>
            <li> grows my edges because also the oil looks a tad darker then ones in store :/</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like the small</li>
            <li> Ok I must admit that the smell is horrible but it works.</li>
            <li> No more using with my fingers.</li>
            <li> , refrigerated syrup- very slowly, in small amounts.</li>
            <li> So I add a small amount to the bald spots.  </li>
            <li> The applicator bottle is pointless.</li>
            <li> Do a small test area on your scalp because the ashes in this oil may irritate your scalp as well.</li>
            <li> not sure if it is causing my hair loss</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can trust the quality.</li>
            <li> Also 1-2 inches of growth but not sure if that is the JBCO or the biotin and trim</li>
            <li> I had and have been using the past 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> However, the castor oil itself is quite thick and messy.</li>
            <li> The itching wld usually start day three or so after greasing my scalp with it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know, not sure what this product was suppose to do to my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried multiple vitamins to help with hair growth, unfortunately nothing worked.</li>
            <li> No more chemicals for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> Thick n heavy oil, so you have to wash it out thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The plastic bottle is too small.</li>
            <li> The Jamaican black castor oil is kinda thick and its hard to style your hair after its applied</li>
            <li> , Castor oil is a very heavy oil period.  </li>
            <li> However due to weaves, my hair was getting thin along the front hairline which is disconcerting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a relaxed hair journey and I mix this with other oils to thin it out.  </li>
            <li> That made me sad and of course I dealt with the terrible loss of the empty bottle.  :)</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and use an oil-free moisturizer on my skin after washing my face, but needed an oil for my edges that wouldn&#x27;t look noticeably oily/shiny or run down the side of my face or behind my ear as the day went on (yuck).</li>
            <li> The Jamaican Black Castor Oil was very thick, but the applicator bottle helped to minimize the amount I was using.</li>
            <li> I was a little late to jump on the JBCO train but now, I am never getting off!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I decided to transition from perm to natural and my hair started breaking and shedding really bad.</li>
            <li> At least, this has been my experience.</li>
            <li> To my disappointment I did NOT see any possible results after using it for for over 4 months.</li>
            <li> I would recommend ordering this product from Sams24-7.com because they are not the least bit concerned with the customer experience</li>
            <li> Why does the applicator bottle appear at least as tall as the bottle in the picture?</li>
            <li> Another negative</li>
            <li> I know that its a thick oil</li>
            <li> Thick.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really thick</li>
            <li> thick-</li>
            <li> It is thick but you can cut it with water or another oil of your choice.</li>
            <li> It is thick and has a burnt woodsy type of smell, but it&#x27;s tolerable..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick consistency</li>
            <li> It is thick so when I want to use just the oil I cut</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick like the consistency of molasses</li>
            <li> I will not but this product again because it is to thick.</li>
            <li> And this product is making my hair thick</li>
            <li> Really thick and smelly stuff.</li>
            <li> The product is really thick, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it in your hair.</li>
            <li> this oil is so thick.</li>
            <li> It was thick</li>
            <li> The oil is soooo thick that you need an applicator.</li>
            <li> It does not make your hair greasy but it is thick.  </li>
            <li> It is thick but still</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product my hair was very thin due to split ends.</li>
            <li> I have serious dandruff issues and my scalp loves this.</li>
            <li> Bad enough my hair was already thin and hard to grow from the jump.</li>
            <li> but in this case, they have another seller shippin the product so that kinda makes them look bad even though it wasnt necessarily their customer service guys.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the smell</li>
            <li> had a bald spot from a bad weave grew it back (at-least to cover it) in about a month or 2</li>
            <li> JBCO has helped my thin edges become thick and helped with hair growth as well.</li>
            <li> It it can be thick and sticky!</li>
            <li> JBCO is very thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 4b naturalista and my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li> Yes it does have a peculiar smell and very thick</li>
            <li> I would recommend cutting it with a little coconut oil for example.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it has a faint smoke smell, but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> so it was broken and brittle</li>
            <li> Yall really had me thinking it was going to be horrible or</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic growth to my hair yet after 3 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> But I must say that the first two weeks of using this, my scalp would itch like crazy crazy crazy!!!</li>
            <li> YUCK...messy and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> i guess ill just have to wait, plus i missed a lot of days in-between</li>
            <li> so ill start again and update on that</li>
            <li> This product failed to do as promised in my opinion.</li>
            <li> problem is, with the stickiness it is difficult for me to want to continue to put it in my hair to even attempt to see if it works.  </li>
            <li> I just started to add peppermint oil and rosemary oil and Ill</li>
            <li> It stinks to me though, so I added lavender and rosemary oil.</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting off all of my hair and even going to the extent of shaving my head.</li>
            <li> So a friend of a friend recommended this product and I was desperate</li>
            <li> STINKS (as in smells</li>
            <li> I also mad a mixture that includes coconut, peppermint and jojoba oil and use that as well</li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> and since I started NO MORE SHEDDING and my hair is growing like crazy!!!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t as unpleasant as others have stated (to me).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; hair, but after a day, the oil seems to saturate the scalp, so it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> Too thick and greasy, smells awful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells bad</li>
            <li> THE SMELL IS NOT THAT BAD</li>
            <li> Smells bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this after having a bad reaction to overlapping relaxer products.</li>
            <li> The smell was bad but bearable.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use and smell isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the beginning stages of using  this product, but if nothing else the smell is bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too oily and the aroma isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> bad hehe)</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> , it makes your hair ITCH LIKE CRAZY!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m terrified :(</li>
            <li> Need some help desperately!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t be mistaken and think that it will work in a week or two because you will be greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is very thick &amp; in a year my hair grew tons!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to like this stuff, but I hate the smell</li>
            <li> Smells bad, even horrible but it works</li>
            <li> The cutomer service from Beauty Online was horrible though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You see,I have horrible eczema.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> You will get a terrible headache.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great growth oil for the hair and edges!</li>
            <li> Excellent product that really works! The Applicator is great for  concentrating on specific areas.</li>
            <li> I cannot lie...this review is purely on smell. It smells like cigarette juice and water from standing pond.</li>
            <li> Loving the castor oil, but the bonus applicator bottle was an empty ketchup bottle you would see at a country diner. That said, it still works for applying! I&#x27;m using the castor oil for hair growth and to thicken my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Love adding this to my deep conditioners!</li>
            <li> Such a great oil! All naturals should have it! I really appreciate the applicator bottle also.</li>
            <li> Everything is wonderful</li>
            <li> Purchased this castor oil to use on my natural hair, in particular, my edges which were dry and peeling. I have combination skin and use an oil-free moisturizer on my skin after washing my face, but needed an oil for my edges that wouldn&#x27;t look noticeably oily/shiny or run down the side of my face or behind my ear as the day went on (yuck). This did the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great on wet or dry hair. Please note that it&#x27;s very thick (especially perfect for winter), and the smell isn&#x27;t exactly yummy, but brushes in and used in concoction with my other hair products, it works well. The fact that it comes with the applicator bottle is a great bonus that sealed the deal! It has also aided in hair growth in the areas it has been applied. I am pleased and will likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This was a second order for my mom she likes the castor oil so much way before she has used the first bottle.  I know that its a thick oil so I ordered this one with an applicator to help her distribute the product on her hair.</li>
            <li> Didnt really do much for me. I bought this hoping to repair some damaged hair. Maybe my damaged hair is too far gone. IDK. Great moisturizer tho.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells bad but it works</li>
            <li> I have been useing this product for months now and it has really grown my hair. also i am useing it on my girls hair as well</li>
            <li> THE SMELL IS NOT THAT BAD, I MIX MINE WITH MY LEAVE ON CONDITIONER THAT HAS A GREAT SMELL,BUT IT HAS MADE MY HAIRLINE GROW IN REAL NICE I AM LOVIN IT, I USE MY OIL DAILY MORNING AND NITE.  AN OIL THAT I WILL KEEP ON MY SHELF FOR EVER.</li>
            <li> So far, my hair and scalp is really digging Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil. I love the fact that it came with an applicator, HUGE plus! I have really, really dry hair and scalp and prior to using this product, I have been experiencing some thinning around the edges of my front hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil for about 2 weeks, I am definitely experiencing less hair breakage, and my hair appears healthier looking. It looks like this will be process and I will need to be patient but I am definitely anxious to see the results of my hair health in 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and so on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I think you should dilute the castro oil with extra virgin olive oil as you may experience some scalp irritation due to the oil cleansing the scalp. At least, this has been my experience. Since diluting the oil (75% olive oil and 25% castro), I have not experienced any further irritations from my scalp.</li>
            <li> So far exactly as advertised. My daughter and I both use it and will recommend this to family as a great product!</li>
            <li> smells to high hell just like cigarettes . I have been using it for a couple of days and the smell is all over my pillow  and hood of my coat. Cant tell you if it works yet because it has not been long enough . But if i am going to have to endure this smell it better work fast!</li>
            <li> Very Good Oil and Works Very Good On Ethnic Hair.</li>
            <li> For those who want to grow hair &amp; oil scalp this is the product to get @ first I bought the 4oz but I loved it sooo much I just had to get the 8oz I&#x27;m in luv with jbco I&#x27;m one very happy customer so ladies whatcha waiting 4 go &amp; order plus its not heavy on your head or smells THXS</li>
            <li> So far so good. Its only been one week.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell......did not smell like the real Jamaican castor oil</li>
            <li> I recieved the bottle but looks different from the ones in the store and application bottle different from the one in the picture I just hope it works and thickens n grows my edges because also the oil looks a tad darker then ones in store :/</li>
            <li> The item did arrived as promised and was in good condition, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> It smells too odd for me to use it on my hair, so I ordered the lavender version.  I&#x27;ve heard nothing but great things about this oil though.  But I suggest getting Lavender or Peppermint</li>
            <li> grew my eyelashes thicker</li>
            <li> Good oil but I don&#x27;t like the small</li>
            <li> Love the applicator with this product</li>
            <li> So, far I am seeing growth and it the product seems to be working.  However, I am giving myself until October 1st to determine if this product is really working as many of these individuals have described.  It is working, but not to where I want it to be yet.  I assume that by October, I should see the results that I was either expecting or something close.  I will update then.</li>
            <li> Ok I must admit that the smell is horrible but it works. I kept my hair braided a lot and always pulled up which thinned my edges. After a month of using this it worked a miracle. The smell is a different story but TRUST me it works!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix with Mega-Tek Rebuilder after reading some of the reviews. So far it&#x27;s ok. Keeps my hair from breaking. Haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic growth to my hair yet after 3 weeks of using it. It is very thick, so only use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised!</li>
            <li> I love this castor oil I use it for my hair and it works really well as a heat protectant before I straighten it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot and it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li> hair felt great and was thicker</li>
            <li> I saw growth after the first week.  I will continue to recommend and purchase this</li>
            <li> Works well, I  will buy again.</li>
            <li> YUCK...messy and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Wow and Wow this package was tripled packaged, tight. Not one drop could spill if it tried too! Very generous amount. Love the applicator plastic bottle. No more using with my fingers. I love this product. Got this one on sale. Works well on my skin and Hair. Especially. Your hairline from braiding. Works magic~</li>
            <li> a blast from the past for most Haitians and Nouveau Haitians.  Who would have known that this famed and fabled Jamaican Black Castor Oil that everyone was talking about is our tried and true old school cureall that was usually stored in a bottle under our mom&#x27;s beds when we were growing up back in the homeland.  It works well for all things - moisturizer for hair (i mix it with evco to lighten it up a bit), i&#x27;ve used it as a &amp;#34;cleanse&amp;#34;;  mixed it with a little rosemary and peppermint for my spot alopecia treatments.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I had waited a long time b/c ordering this and was excited to start using it once it came. To my disappointment I did NOT see any possible results after using it for for over 4 months. Definitely will NOT purchase again.</li>
            <li> I had read some previous reviews saying that the applicator bottle was &amp;#34;stupid&amp;#34; or that it &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t work well&amp;#34; etc. Just a brief reminder: Authentic castor oil is thick, VERY thick. If you put it in an applicator bottle by itself, it&#x27;s gonna come out like heavy, refrigerated syrup- very slowly, in small amounts. You&#x27;ll have to mix it with a slightly lighter oil (like coconut or olive) in order to make full use of your applicator bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, as for the oil itself, I LOVE it. I used it quite frequently last year in between my different hairstyle transitions (braids, extensions, natural hair) and it did wonders! It made my roots thicker and my edges fuller...that is, till I let a friend burn the heck out of my hair -.-  But the point is, the oil works great! It smells like &#x27;ash bleh&#x27; but it certainly does the job right.</li>
            <li> I use it on my skin and hair. Helps aid in keeping my face clear of blemishes and moisturized as well. I use it on my curly hair and have noticed that my hair feels thicker and full of volume. The smell takes a little getting use to but definitely a great product. A little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell but i am encouraged that it will work</li>
            <li> I been using JBCO since April 2012 and I can see a difference.. I had to be the ones to wear a front lace wig.. Yea I look cute,, but it took all of my sides completely out.. Instead of a forehead I had a five head.. So embarrassed I tried everything that could grow hair.. Bad enough my hair was already thin and hard to grow from the jump. I searched and searched for a product that would not damage my hair any farther.. I have been using JBCO for about two months and Im not bladed on the sides any more.. I been taking pictures of the process of regrowing my hair back.. I not lying about my hair bald on both sides .. I have not relaxed it for over six months.. Just let me know if u want proof of the JBCO. I will show u .. 😃</li>
            <li> Well I received this very fast in the mail. I received it within 3days. It is packaged very well. The applicator is the same as what&#x27;s in the picture. It is a nice size bottle. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot so for me it will last a few months. When you open the jar it does have a smell but it&#x27;s not bad. You can&#x27;t smell it at all once it&#x27;s in your hair. I have some bald spots on the side due to I recently had braids along with I Have a thyroid disorder. So I add a small amount to the bald spots.  I am a transitioning newbie. I going from having a wave nouveau to natural.</li>
            <li> I use this on my scalp to make my new growth more manageable and thicken up my hair. I haven&#x27;t been able to tell if my hair has thickened up yet as I am currently 10 weeks post. But my new growth is much more manageble using this on my scalp. I have noticed a difference in the manageability of my new growth which is the main reason I purchased this oil. I only use it two or three times a week.</li>
            <li> This product really moisturize the  scalp but the only  drawback is the  smell not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> If you have thinning hair this will help you regrow your hair and patch your hair up. YES it does regrow hair.</li>
            <li> As expected the caster oil makes me hair heavy and stuff. But the benefits far outweigh the cons. My hair is shiny and finally growing, though not dramatically. It has only been approximately one month but I&#x27;m impressed with the outcome thus far.</li>
            <li> The oil keeps my hair nice a soft, also it moisturizes my hair. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I personally haven&#x27;t seen any results with my hair. Perhaps I&#x27;m not using it correctly or frequently enough but, that has nothing to do with the product. The product is excellent! Very authentic castor oil. Thick.</li>
            <li> Great product great deal , will buy again</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product!!</li>
            <li> Helped with hair growth and moisture. Will be ordering again, a bigger bottle!!</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that an applicator bottle came with the Jamaican black castor oil because it makes applying the oil very easy to use on your scalp. Then I just have to use my finger tips to massage my scalp without me having to pour the oil out of the bottle onto my hands. I really enjoyed using the oil to massage my scalp because it increases blood flow to my scalp in order for my hair to grow. I have to say that this oil did thicken up my hair and made it look bigger than it appeared to be. I&#x27;ve been using it on and off so it says what it say that it will do which is promote healthy hair growth.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in my hair! My edges are growing and my hair has so much shine.</li>
            <li> Has helped with hair and eyelash growth. Outstanding product &amp; the applicator is a wonderful &amp;#34;FREE&amp;#34; touch. Don&#x27;t miss out :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this stuff! I love how it makes my hair feel! And it heals my dry skin. Bonus! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Not quite sure this really works for growth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s messy and makes hair feel thicker but haven&#x27;t seen new growth. Maybe need to do it more often.</li>
            <li> I have blond, fine hair and this worked well on my hair, though I will keep it away from my roots next time (same rule as with conditioner on fine hair).  My hair was noticeably less frizzy the day after and is still so after a second washing. I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, but can post an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried other oils so don&#x27;t have a good comparison, but this worked well for me.</li>
            <li> its is super thick but personally i like it because that means it stays on, as for my edges growing well i guess ill just have to wait, plus i missed a lot of days in-between so ill start again and update on that</li>
            <li> The applicator bottle is pointless. Cheap &amp; can&#x27;t even be used with this thick oil. The oil is great except my scalp gets irritated when I used it but my hair did grow. I had to switch to regular castor oil and gave this JBCO to a friend who loves it. Do a small test area on your scalp because the ashes in this oil may irritate your scalp as well. Irritation could be itching or soreness.</li>
            <li> I love this product.The thick consistency of the oil keeps it from running down your face when applied to your edges. I use it on my edges, scalp and nape, and I do see an improvement. It instantly soothes my scalp if dry. I do use virgin coconut oil on my hair itself because the JBCO is a little too thick for me to evenly spread on my hair. It gets a little gooey. The coconut oil smells much better also, because the JBCO has a burnt wood type of smell. I dont mind it most of the time though its not a big deal. I rate the product 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the smell and the size, I wish it was available in a larger size for the price. 16 oz would be ideal because with the coconut oil I get much more product for a little less cost. The cutomer service from Beauty Online was horrible though. I would recommend ordering this product from Sams24-7.com because they are not the least bit concerned with the customer experience and if I could post the email traffic I would, it would astonish you all. If they were giving a product away for free then that would be one thing but when Im paying for a product and then a shippin tab that cost more than the product itself, I expect a valued customer experience.  And I know Amazon is great with the customer service experience and value their customers but in this case, they have another seller shippin the product so that kinda makes them look bad even though it wasnt necessarily their customer service guys.</li>
            <li> Works very well on hair and nails!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Use it on my edges, eyebrows, and skin and I love it.</li>
            <li> The oil has been working great for growing my edges back. I did have to dilute it with olive oil because it was too strong and causing my scalp to itch.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on 10/27, it arrived today(thank AZ Prime!). I orginally got it with the intention of using it on my hair, but instead used it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see,I have horrible eczema. For the past week the patches on my eyelids, under my nose and inside my right elbow have been flaring up something fierce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with living a Allergy pill popping, perfume-dye free, lukewarm shower taking life- I keep no less than five differents kinds of lotions/creams for emergencies - none of them soothed me. Not even EUCERIN!! Out of desperation I applied dabs of JBOC to all of the aforementioned spots, now here I am on Amazon at 5am writing about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week of itching and burning, relieved in under a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I will give another review once I put it in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great on hair and scalp. Also used on nephew scare ,healed in two days</li>
            <li> Helped me grow my edges back after my recovery. Always have loved this product, always will!</li>
            <li> Good because it washes out easy after use.</li>
            <li> not sure if it is causing my hair loss but i can say that i haven seen much change since using it.</li>
            <li> Smelly and messy...and so far hasn&#x27;t helped my spouse with his hair growth. Bummer. Oh well!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I don&#x27;t need a lot to moisturize my hair and keep it soft and tangle free.  Another great natural product. I know I have to be consistent and continue using this product and I will see great results!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any growth progress.  Will continue to use it and hope for the best since I paid for it.</li>
            <li> You know I just have not had the product long enough to see how it is working.  However due to weaves, my hair was getting thin along the front hairline which is disconcerting.  I noticed that I am getting new growth.  I use this as a moisturizer for my hair, if you have fine straight hair, this would be too heavy.  I also use it on my skin.  It soaks in and leaves my skin soft.  I add a pinch of coconut oil and I have a nice oil.  It also last long, you do not have to use much. It is kinda of spendy but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update it at a later date, but I can say that it has added moisture back to myself and my daughter&#x27;s hair. The reason for 3 stars is because (1) it came with an applicator, but it’s a glass one that you aren&#x27;t able to squeeze, and it&#x27;s difficult to control the flow of oil so I find myself just opening the top and pouring directly in my hand. Had it come with one that was plastic, as advertised currently, I&#x27;d give it a 4. The other deduction in stars (2) is for the actual smell. Luckily it tends to dissipate over time, so I&#x27;d recommend adding it to your hair before bed and then wrapping your hair and letting it sit so it does not get on your pillows. All in all, I’d recommend the product, so far. Both my daughter and I have dry hair, so I was looking for something light that would give us back moisture.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for hair, personally it smells like kerosene but that shows that its truly pure and organic, i had used one that a friend brought from Jamaica and it had the same smell and consistency of texture, just a little darker color. I would suggest to use it on the scalp only using an aapplication bottle and the massage it to distribute it, if you use this method your h s ir will not smell, but if you want to use it as hot oil treatment I think its best to add coconut oil and leave it for a couple of hours before shampooing. I have African American textlaxed hair and the product has helped me greatly in growing my hair thicker and stronger while keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before. My first order was in s glass bottle and had a very thick consistency. My second purchase arrived in a plastic bottle and has very thin consistency and much lighter color. This leads me to believe that this is a lesser, watered down product. I will be returning it. Not sure if I can trust the quality.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Gave some to my husband and mother and they live its many uses too!</li>
            <li> smells like cigarettes smoke</li>
            <li> I love it!! My hair is becoming thicker so I will continue to buy this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The applicator is much smaller than last time with nour red cap. I&#x27;m so glad I kept my old bottle. The oil bottle seems the same as before.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS BUY THIS PRODUCT SINCE I LEARNED OF IT BECAUSE I HAVE CLEARLY SEEN THE BIG DIFFERENCE IT HAS MADE TO MY THINNING HAIR. MY HAIR HAS NOW BECOME FULLER. I HAVE TOLD QUITE A FEW OF MY FRIENDS ABOUT IT AND THEY TOO LOVE THEIR RESULTS</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Product is as described. I have used the product for one month now and I have started to see some regrow to to my temple area. I massage it in every night. I will definitely continue to use the product</li>
            <li> Good pre-shampoo oil that helped to increase moisture into my hair.  Not fantastic enough to buy again. Although, if you&#x27;re looking for a multi-purpose oil that extends beyond the follicles this oil serves may purposes just like coconut oil, my preferred oil.</li>
            <li> The product came wrapped up and very secure and the shipping wasn&#x27;t delayed. I absolutely love it!!! I have a 4c hair and I had been looking for a product that would help soften my hair. This worked like magic!</li>
            <li> I showed my mother this product and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I like Jamaican Black Castor Oil, I thought it would be a heavy oil, but it was light and no odor, which is a plus because I do not like products with scents. The applicator was a plus, very easy to use for your hair and whatever else needed for.  I would highly recommend this product if asked.</li>
            <li> I am using this to regrow my over plucked brows and the regrowth is amazing, and fast. Great product Recommend</li>
            <li> Too thick and greasy, smells awful</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong to me but I love the results.  The applicator bottle that it comes with is perfect!!  This caster oil loves my hair</li>
            <li> Received on time and came as described</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this at first but I am so glad I did! My edges were shot from stress and braids. I didn&#x27;t think I could grow them back. Thanks to this wonderful oil, they are growing slowly but surely. I just massage a dab around my edges in the morning and at night. I highly recommend this oil!</li>
            <li> :( the picture made me think the applicator was a large bottle</li>
            <li> This is a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for skin and hair. My hair is healthier and thicker.</li>
            <li> The applicator is not the same size as the bottle, only half the size if that so picture is deceiving. But the product works great for skin and hair so no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on myself and my daughter&#x27;s natural hair for about a month now, and I can truly see that our hair has grown faster with it&#x27;s use. IT WORKS ;)</li>
            <li> The bomb.com. Changed my breakage pattern on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> Start using once I got my microbraids, and started seeing results within two weeks,  actually taking braids out earlier than expected due to so much growth. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I use Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil on my skin and hair. It has really made my skin look and feel good &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> Appears to be helping my sides grow which had become bald due to years of braiding. Highly likely I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I dont write reviews but i had to for this.....I have only been using this for a week and I am in love!!!! I got this oil in hopes my hair would grow but it did more then I expected.....i have been using this on my head, eye brows, and eye lashes...not only have i noticed a slight growth but my hair feels so much healthier and stronger...I have really curly hair and dye my hair often so it was broken and brittle but this stuff has helped sooooooo much.......The only bad thing is the smell but u get use to it and it&#x27;s really thick so it takes alot more if u have thick hair like me....but if ur looking for results this is the stuff</li>
            <li> It was suppose to come July 6th but it came July 2nd . I love this oil! It&#x27;s my fav. I&#x27;m natural , it made my hair thick and longer!</li>
            <li> Caused a rash on my scalp and skin.</li>
            <li> Can I apply it on my face?  I heard is good for wrinkles.  True? TIA!</li>
            <li> Love this castor oil so nice and thick!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells bad, even horrible but it works</li>
            <li> I Love applicator bottle that comes with this and I love the oil!  Perfect for my natural hair care routine.</li>
            <li> This product came to me faster that they told me in the confirmation email, which is a plus. I was upset because I thought I was purchasing the Coconut scented JBCO but I realized that was an error on my part. Other than the smell of this product, I am still satisfied. I love the applicator bottle that came with it as well!</li>
            <li> This product was delivered without the applicator.  Please send the applicator.  Oil is great for thickening and growing hair.</li>
            <li> Great for skin and thinning temples.  My hair was coming out at the edges because of over processing.  I got this and started messaging it in at the areas needed and the hair came back!</li>
            <li> Great hair oil treatment.  I use it once a week as a leave in treatment for a couple of hours and wash it out.  Hair is noticeably more manageable and stylish.</li>
            <li> Love the jamaican Black Castor oil, the applicator bottle was not the size shown online( alot smaller) oil is excellent and it softens my 4b, 4c natural hair.</li>
            <li> This does what it says and this bottle should last 6 months.. It only takes a teensy weeny drop. It is very thick &amp; in a year my hair grew tons!!! I&#x27;ve been natural for 8 years.  If you can find it locally it&#x27;s cheaper</li>
            <li> Perfect for my natural hair. Applicator bottle is useful. I had to mix the JBCO with Olive Oil. JBCO is very thick.</li>
            <li> This Jamaican oil appears to be fillings in my bald spots that are on the crown of my head in a short span of time in 3 weeks I&#x27;ve seen massive improvement.  I&#x27;m satisfied.  Cindy T Antioch Ca</li>
            <li> Smells bad. I don&#x27;t know if it works like I expected or not.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I use it to thicken my hair, eyebrows, and lashes! I definitely see some results. I have been using it since January faithfully (nightly) and still have a good amount left, that will probably last me another month or so. The applicator is also great and very helpful for application! Seller got it to me very quickly, in two days! I would totally recommend this, especially for beauty use.</li>
            <li> I order several for my natural hair growth and friends who asked me about what I&#x27;m using because my hair is growing and it&#x27;s must thicker too!</li>
            <li> I love this product and the scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Have read plenty on JBCO&#x27;s benefits, and finally decided to try for myself. I have fine hair, and that recently (in the last several months) has had some breakage around my edges, and in the temple and nape areas. I am also hoping to gain some thickness. Typically use it as an all-day hot oil treatment or just locally on those two areas. I&#x27;ve noticed improvement on edges but not my nape or &amp;#34;kitchen&amp;#34;, and my hair has gotten thicker, but primarily only at the roots. Also 1-2 inches of growth but not sure if that is the JBCO or the biotin and trim I had and have been using the past 2-3 months. This oil is super thick- I would recommend cutting it with a little coconut oil for example. Have purchased before but from a different seller, that didn&#x27;t include the applicator so this was perfect.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;m a 4b naturalista and my hair is very thick. Since going natural I&#x27;ve learned that my hair likes thick oils and Blue Magic hair grease. JBCO soothes my scalp and keeps my hair soft and moisturized. JBCO has helped my thin edges become thick and helped with hair growth as well. Definitely a staple product that will always be part of my hair care regimen. Great shipping will reorder from seller again!</li>
            <li> This is really making my hair grow. I love it.</li>
            <li> It might work on some people but did not work for my son. It makes the hair feel thicker after it is washed out, but that is short lived. This product failed to do as promised in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I SEEN HAIR GROWTH IN AS LIL AS 2 WEEKS. YOU MIGHT SEE FASTER AND BETTER RESLTS WHEN MIXING WITH THIS PRODUCT WITH GAPE SEED OIL.</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I thought but it is great.it&#x27;s lasted very long because it&#x27;s really thick and I Mix it with other stuff do I&#x27;m happy lol</li>
            <li> Regular castor oil will work just was well.  The only reason it is back is because the nut is roasted and what make it black is the &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; from the roasting.</li>
            <li> love it! use it our hair and all over body. Thanks so much! The applicator works with ease</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing and decide to give it a try. I am giving it 4 stars because I have only had it one week. I am using it as a scalp oil and so far no complaints.  I will update my review after 30 days.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR MY HAIR, MAINTAIN ITS THICKNESS AND MOISTURED IT WELL... ALSO GREAT WHEN MIXED WITH WATER IN A SPRAY BOTTLE HAIR STAYED HEALTHY AND SHINY</li>
            <li> Great product with amazing hair growth.</li>
            <li> The bottle is PERFECTION! I use this stuff all the time and love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it helps your hair feel full and healthy</li>
            <li> I purchased this in hopes of it helping my thinning hair situation . . . problem is, with the stickiness it is difficult for me to want to continue to put it in my hair to even attempt to see if it works.  Whether it works, I don&#x27;t know though I will &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; to make myself use in hope there will be some improvement.</li>
            <li> The applicator is very useful because it makes it very easy to apply the Oil on a scalp without it being messy. A little goes a long way, so use sparingly. I use it often and I am just running out after 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> Since Sep 2012 to the present.. I use it mostly on my ends and scalp... its growing my hair and it seals the moisture to my ends. Try it.. if it works .. Cheers!!! If not keep searching.&lt;br /&gt;BTW.. it doesn&#x27;t have a smell really.. its ok with me..</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my scalp really well, does the job! I still have to use it for a while longer to see longer results but , over all Its good</li>
            <li> The product that arrived did not look anything like what was depicted.  It arrived in a timely manner, but if it&#x27;s not what you expect or what was advertised then what&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> I have 4C hair and it really helps seal my dry ends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product! I use it for my hair and saw growth within 2 weeks. I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a good oil. It is thick but you can cut it with water or another oil of your choice.</li>
            <li> This does what everyone claims. I bought this after having a bad reaction to overlapping relaxer products. Used a small drop on my edges daily and a small amount on my scalp. I can see improvements in areas where my hair was always thin, and significant growth and thickening. The smell isn&#x27;t as unpleasant as others have stated (to me). A little goes a long way and the applicator bottle is perfect.</li>
            <li> You made my day! I&#x27;ve been waiting to use this product and it arrived right on time to adopt into my healthy hair routine. My hair is looking and feeling great!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased because I read great reviews on how it can help grow and thicken your hair. For the price I said wth. I&#x27;ve been using on my hair for couple of weeks and it definitely is working amazing on my hair. My new growth has been coming in thicker and it does moisturize my scalp tremendously. As of right now I have braids so i can&#x27;t give detail on how much my hair has grown but I can&#x27;t wait to see the results of using this JBCO. Yes it does have a peculiar smell and very thick but i usually apply on damp or semi wet hair so it not as thick. As far as the smell I don&#x27;r mind too much. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the bottle. makes things much less messy</li>
            <li> Black castor oil. I liked it. I don&#x27;t know why I used it, and I don&#x27;t know if it helped my skin, but I like the idea of black castor oil. It seems more pure and whole than the lighter colored version.</li>
            <li> this is a great deal with the applicator bottle included! i use it in my hair and daughters hair, and its the best grade of castor oil</li>
            <li> Definitely see improvements😃👏</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> I love this product currently on my second bottle and the fact that this one came with an applicator is a plus. I have definitely noticed my hair has gotten thicket since my 1st use in Oct. I use this everyday at night as well as part of my beauty regimen. I will continue to use this product for life</li>
            <li> Works well. My hair in my temple is now growing back. Keeps my hair from getting dry and breaking off.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product comes with an applicator, cause you&#x27;ll need it.  I&#x27;m using it as a moisturizer for my African American natural hair, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  It does exactly whats it&#x27;s suppose to do.  I&#x27;m wearing long box braids right now, so I&#x27;m using it on my edges everyday in hopes that they don&#x27;t dry and thin out.  It&#x27;s working wonderfully thus far.</li>
            <li> well packaged. fast shipping. thank you. will buy again</li>
            <li> This made my hair thicker and longer faster than I thought. I am happy it came with an applicator bottle it makes it muxh easier to apply to your scalp. I also use it as a hot oil treatment .I will now be using this as my ONLY hair oil.</li>
            <li> Besides getting accustomed to the smell when used it for the first time, there are no complaints.  Very pleased with purchase. Using it on my hair, very pleased</li>
            <li> Too thick to use for any real application.  Would recommend Argan oil instead.  Ended up just tossing this.  Boo!</li>
            <li> Love it and wish I could find it in local stores. One bottle lasts a long time. Product is thick so apply lightly. I use it on my starter locs.</li>
            <li> The Jamaican Black Castor Oil was very thick, but the applicator bottle helped to minimize the amount I was using. I used the oil on my scalp, particularly in areas where my hair was thinning and I definitely saw my hair grow longer and thicker within a month. I gave this product 4 stars simply because it has a smokey smell.</li>
            <li> I normally use regular castor oil and my friend told me there was no difference between the 2 but I beg to differ. I like the Jamaican Black Castor Oil MUCH better!</li>
            <li> It is a nice product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Although it does have an odor for about an hour after applying, it is definitely worth it.  I&#x27;ve experienced new growth from my scalp where my hair was thinning out.  The applicator made this product soooo easy to use.</li>
            <li> So far so good. The oil shipped quickly. It arrived in 5 days which is fast for me since I&#x27;m stationed in Germany. I have read complaints about the smell, the thickness and stickiness but I like it all. I feel I use less of it because it&#x27;s so thick. I also feel it works better because it&#x27;s a little potent. I&#x27;ve only used for a month and I&#x27;ve experienced some growth. I bought specifically for my edges and it&#x27;s awesome to see hairs pop up and spots filling in. I hope others give it a try. I look forward to more significant growth.</li>
            <li> My daughter cut her hair to the scalp and I have had the hardest time growing it back around the edges. About a month ago I became using JBC on her hair. It is growing strong and thick. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the best hair detangler I&#x27;ve ever used hands down. I love this stuff. I was nervous about trying it because of all the complaints of the strong smell, but I don&#x27;t know who could complain about something so small when nail polish and nail remover is way stronger than this and so is coffee. The smell is very light to me and does not stink AT ALL. Yall really had me thinking it was going to be horrible or something but I&#x27;m glad I tried it because it&#x27;s one of the best oils in the world  :) Yes I would recommend this product to every 4b hair type because we need everything we can get that will help us maintain our hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite oils in the winter for my natural hair. It lasts long and keeps my hair from becoming dry and brittle during the cold months...and by the way...makes my hair grow like weeds...lol...an extra added bonus!</li>
            <li> I ordered on Monday , received on Thursday ! I only ordered 1 bottle of JBCO &amp; 1 applicator , and I received 2 bottles of JBCO thank you very much . Only giving 4 stars right now because this is my first day using the product</li>
            <li> Both my friends and I use this product every other day and we have seen changes in our hair</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the smell but I am seeing some improvement with my hair line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about using this product since I&#x27;ve lost quite a lot of hair the last few years from stress however I have 3A curls (used to be 3B but like I said I lost a lot of hair). I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil which has helped a bit but my crown really needs some love... Anyone have suggestions?</li>
            <li> Staple product for moisturizing my 4a natural coils. No other product works like JBCO.</li>
            <li> Applicator RULES!!! It stinks to me though, so I added lavender and rosemary oil.</li>
            <li> Use it in my natural hair....makes it soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, is good on your skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Ok so this oil is amazing. I use to have very dry and crunchy, 3c hair. After using this product my hair feels much softer! It&#x27;s amazing! I also use this on my skin because word on the street says that it&#x27;s suppose to &amp;#34;help with scarring&amp;#34; as well. It makes my skin softer than a pillow. WARNING: DO NOT use this oil on your face because it WILL clog your pours. That&#x27;s why I recommend using it on your body instead. The applicator bottle is helpful because it helps u have a little more control over where u want to apply the product.</li>
            <li> Very nice, great price, although I didn&#x27;t get an applicator with it in my shipping, I didn&#x27;t deduct any scores from it as it is a great product.  I purchased it for hairl oss and notice that my hair seems to be thickening and new growth is faster. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> love this product! not too sticky and works great!</li>
            <li> Love the jamaican castor oil. Moisturizes and conditons my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product performed&lt;br /&gt;(I did not care for the smell wich is natural)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered the lavender scent to see if it helps  I would still buy it for the benefits use at night and after bath 😉</li>
            <li> Everything is satisfaction.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  I&#x27;m at one month, and I really do think my hair is a little thicker, and the bald spot in the top of my head is getting thicker.  No joke!</li>
            <li> My eye lashes and eyebrows are grown. it is working</li>
            <li> It works will buy more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, expected amazing results after reading other reviews. I used it in my hair regularly after my purchase but honestly I didn&#x27;t see any difference in results then my prior products. It ok.</li>
            <li> it worked great enjoy the products</li>
            <li> Ive used this on my boyfriends thinning spots and his hair has grown back.  He is too happy about it.  I love it as well.  Makes my hair soft and managable.  Im a kinky curly.  So glad the supplied an applicator bottle as well.  U will need it.  The product smells woodsy but the smell fades.</li>
            <li> Fabulous and effective product for moisturizing your scalp and encouraging hair growth.  The applicator bottle is basic,  but a must for using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love love love this stuff, but you have to understand the product you are working with, Castor oil is a very heavy oil period.  So use it lightly if using on your scalp and don&#x27;t put directly on your hair (unless using an exceptional small amount or after diluting in a lighter oil). Be careful not to cut the whole in the tip of the applicator bottle to large.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to see if it would actually grow my edges back, they&#x27;re in very embarrassingly bad shape.  I&#x27;ve used this product now for about 1-1/2 months and I am experiencing some very promising regrowth of my edges.  Where there had been absolutely no growth (barely even hair), there is now some growth. I have hope that with time using the JBC oil, my edges will be back.  So, for the length of time I&#x27;ve used the product I am very pleased with the results, I apply a little every day directly to my edges .  As for the rest of my hair, after washing and conditioning I use the JBC oil to seal in the moisture by applying it directly to my hair while its wet and massaging it in. My hair is shinny and healthier since using the product in this way.  As far as the oil having a smell is concerned, there is a slight odor, but that I&#x27;m comfortable with. Its not unpleasant and should not be noticed by others unless they&#x27;re putting their nose directly in your hair immediately after you use it.  If you don&#x27;t like the scent I would recommend adding a fragrant &amp;#34;essential oil&amp;#34; to it, i.e. lavender, honey almond, lemon, vanilla, whatever you personally like. Amazon sells essential oils, so you could order one at the same time you order the JBC oil. I would definitely recommend this product to all of my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this oil. My granddaughter&#x27;s hair came out because of an infection when she was a baby,but after using this, it grew back thicker and fuller than before the hair loss.</li>
            <li> I am a transitioning naturalista and I saw this recommended on YouTube for thinning edges, so I bought it because weeelllllll....I am a straight product junkie (lol), but I am working to change that in 2013 (lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for it working I have to admit I have not done the recommeded routine for it to work, but I still have it and plan to use it...............one day (lol)</li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil is the truth! I purchased this because I decided to transition from perm to natural and my hair started breaking and shedding really bad. I apply to hair about 4 times a week and massage into my scalp and it has done miracles for my hair! It is a little thick so I mix coconut oil and tea tree oil in mine. I recommend this because it is a great product that brings your hair back to life.</li>
            <li> I mix with coconut oil &amp; use on skin sometimes.</li>
            <li> Good product for helping hair stay moisturized and come back thicker. However, the castor oil itself is quite thick and messy. Overall 4 star product.</li>
            <li> Wow this was really good. It smells horrible but works great for hair growth and I use it in my locs with some smoothed she&#x27;s butter to retwist. If you need to repair hair or twist some natural hair I say buy it!!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and product seems to be working effectively.</li>
            <li> this product made my hair very soft and easy to manage, I also saw some growth in my hair so I will continue to buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I was a little late to jump on the JBCO train but now, I am never getting off! My hair loves, loves, LOVES JBCO</li>
            <li> Just received it and still waiting to see how it works.  It does mosterize my hair as it should. thanks</li>
            <li> It a good product too</li>
            <li> Great product. I mix this when coconut and jojoba oil for the perfect hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I got this product after doing a lot of research since becoming newly &#x27;natural&#x27; (I did the big chop). It is thick and has a burnt woodsy type of smell, but it&#x27;s tolerable..I mix it with organic coconut oil. I can&#x27;t quite say just yet if this is aiding in my hair growth, but I like how it moisturizes my scalp. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. Oh, and kudos for including the applicator because you&#x27;ll definitely need it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my egdes and this made my hair thicker than anything else.. I guess I appreciated it for that</li>
            <li> Why does the applicator bottle appear at least as tall as the bottle in the picture? NOT??? Otherwise, excellent product so far. Unfortunately, my hair adapts to products within 6 months and they are no longer effective.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It works on every thing the product description says it will do.  I love this product and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked well for me. The applicator bottle came in handy. I miss this with peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> It was pretty good. IT left the hair shiny and it wasn&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful</li>
            <li> My item came really quickly. Ive been using this product for a couple of weeks. I have thinning edges so i put just a little in my trouble areas every couple of days and massage with my fingers. I love the application container that comes with it. Im going to give another review in a few months as far as my growth results</li>
            <li> This is working on my hair, it is the only thing that has actually worked. I highly recommend this product for anyone who is having a problem growing their sides out.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my hair and though it keeps it from getting dry, it is a bit thinker than I had anticipated, but that could be a good thing because my hair would stay moisturized longer.  Adding a nice fragrance would be nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 8 weeks and I&#x27;m noticing some hair growth around my edges.  I will continue to use as long as I see results.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was looking on Utube for a way to grow back my thinning edges.. And on every one utube page they suggested Jamaican Black Castor Oil. It really works. I purchased the Oil and the applicator came with. I use it religiously. My edges are really growin back. I had no expectations I was just desperate along with better hair care on my part and this Miricle Oil I am very satisfied!! I just started seeing hair where their wasnt. I didnt take long for it to work. I just apply the Oil on my edges a little bit and on spots where I feel there needs to be.</li>
            <li> great oil in a glass jar, smells awful but my hair is already looking much much better!</li>
            <li> had a bald spot from a bad weave grew it back (at-least to cover it) in about a month or 2&lt;br /&gt;great to seal in moisture and i also put it on my face cause my skin is very dry a little go a long way</li>
            <li> Saw results within 2 weeks!!!! And the applicator makes it so easy to apply! Definitely will order more!</li>
            <li> Interesting smell. Mixed with coconut oil, its not as smelly</li>
            <li> JBCO has met my expectations.  It&#x27;s works well with Natural hair.  Great for hot oil treatments. Would recommend again and again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have seen significant improvements with my hair.  It&#x27;s beginnng to grow back, but be patient, it is a process.</li>
            <li> I use this regularly and there is new growth in the crown of my head where stress had caused it to thin dramatically.I use it with evoo, jojoba oil, regular castor oil as part of my dc and I oil my scalp with this and sometimes evoo. But I must say that the first two weeks of using this, my scalp would itch like crazy crazy crazy!!! I would hav to wash my hair to make it stop. The itching wld usually start day three or so after greasing my scalp with it. But after 2 wks the itching just stopped. There were others on youtube that said they experienced the same thing and it stopped after 2wks. If u can hang in there it will be worth it. My hair is thicker, fuller and healthier looking than ever. I didn&#x27;t do the big chop, but love the thickness of the new growth. I haven&#x27;t permed in over three or four months. Its challenging and I undetstand the logic behind the big chop and starting fresh bk its hard for me to know how to style my hair withour heat, but I am getting the hang of flat twists :)</li>
            <li> I went natural.... edges were perm damaged!! heard about this product so i decided to give it a try. No complaints so far. Worth the purchase and shipping since i cant find it on any shelf in my town or surrounding 50  miles.</li>
            <li> I love jamaican black love it.</li>
            <li> Great oil purchased to regrow hair lose.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT ! and with a convenient applicator who could complain!</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil and Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  Mixed together on my hair edges worked well but I ran out.  I purched already mixed but couldn&#x27;t find in on Amazon.</li>
            <li> excellent ... really works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; hair, but after a day, the oil seems to saturate the scalp, so it&#x27;s not too bad.  Hope to notice stronger hair, and more filling in of thin areas within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> It was nicely packaged, did not smell bad like others said, and was the same size relevant to the picture.</li>
            <li> I love this black castor oil! It makes my hair really soft and strong at the same time! The bottle was just an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Love this black castor oil as a pre-treatment before washing with anti-dandruff shampoo. It keeps the hair&#x27;s natural oils from being depleted. Using on five heads and due to it&#x27;s thick consistency I am still at the top of the bottle a month into use. I would not recommend using in your hair/ on skin alone, as it is very greasy and somewhat sticky. The only downside of this is the advertised &amp;#34;applicator&amp;#34;. The picture shows a decent sized bottle while the one that arrived is a two ounce bottle. A minor inconvenience to the actual product&#x27;s value. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great for ethnic or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on my hair and for my eyelashes and I&#x27;ve seen a big difference in growth and fullness! It&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done, so don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I love it,  leaves my hair shiny and soft, really like this stuff and appreciate the applicator</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working for me thanks!</li>
            <li> The product is ok, The smell is not that bad but I mixed it with a Doo Gro Growth oil to deaden the smell. It seemed to be working on my hair  because I cut my hair way down (like a guy) to grow it fresh as it Was shedding like Craaazy, Every part was damaged and since I have been using it for two weeks now I can actually hold my hair. P.S. My hair is what the call nappy. (4C Hair). I&#x27;m Jamaican</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know, not sure what this product was suppose to do to my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this product and it has been great.</li>
            <li> i feel like it works more on my eyebrows than my scalp hair. but either way it smells kinda funky, but i put it on every couple days when i&#x27;m gonna wash my hair. it does sooth my scalp</li>
            <li> My first use: I added this product to my deep conditioning regime. Applied conditioner and then used the castor oil applicator to apply the oil. My hair feels great. I love how thick this oil is. I&#x27;m natural 4c type and when I straighten my hair with heat, castor oil keeps it from reverting. This is my first time using JBC Oil though but already...I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil better than the regular castor oil.  I love the applicator bottle as well.  I&#x27;ve purchased it for a couple of my friends and they like it as well.  I will be purchasing this product again.  It was well packaged and arrived in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Yes great buy! So glad it came early</li>
            <li> I did not know it stains EVERYTHING. The smell was bad but bearable. The staining...unbearable. It did not do anything different for my scalp or hair.</li>
            <li> The seller was amazing! Kept me up to date on a regular about my package location. I have a love hate relationship with this product. It does moisturize my hair and scalp. It it can be thick and sticky! But I like to keep it on hand. Works wonders for rusty feet and elbows!!</li>
            <li> Five stars for this product! I love it for my hair and skin. Even the not-so-pleasant smell doesn&#x27;t deter me from using the castor oil! (Used in combination with Moroccan argon oil and smell was much better! )</li>
            <li> Works well on getting hair to grow but it has a strong smell to it</li>
            <li> I have alopecia areata and recently lost almost all of my hair. I ended up cutting off all of my hair and even going to the extent of shaving my head. I tried multiple vitamins to help with hair growth, unfortunately nothing worked. I purchased this castor oil and tried a 30 day trial to see the results (I was also taking Hairfinity vitamins at the time). At this point, I was willing to try just about anything. What more could it hurt? I was already almost bald and as an african american woman, I truly value my natural hair. Anyway, I have had wonderful results. I apply to my enitre scalp every other night and sleep in a satin cap. I usually wash my hair the next day. I now have multiple patches of hair growing throughout my head where I had lost hair. Hopefully soon all of my hair will have grown back. I cannot wait to see what happens. No more chemicals for me. I will definitely order again when I finally empty the bottle. Great value for the size of the bottle and price was well worth it. It will last for some time depending on your routine. Happy customer!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a bald spot right in the middle of my head for years and have tried quite a few things to grow it in but my sister has been natural for a few years now and her hair looks beautiful so she suggested I try the castor oil since she heard a lot of reviews from natural gals on how well it grows in hair.  So I bought some and have been using for about a month so far and low and behold I have hair growing in!! I cannot believe it!! All this time I&#x27;ve been searching and trying out different things and I could have been had my spot grown in by now! Well as they say it&#x27;s better late than never so I&#x27;m happy and will continue to use and buy this product.  I have 4a type hair and massage this on my head every night before bed and sometimes in the morning before work.  I also mad a mixture that includes coconut, peppermint and jojoba oil and use that as well but I think I like using it all by itself better.  So I mix it up, some days I&#x27;ll do just BCO and sometimes I&#x27;ll use my mixture it&#x27;s all working so I have no complaints except I wish it came bigger...I&#x27;ll have to do a search to find a bigger bottle...</li>
            <li> I use this on my natural hair and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer/sealant. The smell is initally off-putting, but I noticed it doesn&#x27;t linger after application.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! My psoriasis on my scalp is under control now! I love it no more dry itchy scalp! I could not live without the applicator. It works great if you wear protective styles and need to get to your scalp. The delivery was fast and product was intact.</li>
            <li> I had a spot on my edges that was super thin from braids that I done in August of 2013 that wasnt growing back in. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and my hair is growing back in and that spot isn&#x27;t obvious anymore! The only thing I&#x27;m not a fan of is the smokey smell that it has, other than that this product is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I received this product and the applicator and I am very pleased.  I have used it in my hair and my younger cousins hair and seems to be effective BUT it smells but it does go away after awhile....Another negative, it makes your hair ITCH LIKE CRAZY!  I use to for areas of my hair that are finer or need help growing but I must admit I DO NOT use it regular, maybe about 3-4 times a month due to it&#x27;s itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a little if you are using it all over your scalp, just place strategically in certain areas and massage throughout the scalp.  I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I like it. They say this stuff does wonders for your hair. And from what I can tell, this is definitely authentic. It comes in a dark glass bottle and a plastic squeeze bottle. I love this. It is more than enough oil. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell.. But that&#x27;s how authentic oil smells so oh well. Definitely recommend for naturals and/or people trying to grow out their edges.</li>
            <li> Used this product and saw hair growth on my thinning sides.  I will be ordering this product again. Lived it!</li>
            <li> Nice oil for sealing in moisture, hot oil treatments and prepoos but irritated my scalp when used directly as a scalp oil...left my scalp itchy by the third day of use had to wash my hair out coz the itching had turned into a burning sensation which was not comfortable at all. I use it now on just the hair( not the scalp) and it does wonders on my ends and leaves the hair soft. The Red Pimento Oil was a better alternative for me and did not make my scalp itch at all. For some people JBCO may work fine for them but I probably have a more sensitive scalp...I&#x27;m not sure...which doesn&#x27;t make sense coz the Pimento Oil which is made by the same company has castor oil in it too but did not irritate my scalp! Hmmm  maybe its because the pimento oil is a mixture and not just pure castor oil. Anyway, it&#x27;s a good sealant and moisturizer for hair so that&#x27;s why I only gave it three stars.</li>
            <li> I love the Jamaican Black Castor Oil and will be ordering more soon.  The smell does not bother me as much especially once you are out in the air, it goes away.  My hair is starting to thicken, but I really purchased it as a recommendation for my thinning edges.  So far, I don&#x27;t notice much change there, but I have not been using it long.  I put it on my edges morning and night, just a little and sprinkle water for moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I rated this product five stars because it has done wonders for my hair growth. I use it on my scalp, when I do hot oil treatments, and sometimes on my eyebrows and eyelashes!! Yes, it is safe and the applicator bottle is perfect and considerate of the seller!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Hair stop thinning and breakage. The applicator bottle is very convenient and useful for applying to scalp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product, good for hair growth. I used it once and my hair felt soft and moisturizers. But good grief why wasn&#x27;t I warned about the smell?! This stuff smells HORRIBLE! It&#x27;s like a mixture of old gym shoes, musk, and an essence of cigarette butts! I tried mixing in scented essential oils to mask the smell and they didn&#x27;t help at all! I cleared rooms in my house as soon as I walked in everyone was like yuck wagers that smell?! And for that reason alone, I can no longer use this product, I believe it&#x27;s very effective, but you gotta do something about the SMELL!</li>
            <li> Castor oil is great, but it makes my hair crunchy and scalp itch like hell. I guess I am allergic to it, but it doesn&#x27;t take from the fact that it&#x27;s still a great oil.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair a body butters.  It is thick so when I want to use just the oil I cut it will sweet almond oil.  Many people complain about the smell but I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.  The smell is not strong in my opinion.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to have stronger and healthier hair you might want to consider this product. You can rub in the product on the hair you want to see more growth</li>
            <li> Perfect if like like JBCO.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  I use it on natural kinky hair to oil my scalp and &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; in moisture.  It&#x27;s thick like the consistency of molasses but it&#x27;s not sticky though. Gives my hair an amazing shine.  Don&#x27;t know yet how it makes your hair grow bc I haven&#x27;t used it long enough for those results.</li>
            <li> I think is a great value for pricing. I love the application bottle,  it makes usage and storage very easy.</li>
            <li> The castor oil is good and what I expected. The applicator works well and releases just the right amount of oil.</li>
            <li> I will not but this product again because it is to thick. There is a lot of people that don&#x27;t mind the thickness of the oil but for me I have to mix it with other oil to cut the harsh thickness.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way. I mixed the oil with several others and that allows me to stretch the use of it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like miracle grow! My hair started falling out and I ran into this stuff on Youtube. I put it on every night and massage it into my head and within a few weeks, I started to see growth. It takes a little. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months and only used about an ounce. I thought I was gonna be balding until all my hair fell out but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I like this Castor Oil to help my hair grow. I want to try this castor oil because so many reviewers love it. It works well with my hair. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Yes it does have a nutty smell, but my hair grew so much longer in the short three weeks I have had this product. This is an absolute must if you want a natural way to grow your hair</li>
            <li> This oil is very soothing. I mixed it with vitamin E and grapeseed oil, and I absolutely love how it feels on my scalp!</li>
            <li> I like the oil which came with the applicator as well. It&#x27;s working perfectly on my hair. Will surely recommend .</li>
            <li> I want to start off by saying that I&#x27;m a total skeptic when it comes to hair products that are aimed to produce \\&quot;fast growing results\\&quot;. I heard a lot of praise about JBCO; it thickens new growth and help repair damaged ends and all of these other good things... So, I decided to give it a shot because I was experiencing thinning edges and having a lot of breakage.&lt;br /&gt;It is AMAZINNNNNG!!! I saw results within the first 2-3 weeks. My new growth grew in thicker and softer and it even filled in my thinning edges. This oil is very thick, so I only used small amounts on my scalp and I use it as a sealer for my ends after I moisturize. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and it does help with growth. I even use it on my eyebrows.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Just started using product. Less breakage and more manageable.</li>
            <li> it seems to be thickening my hair up....the real verdict is still out.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent rubbing product for sour muscels.</li>
            <li> I have serious dandruff issues and my scalp loves this. It doesn&#x27;t leave my pores clogged and it helps with all of the flaky dryness.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. It kept my hair moist. Also this product kept my scalp from itching and feeling dry. And this product is making my hair thick and it&#x27;s making my hair grow!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to like this stuff, but I hate the smell, it&#x27;s a smokey smell I just can&#x27;t stand. I wish I had known this came in other fragrances, I had a chance to smell in a store and it was much better than then the original. I tend to use this very sparingly and blended with some essential oils to cut that smokey fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product is VERY thick and kinda sticky, I actually blend this with other lighters oils to dilute. Great sealer for your ends!</li>
            <li> Well packaged. Arrived on time. Not sure if it works. Really thick and smelly stuff. Got this to improve hair growth. 3 stars because the applicator helps alot</li>
            <li> Love it so far.  My hair is growing faster.</li>
            <li> Great effective product for hair growth</li>
            <li> this is a good product it has make my hair very thick love it</li>
            <li> Works great for natural or relaxed hair</li>
            <li> I love this and the applicator bottle.  This is a good buy, imo.</li>
            <li> I use to massage my scalp with it. However, it clogged pores. Had to see a dermatologist to clear acne. Not everyone has the adverse reaction that I had.</li>
            <li> The real deal. #sohappywiththispurchaae</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see that this product wasn&#x27;t runny like most hair oils. I applied it to my scalp and wrapped my hair in a scarf. The oil quickly absorbed into my scalp and didn&#x27;t leave any greasy stains on my scarf. I love the ease of the applicator. Both my husband and I have locs and I will be ordering him his own bottle so he can leave mine alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome black castor oil. I have tried another brand and can completely tell the difference in how it&#x27;s working in my hair from the other. It does smell like ash but it does not linger. I have been using this brand for a week and I can already see growth and thickness in my hair! I apply to my scalp only daily to every other day including after my wash. The application bottle that came with it is not usuable. The plastic is not soft enough to squeeze the oil out. No biggie. I just used another application bottle I already had. This is 5 stars all the way for me. Will be placing another order to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> The Jamaican black castor oil is kinda thick and its hard to style your hair after its applied but it works well as a product if your wearing a braided style.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! It really works and I don&#x27;t mind the woodsy smell. It goes away, but if you need a protectant for your hair, I highly recommend this product. This has also helped my edges grow. I will purchase again. Oh...and you will need the applicator, great addition!</li>
            <li> Adding the applicator bottle to the product was definitely a good touch.  It makes it so much easier to use and control.  The product is an excellent quality product as well.</li>
            <li> Well the product seems good and it was nice that applicator was included.saved on having to go by one.Bad thing is that it does not bring instructions on to use for best benefit</li>
            <li> Only have for about 3 weeks and I can tell a slight difference. Will continue to use and smell isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my daughter in law. Hair was thinning growing slow and she told me after using this for a month how she has notice her hair growing back and easy to manage since at times she would use it as hot oil treatment</li>
            <li> I put this in my shea butter hair mix. My coils are so shiny and soft. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it on my daughters hair with Argan oil to blow dry and flat iron her hair and it is shiny and has bounce. Not weighed down like some other products. I use it in my hair as an overnight treatment and as a leave in prior to doing protective styles. I have noticed less shedding for the both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... It does smell a little like smoke if used by itself. The smell goes does not last long but it is noticeable. I will keep using this!</li>
            <li> This oil is great. Since I&#x27;ve started using it I have seen some growth and I love this product I will order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and and I have seen some growth. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s natural but I do notice that it&#x27;s a bit thicker</li>
            <li> So I have new hair growth along my hairline. It&#x27;s not the best smelling product, but it works. I mix it with jojoba and coconut oils when I apply it to my hair. Good stuff!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about this and had to finally try it out and it&#x27;s a little thick but I love this stuff I only use this on my ends and scalp and use the beauty solid castor oil on my hair perfect combo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the castor oil is great, but the applicator bottle you receive is not the same size as the castor oil bottle, it is much much smaller that the picture suggests.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the beginning stages of using  this product, but if nothing else the smell is bad but I can get pass this if I see hair growth.</li>
            <li> works great n my hair when I wear protective styles.</li>
            <li> This does smell terrible lol. But it&#x27;s good for natural hair, the size, with applicator bottle was a good deal.</li>
            <li> Very good product, have been using it since receiving the product and it has as helped my hair grow!¡ Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 weeks. I had been taking a hair vitamin (Hairfinity) to help with my journey to accepting my natural hair and the hair vitamin alone was helping my hair grow, but I needed something for my sides. No edges run in my family and it didn&#x27;t help that i was wearing full head sewins so my edges were pretty much nonexistent. So a friend of a friend recommended this product and I was desperate so I decided to purchase. And no lie, no over exaggeration, in two weeks I went from barely able to comb my edges to be able to do flat twists on them! I put this product on every day and night and circular massage my edges and I have hair growing in. I will continue to buy this product even though I had problems with the seller and sending my package back, but thankfully amazon customer service is so amazing. If this is the growth for two weeks, I can&#x27;t wait to see what&#x27;s in store for 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I do believe it is a combo of the hair vitamin and the JBCO because my growth seems to be a little faster than other reviews and in the past my hair was very slow to grow. I use this all over my head now because I am testing the growth pace for the rest of my hair with this product.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the product is of high quality.  I wasn&#x27;t even expecting it to come in a glass bottle, so that was a plus!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!! Smells gross though but oh well works wonders!! My hair sheds alot from medicine I am taking and since I started NO MORE SHEDDING and my hair is growing like crazy!!!</li>
            <li> Jamaican castro oil was ok. The product is really thick, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it in your hair. I would suggest using it like a hot oil treatment then wash it out or massage it on your edges/napes ( leave in). Great to achieve thickness.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> this oil is so thick. its very good for your hair, was doing a once a week pre-poo treatment and it made my bleached blonde dry locks super soft and shiny, as far as growth goes i&#x27;m not convinced.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I have always had issues with a very dry and itchy scalp. NOTHING never seemed to work the whole 11 years that I have had my locs. The dry scalp has even somewhat stunted my growth. I decided to give this oil a chance. I honestly was not expecting much of a difference, however I was pleasantly surprised! This oil has really moisturized and has kept my scalp healthy. This oil has also promoted hair growth! The applicator bottle that came with this product ended up cracking after the first use. I just ended up using an old applicator bottle that I already had. The seller was quick and I got my shipment within 2 days. I will definitely order from this seller again in the future!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I use it on just about everything, including my Hair, eyelashes, skin and more. Great oil! does have a slight smell, but nothing so drastic, u can get use to it, as it goes away after a while.</li>
            <li> I hear this is a great oil to use to grow my edges back.  We&#x27;ll see.  Check the applicator bottle before putting oil in it.  The one that came with my order wasn&#x27;t secure, no matter how tight I screwed the top on.  It leaks.</li>
            <li> great product, great service!</li>
            <li> I love the moisture this oil gives my hair. The applicator is a plus.</li>
            <li> Good value and great price for the oil and application bottle.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps with dandruff. I have to mix this with another oil. 1 part this: 3 parts of another oil. Otherwise I get acne . My hair grows faster but that is not anything I need as my hair always does that. But adding this makes it possible for my hair to survive off oil only and every two days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this stuff is any better than white castor oil.  Either way it was good castor oil.  A little over priced for the process to make the castor oil black.  I would suggest you look up the process of making black castor oil and its differences from clear/yellow castor oil and come up with your own conclusion</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s a good oil to make your hair grow. I&#x27;ve been using it for my hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows. I can see the difference. If you haven&#x27;t heard anything like this just go on YouTube and search it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it has a faint smoke smell, but nothing too bad. I will be making more purchases. Also the applicator bottle is smaller than show in the picture and doesn&#x27;t have writting on it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend&#x27;s hair grows so fast when she uses this mixed with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair moisturized and feeling great.. It&#x27;s not too oily and the aroma isn&#x27;t too bad.  I will be using this forever.</li>
            <li> this is my second time ordering this, but this time the smell is weaker and the oil itself is way much thinner it just seems different.</li>
            <li> It was great and I even received it earlier than I expected. So far, the castro oil Is doing a great job.</li>
            <li> It has became my favorite oil and go to solution for everything. It has made my hair longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> I like it thus far, it is somewhat greasy so I use on my kids hair only once week after a deep conditioning. But my cousin has been using longer and so I tried it. It does help my daughter hair is extremely dry so this gives moisture she needs.</li>
            <li> The hair growth with this product is noticeable within 2 weeks. I mixed with tea tree oil and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product for hair growth the package was put together very well . I strongly recommend this Castro oil and hot regrowth hair treatments it helps with dry hair</li>
            <li> The applicator bottle broke after two weeks or so. It&#x27;s very flimsy. The JBCO has lasted me a long time though! I don&#x27;t use it that regularly, but I&#x27;ve used it a great deal over the course of a year and a half and I still have about 1/3 left. Don&#x27;t use it over your entire scalp at once! You will get a terrible headache. I&#x27;ve learned to just put it on &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34; for hours on end, and then I add a little bit of JBCO to my shampoo and conditioner. My hair has grown quite a lot. I went from a buzz cut to shoulder length hair faster than I thought I would, and I really think that it&#x27;s because the JBCO has protected my hair from getting as many split ends. I also have hypothyroidism so my eyebrows and hairline can get really thin from that, and putting a dab on JBCO on my eyebrows and massaging it into my hairline has made a really noticeable difference. It&#x27;s great for my eyelashes too, though I don&#x27;t use it near my eyes too much because I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li> The product met my expectations</li>
            <li> I use this for everything, especially my son&#x27;s hair! Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with the hope of curing my adult cradle cap. To my surprise, I saw my edges growing back in after I started using the oil, It also cured my cradle cap. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product works. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about using a product that claims to grow hair, however I am pleasantly surprised it is very moisturizing and seems to be helping to grow my hair out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great I highly recommend it! My hair feel alot more healthy with this I recommend using head and shoulders 2 n 1 either anti breakage or the the one for athletes</li>
            <li> I am still a fan of this product and the reason I bought it from this seller bc I needed a new applicator!  This is a fantastic product and my hair grows and grows and grows and grows and grows and grows.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about three weeks..and I have noticed a lot of new hair growing and my longer hair looking thicker. I just started to add peppermint oil and rosemary oil and Ill see how well this does. I am super happy with this!!!</li>
            <li> This brand always does well with me! I even use it on my eyebrows and eyelashes. And for me this works!</li>
            <li> This product is great so far, i have seen new hair growth in my temple area. Looking forward to seeing it everywhere else!</li>
            <li> whoever said that this comes with a glass applicator: it comes with a plastic applicator BUT you must poke a hole through the top to get the oil out (using a knife) this oil... STINKS (as in smells bad hehe) but it works great! I&#x27;m noticing a major difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> What type of hair does this work best on?  My hair is thinning and dry.  You can see my scalp in the front and my hair line is receeding.  As a woman I dont&#x27; like this.</li>
            <li> Jamaican black is my favorite product it has been with me from the beginning of my natural journey. It was thick so that is how I started doing an oil mixture to be able to put Jamaican black on my thin hair without it being pulled out. I will continue using this product and i also tell others about this product also.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Thick n heavy oil, so you have to wash it out thoroughly. Keeps hair soft and strong. My hair grew in like a week after i kept using this product! Amazing. The applicator bottle is a plus!! I can mix in other oils with this one and apply directly to my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It makes my hair soft and its growning but it always grows I want it to get thicker ill see with im the next couple of months if it gets thicker I have only had this oil like two months I have 4d 4c hair love it</li>
            <li> So far so good .. It&#x27;s working out well ... It does do what it says so cant complain about thst</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!! Before purchasing this product my hair was very thin due to split ends. I&#x27;ve only used this product for a month and already I can see a big diff in my hair. It&#x27;s grown and thicken rapidly. I also suffered from dry and itchy scalp, I saw results within the first use</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on Amazon and decided to give a shot.  My hair has been natural for a year its hard finding products for my dry scalp that ACTUALLY work.  I tried this out for two weeks and it definitely helped curb itching and dryness of my scalp. The smell is horrible,but if you could get pass it then give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love that the bottle came with it. The oil is soooo thick that you need an applicator. The product has proven to work very well! My daughter&#x27;s natural, curly hair had become a bit dry and her ends were breaking. I used this for a month and her hair is shiny and her ends are in much better shape. You don&#x27;t need much either!!</li>
            <li> The plastic bottle is too small. The oil is classic and always works.</li>
            <li> This stuff right here is the bomb.com! It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. I recommend this for all my natural sisters and all my relaxed sisters too. I use this oil on my hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes. It&#x27;s amazing. 5/5!</li>
            <li> Does anyone know of this works on white people&#x27;s hair too?? In my family females have thinning hair and my grandmother is actually balding! I can&#x27;t stand the thought of going thru that when I get older and I&#x27;m terrified :( I&#x27;ve read sooooo many good reviews from African Americans but nothing from caucasians :( Need some help desperately! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great quality, but the applicator bottle is impossible to squeeze.  It&#x27;s made of the hardest plastic for an applicator bottle I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> This product helps make my hair soft.  I love the smell, it reminds me of home in Jamaica.  It has helped with my edges, they are growing back.  It does not make your hair greasy but it is thick.  It also leaves a burnt smell according to my husband.  Once he asked if I was in a area with people who smoke. Overall it&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;m getting my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this Line of JBCO!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 3 weeks now that I&#x27;ve been using this product. Have not seen a big difference yet. Too early to give a true rating.</li>
            <li> This is the best castor oil on earth.  I plan on stock piling this so that I never run out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Will definitely buy more when I run out! Use it for thinning hair and good on skin for wounds, pimples, etc.</li>
            <li> Great for my sides and ends. Used with other oils as well when doing a prepoo n it mixed well.</li>
            <li> I see major improvements on my hair thanks to jbco.</li>
            <li> Everything is great, except the smell. They should include an option to add-on a natural fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> I am south Asain origin and i use it this for 3 days... I am honest is not bad smell... and is really working.. my hair are soft clean and have Shine...i am Happy to buy this product</li>
            <li> the oil smells a bit but you should expect that from castol oil. and the bottle was a great add on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a relaxed hair journey and I mix this with other oils to thin it out.  My hair has grown from shoulder length to bra strap length in a year.  This second year of my journey, I will be going texlaxed.  I love the thickness of texlaxed hair instead of the bone straight thin hair.  This oil keeps my hair strands moisturized and keep my scalp from being dry.  The applicator bottle came in handy as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a good 3 months maybe and I have definitely seen some progress with my edges. I have been having some thinning because of stress but this stuff has done some great repairing. Please don&#x27;t be mistaken and think that it will work in a week or two because you will be greatly disappointed. You definitely won&#x27;t need to buy it for a long time as a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> GREAT!!!!!!LOVE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love how this oil makes my hair feel. I am only giving it a 4 because I still haven&#x27;t seen much growth on my hairline. However it makes my hair soft and keeps it moisturized. I have no issue with the smell. It is thick but still okay. I mixed it with grapeseed and almond oils. I haven&#x27;t given up and still using it.</li>
            <li> Its helping my skin and hair very well</li>
            <li> I purchased the castor oil because I had a balding spot in the middle of my head, that I Couldn&#x27;t get to fill in no matter what I used. I started using JBCO and I noticed a growth in 4 weeks. For some people that may seem like a long time, but being that it normally takes my forever to grow, these were pretty fast results. I recommend the product, but suggest you do not use too much at one time. I also warm mine in the microwave (it feels 10x better) and I do not wash my hair every week. I apply JBCO once every week, and wash my hair b-weekly. Might not work for everyone but this works for me.</li>
            <li> What I found is that this is a product the you need to buy more than one bottle at a time for it to be used properly and work like you want it to.  You don&#x27;t want to run out. I do see some new hair in my temple part. I was smiling so much to see this.  The little bottle is nice but I burned a hole in it right away sitting it to close to my curling iron. That made me sad and of course I dealt with the terrible loss of the empty bottle.  :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real greasy. I&#x27;ve been using it for a montH now. My hair is a little thicker than before. But I will continue to use it for another 2 months and see if it grew any.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet and I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all natural kinky and coily the castor oil helps prevents hair being dry. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair and it holds moisture in really well. I&#x27;ve also been using it on my edges, but not long enough to say whether or not it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if it aides in growth, but I have had little hair loss since I began using this product. It is a little heavy, but really softens your hair, and is perfect for natural hair.</li>
            <li> i have not seen any improvements yet, still using it , so i can&#x27;t tell</li>
