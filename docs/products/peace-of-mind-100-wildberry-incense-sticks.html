            <li>Like I said, it IS a nice scent</li>

            <li>Wildberry brand incense are the bomb-diggity;  they&#x27;re all good, strong scents.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-It is peaceful and truly beautiful.  </li>

            <li>Love this incense.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Probably one of my favorite scents by Wildberry.</li>
            <li>outstanding burn well</li>
            <li>Mother&#x27;s Fragrancesare are still my favorite.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite incense scent since I was 12.</li>
            <li>Peace of Mind has a prominent strawberry scent, with undertones of vanilla, wood, and musk.</li>
            <li>A huge upside is that the smell can linger for a day or two, depending on how many you burn and how often you burn.</li>
            <li>It is kind of a soft rose smell</li>
            <li>Scent is fine.  </li>
            <li>Very clean &amp; sweet.</li>
            <li>I just received these as free sample with the order I place.(Fairy Dust).  </li>
            <li>Almost like the smell is equivalent to the taste of a lightly flavored mixed-fruit gummy candy.  </li>
            <li>Let me start out by saying that these smelled absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am SO happy I bought them because months later, I still have some.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite incense in the whole world.</li>
            <li>Has a sweet scent as it burns.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells sweet, but is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>They have more scent to them, and not so much just smoke.  </li>
            <li>it smells sweet.</li>
            <li>I light it when im getting relaxed and ready to do yoga.</li>
            <li>It has a ripe and sweet scent, that does feel pretty calming, actually.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely, slightly fruity aroma that is strong, but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>Mind\\&quot; you may not know exactly what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;After burning about 50 sticks of this incense</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got the smaller (and cheaper) 15 stick batch of these.</li>
            <li>It does promote a peaceful atmosphere.</li>
            <li>I am actually going to order more soon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not SUPER strong, but just strong enough to make your home smell fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sort of peachy, but clean, with a dab of vanilla (nearly undetectable).  </li>
            <li>The smell of this reminded me of the taste of some kind of sweet, fruity candy or punch although I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on what, but is not overwhelmingly so.  </li>
            <li>A serene floral blend with notes of juicy peach, black currant, lilac, spicy hyacinth and warm vanilla bean.</li>
            <li>have a drawer filled with incense I&#x27;ve bought and never used, because once I got these they&#x27;re all I&#x27;ve burned since.&lt;br /&gt;Great scent, fast shipping and delivery, I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells very feminine and inviting.</li>
            <li>This is a very calming scent.</li>
            <li>and they got to me very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I remembered Fizzy Pop from buying it at a shop, but didn&#x27;t know much about Peace Of Mind.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>If you are keen on sweeter scents this should be in the top picks from the Wild Berry selection, so go ahead and splurge on the big pack!</li>
            <li>Smells good enough to eat, which is why I&#x27;m usually hungry after I burn one!</li>
            <li>This leaves a pleasant aroma throughout my house that is not too heavy, and doesn&#x27;t smell like typical incense.</li>
            <li>A little bit smokey and burns quickly, but quickly fills the room with lasting scent.</li>
            <li>Very strange usually the product is very consistent but not this time.</li>

            <li> Smells amazing,  great packaging.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have grown to love this scent. It&#x27;s something like egyptian musk crossed with strawberries. It&#x27;s very soothing and an awesome smell to burn as you fall asleep.</li>
            <li> When purchasing an incense with a vague name like \\&quot;Peace of Mind\\&quot; you may not know exactly what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;After burning about 50 sticks of this incense I feel I know this item quite well.&lt;br /&gt;-The fragrance has a rose base, mingled with a bit of strawberry, cedar, gardenia, and the slightest hint of vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;-It is peaceful and truly beautiful.  It is a scent that makes you feel alert, happy and friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always burn some while studying and plant to keep this scent in my stock at all times.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite incense in the whole world. A serene floral blend with notes of juicy peach, black currant, lilac, spicy hyacinth and warm vanilla bean. No matter what mood I am in this always makes me happy. Love it! Love it! Love it!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a nice scent, but I don&#x27;t like it, yet don&#x27;t hate it. It&#x27;s just somewhere in the middle. I&#x27;m glad I got the smaller (and cheaper) 15 stick batch of these. Give them a try. Like I said, it IS a nice scent</li>
            <li> I love it..... My house smell like flowers all the time..</li>
            <li> Love this scent, not overbearing like some incense can be. It does promote a peaceful atmosphere.</li>

It&#x27;s a pleasant scent even for someone like me that doesn&#x27;t like sweet or floraly scents although it seems to be of that family.  Although it&#x27;s not in my regular incense rotation of favorites yet, it is a contender for a second place &amp;#34;special mood&amp;#34; incense so I have only bought a few sticks locally instead of the 100 stick batch here.  If you are keen on sweeter scents this should be in the top picks from the Wild Berry selection, so go ahead and splurge on the big pack!</li>
            <li> ive been buying this scent from a local head shop for quite some time. i LOVE this scent. its beautiful. I light it when im getting relaxed and ready to do yoga. i will never even bother with any other scent again.</li>
            <li> Love this Scent.  It smells like roses in the package.  Has a sweet scent as it burns.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS INCENSE! It&#x27;s smells sweet, but is not overpowering. A huge upside is that the smell can linger for a day or two, depending on how many you burn and how often you burn.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent. There&#x27;s just something about it. I come home and the hubby has it lit for me so I can unwind from work.</li>
            <li> This is a very calming scent. It is not over powering like some others and everyone that has come into the house enjoys it. This is the only scent used in the house with the exception of sage.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love this incense. I am actually going to order more soon. It has a long lasting scent and it does make me have some peace of mind.</li>
            <li> I bought these on a trip in Rhode Island and have been trying to find them ever since. They&#x27;re in my opinion the best smelling I&#x27;ve found so far.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to find them on here ! Great price, and they got to me very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I have a drawer filled with incense I&#x27;ve bought and never used, because once I got these they&#x27;re all I&#x27;ve burned since.&lt;br /&gt;Great scent, fast shipping and delivery, I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. It is kind of a soft rose smell it is very pleasant</li>
            <li> This scent is hard to describe.  It&#x27;s sort of peachy, but clean, with a dab of vanilla (nearly undetectable).  They just smell really good.  Calming even.  I will purchase again.  Wildberry brand incense are the bomb-diggity;  they&#x27;re all good, strong scents.  They have more scent to them, and not so much just smoke.  I doubt I&#x27;ll ever purchase another brand of incense.  They&#x27;re that good.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this blend!  Good quality.  Nice, unique smell, not too perfumey, pleasant.  Good vibes!~</li>
            <li> Smell great&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying that these smelled absolutely fantastic. I am SO happy I bought them because months later, I still have some. When shopping for Wildberry on Amazon, I came down Peace of Mind and Fizzy Pop. I remembered Fizzy Pop from buying it at a shop, but didn&#x27;t know much about Peace Of Mind.&lt;br /&gt;This incense smells a lot like vanilla and strawberry with a rosey scent. It&#x27;s not SUPER strong, but just strong enough to make your home smell fantastic! It&#x27;s a very good smell if you often get headaches from incense, because the smell is super delightful and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I love Wildberry incense!!  This leaves a pleasant aroma throughout my house that is not too heavy, and doesn&#x27;t smell like typical incense.</li>
            <li> Probably one of my favorite scents by Wildberry. Very clean &amp; sweet.</li>
            <li> outstanding burn well</li>
            <li> As good as oil dipped incense gets.  Scent is fine.  Smoke is thick and harsh to handle.  Mother&#x27;s Fragrancesare are still my favorite.</li>
            <li> very light and great smelling. it smells sweet.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite incense scent since I was 12. It&#x27;s a lovely, slightly fruity aroma that is strong, but not too overpowering. I&#x27;ve been buying this from various smoke shops for years, and while it&#x27;s never been outrageously expensive to buy it that way, buying this size through Amazon is a much better bargain.</li>
            <li> I just started getting Wildberry incense, and these things&#x27; scents last hours after you burn them. Peace of Mind has a prominent strawberry scent, with undertones of vanilla, wood, and musk. Smells good enough to eat, which is why I&#x27;m usually hungry after I burn one!</li>
            <li> Best price out there and quality.</li>
