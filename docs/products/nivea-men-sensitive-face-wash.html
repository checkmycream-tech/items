            <li>This product has a very nice scent.  </li>
            <li>face wash may not be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea since it is a bit watery, but it is a quality product that smells great and does a good job.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It is an inexpensive, good cleanser that won&#x27;t break you out.</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s a good cleaner that leaves his face refreshed.</li>
            <li>product does a good job as a face wash.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my skin felt consistently good after a week of using this.</li>
            <li>is good</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but not as great as the fragrance-free formula.</li>
            <li>Great product makes me feel better</li>
            <li>Nice as expected...I got a good price and picked it up from Amazon rather than any store.</li>
            <li>This was a huge hit !!</li>
            <li>All-in-all I am pleased!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to find something that works for him!</li>
            <li>So definitely loving this facewash.</li>
            <li>I should state that I&#x27;m an Amazon Vine Reviewer, and this isn&#x27;t a product I&#x27;d ever buy on my own.</li>
            <li>I want this kind of smell perfume if anyone knows?</li>
            <li>Oh yes, the Face Wash contains Witch Hazel extract and as we New Englanders all know Witch Hazel is a marvelous cure-all for what ails you -</li>
            <li>and I felt it did an excellent job, so much so that I&#x27;ll buy more of Nivea&#x27;s face wash for all my cleansing needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell of that fragrance is VERY strong, which does not even make sense given that it is a face wash product you are going to rinse off.</li>
            <li>I liked using it, and my wife ended up stealing the tube from me :-)</li>
            <li>I loved this product for its smooth texture and aroma.</li>
            <li>Does have a good, clean feel.</li>
            <li>This is a good face wash that gets you clean without the tightness or drying of some cleansers.</li>
            <li>Works well, pleasant and fresh, unobtrusive scent.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t noted problems before, but I have enjoyed using the face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And many products, even so-called &amp;#34;allergy free&amp;#34; ones that contain any sort of fragrence, trigger a reaction.  </li>
            <li>better yet, it appears to help the moisturizers and medicines I must apply work better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but there are better cleansers out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>(My face doesn&#x27;t react well to most soaps.)</li>
            <li>but as I shave DE style after my shower was hoping for a littlew more &amp;#</li>
            <li>Been using this product for many years now.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The chamomile, witch hazel, and vitamin E blend have a refreshing quality.  </li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>It has been praised by the many users I know that use this product.  </li>
            <li>well, is great for sensitive skin, and was just a nice face wash, so would recommend.</li>
            <li>This procedure also works better for avoiding the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I do not know for sure that the Vitamine E, Chamomile and Witch hazel extracts will be medicinally beneficial, however I hope so.  </li>
            <li>My favorite..</li>
            <li>With no alcohol in it, I assumed the face wash would do a better job on that front</li>
            <li>Having said that, it does seem to work better for some people than others.</li>
            <li>If it was priced more realistically I might use it over the long-term.  </li>
            <li>Best feature is that it cleans without leaving an oily feel as some facial cleansers do.</li>
            <li>I really love scent smell of this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and attractive and washing the product off leaves your skin refreshed in a way that make you want to smile and face the day.  </li>
            <li>I love the product it makes my skin clean and healthy not oily and not dry this product it excellent for men skin.</li>
            <li>all, this is a good product that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>The original formula of this face wash was perfect, it was gentle, dye free and alcohol free.  </li>
            <li>Nive makes great sensitive skin products.</li>
            <li>The smell is good, which helps if you care about your face smelling very aromatically after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nivea always creates good products at a reasonable cost, and packaging is well designed.</li>
            <li>He finds that it is effective, but doesn&#x27;t cause sensitive skin issues like redness or more breakouts!</li>
            <li>Very nice face wash if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Its smell is very light and pleasant; I barely notice it.  </li>
            <li>The transparent gel is easy to squeeze from the tube.  </li>
            <li>The Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash is great for using with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.  </li>
            <li>Many men receive razor burns, blemishes and bumps after shaving; others want to have a clean shave and no reactions afterwards from the effects of shaving.  </li>
            <li>The product has a very mild fragrance I found acceptable.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and rinses off with no residue.  </li>
            <li>I thought the smell was over powering, too strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Where it separates itself though is the rather strong lingering scent/fragrance after use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While not the best ever, this is one I would not mind using regularly if the price is right.</li>
            <li>This is the first NIVEA grooming product I have ever used and to be completely honest</li>
            <li>it also caused my wife to come over and caress my cheek, not a bad payoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using the face wash mostly in the shower for my morning shave.  </li>
            <li>And most importantly, it leaves your face fully refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have dry skin as it is, so it wouldn&#x27;t be ideal for me.</li>
            <li>Great, the same as supermarket.</li>
            <li>and I actually bought a couple dozen bottles after it was discontinued because it was so great.</li>
            <li>Earlier, it was fragrance-free, and I thought it was great.  </li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]]), which exfoliates my skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a light smell, if smells had colors, it kinda smells like the color of the packaging.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face feels smooth after I use the wash.  </li>
            <li>wash doesn&#x27;t seem to lather all that much, which would probably lead people to use more of the product and have to rebuy it more</li>
            <li>good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>While I liked it at first what I didn&#x27;t like was that it made the shower/bath floor super slippery.  </li>
            <li>While this product did an adequate job, I honestly had higher hopes for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not in any way greasy and after using the product your skin feels very smooth after the first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lathers easily and quickly washes away.  </li>
            <li>If you like foamy face washes this product isn&#x27;t for you - it&#x27;s very much a cream, and as a result it requires a bit more effort to remove after washing, but since using it I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in skin flair ups and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Certainly more than the old formula but also probably more than any face wash</li>
            <li>I use this once (sometimes twice) a day to leave my face feeling refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>It does clean well</li>
            <li>I must use one that will gently clean my face without drying it out and making it feel like a leather mask or sandpaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Helped quite a bit with the dryness, and keeping my face clean and sfot for the wife.</li>
            <li>The product claims on the package to clean without drying out the skin and softens the beard for a closer shave.</li>
            <li>Go back to original formula NIVEA!!!</li>
            <li>It has a nice creamy texture, applies easily, and I suspect it opens the pores and allows them to absorb other products better.  </li>
            <li>But overall a good face wash.</li>
            <li>After washing my face with this product my skin felt super clean</li>
            <li>It does have a male scent but it smells good.</li>
            <li>That is good enough.</li>
            <li>This is a nice soap for guys with sensitive skin like me.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve noticed that ever since I started exfoliating my skin, my face is cleaner, healthier and more vibrant and females of all ages appear to appreciate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, my face is cleaner, healthier and more vibrant and females of all ages appear to appreciate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It offered an adequate cleansing which lasted 2-3 hours or so even if the scent lingered.</li>
            <li>3.3 fl oz (100 ml)]] is absolutely the best facial care product a man can own for maintaining his face, and so I have fairly high expectations of their face wash in the same line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only is it a good pre shave wash, but it&#x27;s great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I generally take a shower and then shave with shaving cream and then rinse with warm wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>soap is pleasant and has no particular odor.  </li>
            <li>This winter has been one of the strangest that I have ever experienced; its up and down temperatures have been detrimental to my sinuses and complexion.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive skin and can break out easily if using cleaners that are too strong.</li>
            <li>Easy to squeeze too much out.  </li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s intended for sensitive faces, which seems to be the case, goes on easily and washes off fine.</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive, and this is my favorite cleansing product.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and not overpowering, and I felt clean and ready for the day after using it.</li>
            <li>I really like the light scent.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s marketed as &#x27;fragrance-free&#x27;, it does have a gentle soapy smell which I rather enjoy.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>but I think one of the things many people are sensitive to is perfumes so it makes no sense that this product has so many.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are no artificial colors and dyes.  </li>
            <li>When your teenage goes to store to buy a product all on his own -- I would say this product works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be great for at least one of these manufacturers to make a men&#x27;s product that is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>This is a gift for the men in my home, who love Nivea for Men Sensitive Face Wash and have been using this product for years.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why companies feel the need to always try to mess with a successful product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, and I&#x27;ll probably purchase it again when my free sample runs out.</li>
            <li>I use it almost every morning in the shower and this 5 oz container has lasted for more than month, even with me occasionally squeezing out far more than I need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Nivea products and I always found their face wash to be a great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>and of course is gentle for sensitive skin - found it to be better than comparable one from Dove Men care which was &amp;#34;Messy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Your morning will be more extra fresh with this product.</li>
            <li>If a good treatment of soap really isn&#x27;t doing it for your face this product would be a great next step to try, but I can&#x27;t give too high of a recommendation for daily use just because it&#x27;s not necessary except in cases of need.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and not strong.  </li>
            <li>My face gets very dry from washing, and this facewash is very good in keeping it from getting too dry.</li>
            <li>I was a huge fan of the Nivea Sensitive Face Wash that got discontinued a couple years ago</li>
            <li>first thing you&#x27;ll notice is that it is LOADED with perfumes.</li>
            <li>I had some reservations about this face wash after my first use.</li>
            <li>Even though the Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash is designed for men, I feel that women can also enjoy its benefits.  </li>
            <li>Even though the Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash is designed for men, I feel that women can also enjoy its benefits.  </li>
            <li>Definitely NOT fragrance-free any more.</li>
            <li>and I feel that it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>A litle extra hydration would have made it more beneficial to my skin type.</li>
            <li>In fact the first time I tried it, my wife cam into the bathroom and noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>This is a bit disconcerting at first, but once applied you can feel the difference as your skin is energized</li>
            <li>so I was glad to see this back.</li>
            <li>He is a hockey player who needs a good face wash product after wearing an helmet everyday and sweating.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as effective at removing skin oils as some other products, but those products cause me severe reactions anyway</li>
            <li>When I saw this one in the store recently I was super excited - &amp;</li>
            <li>It applies easily and washes cleanly, it has absolutely no irritation and does its job well.</li>
            <li>Three splashes and it was completely washed clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure the formula is all that good, either.</li>
            <li>Combine this with Nivea Men&#x27;s sensitive body wash to get the full experience.</li>
            <li>It may not solve all your issues, but I can&#x27;t imagine that it would help to a large degree.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of sensitive face washes from Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear, to Dove.</li>
            <li>#34;formula is soap, fragrance, dye and alcohol free to minimize the risk of skin irritation.&amp;#34; The new bottle does notmake that claim because they clearly have lots of soap, fragrance, dye and alcohol.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is perfect for using during the winter months when facial skin becomes easily dehydrated because of outdoor cold and wind and indoor heat.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for using during the winter months when facial skin becomes easily dehydrated because of outdoor cold and wind and indoor heat.  </li>
            <li>and I am happy that it does not have any of those little plastic beads mixed in that are for &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Cleans your face without drying and without a girly scent and it does not cost a whole lot, either.</li>
            <li>It does not take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Very flowery (so maybe it comes from the flower extract).</li>
            <li>I become a real wreck.  </li>
            <li>really refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because my skin is acne prone, I religiously use the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>cleans your face without drying and without a girly scent and it does not cost a whole lot, either.</li>
            <li>The face wash works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and is gentle on my skin and leaves it feeling refreshed after.</li>
            <li>The scent is manly and not too intense.</li>
            <li>I really like the feeling this gives</li>
            <li>I love the Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm and was hoping this had a similar scent.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a masculine name or promise me that I will become sexually irresistible to the opposite sex.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for husband as it&#x27;s not easy to find skin care for sensitive skin at a good price.  </li>
            <li>Nivea...if you are listening, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE go back to the original formula for this face wash.  </li>
            <li>However, i still end up using pore strips and finding clogged dirt, meaning this doesn&#x27;t clean as deep as i&#x27;d</li>
            <li>Very gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable that I can use this product for long periods of time without worrying about allergic reactions.  </li>

            <li>bar\\&quot; but true soap) and give the same care to their face that they would use with this cleaner.</li>
            <li>when I first got this product I knew it was brand new , because  when you buy a product that as to do with your skin it has to be new and unused.</li>
            <li>It cleans without drying the skin -- actually, it seems to add a little moisture (a good</li>
            <li>That alone is good enough for a 5 star rating, but this product takes a little getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I decided to try this product after my wife commented that my skin was dry and no longer smooth to touch.  </li>
            <li>If you have issues with soap, allergies, dryness or redness, this might be a decent face wash to consider.</li>
            <li>like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: i don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin, so i can&#x27;t really relate to that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d personally would benefit more from a facial scrub.</li>
            <li>Both my older son and I tried this product.</li>
            <li>I love how amazon now finally sells them individually.</li>
            <li>It is clear and only lightly scented.</li>
            <li>The high glycerin content leaves my face feeling a bit stripped after I wash it off.  </li>
            <li>A fairly small amount is good enough for a beardless wash, so it may last longer than the 5oz suggests, especially compared to some of the more creamy/liquid ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nivea for men sensitive face wash certainly doesn&#x27;t trigger any sort of reaction (irritation or redness) from my skin, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking once I finish this first tube, I&#x27;ll go back to Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean Cream Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>So i feel about 99% sure that the heavy perfumes are causing an allergic reaction for me.</li>
            <li>Anyway, because of all these conditions, I can&#x27;t use normal soap.  </li>
            <li>I normally use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also a lot of the normal face washes ends up clogging my pores which defeats the purpose of a face wash.</li>
            <li>Sensitive Face Wash is highly recommended for men who want to use an affordable, masculine, no nonsense facial cleanser to gently exfoliate and clean their sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Sensitive Face Wash is highly recommended for men who want to use an affordable, masculine, no nonsense facial cleanser to gently exfoliate and clean their sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Wanting to try something new, I stumbled upon this while searching for a new face wash.</li>
            <li>I have never washed my face with soap before, so this is a new experience.  </li>
            <li>So I feel decently qualified to comment about sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Just a few drops mixed with warm water is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I decided to try it and was very surprised by the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>My significant other uses this.</li>
            <li>However, it is also nothing too special -- it cleans about as well as a bar of quality soap, and it&#x27;s more expensive.</li>
            <li>This new forumla is nothing like the old one and because of that, I will never purchase this again.  </li>
            <li>short, it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d expect of a Nivea sensitive face wash.</li>
            <li>Honestly the scent is so subtle that compared to my body wash, shampoo, etc, I barely notice</li>
            <li>Nivea used to have an older line and this new line looks and works just the same.</li>
            <li>Somewhat expensive compared to others but does a really great job cleansing facial skin without irritation.</li>
            <li>, if you are looking for something with a scent to it this may be up your alley, but if you&#x27;re looking for something with no scent steer clear of this.</li>
            <li>B00BEE5VJQ Nivea for Men Post Shave Balm, Sensitive</li>
            <li>but I got is for my hubby who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>He is sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a product designed for sensitive skin with no fragrance to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this really works but,  need to use regularly - it removes all dust particles while washing with</li>
            <li>For example, on Sunday, March 2, 2014, the temperatures soared into the seventies; it felt like a balmy spring day.  </li>
            <li>The Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash can be used three times a day without drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Instead of using the Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser [[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>K Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser 6 OZ (2 PACK)]]]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for nearly two weeks</li>
            <li>Also, Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash doesn&#x27;t have any advertisement gimmicks.  </li>
            <li>My normal face wash is Cetaphil and that has generally worked well.</li>
            <li>Nivea has created this product for Men with Sensitive skin, and a face wash to use before or after shaving.</li>
            <li>They have stated that it works for them; they do not have a sensitive reaction to shaving once they have used this</li>
            <li>Not harsh on my face at all</li>
            <li>Anyway, the gel does not lather in your hands the way shampoo does in your hair, so you have to lather up the gel using a soft sponge or wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>Nivea Men - Sensitive - Face Wash [2014-03-07 509]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a close shave and my skin was not dried out.</li>
            <li>I did purchase another NIVEA product after my evaluation: NIVEA Post Shave Balm for sensitive skin which complements the Face Wash</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you are in the market for a modestly price skin/shaving product.</li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t justify paying $1.20 per ounce for it when I can get either Dove Sensitive Skin body wash or bar soap for around $.39 per ounce.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll take what I can get with a product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Those with truly sensitive skin should try Cetaphil&#x27;s classic, simple cleanser instead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too much scented for an &#x27;unscented&#x27; product, so would not recommend if you&#x27;re going for unscented; it could be milder, and less strong scent to gain that name:</li>
            <li>; and this version and the old one are basically the same except the old has an additional bullet point saying &amp;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn, actually felt somewhat soothing to the face and didn&#x27;t irritate either one of us and my son has very sensitive</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have given it higher marks</li>
            <li>face wash will give your face a clean and refreshed feeling without excessively drying out your face.</li>
            <li>This one goes on smoothly (unlike some of the other pasty facial cleansers I&#x27;ve used) and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry, like it has sucked all of the oils out of it.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and moisturized but still get pimples even using it as a daily wash.</li>
            <li>Apparently this is the signature NIVEA fragrance</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product I wash my sensitive face with.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do any better, or worse, than the Dove face wash</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is faint, which is nice and it does feel invigorating, but I don&#x27;t like the dryness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more watery than what I&#x27;m used to, but that can be rectified by using less of it.</li>
            <li>aware there is a slight scent to the face wash and for those with extra sensitive skin that might be an issue.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount to wash your face with and as you clean your face, you can feel it working.</li>
            <li>Only a small dab is required to clean my face, neck and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I think it helps moisturize his skin and does not dry it out like</li>
            <li>As a man with sensitive skin, every face wash I&#x27;ve ever used seems to leave me with a red, itchy, dry face on day #3 of use.</li>

            <li> This product has a very nice scent.  </li>
            <li> face wash may not be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea since it is a bit watery, but it is a quality product that smells great and does a good job.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It is an inexpensive, good cleanser that won&#x27;t break you out.</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s a good cleaner that leaves his face refreshed.</li>
            <li> product does a good job as a face wash.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin felt consistently good after a week of using this.</li>
            <li> is good</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but not as great as the fragrance-free formula.</li>
            <li> Great product makes me feel better</li>
            <li> Nice as expected...I got a good price and picked it up from Amazon rather than any store.</li>
            <li> This was a huge hit !!</li>
            <li> All-in-all I am pleased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to find something that works for him!</li>
            <li> So definitely loving this facewash.</li>
            <li> I should state that I&#x27;m an Amazon Vine Reviewer, and this isn&#x27;t a product I&#x27;d ever buy on my own.</li>
            <li> I want this kind of smell perfume if anyone knows?</li>
            <li> Oh yes, the Face Wash contains Witch Hazel extract and as we New Englanders all know Witch Hazel is a marvelous cure-all for what ails you -</li>
            <li> and I felt it did an excellent job, so much so that I&#x27;ll buy more of Nivea&#x27;s face wash for all my cleansing needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell of that fragrance is VERY strong, which does not even make sense given that it is a face wash product you are going to rinse off.</li>
            <li> I liked using it, and my wife ended up stealing the tube from me :-)</li>
            <li> I loved this product for its smooth texture and aroma.</li>
            <li> Does have a good, clean feel.</li>
            <li> This is a good face wash that gets you clean without the tightness or drying of some cleansers.</li>
            <li> Works well, pleasant and fresh, unobtrusive scent.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t noted problems before, but I have enjoyed using the face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And many products, even so-called &amp;#34;allergy free&amp;#34; ones that contain any sort of fragrence, trigger a reaction.  </li>
            <li> better yet, it appears to help the moisturizers and medicines I must apply work better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but there are better cleansers out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> (My face doesn&#x27;t react well to most soaps.)</li>
            <li> but as I shave DE style after my shower was hoping for a littlew more &amp;#</li>
            <li> Been using this product for many years now.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The chamomile, witch hazel, and vitamin E blend have a refreshing quality.  </li>
            <li> okay...</li>
            <li> It has been praised by the many users I know that use this product.  </li>
            <li> well, is great for sensitive skin, and was just a nice face wash, so would recommend.</li>
            <li> This procedure also works better for avoiding the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I do not know for sure that the Vitamine E, Chamomile and Witch hazel extracts will be medicinally beneficial, however I hope so.  </li>
            <li> My favorite..</li>
            <li> With no alcohol in it, I assumed the face wash would do a better job on that front</li>
            <li> Having said that, it does seem to work better for some people than others.</li>
            <li> If it was priced more realistically I might use it over the long-term.  </li>
            <li> Best feature is that it cleans without leaving an oily feel as some facial cleansers do.</li>
            <li> I really love scent smell of this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> The scent is clean and attractive and washing the product off leaves your skin refreshed in a way that make you want to smile and face the day.  </li>
            <li> I love the product it makes my skin clean and healthy not oily and not dry this product it excellent for men skin.</li>
            <li> all, this is a good product that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> The original formula of this face wash was perfect, it was gentle, dye free and alcohol free.  </li>
            <li> Nive makes great sensitive skin products.</li>
            <li> The smell is good, which helps if you care about your face smelling very aromatically after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nivea always creates good products at a reasonable cost, and packaging is well designed.</li>
            <li> He finds that it is effective, but doesn&#x27;t cause sensitive skin issues like redness or more breakouts!</li>
            <li> Very nice face wash if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Its smell is very light and pleasant; I barely notice it.  </li>
            <li> The transparent gel is easy to squeeze from the tube.  </li>
            <li> The Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash is great for using with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.  </li>
            <li> Many men receive razor burns, blemishes and bumps after shaving; others want to have a clean shave and no reactions afterwards from the effects of shaving.  </li>
            <li> The product has a very mild fragrance I found acceptable.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and rinses off with no residue.  </li>
            <li> I thought the smell was over powering, too strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Where it separates itself though is the rather strong lingering scent/fragrance after use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While not the best ever, this is one I would not mind using regularly if the price is right.</li>
            <li> This is the first NIVEA grooming product I have ever used and to be completely honest</li>
            <li> it also caused my wife to come over and caress my cheek, not a bad payoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using the face wash mostly in the shower for my morning shave.  </li>
            <li> And most importantly, it leaves your face fully refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have dry skin as it is, so it wouldn&#x27;t be ideal for me.</li>
            <li> Great, the same as supermarket.</li>
            <li> and I actually bought a couple dozen bottles after it was discontinued because it was so great.</li>
            <li> Earlier, it was fragrance-free, and I thought it was great.  </li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]]), which exfoliates my skin.  </li>
            <li> It has a light smell, if smells had colors, it kinda smells like the color of the packaging.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face feels smooth after I use the wash.  </li>
            <li> wash doesn&#x27;t seem to lather all that much, which would probably lead people to use more of the product and have to rebuy it more</li>
            <li> good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> While I liked it at first what I didn&#x27;t like was that it made the shower/bath floor super slippery.  </li>
            <li> While this product did an adequate job, I honestly had higher hopes for it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not in any way greasy and after using the product your skin feels very smooth after the first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lathers easily and quickly washes away.  </li>
            <li> If you like foamy face washes this product isn&#x27;t for you - it&#x27;s very much a cream, and as a result it requires a bit more effort to remove after washing, but since using it I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in skin flair ups and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Certainly more than the old formula but also probably more than any face wash</li>
            <li> I use this once (sometimes twice) a day to leave my face feeling refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li> It does clean well</li>
            <li> I must use one that will gently clean my face without drying it out and making it feel like a leather mask or sandpaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helped quite a bit with the dryness, and keeping my face clean and sfot for the wife.</li>
            <li> The product claims on the package to clean without drying out the skin and softens the beard for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Go back to original formula NIVEA!!!</li>
            <li> It has a nice creamy texture, applies easily, and I suspect it opens the pores and allows them to absorb other products better.  </li>
            <li> But overall a good face wash.</li>
            <li> After washing my face with this product my skin felt super clean</li>
            <li> It does have a male scent but it smells good.</li>
            <li> That is good enough.</li>
            <li> This is a nice soap for guys with sensitive skin like me.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve noticed that ever since I started exfoliating my skin, my face is cleaner, healthier and more vibrant and females of all ages appear to appreciate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , my face is cleaner, healthier and more vibrant and females of all ages appear to appreciate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It offered an adequate cleansing which lasted 2-3 hours or so even if the scent lingered.</li>
            <li> 3.3 fl oz (100 ml)]] is absolutely the best facial care product a man can own for maintaining his face, and so I have fairly high expectations of their face wash in the same line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only is it a good pre shave wash, but it&#x27;s great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I generally take a shower and then shave with shaving cream and then rinse with warm wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> soap is pleasant and has no particular odor.  </li>
            <li> This winter has been one of the strangest that I have ever experienced; its up and down temperatures have been detrimental to my sinuses and complexion.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive skin and can break out easily if using cleaners that are too strong.</li>
            <li> Easy to squeeze too much out.  </li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s intended for sensitive faces, which seems to be the case, goes on easily and washes off fine.</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive, and this is my favorite cleansing product.</li>
            <li> The scent is clean and not overpowering, and I felt clean and ready for the day after using it.</li>
            <li> I really like the light scent.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s marketed as &#x27;fragrance-free&#x27;, it does have a gentle soapy smell which I rather enjoy.</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> but I think one of the things many people are sensitive to is perfumes so it makes no sense that this product has so many.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are no artificial colors and dyes.  </li>
            <li> When your teenage goes to store to buy a product all on his own -- I would say this product works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be great for at least one of these manufacturers to make a men&#x27;s product that is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for the men in my home, who love Nivea for Men Sensitive Face Wash and have been using this product for years.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why companies feel the need to always try to mess with a successful product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, and I&#x27;ll probably purchase it again when my free sample runs out.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every morning in the shower and this 5 oz container has lasted for more than month, even with me occasionally squeezing out far more than I need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Nivea products and I always found their face wash to be a great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> and of course is gentle for sensitive skin - found it to be better than comparable one from Dove Men care which was &amp;#34;Messy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Your morning will be more extra fresh with this product.</li>
            <li> If a good treatment of soap really isn&#x27;t doing it for your face this product would be a great next step to try, but I can&#x27;t give too high of a recommendation for daily use just because it&#x27;s not necessary except in cases of need.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and not strong.  </li>
            <li> My face gets very dry from washing, and this facewash is very good in keeping it from getting too dry.</li>
            <li> I was a huge fan of the Nivea Sensitive Face Wash that got discontinued a couple years ago</li>
            <li> first thing you&#x27;ll notice is that it is LOADED with perfumes.</li>
            <li> I had some reservations about this face wash after my first use.</li>
            <li> Even though the Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash is designed for men, I feel that women can also enjoy its benefits.  </li>
            <li> Even though the Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash is designed for men, I feel that women can also enjoy its benefits.  </li>
            <li> Definitely NOT fragrance-free any more.</li>
            <li> and I feel that it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> A litle extra hydration would have made it more beneficial to my skin type.</li>
            <li> In fact the first time I tried it, my wife cam into the bathroom and noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> This is a bit disconcerting at first, but once applied you can feel the difference as your skin is energized</li>
            <li> so I was glad to see this back.</li>
            <li> He is a hockey player who needs a good face wash product after wearing an helmet everyday and sweating.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as effective at removing skin oils as some other products, but those products cause me severe reactions anyway</li>
            <li> When I saw this one in the store recently I was super excited - &amp;</li>
            <li> It applies easily and washes cleanly, it has absolutely no irritation and does its job well.</li>
            <li> Three splashes and it was completely washed clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure the formula is all that good, either.</li>
            <li> Combine this with Nivea Men&#x27;s sensitive body wash to get the full experience.</li>
            <li> It may not solve all your issues, but I can&#x27;t imagine that it would help to a large degree.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of sensitive face washes from Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear, to Dove.</li>
            <li> #34;formula is soap, fragrance, dye and alcohol free to minimize the risk of skin irritation.&amp;#34; The new bottle does notmake that claim because they clearly have lots of soap, fragrance, dye and alcohol.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is perfect for using during the winter months when facial skin becomes easily dehydrated because of outdoor cold and wind and indoor heat.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect for using during the winter months when facial skin becomes easily dehydrated because of outdoor cold and wind and indoor heat.  </li>
            <li> and I am happy that it does not have any of those little plastic beads mixed in that are for &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Cleans your face without drying and without a girly scent and it does not cost a whole lot, either.</li>
            <li> It does not take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Very flowery (so maybe it comes from the flower extract).</li>

            <li> really refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because my skin is acne prone, I religiously use the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> cleans your face without drying and without a girly scent and it does not cost a whole lot, either.</li>
            <li> The face wash works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and is gentle on my skin and leaves it feeling refreshed after.</li>
            <li> The scent is manly and not too intense.</li>
            <li> I really like the feeling this gives</li>
            <li> I love the Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm and was hoping this had a similar scent.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a masculine name or promise me that I will become sexually irresistible to the opposite sex.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for husband as it&#x27;s not easy to find skin care for sensitive skin at a good price.  </li>
            <li> Nivea...if you are listening, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE go back to the original formula for this face wash.  </li>
            <li> However, i still end up using pore strips and finding clogged dirt, meaning this doesn&#x27;t clean as deep as i&#x27;d</li>
            <li> Very gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable that I can use this product for long periods of time without worrying about allergic reactions.  </li>

            <li> when I first got this product I knew it was brand new , because  when you buy a product that as to do with your skin it has to be new and unused.</li>
            <li> It cleans without drying the skin -- actually, it seems to add a little moisture (a good</li>
            <li> That alone is good enough for a 5 star rating, but this product takes a little getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I decided to try this product after my wife commented that my skin was dry and no longer smooth to touch.  </li>
            <li> If you have issues with soap, allergies, dryness or redness, this might be a decent face wash to consider.</li>
            <li> like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: i don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin, so i can&#x27;t really relate to that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d personally would benefit more from a facial scrub.</li>
            <li> Both my older son and I tried this product.</li>
            <li> I love how amazon now finally sells them individually.</li>
            <li> It is clear and only lightly scented.</li>
            <li> The high glycerin content leaves my face feeling a bit stripped after I wash it off.  </li>
            <li> A fairly small amount is good enough for a beardless wash, so it may last longer than the 5oz suggests, especially compared to some of the more creamy/liquid ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nivea for men sensitive face wash certainly doesn&#x27;t trigger any sort of reaction (irritation or redness) from my skin, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking once I finish this first tube, I&#x27;ll go back to Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean Cream Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> So i feel about 99% sure that the heavy perfumes are causing an allergic reaction for me.</li>
            <li> Anyway, because of all these conditions, I can&#x27;t use normal soap.  </li>
            <li> I normally use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also a lot of the normal face washes ends up clogging my pores which defeats the purpose of a face wash.</li>
            <li> Sensitive Face Wash is highly recommended for men who want to use an affordable, masculine, no nonsense facial cleanser to gently exfoliate and clean their sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li> Wanting to try something new, I stumbled upon this while searching for a new face wash.</li>
            <li> I have never washed my face with soap before, so this is a new experience.  </li>
            <li> So I feel decently qualified to comment about sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Just a few drops mixed with warm water is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I decided to try it and was very surprised by the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> My significant other uses this.</li>
            <li> However, it is also nothing too special -- it cleans about as well as a bar of quality soap, and it&#x27;s more expensive.</li>
            <li> This new forumla is nothing like the old one and because of that, I will never purchase this again.  </li>
            <li> short, it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d expect of a Nivea sensitive face wash.</li>
            <li> Honestly the scent is so subtle that compared to my body wash, shampoo, etc, I barely notice</li>
            <li> Nivea used to have an older line and this new line looks and works just the same.</li>
            <li> Somewhat expensive compared to others but does a really great job cleansing facial skin without irritation.</li>
            <li> , if you are looking for something with a scent to it this may be up your alley, but if you&#x27;re looking for something with no scent steer clear of this.</li>
            <li> B00BEE5VJQ Nivea for Men Post Shave Balm, Sensitive</li>
            <li> but I got is for my hubby who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> He is sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a product designed for sensitive skin with no fragrance to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this really works but,  need to use regularly - it removes all dust particles while washing with</li>
            <li> For example, on Sunday, March 2, 2014, the temperatures soared into the seventies; it felt like a balmy spring day.  </li>
            <li> The Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash can be used three times a day without drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Instead of using the Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser [[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> K Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser 6 OZ (2 PACK)]]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for nearly two weeks</li>
            <li> Also, Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash doesn&#x27;t have any advertisement gimmicks.  </li>
            <li> My normal face wash is Cetaphil and that has generally worked well.</li>
            <li> Nivea has created this product for Men with Sensitive skin, and a face wash to use before or after shaving.</li>
            <li> They have stated that it works for them; they do not have a sensitive reaction to shaving once they have used this</li>
            <li> Not harsh on my face at all</li>
            <li> Anyway, the gel does not lather in your hands the way shampoo does in your hair, so you have to lather up the gel using a soft sponge or wash cloth.  </li>

            <li> I had a close shave and my skin was not dried out.</li>
            <li> I did purchase another NIVEA product after my evaluation: NIVEA Post Shave Balm for sensitive skin which complements the Face Wash</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you are in the market for a modestly price skin/shaving product.</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t justify paying $1.20 per ounce for it when I can get either Dove Sensitive Skin body wash or bar soap for around $.39 per ounce.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll take what I can get with a product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Those with truly sensitive skin should try Cetaphil&#x27;s classic, simple cleanser instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too much scented for an &#x27;unscented&#x27; product, so would not recommend if you&#x27;re going for unscented; it could be milder, and less strong scent to gain that name:</li>
            <li> ; and this version and the old one are basically the same except the old has an additional bullet point saying &amp;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn, actually felt somewhat soothing to the face and didn&#x27;t irritate either one of us and my son has very sensitive</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have given it higher marks</li>
            <li> face wash will give your face a clean and refreshed feeling without excessively drying out your face.</li>
            <li> This one goes on smoothly (unlike some of the other pasty facial cleansers I&#x27;ve used) and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry, like it has sucked all of the oils out of it.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and moisturized but still get pimples even using it as a daily wash.</li>
            <li> Apparently this is the signature NIVEA fragrance</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product I wash my sensitive face with.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do any better, or worse, than the Dove face wash</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is faint, which is nice and it does feel invigorating, but I don&#x27;t like the dryness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more watery than what I&#x27;m used to, but that can be rectified by using less of it.</li>
            <li> aware there is a slight scent to the face wash and for those with extra sensitive skin that might be an issue.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to wash your face with and as you clean your face, you can feel it working.</li>
            <li> Only a small dab is required to clean my face, neck and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I think it helps moisturize his skin and does not dry it out like</li>
            <li> As a man with sensitive skin, every face wash I&#x27;ve ever used seems to leave me with a red, itchy, dry face on day #3 of use.</li>
            <li> She and I both have sensitive facial skin and have used each other&#x27;s facial cleansers.  </li>
            <li> She and I both have sensitive facial skin and have used each other&#x27;s facial cleansers.  </li>
            <li> cleanser is very slippery and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It does not take much to get the job done - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> the originally Sensitive Face Wash. The smell is cheap and bad - I&#x27;d compare it to the fragrance of an Old Spice body wash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just very frustrating that they discontinued a product that was so helpful and came up with a new one that is the exact opposite with the same branding as before.</li>
            <li> and my face always feels soft, dry, and clean, not rough, oily and dirty.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is a completely different product than their old one and basically does the exact opposite of what they claim.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dry, flaky, red, inflamed.  </li>
            <li> Though this cleanser touts itself as &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;for sensitive skin,&amp;#34; it has a tendency to irritate my eyes and nose slightly.</li>
            <li> I did not see any dry skin like I do when I use regular bath soap.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Nivea made the peculiar decision to replace its fine, unscented Men&#x27;s Sensitive Face Wash with this heavily scented version that is alcohol-free.</li>
            <li> As some have mentioned, it has a high level of glycerin which may be weird for some people as the glycerin has a very slimy / greasy feeling on your face</li>
            <li> Why not sure keep a formula that is actually helpful for people with sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> that came with the system, I use a variety of inexpensive facial washes, usually the ones for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Consequently, I have to be careful with my facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it besides being annoyed by the smell, I felt it actually DID dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;m done shaving, I use this wash and I&#x27;ve never had any dry issues since.</li>
            <li> Without going into specifics I have facial skin that takes a beating during the cold dry New England winters - particularly if I&#x27;m outdoors after shaving.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight and dry like the regular version does.</li>
            <li> It is not a classic Nivea cream smell, but it&#x27;s somewhere in that neighborhood.</li>
            <li> I typically shave with soap while in the shower, and I&#x27;ve always suffered from some dry skin issues in the winter, and I never really cared enough to do anything about it.</li>
            <li> My only qualm as with any product of this sort is that too few people will just pick up a bar of soap (not a \\&quot;body</li>
            <li> My skin feels gross after just a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone who suffers from dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to use it again and will certainly not buy it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So needless to say I was blown away when I started using this particular face wash from Nivea and didn&#x27;t experience any of the aforementioned symptoms.</li>
            <li> And that fragrance is an awful scent, which makes the advertised fragrance free very untrue.</li>
            <li> but my skin dried up at the same pace as it usually does.  </li>
            <li> Why on Earth would they think men with sensitive skin would want to use a product with an unnecessary additive, namely an added fragrance?</li>
            <li> Over the past few years, it became harder and harder to find the fragrance-free version, and I&#x27;ve since been using the scented version.  </li>
            <li> That is NOT TRUE.</li>
            <li> Why do these companies mess with what&#x27;s working?</li>
            <li> Can be a little drying at times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically stronger smelling than all the other face washes I&#x27;ve bought in the past couple years looking for a replacement of</li>
            <li> All ended up drying my skin and always leaned towards heavy fragrances.</li>
            <li> With a few days of beard, it feels like it is disappearing into the beard.</li>
            <li> My shoulders have cleared up, and my face feels like a million dollars everyday since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> The face wash hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin, leaving it red, itchy or broken out with a rash.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not wholly unpleasant, but it&#x27;s not a scent I&#x27;d normally pick for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tube may seem small, but you get a lot.</li>
            <li> Had had problems with soap products drying my face out in the past.  </li>
            <li> It is see-through, almost colorless, with a small number of small bubbles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my husband this past winter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, the face wash is thick, I mean really thick and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hardly an expert on face washes, but I do have oily skin and have used a variety of products.</li>
            <li> Then it because hard to find in the stores, so I started purchasing it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does work for what it&#x27;s designed for,at least from my 100% unscientific testing in the shower.</li>
            <li> On Tuesday, March 3, 2014, I was late to work because of snow and ice on the roads.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Very thick and greasy feeling...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and as long as it doesn&#x27;t smell bad I can careless about the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I used to look at all of these customized products and scoff, what&#x27;s wrong with soap?  </li>
            <li> For some reason, it gave me a lot of acne on my shoulders and after awhile, my face felt all oily and dirty.</li>
            <li> Having said that it was disappointing when it came to moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It didnt have this awful scent that this one has.  </li>
            <li> Horrible product don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> It dries your skin terribly!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great, the same as supermarket.</li>
            <li> Cleans your face without drying and without a girly scent and it does not cost a whole lot, either. It does not take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Nice as expected...I got a good price and picked it up from Amazon rather than any store.</li>
            <li> Can be a little drying at times. But overall a good face wash.</li>
            <li> Very gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product is a great product. Somewhat expensive compared to others but does a really great job cleansing facial skin without irritation.</li>
            <li> Nive makes great sensitive skin products. Their [[ASIN:B00BEE5VJQ Nivea for Men Post Shave Balm, Sensitive 3.3 fl oz (100 ml)]] is absolutely the best facial care product a man can own for maintaining his face, and so I have fairly high expectations of their face wash in the same line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;d expect of a Nivea sensitive face wash. It applies easily and washes cleanly, it has absolutely no irritation and does its job well. My only qualm as with any product of this sort is that too few people will just pick up a bar of soap (not a \\&quot;body bar\\&quot; but true soap) and give the same care to their face that they would use with this cleaner. If a good treatment of soap really isn&#x27;t doing it for your face this product would be a great next step to try, but I can&#x27;t give too high of a recommendation for daily use just because it&#x27;s not necessary except in cases of need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Nivea products and I always found their face wash to be a great product, especially for the price. The tube may seem small, but you get a lot. You only need a small amount to wash your face with and as you clean your face, you can feel it working. This product lasted two weeks and I felt it did an excellent job, so much so that I&#x27;ll buy more of Nivea&#x27;s face wash for all my cleansing needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li> It works great for me...but I got is for my hubby who has sensitive skin. He is sensitive to fragrance.Now fragrance doesn&#x27;t appear on the list of ingredients but this is a smelly product. Very flowery (so maybe it comes from the flower extract). Also he likes to avoid glycerin when he can...and that is ingredient number two here. SO if those things bother you, beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is very slippery and a little bit goes a long way. I like that it leaves my face feeling softer than the shower soap we use, so I keep this in the shower. It is an inexpensive, good cleanser that won&#x27;t break you out. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I was a huge fan of the Nivea Sensitive Face Wash that got discontinued a couple years ago and I actually bought a couple dozen bottles after it was discontinued because it was so great. When I saw this one in the store recently I was super excited - &amp;#34;they brought it back!&amp;#34; I thought. Unfortunately this is a completely different product than their old one and basically does the exact opposite of what they claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you&#x27;ll notice is that it is LOADED with perfumes. Just opening the bottle you&#x27;ll get a sense. It&#x27;s basically stronger smelling than all the other face washes I&#x27;ve bought in the past couple years looking for a replacement of the originally Sensitive Face Wash. The smell is cheap and bad - I&#x27;d compare it to the fragrance of an Old Spice body wash. The first time I used it besides being annoyed by the smell, I felt it actually DID dry my skin out. Certainly more than the old formula but also probably more than any face wash I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it again and that night I basically sneezed all night. I thought perhaps sneezing all night was related to using it but figured it just was a coincidence. About a week later I tried it one last time and this time I sneezed all night again and basically got no sleep. This isn&#x27;t something that happens to me a lot - the last time I stayed up all night sneezing was probably a year ago when I stayed in a house with lots of cats. So i feel about 99% sure that the heavy perfumes are causing an allergic reaction for me. Obviously everyone is different but I think one of the things many people are sensitive to is perfumes so it makes no sense that this product has so many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a section on the back of the bottle titled &amp;#34;what you get&amp;#34; and this version and the old one are basically the same except the old has an additional bullet point saying &amp;#34;formula is soap, fragrance, dye and alcohol free to minimize the risk of skin irritation.&amp;#34; The new bottle does notmake that claim because they clearly have lots of soap, fragrance, dye and alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just very frustrating that they discontinued a product that was so helpful and came up with a new one that is the exact opposite with the same branding as before. Why not sure keep a formula that is actually helpful for people with sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> My significant other uses this. He says it&#x27;s a good cleaner that leaves his face refreshed. Has not caused any skin irritation. He also uses Nivea shaving gel with this face wash for shaving.</li>
            <li> While I liked it at first what I didn&#x27;t like was that it made the shower/bath floor super slippery.  Not good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight and dry like the regular version does.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and moisturized but still get pimples even using it as a daily wash.</li>
            <li> I had some reservations about this face wash after my first use. It&#x27;s a little more watery than what I&#x27;m used to, but that can be rectified by using less of it. The smell is good, which helps if you care about your face smelling very aromatically after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does a good job as a face wash. I noticed that my skin felt consistently good after a week of using this. I hadn&#x27;t noted problems before, but I have enjoyed using the face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash may not be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea since it is a bit watery, but it is a quality product that smells great and does a good job.</li>
            <li> I seem to have just about every skin condition known to humanity.  Dry, flaky, red, inflamed.  My dermatologist has me on a bunch of stuff.  Anyway, because of all these conditions, I can&#x27;t use normal soap.  I become a real wreck.  Even shaving is a bit of a chore.  And many products, even so-called &amp;#34;allergy free&amp;#34; ones that contain any sort of fragrence, trigger a reaction.  So I feel decently qualified to comment about sensitive skin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nivea for men sensitive face wash certainly doesn&#x27;t trigger any sort of reaction (irritation or redness) from my skin, and better yet, it appears to help the moisturizers and medicines I must apply work better.  It has a nice creamy texture, applies easily, and I suspect it opens the pores and allows them to absorb other products better.  If you like foamy face washes this product isn&#x27;t for you - it&#x27;s very much a cream, and as a result it requires a bit more effort to remove after washing, but since using it I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in skin flair ups and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, this is a good product that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  If you have issues with soap, allergies, dryness or redness, this might be a decent face wash to consider.</li>
            <li> I thought the smell was over powering, too strong. also, since it&#x27;s Glycerin based it&#x27;s too greasy, I have to wash my hands to get it off. I also don&#x27;t think it cleanses that well, leaves my face feeling greasy. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this once (sometimes twice) a day to leave my face feeling refreshed and clean.  The scent is pleasant and not overpowering.  Just a few drops mixed with warm water is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I rub it onto my face for about 30 seconds, then rinse.  It cleans without drying the skin -- actually, it seems to add a little moisture (a good thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Though this cleanser touts itself as &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;for sensitive skin,&amp;#34; it has a tendency to irritate my eyes and nose slightly. It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but there are better cleansers out there. Those with truly sensitive skin should try Cetaphil&#x27;s classic, simple cleanser instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I use this to wash my face daily. Does have a good, clean feel. However, i still end up using pore strips and finding clogged dirt, meaning this doesn&#x27;t clean as deep as i&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: i don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin, so i can&#x27;t really relate to that. I&#x27;d personally would benefit more from a facial scrub.</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive, and this is my favorite cleansing product. That is saying a lot because I have tried them all. (My face doesn&#x27;t react well to most soaps.) I really like the light scent. I wish the tube was larger but it&#x27;s not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a number of years.  Earlier, it was fragrance-free, and I thought it was great.  Over the past few years, it became harder and harder to find the fragrance-free version, and I&#x27;ve since been using the scented version.  It&#x27;s okay, but not as great as the fragrance-free formula.</li>
            <li> This is a product designed for sensitive skin with no fragrance to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work for what it&#x27;s designed for,at least from my 100% unscientific testing in the shower. It didn&#x27;t do any better, or worse, than the Dove face wash I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where it separates itself though is the rather strong lingering scent/fragrance after use. It&#x27;s not wholly unpleasant, but it&#x27;s not a scent I&#x27;d normally pick for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are looking for something with a scent to it this may be up your alley, but if you&#x27;re looking for something with no scent steer clear of this.</li>
            <li> Both my older son and I tried this product. It doesn&#x27;t burn, actually felt somewhat soothing to the face and didn&#x27;t irritate either one of us and my son has very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware there is a slight scent to the face wash and for those with extra sensitive skin that might be an issue.</li>
            <li> this really works but,  need to use regularly - it removes all dust particles while washing with and you can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I love the Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm and was hoping this had a similar scent. It does clean well but as I shave DE style after my shower was hoping for a littlew more &amp;#34;pick me up&amp;#34;.  May have to try the &amp;#34;Energizing&amp;#34; style of this instead.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for many years now. Nivea used to have an older line and this new line looks and works just the same. I love how amazon now finally sells them individually. I used to have to buy them in pack of 6 or 12, I didn&#x27;t care as its something that I&#x27;ll end up using over a couple of months anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of sensitive face washes from Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear, to Dove. All ended up drying my skin and always leaned towards heavy fragrances. I&#x27;m a guy, and as long as it doesn&#x27;t smell bad I can careless about the fragrance.  Also a lot of the normal face washes ends up clogging my pores which defeats the purpose of a face wash. So definitely loving this facewash. I use it 2-3 times a day depending on the weather and whether or not I hit the gym.</li>
            <li> After washing my face with this product my skin felt super clean and I felt really refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not in any way greasy and after using the product your skin feels very smooth after the first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This winter has been one of the strangest that I have ever experienced; its up and down temperatures have been detrimental to my sinuses and complexion.  For example, on Sunday, March 2, 2014, the temperatures soared into the seventies; it felt like a balmy spring day.  On Tuesday, March 3, 2014, I was late to work because of snow and ice on the roads.  Consequently, I have to be careful with my facial cleanser.  I must use one that will gently clean my face without drying it out and making it feel like a leather mask or sandpaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash can be used three times a day without drying out my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol that dries.  There are no artificial colors and dyes.  Its smell is very light and pleasant; I barely notice it.  The transparent gel is easy to squeeze from the tube.  Only a small dab is required to clean my face, neck and shoulders.  Because my skin is acne prone, I religiously use the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System ([[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]]), which exfoliates my skin.  Instead of using the Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser [[[ASIN:B00AY1FX2K Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser 6 OZ (2 PACK)]]] that came with the system, I use a variety of inexpensive facial washes, usually the ones for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash is great for using with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.  I&#x27;ve used it for nearly two weeks and my face always feels soft, dry, and clean, not rough, oily and dirty.  The face wash hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin, leaving it red, itchy or broken out with a rash.  It is a simple, basic, no nonsense face wash that cleanses my skin.  Also, Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash doesn&#x27;t have any advertisement gimmicks.  It doesn&#x27;t have a masculine name or promise me that I will become sexually irresistible to the opposite sex.  However, I&#x27;ve noticed that ever since I started exfoliating my skin, my face is cleaner, healthier and more vibrant and females of all ages appear to appreciate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash is highly recommended for men who want to use an affordable, masculine, no nonsense facial cleanser to gently exfoliate and clean their sensitive skin.  It is perfect for using during the winter months when facial skin becomes easily dehydrated because of outdoor cold and wind and indoor heat.  I feel comfortable that I can use this product for long periods of time without worrying about allergic reactions.  Even though the Nivea Men Sensitive Face Wash is designed for men, I feel that women can also enjoy its benefits.  My girlfriend, Tammy, and I share beauty products.  She and I both have sensitive facial skin and have used each other&#x27;s facial cleansers.  If it works, it works; I don&#x27;t care what it is named or for whom it is intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B.

            <li> This was a huge hit !! My teenage son used this product and just bought another this week because he said he worked well to keep the acne away. He is a hockey player who needs a good face wash product after wearing an helmet everyday and sweating. When your teenage goes to store to buy a product all on his own -- I would say this product works.</li>
            <li> cleans your face without drying and without a girly scent and it does not cost a whole lot, either. It does not take much to get the job done - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is clear and only lightly scented. It lathers easily and quickly washes away.  I used about a dime sized dollop of face wash on my palm, rubbed into a lather and applied to my face. Three splashes and it was completely washed clean. No scrubbing required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chamomile, witch hazel, and vitamin E blend have a refreshing quality.  I was very happy with how this product felt.  I also tend to be prone to breaking out, and I can report that I had no problems with this product. All-in-all I am pleased!</li>
            <li> Bought this for husband as it&#x27;s not easy to find skin care for sensitive skin at a good price.  He likes this and says it does the job.</li>
            <li> My face gets very dry from washing, and this facewash is very good in keeping it from getting too dry. The lack of alcohols or drying solutions allows my face to stay hydrated while still cleaning off oils and dirt from my face.</li>
            <li> The face wash works very well on my skin. I tend to have sensitive skin and can break out easily if using cleaners that are too strong. It lathers well and is gentle on my skin and leaves it feeling refreshed after. It does have a male scent but it smells good. My normal face wash is Cetaphil and that has generally worked well. In fact, I feel like the Nivea makes my skin feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is a good face wash that gets you clean without the tightness or drying of some cleansers. I liked using it, and my wife ended up stealing the tube from me :-) However, it is also nothing too special -- it cleans about as well as a bar of quality soap, and it&#x27;s more expensive. The scent is clean and not overpowering, and I felt clean and ready for the day after using it.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT fragrance-free any more. As of the date I am posting this comment, the product listing still says this stuff is fragrance-free. That is NOT TRUE. Unfortunately, Nivea made the peculiar decision to replace its fine, unscented Men&#x27;s Sensitive Face Wash with this heavily scented version that is alcohol-free. Why on Earth would they think men with sensitive skin would want to use a product with an unnecessary additive, namely an added fragrance? The smell of that fragrance is VERY strong, which does not even make sense given that it is a face wash product you are going to rinse off.</li>
            <li> Great product makes me feel better</li>
            <li> Very thick and greasy feeling...  Easy to squeeze too much out.  I guess it cleans okay...</li>
            <li> Had had problems with soap products drying my face out in the past.  This stuff works great.  I leave it in the shower.  Soap up my hair, wash my face, and then rinse it all off.  Helped quite a bit with the dryness, and keeping my face clean and sfot for the wife.</li>
            <li> Has been great for helping with shaving problems</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try. It has a stinky, perfumey scent, sort of like baby powder mixed with perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That might raise the question, is this what a &amp;#34;mens&amp;#34; product should smell like? I would think not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse, once you use it, the scent lingers for a while. I made the mistake of using this before going to bed and it kept me awake for some time. I even got up and rinsed my face again, used a tea tree oil paid. The scent still lingered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wash doesn&#x27;t seem to lather all that much, which would probably lead people to use more of the product and have to rebuy it more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to use it again and will certainly not buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be great for at least one of these manufacturers to make a men&#x27;s product that is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I have used this all week to wash my face and I feel that it&#x27;s pretty drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin as it is, so it wouldn&#x27;t be ideal for me. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is faint, which is nice and it does feel invigorating, but I don&#x27;t like the dryness. A litle extra hydration would have made it more beneficial to my skin type.</li>
            <li> Many men receive razor burns, blemishes and bumps after shaving; others want to have a clean shave and no reactions afterwards from the effects of shaving.  Nivea has created this product for Men with Sensitive skin, and a face wash to use before or after shaving. This is a gift for the men in my home, who love Nivea for Men Sensitive Face Wash and have been using this product for years.  They have stated that it works for them; they do not have a sensitive reaction to shaving once they have used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to others, as well as Amazon Customers who have the need to use this product for their shaving needs.  It has been praised by the many users I know that use this product.  The product was packed securely/neatly and arrived in a timely basis.</li>
            <li> This is an unassuming face wash. It has a light smell, if smells had colors, it kinda smells like the color of the packaging. It is not a classic Nivea cream smell, but it&#x27;s somewhere in that neighborhood. (keep in mind reaction to smell varies from person to person).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not as foamy as some others. Perhaps because of that, I prefer it on a beardless face. With a few days of beard, it feels like it is disappearing into the beard. Perhaps because it&#x27;s not as foamy. It is see-through, almost colorless, with a small number of small bubbles. A fairly small amount is good enough for a beardless wash, so it may last longer than the 5oz suggests, especially compared to some of the more creamy/liquid ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not the best ever, this is one I would not mind using regularly if the price is right.</li>
            <li> This Nivea face wash is good: it&#x27;s intended for sensitive faces, which seems to be the case, goes on easily and washes off fine. It&#x27;s a little too much scented for an &#x27;unscented&#x27; product, so would not recommend if you&#x27;re going for unscented; it could be milder, and less strong scent to gain that name: regardless, it did it&#x27;s job well, is great for sensitive skin, and was just a nice face wash, so would recommend.</li>
            <li> I used to look at all of these customized products and scoff, what&#x27;s wrong with soap?  But I decided to try this product after my wife commented that my skin was dry and no longer smooth to touch.  This product changed that.  In fact the first time I tried it, my wife cam into the bathroom and noticed a difference.  That alone is good enough for a 5 star rating, but this product takes a little getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the face wash is thick, I mean really thick and heavy.  This is a bit disconcerting at first, but once applied you can feel the difference as your skin is energized -- that is the only way I can describe it.  The scent is clean and attractive and washing the product off leaves your skin refreshed in a way that make you want to smile and face the day.  it also caused my wife to come over and caress my cheek, not a bad payoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using the face wash mostly in the shower for my morning shave.  i used to use soap for that and now I am a Nivea man.</li>
            <li> I used to use Clearasil face wash in the shower every day. For some reason, it gave me a lot of acne on my shoulders and after awhile, my face felt all oily and dirty. Wanting to try something new, I stumbled upon this while searching for a new face wash. And since I&#x27;ve switched to traditional wetshaving, I wanted something that would help soften up my beard as well. Not only is it a good pre shave wash, but it&#x27;s great for everyday use. My shoulders have cleared up, and my face feels like a million dollars everyday since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> I loved this product for its smooth texture and aroma. The scent is manly and not too intense. And most importantly, it leaves your face fully refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> Works good. Not harsh on my face at all</li>
            <li> when I first got this product I knew it was brand new , because  when you buy a product that as to do with your skin it has to be new and unused. second I love the product it makes my skin clean and healthy not oily and not dry this product it excellent for men skin.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of NIVEA. Their products never disappoint me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my husband this past winter. He says &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what it is but it feels nice&amp;#34;. That is good enough. I think it helps moisturize his skin and does not dry it out like bar soap does, which is what he used before.</li>
            <li> This product has a very nice scent.  I have never washed my face with soap before, so this is a new experience.  I generally take a shower and then shave with shaving cream and then rinse with warm wash cloth.  Anyway, the gel does not lather in your hands the way shampoo does in your hair, so you have to lather up the gel using a soft sponge or wash cloth.  This procedure also works better for avoiding the eyes.  I do not know for sure that the Vitamine E, Chamomile and Witch hazel extracts will be medicinally beneficial, however I hope so.  Seems like my face is smoother though this is subjective.</li>
            <li> This works well and of course is gentle for sensitive skin - found it to be better than comparable one from Dove Men care which was &amp;#34;Messy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Nivea...if you are listening, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE go back to the original formula for this face wash.  I can&#x27;t understand why companies feel the need to always try to mess with a successful product.  The original formula of this face wash was perfect, it was gentle, dye free and alcohol free.  It didnt have this awful scent that this one has.  This new forumla is nothing like the old one and because of that, I will never purchase this again.  Go back to original formula NIVEA!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible product don&#x27;t buy this one. It dries your skin terribly!! And that fragrance is an awful scent, which makes the advertised fragrance free very untrue.</li>
            <li> I tried face wash from all companies and finally settled on this product. My favorite.. Nivea Men Face wash !</li>
            <li> This NIvea face wash for men simply didn&#x27;t gel for me. It offered an adequate cleansing which lasted 2-3 hours or so even if the scent lingered. It did well with shaving and stood out on that front. Having said that it was disappointing when it came to moisturizing. With no alcohol in it, I assumed the face wash would do a better job on that front but my skin dried up at the same pace as it usually does.  While this product did an adequate job, I honestly had higher hopes for it.Other reviewers have given it higher marks so I won&#x27;t close the door on recommending it. Having said that, it does seem to work better for some people than others.</li>
            <li> I like this face wash.  The scent is pleasant and not strong.  The skin on my face feels smooth after I use the wash.  I did not see any dry skin like I do when I use regular bath soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hardly an expert on face washes, but I do have oily skin and have used a variety of products. This one goes on smoothly (unlike some of the other pasty facial cleansers I&#x27;ve used) and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry, like it has sucked all of the oils out of it. It also seems to last a while. I use it almost every morning in the shower and this 5 oz container has lasted for more than month, even with me occasionally squeezing out far more than I need.</li>
            <li> Nivea Men - Sensitive - Face Wash [2014-03-07 509]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is the first NIVEA grooming product I have ever used and to be completely honest this was a sample provided to me by Amazon to evaluate - nonetheless I will attempt to be objective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Without going into specifics I have facial skin that takes a beating during the cold dry New England winters - particularly if I&#x27;m outdoors after shaving. The product claims on the package to clean without drying out the skin and softens the beard for a closer shave. I used the item as directed prior to shaving and I must admit the product met my expectations. I had a close shave and my skin was not dried out. I did purchase another NIVEA product after my evaluation: NIVEA Post Shave Balm for sensitive skin which complements the Face Wash product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend this product if you are in the market for a modestly price skin/shaving product. The product has a very mild fragrance I found acceptable. Apparently this is the signature NIVEA fragrance so if you don&#x27;t like any aroma you may want to take that into consideration. Oh yes, the Face Wash contains Witch Hazel extract and as we New Englanders all know Witch Hazel is a marvelous cure-all for what ails you - so another reason to recommend the item!</li>
            <li> This is a nice soap for guys with sensitive skin like me.  However, I can&#x27;t justify paying $1.20 per ounce for it when I can get either Dove Sensitive Skin body wash or bar soap for around $.39 per ounce.  There is just no difference to justify the extra cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is pleasant and has no particular odor.  It is easy to apply and rinses off with no residue.  If it was priced more realistically I might use it over the long-term.  As it is, i can find no difference that would make me pay extra for it.</li>
            <li> I should state that I&#x27;m an Amazon Vine Reviewer, and this isn&#x27;t a product I&#x27;d ever buy on my own. However, I decided to try it and was very surprised by the quality of the product. I typically shave with soap while in the shower, and I&#x27;ve always suffered from some dry skin issues in the winter, and I never really cared enough to do anything about it. This product is the perfect solution. Once I&#x27;m done shaving, I use this wash and I&#x27;ve never had any dry issues since. I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone who suffers from dry or sensitive skin. It may not solve all your issues, but I can&#x27;t imagine that it would help to a large degree. I highly recommend this, and I&#x27;ll probably purchase it again when my free sample runs out.</li>
            <li> Works well, pleasant and fresh, unobtrusive scent. Best feature is that it cleans without leaving an oily feel as some facial cleansers do. Nivea always creates good products at a reasonable cost, and packaging is well designed.</li>
            <li> Nivea had a terrific, odorless facial cleanser that I used for 4 or 5 years. Then it because hard to find in the stores, so I started purchasing it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last order was actually delivered from Germany (!!) and took forever so I was glad to see this back. The smell is revolting—old man and camphor after a jog through an oil refinery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure the formula is all that good, either. My skin feels gross after just a few hours. Why do these companies mess with what&#x27;s working?</li>
            <li> Stuff made me break out in a rash.</li>
            <li> I really love scent smell of this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Nice on skin. Your morning will be more extra fresh with this product. I want this kind of smell perfume if anyone knows?</li>
            <li> The high glycerin content leaves my face feeling a bit stripped after I wash it off.  I like that it contains witch hazel, but could do without all the glycerin.  I&#x27;m thinking once I finish this first tube, I&#x27;ll go back to Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean Cream Cleanser.  Wish that name was shorter.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product I wash my sensitive face with. Been using it for years. It&#x27;s not easy to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Bought from my preteen son who is developing acne problems. He finds that it is effective, but doesn&#x27;t cause sensitive skin issues like redness or more breakouts! I&#x27;m glad to find something that works for him!</li>
            <li> good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very nice face wash if you have sensitive skin. Combine this with Nivea Men&#x27;s sensitive body wash to get the full experience. I really like the feeling this gives and I am happy that it does not have any of those little plastic beads mixed in that are for &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34;. I will continue to buy this product and amazon has it on sale from time to time at a great price.</li>
            <li> As a man with sensitive skin, every face wash I&#x27;ve ever used seems to leave me with a red, itchy, dry face on day #3 of use. So needless to say I was blown away when I started using this particular face wash from Nivea and didn&#x27;t experience any of the aforementioned symptoms. As some have mentioned, it has a high level of glycerin which may be weird for some people as the glycerin has a very slimy / greasy feeling on your face but it washes away easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have commented on the fragrance being overpowering. While it&#x27;s marketed as &#x27;fragrance-free&#x27;, it does have a gentle soapy smell which I rather enjoy. Honestly the scent is so subtle that compared to my body wash, shampoo, etc, I barely notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash will give your face a clean and refreshed feeling without excessively drying out your face. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as effective at removing skin oils as some other products, but those products cause me severe reactions anyway so I&#x27;ll take what I can get with a product for sensitive skin.</li>
