    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am in love with this product! The smell is so calming. It smells exactly like a bouquet of flowers, and it also makes my face unbelievably soft in the morning. I do wish for the price that is asked that they would make it into a larger size. It was used up very quickly. Being my first time trying diva stuff&#x27;s products, I can happily say that I will be ordering from them again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about 3/4 of a bottle of this. It has a nice scent, but doesn&#x27;t do much else for my skin. It doesn&#x27;t really moisturize, and I don&#x27;t feel my skin is any calmer, more soothed, softer, brighter, anything really. I have combination skin (more on the oily side, not generally overly dry) with moderate adult acne breakouts. In fact, this toner may possibly be causing some breakouts. I read the ingredient list and saw that Vitamin E is an ingredient. Vitamin E is known to be mildly to moderately comedogenic. So I&#x27;m not sure that marketing this product as recommended for acne is really the way for Diva Stuff to go. I&#x27;ve been having cystic acne breakouts in unusual places. I am not certain that this product is the cause, and yes everyone&#x27;s skin is different as the company will probably post under this review. However I do want to point out that if you are prone to acne, you may want to spot test or be careful with this product, even though it is partially marketed toward acne.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this diva stuff product. I have tried so many but will stick with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tonic along with the hibiscus lift face cream everynight and sometimes before makeup during the day. My previous moisturizer day and night was neutrogena spf15 wrinkle reduction.  I loved that and still do. Sometimes I use that in the day and the hibiscus at night. Regardless,  my complextion at 37 looks its best it has ever did now then before I started the hibiscus lift. I have no idea how this genius concocted these excellent products but they are definitely working. I never had a problem with acne but it still made my skin bright, flawless and very soft and smooth.  I recommend these 2 products to anyone who can manage to be consistent.  The results are worth it. Im very happy with the products I have tried so far and the customer service is fantastic as well.</li>
            <li> this product is the consistency of water...</li>
            <li> I bought this on another website and this product is awesome!  This a total dirt magnet! I wash my face at night and then apply this with a cotton ball. The cotton ball is always dirty afterwards which is kind of gross since I just washed my face lol but this is getting my face super clean! You can feel it tighten your skin a bit and I usually apply a Diva stuff lotion after applying this at night. Its helped with my complextion as well.</li>
            <li> I love this face tonic! It smells so nice and gives your face a little tingle when you apply it. I&#x27;ve been putting it on at night before I use the hibiscus lift lotion and my skin looks amazing in the morning! Even my husband noticed (you don&#x27;t know him, but trust me....the fact that he notices anything is a huge deal) he asked me how I managed to look so pretty first thing in the morning. It&#x27;s this stuff! Everything I&#x27;ve ever tried from Diva Stuff has far exceeded my expectations; I can&#x27;t recommend this product or this company enough.</li>
            <li> First of all, the smell is terrific! I love going to bed smelling like flowers. Second, it&#x27;s really effective. I&#x27;ve been using it for only a couple of days and I already see results. My face is smoother and pores are tighter in the morning. Also, I had a little bit of acne on my chin that dried up really fast. I know that my skin will only get better over time using this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My acne is nearly gone after what one night!</li>
            <li> On the container does not labeled the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Has a very strong disturbing smell for me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product it is awesome</li>
            <li> Great stuff, cleared up my acne. My complexion is smooth and has a natural glow,</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toner. It smells amazing and you can feel it tightening.&lt;br /&gt;I have rosacea and this has really helped reduce the appearance of bumps and redness. This is an essential to your beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an old product or what but it was great the first week and then the toner started to look kinda muddy and the smell changed.  I ended up dumping it out because I didn&#x27;t like putting toner on my face that smelled like mold.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this Hibiscus Lift the scent is so light and fresh and this leaves my face feeling firm and smooth in the morning i use this at night but sometimes in the morning also.My face feels so clean after using this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!  It does exactly what it states....lifts and firms.  After using it I can feel the firming affect and, not only that, but the scent is nice as well.  I will definitely purchase more of this!</li>
            <li> I found it works for me during the day and not at night... if i use it at night my face would be oily in the morning, but during the day its fine. I noticed its clearing up blackheads from the corner of my nose too. Nice.</li>
            <li> Now part of my daily skin care-Hibiscus Lift toner! I wasn&#x27;t in the habit of using a toner before but I am now. This is a fantastic toner with a beautiful smell. My skin feels absolutely clean when I use it and ready for my night time moisturizer. I would love it if it came in a larger quantity, I am using it up quickly!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. Smells pretty too.</li>
            <li> Great product, makes the skin feel so clean and good.  Smells great.</li>
            <li> I love Diva products, unfortunately this broke me out in a rash.</li>
