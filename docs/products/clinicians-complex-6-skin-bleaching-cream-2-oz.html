    <ol>
            <li>She says works wonderfully to fade age spots.</li>
            <li>A great product for the money.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell that great.</li>
            <li>it was a great prodoct</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve found it to be non-damaging yet effective at fading blemishes)  </li>
            <li>Nice product, I love it.</li>
            <li>, if you buy this, you better buy a very strong sunblock... think</li>
            <li>one more thing:</li>
            <li>Love rbis buy it all the time it works</li>
            <li>it is the most happiest  beauty</li>
            <li>Love the product seems to be working quickly</li>
            <li>I think this cream works even faster for those with light skintones.</li>
            <li>Not only is this cream great for bleachin treatments but it also improves the texture of skin in a way i did not expect.</li>
            <li>i m excited.</li>
            <li>Now the area has lightened enough that I am more comfortable going without.  </li>
            <li>If you apply make-up right away, it will look hideous.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on its skin lightening efficacy, but I will edit this comment if it doesn&#x27;t work or if it works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>The cream works very well with brown marks.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product twice a day for many weeks now, and see absolutely no improvement in age spots on my face and hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve NEVER had any face product work this fast.  </li>
            <li>Clinicians Complex has worked the best to lighten the large dark area on my neck and the age spots on the backs of my hands.</li>
            <li>Although my skin is not completely back to it&#x27;s original color, I have seen a noticable difference.  </li>
            <li>While not as greasy as many other skin bleach products, this cream does feel like one of its ingredients might be butter.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>you get steady</li>
            <li>Sunspots, freckles, age spots - used Obagi Clear for 3-4 years until I could no longer get it online.  </li>
            <li>So far, no results.  </li>
            <li>Another tip, it works much faster when skin is exfoliated prior to usage.</li>
            <li>This jar is huge and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Additional ingredients that Clear did not provide can only be beneficial.  </li>
            <li>I know this will sound crazy, but I noticed a difference the first time I used this.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> How long does it take to lessen the color of sun spots?  </li>
            <li> You might LOOK like a burn victim if you use it and then go in the sun, but it doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable at all.&lt;br /&gt;It also absorbs very quickly compared to other hydroquinone-based oily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and the dark spots are definitely fading.  </li>
            <li> so your face should be patted dry after washing and left slightly damp.</li>
            <li> are fading already &amp; shipping was as expected on time</li>
            <li> Spent $68 at my dermotologists because she \\&quot;highly\\&quot; recommended this product.  </li>
            <li> Working extremely well, my doctor recommended it and it works.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several other skin lighteners over the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone that have dark spots they want to disappear.  </li>
            <li> been using it for a week, my face is definately smoother but my dark spots are still there.</li>
            <li> Did not fade any of my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Previously I used makeup to cover my neck.  </li>
            <li> My skin has improved a little bit.</li>
            <li> No significant change noted after 1 months use.</li>
            <li> After one jar; maybe a very slight reduction in color.</li>
            <li> Its a little hard to spread on a dry face as its very thick and concentrated.</li>
            <li> The downaide: it is thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick in hard to rub in, but i still used it as directions required.</li>
            <li> This product is no good.</li>
            <li> The pigment spots lighten up or disappeared without drying or irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get confused about 6%.</li>
            <li> I wish they will put this on line description that people will not get confused.</li>
            <li> Its expensive</li>
            <li> I had terrible dark spots on my face (frican complexion) but they have gradually lightened.</li>
            <li> It was too expensive to not have worked :(</li>
            <li> Wanted this to lighten brown spots:(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Been using twice a day and no lightening observed. Face appears smoother and skin is glowing. Wanted this to lighten brown spots:(</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a couple of months.  So far, no results.  How long does it take to lessen the color of sun spots?  I use the product twice a day and try to stay out of the sun.  I carry and umbrella when I walk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time now, and it works well so (I&#x27;ve found it to be non-damaging yet effective at fading blemishes)  I appreciate it whenever I can find it at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> So my Mom asked me to buy this for her as she is a devoted fan and her doctor is no longer stocking in his office. She says works wonderfully to fade age spots.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample and it did wonders for the spots on my face so I ordered the 2 oz. jar. If you have spots don&#x27;t hesitate. This product is your answer.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of using the cream I started noticing the obvious difference in my skin. The pigment spots lighten up or disappeared without drying or irritating the skin. Ordered it third time.</li>
            <li> Working extremely well, my doctor recommended it and it works.  Recommend to anyone that have dark spots they want to disappear.  Thank yous.</li>
            <li> Sunspots, freckles, age spots - used Obagi Clear for 3-4 years until I could no longer get it online.  The FDA now requires an Rx for 4% hydroquinone, unless you get it from your dermatologist or plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.  Tried this with only 2% hydroquinone and am convinced it works just as well and have noticed a fading in just two weeks of use.  Additional ingredients that Clear did not provide can only be beneficial.  I also use it on the backs of my hands - which is always an age &amp;#34;give away&amp;#34;!  A great product for the money.</li>
            <li> Love the product seems to be working quickly I have been using for two weeksspots are fading already &amp; shipping was as expected on time</li>
            <li> This product is no good. After using this for two months I haven&#x27;t seen any difference. I definitely won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of use, there is no difference in my skin ton; in fact, some parts are darker. I will ask for a refund.</li>
            <li> The cream works very well with brown marks.  They are definitely lighter and I will continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> I started using this cream on October 21st, 2011 and it has been app. 17 days of usage. I had terrible dark spots on my face (frican complexion) but they have gradually lightened. I began to see a difference after one week of use. I think this cream works even faster for those with light skintones. Its expensive but I was desparate. Its a little hard to spread on a dry face as its very thick and concentrated. So please spread it on damp skin. Another tip, it works much faster when skin is exfoliated prior to usage.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other skin lighteners over the past couple of years.  Clinicians Complex has worked the best to lighten the large dark area on my neck and the age spots on the backs of my hands. Improvement has taken some time - this is my third purchase.  Although my skin is not completely back to it&#x27;s original color, I have seen a noticable difference.  Previously I used makeup to cover my neck.  Now the area has lightened enough that I am more comfortable going without.  I would recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> been using it for a week, my face is definately smoother but my dark spots are still there. o yeah one more thing: first 2 nights of using this product i started to peel really bad, i dont really know if its normal but i am giving it another week to see changes. i will be bacck after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok so now its been a week. i can definately see results now. my face is getting lighter and smoother. i m excited. giving it another week again</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day for many weeks now, and see absolutely no improvement in age spots on my face and hand. Cheap drugstore products that I purchased in the past did an incomplete job of lightening age spots, but they outperformed Clinician&#x27;s Complex. Save your money for something that works.</li>
            <li> Not only is this cream great for bleachin treatments but it also improves the texture of skin in a way i did not expect. The downaide: it is thick so your face should be patted dry after washing and left slightly damp. Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell that great.</li>
            <li> I am still using this cream. My skin has improved a little bit. I cannot give a definite answer yet.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I know this will sound crazy, but I noticed a difference the first time I used this.  I&#x27;ve NEVER had any face product work this fast.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and the dark spots are definitely fading.  This jar is huge and a little goes a long way.  I suspect I will have it long after the current spots are a memory.</li>
            <li> I like it, it works for me. Don&#x27;t get confused about 6%. This is a combination of 3 different acids. I wish they will put this on line description that people will not get confused.</li>
            <li> Love rbis buy it all the time it works and I recommend you buy this product.make you get steady so you don&#x27;t run out</li>
            <li> Spent $68 at my dermotologists because she \\&quot;highly\\&quot; recommended this product.  After one jar; maybe a very slight reduction in color. Going for the cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> it is the most happiest  beauty</li>
            <li> While not as greasy as many other skin bleach products, this cream does feel like one of its ingredients might be butter.&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you buy this, you better buy a very strong sunblock... think SPF 80+&lt;br /&gt;One time i walked out in the sun after using this cream. It was only a couple minutes but when I looked in the mirror, my skin looked as if I had taken an acid bath.&lt;br /&gt;I should probably mention, however, that it never itches or burns. You might LOOK like a burn victim if you use it and then go in the sun, but it doesn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable at all.&lt;br /&gt;It also absorbs very quickly compared to other hydroquinone-based oily creams.&lt;br /&gt;DO wait a couple minutes before applying anything else on. If you apply make-up right away, it will look hideous.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on its skin lightening efficacy, but I will edit this comment if it doesn&#x27;t work or if it works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> it was a great prodoct</li>
            <li> Hi, the clinician&#x27;s did not back up it&#x27;s claims. It&#x27;s very thick in hard to rub in, but i still used it as directions required. Did not fade any of my dark spots. It was too expensive to not have worked :(</li>
            <li> Nice product, I love it.</li>
            <li> Verdict is still out. No significant change noted after 1 months use.</li>
    </ol>
