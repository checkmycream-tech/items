            <li>so you want to make sure that the surfaces mesh perfectly.</li>
            <li>Awesome quick repair!  </li>
            <li>After this the repaired denture is apparently good to go.</li>
            <li>After this the repaired denture is apparently good to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for emergency repairs.</li>
            <li>It is good for three repairs.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this product to be as good as advertised....</li>
            <li>if you take you time....it is as good as any dental lab can do....without being ripped off by these con artists....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good deal......</li>
            <li>My opinion is its not as good as it use to b this denture repair stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll give the fifth star if this repair lasts another month, but I think the product is good for the tooth</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the ease of repair.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!!  </li>
            <li>and if i need some more i will buy it  its a good product.</li>
            <li>but it was spreadable and went on nicely covering the crack..</li>
            <li>After soaking in warm water, I used the supplied sandpaper to remove the excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading some of the not so nice reviews, i&#x27;m wondering if you read the instruction frist.</li>
            <li>goodluck with any kind of expectation you have</li>
            <li>and you will get a very strong adhesion.</li>
            <li>So I repaired it again and relined it so far real good.</li>
            <li>I cleaned it, let it soak for the precise amount of time and everything seemed absolutely wonderful, until the first time I ate.</li>
            <li>This product worked great for me even my dentist was surprised how good it works and looks.</li>
            <li>and I must say that I was very impressed with how easy it was to successfully perform the needed repair and have the aforementioned old timer once again happily eating his fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make very sure that you have the surfaces clean, there would have been a form of glue holding the tooth into the plate</li>
            <li>You can add more denture repair liquid one drop at a time,</li>
            <li>Best to reinforce repair with 2nd layer.</li>
            <li>they charge more for some reason.</li>
            <li>I thought the product would have given me more than one use.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>but it looks ok,  </li>
            <li>They can do a much better job.</li>
            <li>It is OK.</li>
            <li>I was able too fix the plate..  </li>
            <li>I used this and was able to do like an auto body type repair using this repair kit.</li>
            <li>If it screws them up even more, then I&#x27;ll just get lectured a bit more.  </li>
            <li>Here is is a month later, and the repair is still working perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Hope we never have to use it but better to be prepared.</li>
            <li>After a bit of dremeling to get it smooth, it has been a saviour for me!</li>
            <li>Not to sure</li>
            <li>OK What else can I say.  </li>
            <li>so I thought the doc kit would be better.  </li>
            <li>It would have been a much better job</li>
            <li>Unless you are an experienced dental worker who wants to save a trip to the dentist, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>In fact when I lost one of my top front teeth from my denture</li>
            <li>I bought the repair kit, and followed the instructions carefully, my top incisor has been eating everything for two weeks now and is still in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were very straightforward.  </li>
            <li>The price was good and delivery fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the Company, the chemical is good...</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do a great job, and noticed that there was a tiny gap in the repair, so I applied more paste to the gap.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use...</li>
            <li>Its been five years, and the repair is still going strong</li>
            <li>Useful tool for my mom to have on hand to fix her dentures; however, this product and the companion re-liner kit, both have very strong, foul, lingering odor/taste, which does interfere with one&#x27;s enjoyment of eating or drinking.</li>
            <li>It may have worked just fine if I had.</li>
            <li>All in all the package was just fine and the delivery was followed as instructed.</li>
            <li>Save your money super glue works better and is cheaper, this product did not work at all  </li>
            <li>I read many complaints here about how quickly the paste sets</li>
            <li>) Using the included plastic spatula mix the powder and liquid thoroughly until a smooth creamy consistency like syrup is achieved.</li>
            <li>D.O.C. Denture Repair Kit is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>so happy my bottoms are back in.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t give a great review because this didn&#x27;t seem to work properly.  </li>
            <li>Just follow the directions precisely</li>
            <li>,I hope it lasts , so far so good.</li>
            <li>This item worked very well for me ...very pleased with it ....  </li>
            <li>Love it, Thank You so much</li>
            <li>Dental tech glued it back together -- forget a good alignment -- but it lasted about 4 months.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works well and this company ships quickly.  </li>
            <li>Hardened too quickly to manage well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE ON 07/03/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more than 2 months have passed, the original lower denture repair described in the above review is still going strong, no problems</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE ON 07/03/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more than 2 months have passed, the original lower denture repair described in the above review is still going strong, no problems</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will be interesting to see how long this repair lasts; I will provide an appropriate update.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will be interesting to see how long this repair lasts; I will provide an appropriate update.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very patient about it and willing to try it two more times.</li>
            <li>Place the now repaired denture into “hot water” (not boiling!)</li>
            <li>Way to go D.O.C. Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Just ordered more to repair before it breaks completely.</li>
            <li>Well worth having a spare repair kit around for emergencies.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I chose this rating to alert future purchasers this product does not meet it&#x27;s expectation.</li>
            <li>but I think maybe I didn&#x27;t get it just right.</li>
            <li>Works good so far I had to repair my lower plate that broke right in the middle into.</li>
            <li>It might get you to the dentist to fit new dentures.</li>
            <li>wow is it strong.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to work quickly, just deliberately, the glue doesn&#x27;t really set until about a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>We waited and his lower denture is now rock solid and perfectly aligned – as good if not better than new during daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We waited and his lower denture is now rock solid and perfectly aligned – as good if not better than new during daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used super glue in the past and it works good until i can get to the dentist for a repair.</li>
            <li>I even watched the utube video by a customer because it seemed very important to mix the product properly</li>
            <li>I fixed my dentures myself and ducked a huge repair bill from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>instructions were clear, all the parts were there, I followed them precisely, and the glue was the consistency of syrup</li>
            <li>you must read the instructions i made it soupy and then let set in hot tap water still eating steak and beef jerkey</li>
            <li>Be sure all pieces a aligned properly!</li>
            <li>and I have used it to repair my upper plate to give it some more life.</li>
            <li>my first meal this morning and no problem at all.</li>
            <li>Okay for short time/emergency</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait til he sees me next month :)</li>
            <li>, my recommendation is to not break the darned things in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for our emergency first aid kit, along with an emergenct dental kit.</li>
            <li>The first two applications didn&#x27;t go well</li>
            <li>the first repair did&#x27;t hold bud two days.</li>
            <li>: My top denture had a crack in it from between the two front teeth 1/2 way to the back of the denture.  </li>
            <li>i mainly got this for my mom who wears dentures and just needed a quick fix since they broke but the glue didnt</li>
            <li>I could not line it up exactly, held it in place for 30 seconds,</li>
            <li>had I not messed it up with doc first.</li>
            <li>i did a few repair with it and it work as i was waiting for the dentist thank you for the good service</li>
            <li>) Remove any of the now congealed pink substance that has oozed/escaped out of the break during pressure application with the spatula or other available tool (e.g., a toothpick is a handy item to have available for this</li>
            <li>(Ya think there might be a simple jig in the kit to help hold it fairly close to proper position?)  </li>
            <li>its very east to use and it didnt take very much to fix the dentures  </li>
            <li>Easy to remove, doesn&#x27;t last a day.  </li>
            <li>, I was really careful to ensure just the outside was glued and that it was aligned perfectly so I didn&#x27;t do any long term damage to my teeth.</li>
            <li>how many I.Q. points I&#x27;ll loose doing it.</li>
            <li>When my now elderly father accidentally dropped his lower denture on the tile floor in my kitchen splitting it completely in half (2 pieces) in such a way that none of the teeth were damaged and the break itself was clean and aligned perfectly without any missing pieces, this denture repair kit was what I turned to first in an attempt to fix his prosthetic teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Maybe with a larger denture it would work fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, only temporary until I see my dentist.</li>
            <li>It lasted for over 3 years on my original denture, but I added 3 new teeth to the denture, since I had a few more removed, and this stuff works</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>5 stars absolutely.  </li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>The tendency is to use too much</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so you have to be ready to apply it after you mix the solution</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>I recleaned the tooth and socket and regluded with a thin watery mix and the repair is great.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon you save me money, time and gas.</li>
            <li>they worked very well</li>
            <li>but it is way better than I expected....</li>
            <li>it really does work.....</li>
            <li>As I was putting the syrupy stuff on each piece it started to crumble and the whole thing was a disaster.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know it really did not do what I expected, but It may work better for others</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another 2 months have elapsed and the original lower denture repair has finally come apart once again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another 2 months have elapsed and the original lower denture repair has finally come apart once again.</li>
            <li>Not entirely a replacement for professional repair, but definitely a good product for those of us who have to make do for a while due to budget.</li>
            <li>While correctly aligning the break apply steady pressure to both sides of the break for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One tooth came out of the top plate one the left side over the pin hole in the back.  </li>
            <li>This five-star item is highly recommended for keeping some additional cash in your – and</li>
            <li>This five-star item is highly recommended for keeping some additional cash in your – and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Aside from the above, it really worked!!</li>
            <li>I had first used gorilla glue which held for about a week and when the tooth came back out , I didn&#x27;t clean the residue well enough.</li>
            <li>Its really very temporary fix till you gte it fixed by dentist...</li>
            <li>But, if you do, order this stuff and you can return them to normal operation within an hour.</li>
            <li>I used up the entire box just trying to get it right though.</li>
            <li>My denture feels like new.</li>
            <li>I called my dentist who wanted $250 plus Tax to come in urgently and get a new one.</li>
            <li>) Ensure that the damaged denture is clean and dry and that there are no missing pieces in the area of the break</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although not required, I personally recommend waiting an additional 24 hours before first use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although not required, I personally recommend waiting an additional 24 hours before first use.</li>
            <li>I have fixed broken teeth many, many times over 40 years of use and its never let me down.</li>
            <li>I was able to save the tooth and tried a third time but the tube had been leaking fumes despite tight cap closure and no leak that I could see in the tube.</li>
            <li>This time i used a little more of the liquid and mixed it</li>
            <li>Be ready to apply the mixture as soon as it is mixed.  </li>
            <li>and so far they are still together  </li>
            <li>This time it broke while eating a fairly soft pizza --Friday eve of a 3-day weekend.  </li>
            <li>i understand we still need to go to a professional</li>
            <li>have them done by a professional in the field.</li>
            <li>Overall, this appears to be a good temporary solution, but it&#x27;s by no means a permanent repair for broken dentures.minutes.</li>
            <li>Overall, this appears to be a good temporary solution, but it&#x27;s by no means a permanent repair for broken dentures.</li>
            <li>arrived ok  packing box was oversized for such a small box</li>
            <li>I was trying to be so careful when my upper partial broke in 2 pieces at near the top that rests on the roof of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be careful to clean out the denture, particularly the little overlap that is normally at the \\&quot;top\\&quot; of the tooth.</li>
            <li>The first two repairs only lasted for about 3 meals, and the last one only lasted about 2 1/2 days.</li>
            <li>In an effort to make the product work fast they have created a fast setting and drying compound that unfortunately lack the ability to be worked into a reasonable finish while applying  as it starts to set too fast and then shatters when you put it to use.</li>
            <li>If you have eaten without the tooth, which you certainly will have unless you already had the kit in hand, then use a toothpick or other small tip to clean any residue out of that overlap.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked for my husband till he could get his dentures fixed properly.</li>
            <li>And once you&#x27;ve used the kit all likelihood has it you&#x27;ve ruined them for future, professional repair.</li>
            <li>The next day I found my Krazy Glue, unscrewed the top, put in on but due to the mess from doc</li>
            <li>Crack fixed for a couple of days then split open again.  </li>
            <li>Realize that I already compounded the issue by sanding one of the broken joints, which was going to make the repair more difficult.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the third try , I got it to bond , had to rough up the area along the crack, then apply the cement , it sets up fast</li>
            <li>I broke my bottom toofusses and glued them with crazy glue quite a few times but didn&#x27;t last and ruined the nice clean edges where they went together.</li>
            <li>It does work, at least temporarily, but it does eventually wear off or dissolve or something, so you have to do it again or go to the dentist and get your denture fixed right.  </li>
            <li>many years ago I used it and it dried white , I had a missing tooth and made one it lasted for years.</li>
            <li>So now instead of a repair I have to buy a new partial $$$$.</li>
            <li>I do recommend though, to put the tube of cement in the refrigerator for 1/2 hour like it says , to slow down the set-up time, as it will set TOO FAST, and you won&#x27;t get the teeth of denture into the right position fast enough, if you don&#x27;t slow down the quick adhesion .It will set up in about 15- 40 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of applying too much product and because it dries so quickly, it was difficult to remove the extra product.  </li>

            <li> IT WORKING GREAT FOR FIXING MY FATHER DENTURE</li>
            <li> The tooth has held great for three yrs.</li>
            <li> Great for emergency repairs.</li>
            <li> A very good product for denture wearers to have handy.</li>
            <li> so you want to make sure that the surfaces mesh perfectly.</li>
            <li> Awesome quick repair!  </li>
            <li> After this the repaired denture is apparently good to go.</li>
            <li> After this the repaired denture is apparently good to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for emergency repairs.</li>
            <li> It is good for three repairs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to be as good as advertised....</li>
            <li> if you take you time....it is as good as any dental lab can do....without being ripped off by these con artists....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good deal......</li>
            <li> My opinion is its not as good as it use to b this denture repair stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll give the fifth star if this repair lasts another month, but I think the product is good for the tooth</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the ease of repair.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!!  </li>
            <li> and if i need some more i will buy it  its a good product.</li>
            <li> but it was spreadable and went on nicely covering the crack..</li>
            <li> After soaking in warm water, I used the supplied sandpaper to remove the excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading some of the not so nice reviews, i&#x27;m wondering if you read the instruction frist.</li>
            <li> goodluck with any kind of expectation you have</li>
            <li> and you will get a very strong adhesion.</li>
            <li> So I repaired it again and relined it so far real good.</li>
            <li> I cleaned it, let it soak for the precise amount of time and everything seemed absolutely wonderful, until the first time I ate.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for me even my dentist was surprised how good it works and looks.</li>
            <li> and I must say that I was very impressed with how easy it was to successfully perform the needed repair and have the aforementioned old timer once again happily eating his fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make very sure that you have the surfaces clean, there would have been a form of glue holding the tooth into the plate</li>
            <li> You can add more denture repair liquid one drop at a time,</li>
            <li> Best to reinforce repair with 2nd layer.</li>
            <li> they charge more for some reason.</li>
            <li> I thought the product would have given me more than one use.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> but it looks ok,  </li>
            <li> They can do a much better job.</li>
            <li> It is OK.</li>
            <li> I was able too fix the plate..  </li>
            <li> I used this and was able to do like an auto body type repair using this repair kit.</li>
            <li> If it screws them up even more, then I&#x27;ll just get lectured a bit more.  </li>
            <li> Here is is a month later, and the repair is still working perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Hope we never have to use it but better to be prepared.</li>
            <li> After a bit of dremeling to get it smooth, it has been a saviour for me!</li>
            <li> Not to sure</li>
            <li> OK What else can I say.  </li>
            <li> so I thought the doc kit would be better.  </li>
            <li> It would have been a much better job</li>
            <li> Unless you are an experienced dental worker who wants to save a trip to the dentist, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> In fact when I lost one of my top front teeth from my denture</li>
            <li> I bought the repair kit, and followed the instructions carefully, my top incisor has been eating everything for two weeks now and is still in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were very straightforward.  </li>
            <li> The price was good and delivery fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the Company, the chemical is good...</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do a great job, and noticed that there was a tiny gap in the repair, so I applied more paste to the gap.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use...</li>
            <li> Its been five years, and the repair is still going strong</li>
            <li> Useful tool for my mom to have on hand to fix her dentures; however, this product and the companion re-liner kit, both have very strong, foul, lingering odor/taste, which does interfere with one&#x27;s enjoyment of eating or drinking.</li>
            <li> It may have worked just fine if I had.</li>
            <li> All in all the package was just fine and the delivery was followed as instructed.</li>
            <li> Save your money super glue works better and is cheaper, this product did not work at all  </li>
            <li> I read many complaints here about how quickly the paste sets</li>
            <li> ) Using the included plastic spatula mix the powder and liquid thoroughly until a smooth creamy consistency like syrup is achieved.</li>
            <li> D.O.C. Denture Repair Kit is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> so happy my bottoms are back in.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t give a great review because this didn&#x27;t seem to work properly.  </li>
            <li> Just follow the directions precisely</li>
            <li> ,I hope it lasts , so far so good.</li>
            <li> This item worked very well for me ...very pleased with it ....  </li>
            <li> Love it, Thank You so much</li>
            <li> Dental tech glued it back together -- forget a good alignment -- but it lasted about 4 months.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works well and this company ships quickly.  </li>
            <li> Hardened too quickly to manage well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE ON 07/03/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more than 2 months have passed, the original lower denture repair described in the above review is still going strong, no problems</li>

            <li> /&gt;It will be interesting to see how long this repair lasts; I will provide an appropriate update.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will be interesting to see how long this repair lasts; I will provide an appropriate update.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very patient about it and willing to try it two more times.</li>
            <li> Place the now repaired denture into “hot water” (not boiling!)</li>
            <li> Way to go D.O.C. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Just ordered more to repair before it breaks completely.</li>
            <li> Well worth having a spare repair kit around for emergencies.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I chose this rating to alert future purchasers this product does not meet it&#x27;s expectation.</li>
            <li> but I think maybe I didn&#x27;t get it just right.</li>
            <li> Works good so far I had to repair my lower plate that broke right in the middle into.</li>
            <li> It might get you to the dentist to fit new dentures.</li>
            <li> wow is it strong.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to work quickly, just deliberately, the glue doesn&#x27;t really set until about a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> We waited and his lower denture is now rock solid and perfectly aligned – as good if not better than new during daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We waited and his lower denture is now rock solid and perfectly aligned – as good if not better than new during daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used super glue in the past and it works good until i can get to the dentist for a repair.</li>
            <li> I even watched the utube video by a customer because it seemed very important to mix the product properly</li>
            <li> I fixed my dentures myself and ducked a huge repair bill from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> instructions were clear, all the parts were there, I followed them precisely, and the glue was the consistency of syrup</li>
            <li> you must read the instructions i made it soupy and then let set in hot tap water still eating steak and beef jerkey</li>
            <li> Be sure all pieces a aligned properly!</li>
            <li> and I have used it to repair my upper plate to give it some more life.</li>
            <li> my first meal this morning and no problem at all.</li>
            <li> Okay for short time/emergency</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait til he sees me next month :)</li>
            <li> , my recommendation is to not break the darned things in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for our emergency first aid kit, along with an emergenct dental kit.</li>
            <li> The first two applications didn&#x27;t go well</li>
            <li> the first repair did&#x27;t hold bud two days.</li>
            <li> : My top denture had a crack in it from between the two front teeth 1/2 way to the back of the denture.  </li>
            <li> i mainly got this for my mom who wears dentures and just needed a quick fix since they broke but the glue didnt</li>
            <li> I could not line it up exactly, held it in place for 30 seconds,</li>
            <li> had I not messed it up with doc first.</li>
            <li> i did a few repair with it and it work as i was waiting for the dentist thank you for the good service</li>
            <li> ) Remove any of the now congealed pink substance that has oozed/escaped out of the break during pressure application with the spatula or other available tool (e.g., a toothpick is a handy item to have available for this</li>
            <li> (Ya think there might be a simple jig in the kit to help hold it fairly close to proper position?)  </li>
            <li> its very east to use and it didnt take very much to fix the dentures  </li>
            <li> Easy to remove, doesn&#x27;t last a day.  </li>
            <li> , I was really careful to ensure just the outside was glued and that it was aligned perfectly so I didn&#x27;t do any long term damage to my teeth.</li>
            <li> how many I.Q. points I&#x27;ll loose doing it.</li>
            <li> When my now elderly father accidentally dropped his lower denture on the tile floor in my kitchen splitting it completely in half (2 pieces) in such a way that none of the teeth were damaged and the break itself was clean and aligned perfectly without any missing pieces, this denture repair kit was what I turned to first in an attempt to fix his prosthetic teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Maybe with a larger denture it would work fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, only temporary until I see my dentist.</li>
            <li> It lasted for over 3 years on my original denture, but I added 3 new teeth to the denture, since I had a few more removed, and this stuff works</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars absolutely.  </li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> The tendency is to use too much</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> so you have to be ready to apply it after you mix the solution</li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> I recleaned the tooth and socket and regluded with a thin watery mix and the repair is great.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon you save me money, time and gas.</li>
            <li> they worked very well</li>
            <li> but it is way better than I expected....</li>
            <li> it really does work.....</li>
            <li> As I was putting the syrupy stuff on each piece it started to crumble and the whole thing was a disaster.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know it really did not do what I expected, but It may work better for others</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another 2 months have elapsed and the original lower denture repair has finally come apart once again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another 2 months have elapsed and the original lower denture repair has finally come apart once again.</li>
            <li> Not entirely a replacement for professional repair, but definitely a good product for those of us who have to make do for a while due to budget.</li>
            <li> While correctly aligning the break apply steady pressure to both sides of the break for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One tooth came out of the top plate one the left side over the pin hole in the back.  </li>
            <li> This five-star item is highly recommended for keeping some additional cash in your – and</li>
            <li> This five-star item is highly recommended for keeping some additional cash in your – and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Aside from the above, it really worked!!</li>
            <li> I had first used gorilla glue which held for about a week and when the tooth came back out , I didn&#x27;t clean the residue well enough.</li>
            <li> Its really very temporary fix till you gte it fixed by dentist...</li>
            <li> But, if you do, order this stuff and you can return them to normal operation within an hour.</li>
            <li> I used up the entire box just trying to get it right though.</li>
            <li> My denture feels like new.</li>
            <li> I called my dentist who wanted $250 plus Tax to come in urgently and get a new one.</li>
            <li> ) Ensure that the damaged denture is clean and dry and that there are no missing pieces in the area of the break</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although not required, I personally recommend waiting an additional 24 hours before first use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although not required, I personally recommend waiting an additional 24 hours before first use.</li>
            <li> I have fixed broken teeth many, many times over 40 years of use and its never let me down.</li>
            <li> I was able to save the tooth and tried a third time but the tube had been leaking fumes despite tight cap closure and no leak that I could see in the tube.</li>
            <li> This time i used a little more of the liquid and mixed it</li>
            <li> Be ready to apply the mixture as soon as it is mixed.  </li>
            <li> and so far they are still together  </li>
            <li> This time it broke while eating a fairly soft pizza --Friday eve of a 3-day weekend.  </li>
            <li> i understand we still need to go to a professional</li>
            <li> have them done by a professional in the field.</li>
            <li> Overall, this appears to be a good temporary solution, but it&#x27;s by no means a permanent repair for broken dentures.minutes.</li>
            <li> Overall, this appears to be a good temporary solution, but it&#x27;s by no means a permanent repair for broken dentures.</li>
            <li> arrived ok  packing box was oversized for such a small box</li>
            <li> I was trying to be so careful when my upper partial broke in 2 pieces at near the top that rests on the roof of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be careful to clean out the denture, particularly the little overlap that is normally at the \\&quot;top\\&quot; of the tooth.</li>
            <li> The first two repairs only lasted for about 3 meals, and the last one only lasted about 2 1/2 days.</li>
            <li> In an effort to make the product work fast they have created a fast setting and drying compound that unfortunately lack the ability to be worked into a reasonable finish while applying  as it starts to set too fast and then shatters when you put it to use.</li>
            <li> If you have eaten without the tooth, which you certainly will have unless you already had the kit in hand, then use a toothpick or other small tip to clean any residue out of that overlap.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked for my husband till he could get his dentures fixed properly.</li>
            <li> And once you&#x27;ve used the kit all likelihood has it you&#x27;ve ruined them for future, professional repair.</li>
            <li> The next day I found my Krazy Glue, unscrewed the top, put in on but due to the mess from doc</li>
            <li> Crack fixed for a couple of days then split open again.  </li>
            <li> Realize that I already compounded the issue by sanding one of the broken joints, which was going to make the repair more difficult.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the third try , I got it to bond , had to rough up the area along the crack, then apply the cement , it sets up fast</li>
            <li> I broke my bottom toofusses and glued them with crazy glue quite a few times but didn&#x27;t last and ruined the nice clean edges where they went together.</li>
            <li> It does work, at least temporarily, but it does eventually wear off or dissolve or something, so you have to do it again or go to the dentist and get your denture fixed right.  </li>
            <li> many years ago I used it and it dried white , I had a missing tooth and made one it lasted for years.</li>
            <li> So now instead of a repair I have to buy a new partial $$$$.</li>
            <li> I do recommend though, to put the tube of cement in the refrigerator for 1/2 hour like it says , to slow down the set-up time, as it will set TOO FAST, and you won&#x27;t get the teeth of denture into the right position fast enough, if you don&#x27;t slow down the quick adhesion .It will set up in about 15- 40 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of applying too much product and because it dries so quickly, it was difficult to remove the extra product.  </li>
            <li> This is kind of difficult to use, and even harder to get it off my hands, and I can&#x27;t use it without getting it on my hands.</li>
            <li> This left me with a mess on my partial that I spent the rest of the day trying to clean off.  </li>
            <li> The minimal price charged should have given me some indication that my chances of being successful were next to impossible.</li>
            <li> Mine was off a fraction which made my partial not fit right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time to process another repair (still plenty of materials left in the kit) and see how long it lasts the second time around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time to process another repair (still plenty of materials left in the kit) and see how long it lasts the second time around.</li>
            <li> With the spatula quickly place enough of this mixture to thinly coat both surfaces of the break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No you dont&#x27;t have much time to use it and its hard to get plate alianed properly.</li>
            <li> When I finally started I could not even get the tube open as instructed, I had to get a sharp object to puncture it and should have stopped at that point.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers with a similar break have had their repairs last for as long as 1 to 2</li>
            <li> Other reviewers with a similar break have had their repairs last for as long as 1 to 2</li>
            <li> i could hardly spread it and it hardens sooooo fast</li>
            <li> I was able to fill in voids made from the brakeage and crazy gluing and haven&#x27;t had a problem since saving me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I used one of three repair powders with 22 drops as directed and it fixed a small hole with plenty of spare glue left.  </li>
            <li> I spent around $8 to do the same thing my dentist would have charged $150.  </li>
            <li> I decided to take my dremel tool and make a wide deep area around  </li>
            <li> Though I didn&#x27;t see the entire content of the package on display I still got it on the expected date.</li>
            <li> It works as long as you don&#x27;t eat.</li>
            <li> This stuff is Pink, made  a tooth in place soaked  rubbed etc&amp;#60; last night , this morning it all fell out.</li>
            <li> Did the job and saved me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> Only wish that the powder could come in smaller packets(less waste)</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it is a lttle hard to work with because it set so fast but other than that</li>
            <li> Add about 22 drops of the clear denture repair liquid from the tube provided (looks like a small tube of glue) to the powder in the mixing cup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m above average and want to stay that way.</li>
            <li> The first time I repaired the tooth the mix was thick and the tooth did not fit correctly with the bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li> I had a tooth come loose from my dentures and the Dentist was on vacation, yikes!</li>
            <li> Empty the contents of one packet resin (pink powder) into one of the three see-through plastic mixing cups</li>
            <li> Sandpaper is included to help eliminate any rough spots that remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sandpaper is included to help eliminate any rough spots that remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the directions carefully and had the tooth come off during a meal twice.</li>
            <li> I was repairing my lower partial and it was an ackward repair to begin with.</li>
            <li> Did not work as hoped for or expected.</li>
            <li> Called dentist to find the cost was over $100.00  to reaffix a tooth to my partial, so decided to use superglue.</li>
            <li> Fingers kept slipping during the interminable 5 minute holds.  </li>
            <li> The representative told me I could not use the repaired partial to eat either.  </li>
            <li> Was supposed to have  a tube with the liquid in it, was empty.</li>
            <li> It dries to a muted pink gum-like color..</li>
            <li> Therefore, of absolutely no use.  </li>
            <li> Plus it only had one small piece of sand paper to sand the denture.</li>
            <li> I had a small hairline crack in my upper denture</li>
            <li> That left me with one repair powder and no more liquid to go with it.  </li>
            <li> I actually use this product to glue my false tooth back in place.</li>
            <li> I practiced how to piece the 2 sides of my partial together because it was on a curve making it difficult to line up and hold steady for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to hold my smaller pieces together for five minutes until adhesive set.</li>
            <li> but i thought this would last at least a couple of hours...</li>
            <li> I have a hard time trying to mend the loose, broken denture and when I finally did, after 3 try, it didn&#x27;t last a day.</li>
            <li> Realy hard if you shake any big mess</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to bite down.</li>
            <li> I repaired mine that was broke in half.</li>
            <li> It ended up not being enough for a third repair which probably would have failed also.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for unable to find in my local big box store</li>
            <li> my husband droped his bottom denture in the sink and it broke in half.</li>
            <li> A less than $20 fix with D.O.C.</li>
            <li> I snapped my lowers in half.</li>
            <li> it has been holding for three weeks now still tight</li>
            <li> for a small crack or hole but not a large crack since the stuff crumbled before I could even get it on.  </li>
            <li> New dentures lost a tooth unable to go to a dentist.</li>
            <li> I was expecting an extra teeth though for a broken denture repair.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> My last trip to the dentist for broken tooth  (because i couldn&#x27;t find D.O.C) costed me $75.00.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time because the instructions say you can&#x27;t change it once you use it.</li>
            <li> let it set a few hours</li>
            <li> just work with it and make it a little thinner for spreading and it works well !</li>
            <li> Combined with ridiculous shipping rates I have no other opinion than the overall feeling of being used and had for a bad experience.</li>
            <li> it dried hard as promised.</li>
            <li> I just wasted my money!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if the instructions were followed correctly.</li>
            <li> I have past experience using multipart epoxies, so I suppose that does help.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d actually have to go see a dentist again and suffer through the lectures of all of the things I&#x27;ve done wrong in my life.  </li>
            <li> you need a dozen to fix a broken  denture in half</li>
            <li> This product is hard to work with.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t believe the negative remarks...</li>
            <li> It was soooo thick</li>
            <li> The mixture was too thick.  </li>
            <li> Was of money, not a lot but was still too much to pay for this crap.</li>
            <li> I guess I just didn&#x27;t want to pay the ridiculous price to reattach a tooth to a denture that dentists charge.</li>
            <li> A little complicated to apply</li>
            <li> it was nothing but hard lumps in just seconds! .....</li>
            <li> At least it sets up in one minute!</li>
            <li> Very hard to work with</li>
            <li> If you need to fix a broken denture I would recommend taking it to someone that makes dentures.</li>
            <li> The crack was in a thin spot  ........</li>
            <li> (it looked too thin)</li>
            <li> Must mix it thin.  </li>
            <li> Broken.  </li>
            <li> Mixing the product was slow because the ratio they have is wrong and lumpy</li>
            <li> My suggestion to anyone who needs to have broken Dentures repaired,&lt;br /&gt;should</li>
            <li> This repair kit may not work if the denture is broken into two pieces.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT PERFORMED AS ADVERTISED, NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHIPPED OR BROKEN NYLON TEETH.</li>
            <li> Everything else is for dentures, which those products are puffy,nasty tasting, spongy, that doesn&#x27;t work on false teeth or crowns and washes out of your mouth with in minutes of drinking something.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dentures, I have crowns and a false tooth.</li>
            <li> It works and you will save a lot of money on expensive denture work at the dentist</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> LAME</li>
            <li> Dangerous and 100 percent useless to me.</li>
            <li> I always let it set up for overnight, after the cold water bath for it.(about 2 min.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> im afraid.</li>
            <li> Besides having a horrible texture which results in a loss of taste at least I can use them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to determine where the break was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are probably the ones giving this product the bad comments....</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that it did not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> impossible!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trying to be nasty or anything</li>
            <li> It was terrible did not work at all</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When my now elderly father accidentally dropped his lower denture on the tile floor in my kitchen splitting it completely in half (2 pieces) in such a way that none of the teeth were damaged and the break itself was clean and aligned perfectly without any missing pieces, this denture repair kit was what I turned to first in an attempt to fix his prosthetic teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this identical kit at my local Walgreens for about $8.00 and I must say that I was very impressed with how easy it was to successfully perform the needed repair and have the aforementioned old timer once again happily eating his fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough material is provided for three repairs and the instructions are simple and to the point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Ensure that the damaged denture is clean and dry and that there are no missing pieces in the area of the break itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Empty the contents of one packet resin (pink powder) into one of the three see-through plastic mixing cups provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Add about 22 drops of the clear denture repair liquid from the tube provided (looks like a small tube of glue) to the powder in the mixing cup. You will very likely only have enough liquid for 2 and not the stated 3 repairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Using the included plastic spatula mix the powder and liquid thoroughly until a smooth creamy consistency like syrup is achieved. You can add more denture repair liquid one drop at a time, if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) With the spatula quickly place enough of this mixture to thinly coat both surfaces of the break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) While correctly aligning the break apply steady pressure to both sides of the break for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) Remove any of the now congealed pink substance that has oozed/escaped out of the break during pressure application with the spatula or other available tool (e.g., a toothpick is a handy item to have available for this purpose)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8) Place the now repaired denture into “hot water” (not boiling!) for 10 minutes. This likely helps set the bond via heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9) After this the repaired denture is apparently good to go. Sandpaper is included to help eliminate any rough spots that remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although not required, I personally recommend waiting an additional 24 hours before first use. We waited and his lower denture is now rock solid and perfectly aligned – as good if not better than new during daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be interesting to see how long this repair lasts; I will provide an appropriate update. Other reviewers with a similar break have had their repairs last for as long as 1 to 2 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not hesitate to use this absolutely great product of impressive quality and ease of use at a bargain price once again if this denture should ever require it. This five-star item is highly recommended for keeping some additional cash in your – and not you dentist’s – pocket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 07/03/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more than 2 months have passed, the original lower denture repair described in the above review is still going strong, no problems whatsoever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 09/07/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another 2 months have elapsed and the original lower denture repair has finally come apart once again. It&#x27;s time to process another repair (still plenty of materials left in the kit) and see how long it lasts the second time around. Overall, this appears to be a good temporary solution, but it&#x27;s by no means a permanent repair for broken dentures.minutes.

            <li> Works very well.  Just follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> it has been holding for three weeks now still tight thank you</li>
            <li> No you dont&#x27;t have much time to use it and its hard to get plate alianed properly. but it does work. Best to reinforce repair with 2nd layer. I repaired mine that was broke in half. a Year later it is starting to crack again. Just ordered more to repair before it breaks completely.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as promised.  Couldn&#x27;t even get the pieces to bond.  Followed all instructions, but the product hardened even before I applied it.   I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  I just wasted my money!</li>
            <li> Works great just follow directions, would recommend this to family and friends</li>
            <li> 5 stars absolutely.  Phongsoon dejanu</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. i followed all the instructions several times until it was gone but it did not work at all. i got no reply from the company when i sent them an email</li>
            <li> D.O.C. Denture Repair Kit is a fantastic product.  It really works.  And, it&#x27;s so easy to use.  Only one hint:  Use it sparingly to start.  I made the mistake of applying too much product and because it dries so quickly, it was difficult to remove the extra product.  Be ready to apply the mixture as soon as it is mixed.  Aside from the above, it really worked!!</li>
            <li> I actually use this product to glue my false tooth back in place. It&#x27;s excellent. There&#x27;s nothing else like it outside of the dentist&#x27;s office. Everything else is for dentures, which those products are puffy,nasty tasting, spongy, that doesn&#x27;t work on false teeth or crowns and washes out of your mouth with in minutes of drinking something. I don&#x27;t have dentures, I have crowns and a false tooth. There is nothing else on the market that is a glue to cement a tooth or crown back in place like this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!!  I spent around $8 to do the same thing my dentist would have charged $150.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> wow is it strong. so happy my bottoms are back in.  thank you</li>
            <li> I followed the directions carefully and had the tooth come off during a meal twice. I was able to save the tooth and tried a third time but the tube had been leaking fumes despite tight cap closure and no leak that I could see in the tube. It ended up not being enough for a third repair which probably would have failed also. I may use some superglue or epoxy but I don&#x27;t know how many I.Q. points I&#x27;ll loose doing it. (No jokes please...) I&#x27;m above average and want to stay that way. I guess I just didn&#x27;t want to pay the ridiculous price to reattach a tooth to a denture that dentists charge. It&#x27;s highway robbery especially if they didn&#x27;t make your denture ....they charge more for some reason. Oh well...I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
            <li> I was trying to put a tooth back in my denture after it broke off. The tooth fits perfectly so there was no question of gaps or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were clear, all the parts were there, I followed them precisely, and the glue was the consistency of syrup just like it said, it went on the denture like it was supposed to, the tooth immediately adhered. I cleaned it, let it soak for the precise amount of time and everything seemed absolutely wonderful, until the first time I ate. The tooth immediately came back out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I agree with the above review.  I had a front tooth that came out of the socket.  You can make up to 3 repairs with the kit.  I had to use all three.  The first two repairs only lasted for about 3 meals, and the last one only lasted about 2 1/2 days.</li>
            <li> This has always worked great.</li>
            <li> you must read the instructions i made it soupy and then let set in hot tap water still eating steak and beef jerkey</li>
            <li> I thought the product would have given me more than one use.  Plus it only had one small piece of sand paper to sand the denture.</li>
            <li> This is kind of difficult to use, and even harder to get it off my hands, and I can&#x27;t use it without getting it on my hands. It does work, at least temporarily, but it does eventually wear off or dissolve or something, so you have to do it again or go to the dentist and get your denture fixed right.  It&#x27;s good for emergency repairs.</li>
            <li> Way over priced. I found the same brand at locale drug store for $1.98 a box. So don&#x27;t bother buying this from here.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for me even my dentist was surprised how good it works and looks.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t give a great review because this didn&#x27;t seem to work properly.  I wasn&#x27;t the one that did the repair so I&#x27;m not sure if the instructions were followed correctly.</li>
            <li> I was repairing my lower partial and it was an ackward repair to begin with. Be sure all pieces a aligned properly! Once it sets up its a done deal! Mine was off a fraction which made my partial not fit right. In fact I could not wear it. I&#x27;ve used super glue in the past and it works good until i can get to the dentist for a repair. So now instead of a repair I have to buy a new partial $$$$. This product does work. I used up the entire box just trying to get it right though. Bought my product at a drugstore.</li>
            <li> I only tried repairing my flipper tooth denture once. Maybe with a larger denture it would work fine. It was hard to hold my smaller pieces together for five minutes until adhesive set. I wasn&#x27;t very patient about it and willing to try it two more times. It may have worked just fine if I had.</li>
            <li> I had a tooth come loose from my dentures and the Dentist was on vacation, yikes! It is pretty easy to use. The tendency is to use too much but if you just follow the directions you&#x27;ll be happy. It lasted until I got in with the dentist - 2 weeks - and it felt like it could last indefinitely. It is good for three repairs. The price was good and delivery fast. A very good product for denture wearers to have handy.</li>
            <li> Works well and I have used it to repair my upper plate to give it some more life. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I have past experience using multipart epoxies, so I suppose that does help.</li>
            <li> My purpose solved, D.O.C Repair, I never heard it before, got the very good result, Thanks to the Company, the chemical is good...</li>
            <li> I have used this before to mend my upper denture, and I bought this to take with me when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;  It has saved me a lot of money for repair!&lt;br /&gt;  It lasted for over 3 years on my original denture, but I added 3 new teeth to the denture, since I had a few more removed, and this stuff works well!&lt;br /&gt;  I do recommend though, to put the tube of cement in the refrigerator for 1/2 hour like it says , to slow down the set-up time, as it will set TOO FAST, and you won&#x27;t get the teeth of denture into the right position fast enough, if you don&#x27;t slow down the quick adhesion .It will set up in about 15- 40 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;  I always let it set up for overnight, after the cold water bath for it.(about 2 min.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  GREAT, GREAT PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> Its really very temporary fix till you gte it fixed by dentist...overall would keep for emergency and travel&lt;br /&gt;Thank you uch</li>
            <li> Save your money super glue works better and is cheaper, this product did not work at all  my denture was cracked and this did not adhere at all</li>
            <li> arrived ok  packing box was oversized for such a small box but it looks ok,  thank you</li>
            <li> Last night I just was finshing my last bite of food when my lower denture cracked.&lt;br /&gt;Friday night no where to get my dentures fixed.&lt;br /&gt;Then I recalled seeing this product in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;Went to walgreens and purchased it. While I was thinking how to repair&lt;br /&gt;my denture I decided to take my dremel tool and make a wide deep area around  the&lt;br /&gt;crack to patch inorder to make a stronger repair.&lt;br /&gt;Had my first meal this morning and no problem at all. Very pleased with the ease of repair.&lt;br /&gt;Very simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;Old Timer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, only temporary until I see my dentist.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove, doesn&#x27;t last a day.  I have a hard time trying to mend the loose, broken denture and when I finally did, after 3 try, it didn&#x27;t last a day.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to work with. If you need to fix a broken denture I would recommend taking it to someone that makes dentures. They can do a much better job.</li>
            <li> The tooth fell out the next morning. A dentist repaired my tooth and said the bite has to be adjusted when replacing a lost tooth.</li>
            <li> its very east to use and it didnt take very much to fix the dentures  and so far they are still together  and if i need some more i will buy it  its a good product.</li>
            <li> Okay for short time/emergency</li>
            <li> It is OK. Just remember that it probably will not last forever and you might want to have a dental office make a permanent repair on your dentures.  I did read that some folks had months of service out of their repairs, so who knows.  Try it.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for unable to find in my local big box store</li>
            <li> This item worked very well for me ...very pleased with it ....  I was able too fix the plate..  Thanks</li>
            <li> Does not do as  says it does. Very hard to work with</li>
            <li> my husband droped his bottom denture in the sink and it broke in half. we order this repair kit. it worked like a charm. he did have to do some sanding,sandpaper is included in the kit.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked for my husband till he could get his dentures fixed properly.</li>
            <li> I broke my bottom toofusses and glued them with crazy glue quite a few times but didn&#x27;t last and ruined the nice clean edges where they went together. I used this and was able to do like an auto body type repair using this repair kit. I was able to fill in voids made from the brakeage and crazy gluing and haven&#x27;t had a problem since saving me a lot of money. Recommended to anyone that needs a repair.</li>
            <li> Did not work as hoped for or expected. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Love it, Thank You so much</li>
            <li> After the third try , I got it to bond , had to rough up the area along the crack, then apply the cement , it sets up fast so you have to be ready to apply it after you mix the solution ,I hope it lasts , so far so good.</li>
            <li> Though I didn&#x27;t see the entire content of the package on display I still got it on the expected date.I was expecting an extra teeth though for a broken denture repair.All in all the package was just fine and the delivery was followed as instructed.</li>
            <li> Useful tool for my mom to have on hand to fix her dentures; however, this product and the companion re-liner kit, both have very strong, foul, lingering odor/taste, which does interfere with one&#x27;s enjoyment of eating or drinking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not yet used it. Called dentist to find the cost was over $100.00  to reaffix a tooth to my partial, so decided to use superglue. It is still working!</li>
            <li> The denture repair worked great.</li>
            <li> Works well and this company ships quickly.  Not entirely a replacement for professional repair, but definitely a good product for those of us who have to make do for a while due to budget.</li>
            <li> very pleased with item!</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this product.  It is a waste of money.  It does not perform as it states it does.  Used it and the product&#x27;s performance only lasted for about two hours.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know it really did not do what I expected, but It may work better for others</li>
            <li> Worked very well. A little complicated to apply but it did the job.</li>
            <li> Repair was done about three weeks ago and it is doing great. Followed the directions to a T and there have been no problems.&lt;br /&gt;Joe</li>
            <li> A $400 estimate from my dentist. A less than $20 fix with D.O.C. My denture feels like new. Can&#x27;t wait til he sees me next month :)</li>
            <li> This stuff works just like you&#x27;ve paid a visit to your dentist. I showed my dentist what it could do and&lt;br /&gt; my dentist was amazed. Way to go D.O.C. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Temp denture (until my gums heal from the barbaric way teeth were removed) broke once on a weekday.  Dental tech glued it back together -- forget a good alignment -- but it lasted about 4 months.  This time it broke while eating a fairly soft pizza --Friday eve of a 3-day weekend.  Could not get a bond.  Fingers kept slipping during the interminable 5 minute holds.  (Ya think there might be a simple jig in the kit to help hold it fairly close to proper position?)  Used the entire kit, wound up with migrain-type headache from 15-20 minute expoure to the vile fumes.  Think I&#x27;ll try the GORILLA.  At least it sets up in one minute!</li>
            <li> I had a small hairline crack in my upper denture and i wanted to see if i could mend it without having to go to the dentist and be charged a fortune. The crack was in a thin spot  ........so i followed the directions and tried spreading the stuff evenly over the crack....impossible!!!! It was soooo thick i could hardly spread it and it hardens sooooo fast it was nothing but hard lumps in just seconds! .....so.....i chipped it off the plate and started over. This time i used a little more of the liquid and mixed it (it looked too thin) but it was spreadable and went on nicely covering the crack..it worked perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes i would recommend getting it....just work with it and make it a little thinner for spreading and it works well !</li>
            <li> you need a dozen to fix a broken  denture in half</li>
            <li> not used yet, but ordered for emergency when traveling. peace of mind.</li>
            <li> Must mix it thin.  One tooth came out of the top plate one the left side over the pin hole in the back.  I put to let paper in the pin hole to keep the glue out.  The first time I repaired the tooth the mix was thick and the tooth did not fit correctly with the bottom teeth.  I recleaned the tooth and socket and regluded with a thin watery mix and the repair is great.</li>
            <li> I snapped my lowers in half. Broken.  Rats.  I thought I&#x27;d actually have to go see a dentist again and suffer through the lectures of all of the things I&#x27;ve done wrong in my life.  I read a few reviews on this very inexpensive repair kit.  What did I have to lose?  I&#x27;m a guy.  If it screws them up even more, then I&#x27;ll just get lectured a bit more.  Realize that I already compounded the issue by sanding one of the broken joints, which was going to make the repair more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually read the instructions on this one.  They were very straightforward.  After mixing the two ingredients, I applied the paste to the dentures and held on for 5 minutes.  I didn&#x27;t do a great job, and noticed that there was a tiny gap in the repair, so I applied more paste to the gap.  After soaking in warm water, I used the supplied sandpaper to remove the excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, after the repair was complete, I expected the dentures to fall apart as soon as they were put to use.  They did not.  Here is is a month later, and the repair is still working perfectly.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to determine where the break was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my recommendation is to not break the darned things in the first place.  But, if you do, order this stuff and you can return them to normal operation within an hour.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the not so nice reviews, i&#x27;m wondering if you read the instruction frist. I&#x27;m not trying to be nasty or anything but i have been using this product since i&#x27;ve been 21 l&#x27;m 62 now . I use to buy it in the drug stores but i can&#x27;t find it in the stores now. THANK GOD FOR AMAZON!!!!  I have fixed broken teeth many, many times over 40 years of use and its never let me down. My last trip to the dentist for broken tooth  (because i couldn&#x27;t find D.O.C) costed me $75.00. I gave it 4 stars because it is a lttle hard to work with because it set so fast but other than that i think it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m buying two boxes so i can always have it on hand. Thanks Amazon you save me money, time and gas.</li>
            <li> Product works great.  Still holding tooth in even after soaking in a cleaning solution.  Will purchase this item again when I get low.</li>
            <li> IT WORKING GREAT FOR FIXING MY FATHER DENTURE</li>
            <li> Bought this for our emergency first aid kit, along with an emergenct dental kit. Hope we never have to use it but better to be prepared.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this product yet. I&#x27;m making an appointment with the Dentist to repair.</li>
            <li> My retainer broke 3 months after wearing it as advised by my dentist. I was just cleaning it one morning and a big split broke between the front upper bracket. I called my dentist who wanted $250 plus Tax to come in urgently and get a new one. Having also just lost my job, there was no way I could have paid that. I tried superglue but it didn&#x27;t hold. So I purchased this and it worked like a charm, I was really careful to ensure just the outside was glued and that it was aligned perfectly so I didn&#x27;t do any long term damage to my teeth. After a bit of dremeling to get it smooth, it has been a saviour for me! Thankyou DOC Dentists!!!</li>
            <li> they worked very well</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to be as good as advertised....but it is way better than I expected....if you take you time....it is as good as any dental lab can do....without being ripped off by these con artists....they are probably the ones giving this product the bad comments....don&#x27;t believe the negative remarks...this stuff is incredable...BUY IT...it&#x27;s a good deal......it really does work.....</li>
            <li> I am buying my 2nd box today. About 3 yrs ago I broke a denture tooth out of the socket. The first two applications didn&#x27;t go well so it took me a bit to get it figured out. I had first used gorilla glue which held for about a week and when the tooth came back out , I didn&#x27;t clean the residue well enough. I went to work with a sandpaper and cleaned the socket and the tooth of all glue and then used the last bit of the DOC. The tooth has held great for three yrs. Today I lost another one and DOC is my choice.</li>
            <li> It works and you will save a lot of money on expensive denture work at the dentist but it is only temporary</li>
            <li> Works good so far I had to repair my lower plate that broke right in the middle into. the first repair did&#x27;t hold bud two days. Not to sure but I think maybe I didn&#x27;t get it just right. So I repaired it again and relined it so far real good.It is the best stuff I could find. A dentist wanted $175.00 to fix it and not give a warranty it would stay.</li>
            <li> I used one of three repair powders with 22 drops as directed and it fixed a small hole with plenty of spare glue left.  Later, a caramel chew took out a back tooth.  I mixed up the second powder and only had 20 drops of liquid to put in it.  The mixture was too thick.  That left me with one repair powder and no more liquid to go with it.  The product worked for my needs, but I didn&#x27;t get 3 repairs as indicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: My top denture had a crack in it from between the two front teeth 1/2 way to the back of the denture.  I had no choice but to use this repair kit. I watched some YouTube videos to find the best technique then I tackled the job.  Besides having a horrible texture which results in a loss of taste at least I can use them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 11-2013: Ugh.. the crack is back in the dentures.  That repair only lasted a month or two.</li>
            <li> OK What else can I say.  The item was a ordered and I have no coplaints  That is it for now</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time because the instructions say you can&#x27;t change it once you use it.</li>
            <li> i did a few repair with it and it work as i was waiting for the dentist thank you for the good service</li>
            <li> It might get you to the dentist to fit new dentures. Don&#x27;t expect to bite down. And once you&#x27;ve used the kit all likelihood has it you&#x27;ve ruined them for future, professional repair.</li>
            <li> i mainly got this for my mom who wears dentures and just needed a quick fix since they broke but the glue didnt even last 2 min. i understand we still need to go to a professional but i thought this would last at least a couple of hours... i may never buy this again im afraid.</li>
            <li> I tried several times and followed instructions but tooth came back off after eating.  It works as long as you don&#x27;t eat.</li>
            <li> Purchased it for my father, he stated that it worked and is solid for the tooth that fell out of his dentures.</li>
            <li> I did not get this box,on this page. Something else?</li>
            <li> Save yourself a lot of time and money, use Krazy Glue instead.  I was trying to be so careful when my upper partial broke in 2 pieces at near the top that rests on the roof of my mouth.  I googled home repairs since it was a Friday evening and even read the reviews here.  I had Krazy Glue at home but couldn&#x27;t find it so I thought the doc kit would be better.  I even watched the utube video by a customer because it seemed very important to mix the product properly, at the end she admitted it did not work properly and she was calling the company.  I read many complaints here about how quickly the paste sets so I did as instructed and placed the tube in the frig for 1/2 hour.  I later asked doc why they did not have a video and did not get a satisfactory answer.  The representative told me I could not use the repaired partial to eat either.  I practiced how to piece the 2 sides of my partial together because it was on a curve making it difficult to line up and hold steady for 5 minutes.  When I finally started I could not even get the tube open as instructed, I had to get a sharp object to puncture it and should have stopped at that point.  Mixing the product was slow because the ratio they have is wrong and lumpy so I have to keep adding the liquid.  As I was putting the syrupy stuff on each piece it started to crumble and the whole thing was a disaster.  Maybe this stuff is o.k. for a small crack or hole but not a large crack since the stuff crumbled before I could even get it on.  This left me with a mess on my partial that I spent the rest of the day trying to clean off.  The next day I found my Krazy Glue, unscrewed the top, put in on but due to the mess from doc I could not line it up exactly, held it in place for 30 seconds, let it set a few hours and I fixed my partial.  It would have been a much better job had I not messed it up with doc first.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless. Didn&#x27;t last 2 days.</li>
            <li> Great for emergency repairs.</li>
            <li> Saved my bacon twice when I lost the grip on my dentures and they broke in the sink and on the floor.  Well worth having a spare repair kit around for emergencies.  I fixed my dentures myself and ducked a huge repair bill from my dentist.  They were wearable in a matter of minutes not days. Easy to use...BUT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER!!!!  Its been five years, and the repair is still going strong</li>
            <li> Crack fixed for a couple of days then split open again.  Problem probably is the crack goes across 3/4 of the upper denture and there is a lot of play when biting with the front teeth.</li>
            <li> many years ago I used it and it dried white , I had a missing tooth and made one it lasted for years. New dentures lost a tooth unable to go to a dentist. This stuff is Pink, made  a tooth in place soaked  rubbed etc&amp;#60; last night , this morning it all fell out. My opinion is its not as good as it use to b this denture repair stuff.</li>
            <li> Did the job and saved me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> Was supposed to have  a tube with the liquid in it, was empty. Was of money, not a lot but was still too much to pay for this crap.</li>
            <li> Hardened too quickly to manage well. Accelerated hardening made product too brittle to maintain. In an effort to make the product work fast they have created a fast setting and drying compound that unfortunately lack the ability to be worked into a reasonable finish while applying  as it starts to set too fast and then shatters when you put it to use. Combined with ridiculous shipping rates I have no other opinion than the overall feeling of being used and had for a bad experience.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I chose this rating to alert future purchasers this product does not meet it&#x27;s expectation. The three repairs offered here were only enough for one &amp;#34;repair,&amp;#34; that did not even work properly. My suggestion to anyone who needs to have broken Dentures repaired,&lt;br /&gt;should have them done by a professional in the field. The minimal price charged should have given me some indication that my chances of being successful were next to impossible.</li>
            <li> Dangerous and 100 percent useless to me. Unless you are an experienced dental worker who wants to save a trip to the dentist, this is not for you. It might work for you, but not for me. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Awesome quick repair!  My mom came here for a vacation, front tooth of her denture came off, she needed something to hold it in place until she gets back to her country, it held for about 2 months!  Just a note that this is a temp fix, so if you are looking for that, this is great!</li>
            <li> This repair kit may not work if the denture is broken into two pieces. BEWARE that if you try to return this item, you will have to pay the return postage as well as 15% re-stocking fee.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before buying this, they are mixed. I can&#x27;t say anything about the repair of the denture itself, but I will speak of the re-installing of a tooth into the denture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I note that some reviews mention the speed of setting, I have experience with that as one who does wood turning on a lathe. I often use CA glue, which sets in seconds. In fact when I lost one of my top front teeth from my denture I tried my CA glue to fix it. It lasted through a hamburger but broke off at the pre-bed popcorn. I bought the repair kit, and followed the instructions carefully, my top incisor has been eating everything for two weeks now and is still in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful to clean out the denture, particularly the little overlap that is normally at the \\&quot;top\\&quot; of the tooth. If you have eaten without the tooth, which you certainly will have unless you already had the kit in hand, then use a toothpick or other small tip to clean any residue out of that overlap. Make very sure that you have the surfaces clean, there would have been a form of glue holding the tooth into the plate so you want to make sure that the surfaces mesh perfectly. You don&#x27;t have to work quickly, just deliberately, the glue doesn&#x27;t really set until about a couple of minutes. Keep the pressure on it for about five minutes - all glues have a tendency to expand as they cure. The movement of the expansion weakens the bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give the fifth star if this repair lasts another month, but I think the product is good for the tooth replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best, Jon</li>
            <li> not recommended if you are hoping to put off the dentist visit for even two weeks. goodluck with any kind of expectation you have</li>
            <li> doesnt work at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!l  I read the directions and did what i was suppose to do but it still did not hold but for 2 minutes. LAME</li>
            <li> Simple to use. Just followed directions andd it dried hard as promised. It dries to a muted pink gum-like color..I&#x27;ve used the repair piece for awhile with no problems. I  did wonder about the safety of the material (methacryrlates.), I probably wouldn&#x27;t know what  a profession was using (maybe this?), and they would charge big bucks.It says not to use if allegic to the ingredients.  There is no tastei</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okaya s s s s . . A a a a a a a a a a a a a a aa a a</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT PERFORMED AS ADVERTISED, NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHIPPED OR BROKEN NYLON TEETH.</li>
            <li> It was terrible did not work at all</li>
            <li> Would not adhere to the chip on the veneer.  Therefore, of absolutely no use.  I was very disappointed that it did not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Very good in its ease of use. Just follow the directions precisely and you will get a very strong adhesion. Only wish that the powder could come in smaller packets(less waste)</li>
            <li> Realy hard if you shake any big mess</li>
            <li> Hope it will work in an emergency.</li>
            <li> Great product a lifesaver!</li>
