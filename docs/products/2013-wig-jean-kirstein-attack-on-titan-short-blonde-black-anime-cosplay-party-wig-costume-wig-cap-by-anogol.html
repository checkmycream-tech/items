            <li>The wig is very comfortable to wear, and I received a lot of comments for it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not shiny like most wigs, and it feels very nice.</li>

            <li>I am extremely pleased with this wig!</li>
            <li>Great wig!&lt;br /&gt;Nicely styled like the picture and easy to wear.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>The delivery time on this was astoundingly</li>
            <li>and she said it was very good quality, very real looking unlike some wigs.</li>
            <li>This makes it very easy to style, even without product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite IG I own</li>
            <li>Amazing quality and easy to style.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a statement if you knew how many I own.but</li>
            <li>This wig arrived weeks ahead of schedule, was more than we&#x27;d hoped for for the price we paid and my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really comfortable!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic wig!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a lot of hair, which I&#x27;m glad to have on a wig, because it makes it easier to work with and style.</li>
            <li>I think it adds more shades to the wig.</li>
            <li>the price, the quality is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>definitely recommend this wig, even if lilac is the norm, because its simply beautiful.</li>
            <li>quality of this wig is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are prepared to style and cut, but so worth it.</li>
            <li>I got the wig in two days because I got the two day free shipping option.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you want a Jean wig!!!!</li>
            <li>Return was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>, so it shipped very fast!</li>
            <li>I seriously cannot tell you how many compliments on how great my Jean wig looks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice quality wig but the cut is just so off from the actual character.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li>It came almost two weeks earlier than expected, and it&#x27;s the perfect color.</li>
            <li>Beyond a little bit of trimming, i barely had to cut it at all to make it look perfect.</li>
            <li>The wig is very nice and soft, yet you can easily style the wig without any wax or hair-spray because the single strands of hair will most likely stay in the way you&#x27;ll put them, so the wig doesn&#x27;t really require any styling.</li>
            <li>This is my first wig I bought online</li>
            <li>This is my first wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased in anticipation for Anime Expo 2015</li>
            <li>The colors are almost exact too.</li>
            <li>It can get a little shaggy, but easy to fix and style :]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really a perfectionist so this wig just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>but I noticed that the lighter portion was made up of a light blonde and lilac colored fibers.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig like a couple months ago, and people think it&#x27;s my real hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter really wanted this wig</li>
            <li>Looks extremely real for a wig</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s that natural looking, some people thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>The band that rests on your forehead is lined with a very soft material so that it does not irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made contact with the seller about the lilac coloration (its like lilac highlights) and although my exact questions weren&#x27;t fully answered they got back to me immediately and did all they could to help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 14 year old.</li>
            <li>wig doesn&#x27;t exactly match the picture, which is to be expected</li>
            <li>The lilac color is almost unnoticeable, in person you can&#x27;t see it unless you are very close (less than 6 inches away), and in pictures it only appears lilac in very select lighting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, well shaped and easily reshaped for different looks.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m starting to get more serious about cosplay, I decided to start a cosplay blog and such.</li>
            <li>The bangs are a bit long, but there&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
            <li>The dark brown lower half is very soft while the upper lighter half is more coarse.</li>

            <li> I ordered this wig on January 18th and it arrived by January 28th. The delivery time on this was astoundingly fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this wig is just fantastic. One of the nicest, if not the nicest, wig I&#x27;ve ever owned. The dark brown lower half is very soft while the upper lighter half is more coarse. This makes it very easy to style, even without product. The band that rests on your forehead is lined with a very soft material so that it does not irritate your skin. It also has adjustable straps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wig doesn&#x27;t exactly match the picture, which is to be expected but I noticed that the lighter portion was made up of a light blonde and lilac colored fibers. I don&#x27;t know if the other wigs people ordered were like this too or not. The lilac color is almost unnoticeable, in person you can&#x27;t see it unless you are very close (less than 6 inches away), and in pictures it only appears lilac in very select lighting.

            <li> Amazing quality and easy to style. The wig cap itself i extremely durable. For those who don&#x27;t know how to style wigs, this wig does come unstyled, and with some added length. Make sure you are prepared to style and cut, but so worth it. 100% satisfied amazing! Here&#x27;s the wig before and after styling</li>
            <li> I got the wig in two days because I got the two day free shipping option. This is my first wig I bought online and I have to say I love it. The quality is GREAT!!!!!! It&#x27;s VERY comfortable!!! I wore it for about an hour and it did not bother me like my other wigs. I highly recommend this if you want a Jean wig!!!!</li>
            <li> The bangs are a bit long, but there&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed. A few people thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li> it came out just like the picture. and i love it. i wear it for jean, but also on different several occassions. Yes, it&#x27;s that natural looking, some people thought it was my real hair. haha. 10/10 would recommend</li>
            <li> This is my first wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased in anticipation for Anime Expo 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, the quality is pretty good.  After  some styling with some got2b styling gel and such it definitely did it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> The wig is very nice and soft, yet you can easily style the wig without any wax or hair-spray because the single strands of hair will most likely stay in the way you&#x27;ll put them, so the wig doesn&#x27;t really require any styling. The colors are very nice, and the length of both neck and bangs are optimal. The wig is very comfortable to wear, and I received a lot of comments for it!</li>
            <li> Great wig!&lt;br /&gt;Nicely styled like the picture and easy to wear.&lt;br /&gt;Nice price too!</li>
            <li> The wig was different than the picture but overall it&#x27;s still nice. I recommend this product! :) it&#x27;s an awesome Jean wig.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! This is my favorite IG I own and that&#x27;s a statement if you knew how many I own.but the length is great and the color is on point so to all of you Jean cosplayers this is the wig to get.</li>
            <li> This wig arrived weeks ahead of schedule, was more than we&#x27;d hoped for for the price we paid and my daughter loves it. She wears it all the time, for hours at a time without complaints. It&#x27;s thick, well shaped and easily reshaped for different looks. It fits her perfectly and it comes with a wig cap. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig like a couple months ago, and people think it&#x27;s my real hair. it&#x27;s not shiny like most wigs, and it feels very nice. It can get a little shaggy, but easy to fix and style :] I recommend this wig to anyone who is thinking about buying it.</li>
            <li> Unlike the Eren doll, this is something she sleeps with. I think it&#x27;s just because she can&#x27;t find it amongst all the stuff piled on her bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, though, it&#x27;s a great wig, good quality, looks better than in the pic, even.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this wig! It came almost two weeks earlier than expected, and it&#x27;s the perfect color. I would definitely consider purchasing from this seller again. Beyond a little bit of trimming, i barely had to cut it at all to make it look perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really comfortable! It&#x27;s the best fitting wig I have, and I&#x27;ve bought a bunch. The colors are almost exact too.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and she said it was very good quality, very real looking unlike some wigs.</li>
            <li> My daughter really wanted this wig so I ordered it for her. It was suppose to come in some time in May (note it&#x27;s still April) but we got it 6 days after we ordered it, so it shipped very fast! My daughter has noted there are hints of lilac in the wig, but it&#x27;s not very noticeable and it&#x27;s soft. Either way, it&#x27;s a really nice wig!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic wig! Didn&#x27;t expect it to look this good for the price I paid for it. Looks extremely real for a wig</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m starting to get more serious about cosplay, I decided to start a cosplay blog and such. I seriously cannot tell you how many compliments on how great my Jean wig looks. It&#x27;s got a lot of hair, which I&#x27;m glad to have on a wig, because it makes it easier to work with and style. There are purpley fibers on this wig, which I&#x27;m not sure why there are, but it in no means looks bad! I think it adds more shades to the wig. I&#x27;m very happy with this wig :)</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 14 year old. Arrived in time, in good condition. Looks great, and she is happy with it. That&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
