            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t Love the smell of coconuts.</li>
            <li>I used this with the wen instructions and love it.</li>
            <li>Amazing scent and makes my hair so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It is better than the most expensive hair products I have used and incredibly affordable and color-safe, the best quality!</li>
            <li>I even like the smell better and most certainly like the price better!</li>

            <li>This shampoo/conditioner, on the other hand, is the BEST natural product I have ever discovered!</li>
            <li>I went back and bought the leave-in conditioner I loved it so much!</li>
            <li>The smell was fine but as far as my hair.....</li>
            <li>I Immediately noticed how soft, tangle free, shiny and weightless my hair was, literally after the FIRST wash.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I tried many different shampoos and conditioners from Renpure line.  </li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time, so I can&#x27;t vouch for its long-term use yet, but the first use was so positive</li>
            <li>Will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li>and I used a different line sulfate free shampoo which did not lather much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The smell of this product really turned me off.  </li>
            <li>Smells decent -</li>
            <li>Theoretically, I prefer sulfate-free, natural hair products, but find that most often, the quality of the products seem to suffer, making hair more tangled, more dull, and less shiny.</li>
            <li>So soft and so much stronger than what it was.</li>
            <li>The product contains a very unnatural smelling fragrance, so if you are looking for natural, organic ingredients, keep looking.  </li>
            <li>I felt I should share an early review.  </li>
            <li>This morning after brushing, my hair was fluffy, light, shiny, and has tons of body.  </li>
            <li>I love this product on my thick natural kinky hair.</li>
            <li>It did NOT weigh my hair down at all, which is really rare for me with conditioners.  </li>
            <li>All of them left our scalps dried out and very itchy after the first couple of times we started using these products.</li>

            <li> I like that it is free of chemicals that are bad for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that is beginning to thin out as I am in my mid-30&#x27;s.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I just used this for the first time, so I can&#x27;t vouch for its long-term use yet, but the first use was so positive I felt I should share an early review.  I have long, fine-medium thickness hair that has gotten pretty rough near the ends during the last few months.  I used this conditioner last night with no shampoo.  It did NOT weigh my hair down at all, which is really rare for me with conditioners.  This morning after brushing, my hair was fluffy, light, shiny, and has tons of body.  I&#x27;m definitely getting the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all.  The smell was fine but as far as my hair.....it felt like I didn&#x27;t even put it in my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair and smells good to!</li>
            <li> I love this product on my thick natural kinky hair. Detangles very well leaving hair soft and smooth and smelling awesome. I even used it as a body milk after I showered - slathered it on my body and then rinsed off - eliminating the need to apply lotion.  Will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner set is AMAZING. Theoretically, I prefer sulfate-free, natural hair products, but find that most often, the quality of the products seem to suffer, making hair more tangled, more dull, and less shiny. This shampoo/conditioner, on the other hand, is the BEST natural product I have ever discovered! It is better than the most expensive hair products I have used and incredibly affordable and color-safe, the best quality! I Immediately noticed how soft, tangle free, shiny and weightless my hair was, literally after the FIRST wash.</li>
            <li> Love it. Love it. Love it. Wonderful for the hair.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I hoped. Smells decent - but I&#x27;m still left with hair that needs a leave in conditioner when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever</li>
            <li> Totally enjoying this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to WEN! I even like the smell better and most certainly like the price better! Just remember that you have to use a number of pumps of shampoo to thoroughly cleanse your hair, follow the directions and you&#x27;ll have great results</li>
            <li> works great , arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Really good conditioner. Not greasy, but leaves hair shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Picked up this conditioner at my local TJ Maxx, wanted to try a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner and compare to the Fekkai line I have been using which is quite expensive. LOVE this conditioner! I didn&#x27;t try the co-wash one....just the regular conditioner and I used a different line sulfate free shampoo which did not lather much. I have thick curly hair that is beginning to thin out as I am in my mid-30&#x27;s. I can only wash every other day due to the curls and texture of my hair, or my scalp gets dry and flaky. I went back and bought the leave-in conditioner I loved it so much!</li>
            <li> This Coconut Milk has worked wonders on my hair. Who doesn&#x27;t Love the smell of coconuts. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I tried many different shampoos and conditioners from Renpure line.  All of them left our scalps dried out and very itchy after the first couple of times we started using these products. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair smell so good and feel very soft.  I like that it is free of chemicals that are bad for your hair.  No sulfates is what sold me on this product!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I used this with the wen instructions and love it. No greasy feeling and my hair is amazing now. So soft and so much stronger than what it was. I can actually let it air dry and not have a frizzy mess on my hands.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent and makes my hair so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product really turned me off.  Had to Return it.</li>
            <li> Perfume alert! Product labeled as organic and free of harmful ingredients. The product contains a very unnatural smelling fragrance, so if you are looking for natural, organic ingredients, keep looking.  I decided not to return it bcuz I liked the packaging and the pump feature.  I dumped out the perfumie stuff and put in my Desert Essence Coconut Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
