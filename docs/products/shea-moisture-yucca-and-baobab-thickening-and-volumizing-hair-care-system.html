            <li>Love the productd and price.</li>
            <li>And coming from some who doesn&#x27;t use shampoo; I find their sulfate free shampoo to be absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Using Nixon hair products (shampoo+conditioner) instead and its much better for my hair.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>

            <li>Since she has started using it I have noticed that her hair look much more full.</li>
            <li>They smell incredible, contain natural ingredients that I am familiar with, and are exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for in terms of hair care.</li>
            <li>I tried it again on my now fully natural shoulder length kinky hair and it felt really good.</li>
            <li>This is a perfectly sized kit for testing out a new line of products--excellent variety for a low price.</li>

            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel as though it had stripped my hair completely and my hair felt soft and manageable after the shampoo and treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have short, fine, thin hair and all of these products give me a thicker, fuller and soft feel when used as directed.</li>

            <li> I have short, fine, thin hair and all of these products give me a thicker, fuller and soft feel when used as directed.</li>
            <li> Just remember that with fine hair a small amount of the shampoo (and the other products) goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I was transitioning from relaxed to natural and it was a mess.</li>
            <li> When these bottles are empty</li>
            <li> (I have thick African American hair.)</li>
            <li> The other two items in the package make my hair oily.</li>
            <li> Made hair extremely greasy and oily.</li>
            <li> had gotten braids and they were extremely tight and had a lot of hair loss, decided I wasn&#x27;t going to wear weave for awhile</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair once a week depending on my styling product usage and I intend to use this at least once a month on my hair as I&#x27;m currently using the Wen hair care system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Confusing reply when I tried to return.</li>
            <li> My hair tangled so bad and felt dry and straw like.  </li>
            <li> Not for thin hair: made it feel dirty.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewer may or may not say they were crazy about the floral scent, but to me it&#x27;s not that overpowering in any way.</li>
            <li> I really hated it.  </li>

            <li> Love the productd and price.</li>
            <li> Not for thin hair: made it feel dirty.  Confusing reply when I tried to return.</li>
            <li> When I received package some of the shampoo had leaked. Shipped quickly</li>
            <li> I am happy that I purchased their travel size system! Some reviewer may or may not say they were crazy about the floral scent, but to me it&#x27;s not that overpowering in any way. It&#x27;s a really good line from Shea Moisture and I will recommend this to any naturals who suffer with fine/thin hair strands. And coming from some who doesn&#x27;t use shampoo; I find their sulfate free shampoo to be absolutely amazing. Well, everything in the box is priceless and I will be making this as my staple hair care routine! :)</li>
            <li> Shampoo made my hair fall out, the sprays and milk did nothing. Would not recommend. Using Nixon hair products (shampoo+conditioner) instead and its much better for my hair.</li>
            <li> If I had written this review when I had bought this I would have given it 1 star but I decided not to dump it and used it again about a week ago, and this is over a year  since I purchased the products.&lt;br /&gt;When I had bought this kit I was transitioning from relaxed to natural and it was a mess. My hair tangled so bad and felt dry and straw like.  I really hated it.  I tried it again on my now fully natural shoulder length kinky hair and it felt really good. It didn&#x27;t feel as though it had stripped my hair completely and my hair felt soft and manageable after the shampoo and treatment.  I usually wash my hair once a week depending on my styling product usage and I intend to use this at least once a month on my hair as I&#x27;m currently using the Wen hair care system. When these bottles are empty I&#x27;m not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about five months and I am just now running out of it. I love that it comes with several different items for the price. The products are organic and I needed to step away from shampoos and conditioners with sulfate FOREVER, so I tried this. I wish the bottle sizes were bigger, but this was the size I need as a &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; run. I think that I will experiment with other organic items before purchasing again to make sure that this is the best thing for my hair, but the item is great for my hair type. (I have thick African American hair.) I also used these products on my hair when I had a sew-in.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner.  Really give me some volume.  The other two items in the package make my hair oily.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a significant difference in my hair yet; but I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Ok but would not purchase again</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCTS GREAT MOISTURE</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mom. Since she has started using it I have noticed that her hair look much more full. She is also taking a hair vit, that is helping with growth. She likes the smell and how her hair feels after she uses the products. Go SM.</li>
            <li> had gotten braids and they were extremely tight and had a lot of hair loss, decided I wasn&#x27;t going to wear weave for awhile and my boyfriend bought me the milk of this product and I fell in love! My edges grew out, my hair remained moisturized and my hair styles came out beautifully than ever before! I didn&#x27;t have fine hair to begin with, but my hair got thicker and my hair was actually finally growing! Watch out I might buy the rest of the STOCK! The shampoo, masque, and the mist are bonus! They really work if you take the time to truely care for your hair!</li>
            <li> I have short, fine, thin hair and all of these products give me a thicker, fuller and soft feel when used as directed. They smell incredible, contain natural ingredients that I am familiar with, and are exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for in terms of hair care. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of product lines and this is what I&#x27;ll be sticking with. Just remember that with fine hair a small amount of the shampoo (and the other products) goes a long way! I enjoyed sampling all of the masks and treatments. This is a perfectly sized kit for testing out a new line of products--excellent variety for a low price. Highly recommend you try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note-- I bought the same brand of conditioner separately since it didn&#x27;t come in this tester kit. Worked great.</li>
            <li> I love all Shea Moisture products.  My hair does appear to be thicker after using the shampoo and the conditioner.  Also, my hair feels moisturized and looks healthy and shiny.  This is a great idea of combining this trio of products so you can determine if they really work. I like using the same line of products together.  I feel they blend easier for better results.</li>
            <li> Made hair extremely greasy and oily.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product</li>
