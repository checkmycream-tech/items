    <ol>
            <li>and I&#x27;m telling you this is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Best hairspray ever invented.</li>
            <li>Best hairspray ever!!</li>
            <li>Great stuff!  </li>
            <li>My beautiful salon girl uses it so now I do too.</li>
            <li>Works great in all kinds of weather.</li>
            <li>Great item.  </li>
            <li>Smells good but not overpowering with a great hold that isn&#x27;t sticky and combable if needed.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and holds exceptionally well without buildup or being sticky.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it!</li>
            <li>I have used this hair product for 20+ yrs and love it!</li>
            <li>Matrix is my favorite hair spray that I will always use!</li>
            <li>I received a dented bottle which was considered hazardous, so could not return it.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray and can buy cheaper here than I can in the stores.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>Plus, you get a mutch better price over the internet</li>
            <li>I have been using this hairspray for probably 20 years, maybe more</li>
            <li>Have been using for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray.</li>
            <li>If you do brush your hair after spraying, you can re-spray without your hair becoming gunked with hairspray.</li>
            <li>This hairspray works fine, but the scent is stronger than what I like.</li>
            <li>I would not buy the product again but certainly feel kindly disposed toward the seller.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best hair spray I&#x27;ve found - I have fine hair and live on the humid Gulf Coast and this is the only hair spray that will hold my hair in place</li>
            <li>I have a very short attention span when it comes to hair products so that is surprising in and of itself.  </li>
            <li>My long time favorite!</li>
            <li>Great hold but not sticky and hard.  </li>
            <li>so I needed a good hairspray that would create volume and hold my style without being too stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li>I have very soft, fine hair and most hair sprays spray on wet, which would make my hair droop.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair and have tried many hair sprays.  </li>
            <li>However, my mother has thin hair and it worked great for her.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>have extremely baby fine hair</li>
            <li>Finally I found a hair spray that will hold my fine hair all day long, even on damp days.  </li>
            <li>The proforma firm hold does a really good job and not a weighted down feeling to it.  </li>
            <li>I am 66 years old</li>
            <li>And even when your hair won&#x27;t move it still feels soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>Love this spray as it&#x27;s a firm hold but not with that heavy feeling.</li>

            <li> I have thick, coarse and straight hair and this spray did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This sprays on fairly dry and lasts even when you comb alittle.  </li>
            <li> I have used many other hairsprays and go crazy when my hair falls into my eyes after just an hour or so, then have to respray and my hair becomes greasy and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Morocccan Oil hairspray but thought I&#x27;d try something different.</li>

            <li> I spray my bangs to the side so they don&#x27;t fall in my eyes and this spray will last all day, seriously (if you don&#x27;t brush it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted money trying to find something comparable with no luck.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as sticky as it used to be and doesn&#x27;t look powdery on my black hair!  </li>
            <li> but I do have thick heavy hair.</li>
            <li> I was annoyed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has become difficult to find.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this hairspray and can buy cheaper here than I can in the stores.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse and straight hair and this spray did not work for me. It just would not keep the hold but I do have thick heavy hair. However, my mother has thin hair and it worked great for her.</li>
            <li> The proforma firm hold does a really good job and not a weighted down feeling to it.  Works great in all kinds of weather.</li>
            <li> Finally I found a hair spray that will hold my fine hair all day long, even on damp days.  It took me a while.  I am in my fifties.  Unfortunately it has become difficult to find.  Hopefully it is not being discontinued.</li>
            <li> I used Proforma by Matrix in the 80&#x27;s when I had &amp;#34;Big Hair&amp;#34; and it held until I washed it.  They quit making it for awhile because the sprayer would get clogged up.  I hadn&#x27;t seen it in years and happened to see it online. I ordered it and it was just the way I remembered it.  I have very soft, fine hair and most hair sprays spray on wet, which would make my hair droop.  This sprays on fairly dry and lasts even when you comb alittle.  It isn&#x27;t as sticky as it used to be and doesn&#x27;t look powdery on my black hair!  So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> I have used this hair product for 20+ yrs and love it! Matrix is my favorite hair spray that I will always use!</li>
            <li> Great hold but not sticky and hard.  I bought this product on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and it&#x27;s much cheaper than my usual brand.  I will switch.</li>
            <li> This hairspray has hold, but flexibility. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair look like you have a helmet on, but can with stand some windy days.</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and I&#x27;m telling you this is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever had.  Smells great, and holds exceptionally well without buildup or being sticky.</li>
            <li> I received a dented bottle which was considered hazardous, so could not return it. I was annoyed. Did not use product on my hair but sprayed some on my arm to test and could not stand the scent.  However, the seller graciously refunded my money, even tho I had no expectation that he would.  I would not buy the product again but certainly feel kindly disposed toward the seller.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair spray that I will use.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Morocccan Oil hairspray but thought I&#x27;d try something different. This hairspray works fine, but the scent is stronger than what I like. I will stick with my Moroccan Oil hairspray.</li>
            <li> After using a Nexus hair spray product for years I thought it was about time I had a change so decided to try Matrix.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely baby fine hair so I needed a good hairspray that would create volume and hold my style without being too stiff or sticky.  Matrix does the job my other hair spray didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hairspray on a daily basis for over 10 years.  I have a very short attention span when it comes to hair products so that is surprising in and of itself.  It is lightweight, doesn&#x27;t build up, works well for both styling and finishing.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product, but we can&#x27;t find it locally.  Plus, you get a mutch better price over the internet</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and have tried many hair sprays.  Amplify Proforma is the only hair spray that keeps my hair in place, even on a rainy day.  It is a little pricey but worth the cost.  I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hairspray for probably 20 years, maybe more and I have never found anything comparable. I spray my bangs to the side so they don&#x27;t fall in my eyes and this spray will last all day, seriously (if you don&#x27;t brush it). If you do brush your hair after spraying, you can re-spray without your hair becoming gunked with hairspray. And even when your hair won&#x27;t move it still feels soft to the touch.

            <li> Love this spray as it&#x27;s a firm hold but not with that heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to hairspray for years. I&#x27;ve wasted money trying to find something comparable with no luck. Smells good but not overpowering with a great hold that isn&#x27;t sticky and combable if needed.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever invented.</li>
