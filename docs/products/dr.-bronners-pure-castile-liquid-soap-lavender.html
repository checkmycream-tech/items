            <li>Wonderful product for cleaning and general use hand washing</li>
            <li>I was hoping after diluting it with water while bathing with it, it would be more of a hint of lavender.  </li>
            <li>I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap every time I shower.</li>
            <li>I suggest you go to a local supermarket and smell each type and see which one works best for you before you buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li>It has so many uses, you can replace a number of products in your household.</li>
            <li>It works for household cleaning, hand soap, dish soap, shampoo, toothpaste, and so much more.</li>
            <li>I love purchasing fair trade items, especially when they are as great a product as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product and the only drawback is that it may clog dispenser bottles, but I have learned to work around that.</li>
            <li>love that it is biodegradable.</li>
            <li>I love it...except</li>
            <li>and it just seems to be better all around.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I use the peppermint more in the summers because it&#x27;s so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more soapy and the smell is more authentic.  </li>
            <li>In any event, I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything I like better.</li>
            <li>I like the lavender especially as it has a calming scent and just makes them smell delicious!  </li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>We love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>We use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap and have for over a year.  </li>
            <li>This soap smells great and is very gentle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and have used it</li>
            <li>And love the smell of Lavender:).</li>
            <li>She noticed that her acne got better.  </li>
            <li>It should be sold in more stores.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to so many things, but not to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps.  </li>
            <li>This is the only body wash I will use from now on and it is the best.</li>
            <li>love this soap.</li>
            <li>LOVE this soap.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I also feel very clean after using it.</li>
            <li>When I asked what the awesome product was, the owners happily wrote the info down for me and raved how good it is and how long they had been using it... even bathing their dogs with it too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and you get twice as clean!  </li>
            <li>This soap contains natural ingredients and smells great.  </li>
            <li>it doesnt wash out easy....</li>
            <li>Probably because this non soap wasnt able to clean off the bacterial buildup after sweating.</li>
            <li>Cleans and rinses easily.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well as a maintenance kind of soap--to prevent build up of dirt in the shower and bath.</li>
            <li>I plan to take it with me on camping trips, because that is when I don&#x27;t care quite as much if I smell good or look all that clean.</li>
            <li>Fabulous Soap.</li>
            <li>Smells great and last forever.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it is natural and not harsh, plus good for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up !!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since the 70&#x27;s and have baby skin on an old man and looking good at 63.</li>
            <li>The lavender is my favorite, but the other varieties are great as well.</li>
            <li>an aside, even though this is a review for the lavender scent, I also often use the tea tree for household uses and it leaves things smelling very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and pleasant, and no residue is left on the skin.</li>
            <li>I always feel super clean and it rinses easily,</li>
            <li>I like the squeaky clean feel</li>
            <li>-it lathers but doesnt seem to clean.</li>
            <li>I could was camping utensils with it, brush my teeth with it, shampoo with it, clean my body</li>
            <li>Nowadays, I use it for bathing because I like being squeaky clean without a filmy residue.  </li>
            <li>It lathers exceptionally well, has a light scent, and only a small amount is needed to create a wonderful lather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation?</li>
            <li>have loved Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps since that day but after having tried them all, I stick with the peppermint only - to me</li>
            <li>i use it for shampoo, i have fine limp hair and this is great.</li>
            <li>It is a fresh and clean smell.</li>
            <li>I have used nothing but the lavender or the baby liquid castile on all three of my children since they were getting their very first bathes.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a great idea as a previous reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li>please dont get it in or near your eyes because this \\&quot;organic soap\\&quot; has probably caused many emergency room visits.</li>
            <li>We dilute it down to 1 part soap 3 parts water, and it works great in the pumps and makes the cost really reasonable for having to wash 50 hands 10 times a day!</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve never used for anything but a body wash, I have compared it to other body washes, and have found that Bronner&#x27;s is superior.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to be able to use one with a slight scent of lavendar.  </li>
            <li>This soap is all natural, lots of suds and easy on your water system.  </li>
            <li>Very very itchy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>This review is for the lavender which is almost our first fav</li>
            <li>but our first fav is the almond</li>
            <li>First time buyer</li>
            <li>cost scared me a bit at first, but you are supposed to dilute this concentrated soap 1:4 or 1:5</li>
            <li>Thanks, Doc Bronner&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I really liked the other citrus type, but lavender not so much.</li>
            <li>The container is large.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The purity and organic contents really appeal to me, too.  </li>
            <li>Is this price for real?</li>
            <li>A friend of mine suggested it looked like I had just put shampoo in my hair and not rinsed it out very well.</li>
            <li>and I had to take a shower with real soap-Ivory,Irish spring, Dial, Etc..afterwards.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the addition of  hemp as much as the one with just lavender, so</li>
            <li>I got a soap foamer to dispense it, which really helps...  </li>
            <li>The packaging and appearance looked genuine, but the product does not have the same working properties, smell, etc.</li>
            <li>Very calming and relaxing in the shower.  </li>
            <li>You do not need to use much either, it foams very well.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to buy it as long as I live.</li>
            <li>and I give it five stars because i used it to clean my shower and it removed soap scum and my shower has never looked better.</li>
            <li>It only takes a drop for a rich lather.</li>
            <li>I never felt clean especially when sweaty after exercising.</li>
            <li>use code KAL996 to get free $10 towards any first purchase at the iherb site, over $40, through end of March, hurry!&lt;br /&gt; or  $5 off any other purchase, any time&lt;br /&gt;code</li>
            <li>It is more watery than a typical shampoo or hand soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have at least one soap on the market that gives me absolutely nothing to worry about.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the shower mainly</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I also use it for washing their hair, as babies need something gentle for their sensitive scalps.  </li>
            <li>The product last a long time since its concentrated , you&#x27;ll save money buy not buying so many products through out the year</li>
            <li>But I felt like I didn&#x27;t feel clean for as long, and didn&#x27;t continue smelling nice for as long as with other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have looked carefully (don&#x27;t appear to be able to return), but at least from this supplier on Amazon, I&#x27;d strongly advise against purchasing Dr. Bronners from BeautyOnline.com.</li>
            <li>--I think I may have been able to find a less expensive way to purchase if I had really shopped around, but I liked the convenience this way.</li>
            <li>The only problem is the smell, i didn&#x27;t mind it as much at first</li>
            <li>This has fixed ALL of my soap allergy issues!</li>
            <li>and my hands have never been so soft!  </li>
            <li>I had a current comparison bottle from a big box retail, and have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for many years - never had one that smelled like linseed oil and foamed up like commercial soap....</li>
            <li>Always high quality, multiple uses, no hidden ingredients, gentle on skin, dishes, septic tanks and sewer systems.</li>
            <li>The pure castile soap line comes in several scents and can be used for shampoo, body wash, bathing baby, laundry, etc.</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised at how \\&quot;strong\\&quot; this soap smells.  </li>
            <li>Goes twice as far</li>
            <li>I also use this on my eight year old.</li>
            <li>I just decided to look elsewhere for natural shampoo that will work without additional steps.</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my clothes feel soft</li>
            <li>My face is so soft.</li>
            <li>All natural soap that leaves you feeling fresh and clean and with no build up of soap scum in the tub!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Living in Minnesota, in the winter my hands get pretty dry, cracked and sometimes to the point they will bleed.  </li>
            <li>I use this mixed with water in a spray bottle to clean everything; it really is endless as to what you can use it for.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll never go back to your old soap.</li>
            <li>And when I use it on my hands if they happen to be a bit dry, it stings slightly which surprised me because it&#x27;s suppose to be very gentle and natural.  </li>
            <li>A real bargain because you only need a small amount to wash your whole body.</li>
            <li>Several organic oils make up this short list of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>generally had been using shampoos and winter before last and this winter</li>
            <li>No weird or harsh chemicals and never a need to feel guilty for using questionable products on your most precious family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have long and thick hair, so I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t feel clean with this, but that hasn&#x27;t been the case.</li>
            <li>My young daughter started getting very dry hands last winter.  </li>

            <li> The lavender is my favorite, but the other varieties are great as well.</li>
            <li> an aside, even though this is a review for the lavender scent, I also often use the tea tree for household uses and it leaves things smelling very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and pleasant, and no residue is left on the skin.</li>
            <li> I always feel super clean and it rinses easily,</li>
            <li> I like the squeaky clean feel</li>
            <li> -it lathers but doesnt seem to clean.</li>
            <li> I could was camping utensils with it, brush my teeth with it, shampoo with it, clean my body</li>
            <li> Nowadays, I use it for bathing because I like being squeaky clean without a filmy residue.  </li>
            <li> It lathers exceptionally well, has a light scent, and only a small amount is needed to create a wonderful lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation?</li>
            <li> have loved Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps since that day but after having tried them all, I stick with the peppermint only - to me</li>
            <li> i use it for shampoo, i have fine limp hair and this is great.</li>
            <li> It is a fresh and clean smell.</li>
            <li> I have used nothing but the lavender or the baby liquid castile on all three of my children since they were getting their very first bathes.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a great idea as a previous reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> please dont get it in or near your eyes because this \\&quot;organic soap\\&quot; has probably caused many emergency room visits.</li>
            <li> We dilute it down to 1 part soap 3 parts water, and it works great in the pumps and makes the cost really reasonable for having to wash 50 hands 10 times a day!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve never used for anything but a body wash, I have compared it to other body washes, and have found that Bronner&#x27;s is superior.  </li>
            <li> I was so glad to be able to use one with a slight scent of lavendar.  </li>
            <li> This soap is all natural, lots of suds and easy on your water system.  </li>
            <li> Very very itchy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This review is for the lavender which is almost our first fav</li>
            <li> but our first fav is the almond</li>
            <li> First time buyer</li>
            <li> cost scared me a bit at first, but you are supposed to dilute this concentrated soap 1:4 or 1:5</li>
            <li> Thanks, Doc Bronner&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I really liked the other citrus type, but lavender not so much.</li>
            <li> The container is large.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The purity and organic contents really appeal to me, too.  </li>
            <li> Is this price for real?</li>
            <li> A friend of mine suggested it looked like I had just put shampoo in my hair and not rinsed it out very well.</li>
            <li> and I had to take a shower with real soap-Ivory,Irish spring, Dial, Etc..afterwards.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the addition of  hemp as much as the one with just lavender, so</li>
            <li> I got a soap foamer to dispense it, which really helps...  </li>
            <li> The packaging and appearance looked genuine, but the product does not have the same working properties, smell, etc.</li>
            <li> Very calming and relaxing in the shower.  </li>
            <li> You do not need to use much either, it foams very well.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to buy it as long as I live.</li>
            <li> and I give it five stars because i used it to clean my shower and it removed soap scum and my shower has never looked better.</li>
            <li> It only takes a drop for a rich lather.</li>
            <li> I never felt clean especially when sweaty after exercising.</li>
            <li> use code KAL996 to get free $10 towards any first purchase at the iherb site, over $40, through end of March, hurry!&lt;br /&gt; or  $5 off any other purchase, any time&lt;br /&gt;code</li>
            <li> It is more watery than a typical shampoo or hand soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have at least one soap on the market that gives me absolutely nothing to worry about.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower mainly</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I also use it for washing their hair, as babies need something gentle for their sensitive scalps.  </li>
            <li> The product last a long time since its concentrated , you&#x27;ll save money buy not buying so many products through out the year</li>
            <li> But I felt like I didn&#x27;t feel clean for as long, and didn&#x27;t continue smelling nice for as long as with other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have looked carefully (don&#x27;t appear to be able to return), but at least from this supplier on Amazon, I&#x27;d strongly advise against purchasing Dr. Bronners from BeautyOnline.com.</li>
            <li> --I think I may have been able to find a less expensive way to purchase if I had really shopped around, but I liked the convenience this way.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the smell, i didn&#x27;t mind it as much at first</li>
            <li> This has fixed ALL of my soap allergy issues!</li>
            <li> and my hands have never been so soft!  </li>
            <li> I had a current comparison bottle from a big box retail, and have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for many years - never had one that smelled like linseed oil and foamed up like commercial soap....</li>
            <li> Always high quality, multiple uses, no hidden ingredients, gentle on skin, dishes, septic tanks and sewer systems.</li>
            <li> The pure castile soap line comes in several scents and can be used for shampoo, body wash, bathing baby, laundry, etc.</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised at how \\&quot;strong\\&quot; this soap smells.  </li>
            <li> Goes twice as far</li>
            <li> I also use this on my eight year old.</li>
            <li> I just decided to look elsewhere for natural shampoo that will work without additional steps.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my clothes feel soft</li>
            <li> My face is so soft.</li>
            <li> All natural soap that leaves you feeling fresh and clean and with no build up of soap scum in the tub!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Living in Minnesota, in the winter my hands get pretty dry, cracked and sometimes to the point they will bleed.  </li>
            <li> I use this mixed with water in a spray bottle to clean everything; it really is endless as to what you can use it for.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never go back to your old soap.</li>
            <li> And when I use it on my hands if they happen to be a bit dry, it stings slightly which surprised me because it&#x27;s suppose to be very gentle and natural.  </li>
            <li> A real bargain because you only need a small amount to wash your whole body.</li>
            <li> Several organic oils make up this short list of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> generally had been using shampoos and winter before last and this winter</li>
            <li> No weird or harsh chemicals and never a need to feel guilty for using questionable products on your most precious family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair, so I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t feel clean with this, but that hasn&#x27;t been the case.</li>
            <li> My young daughter started getting very dry hands last winter.  </li>
            <li> But I am not sure it is strong enough to use to clean a full-on dirty tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The soap is very concentrated so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you save a bottle pour half of your new one in it and add water.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t affect its function, but does make it a little harder to control how much comes out.</li>
            <li> For the money you paid, I can&#x27;t complain, although it is nothing special and the lavender smell does not last long as the expensive lotion/cleanser does.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of expensive, fancy shower gels, and really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was a horse/mule packer in the Sierra Nevada a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> (&amp;#34;Scrubbie&amp;#34; is not much of a masculine word, but, hey ... )</li>
            <li> This product can go a long way if you use a sponge or scrubbie!  </li>
            <li> I have brownish-blond hair that is long, very straight, and thin.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Same with my little one.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love this soap, as it is so pure and no added  horrific chemicals whose name I cannot pronounce, but .....</li>
            <li> I happen to be partial to the lavendar</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  </li>
            <li> It rates extremely well in the cosmetics database of toxic products (1 on a scale of 0 - 10).  </li>
            <li> It can save you a lot of money, replacing other products with this product.</li>
            <li> the other hand, I have used this to wash off the tiles and the tub.</li>
            <li> I also had itching and small welts on my body the last time I used it.</li>
            <li> I was not hesitant to use it in a stream or lake due to its organic, chemical-free pureness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy any other soap again.</li>
            <li> it really is harsh on my skin and seems to dry it out.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with pure ingredients and a lavender scent.</li>
            <li> Hemp as it&#x27;s much less of a carbon footprint</li>
            <li> ill re- purchase just the lavender in the future; but sent really is a personal preference .</li>
            <li> , I started getting a dry and flaky scalp pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Little too perfumey for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t prepared for is how thin it is.</li>
            <li> I tried using this for a few days as shampoo, and my hair looked unwashed.</li>
            <li> I used this garbage a few times</li>
            <li> No more itching after showering and a little dab is all it takes!</li>
            <li> But know you can get a way with using a very little.  </li>
            <li> It also takes very little of the product (compared to others that take a lot of soap to do the job).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with skin irritation caused by beauty products in the past.</li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> For the past couple of months I have had skin irritations after I shower.</li>
            <li> and I keep a small bottle of the peppermint and a small bottle of the lavendar in each of our two showers.  </li>
            <li> If you have children PLease Please-put this stuff where it belongs-in the garbage,and be smart try to speak with an actual user before even thinking about using this horrible demons concoction.</li>
            <li> doctor\\&quot; He was also supposed to be a little bit crazy i.e. the fanatical religious label.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I need conditioner too, as it doesn&#x27;t feel silly.</li>
            <li> At least, that&#x27;s how it seems to me.  </li>
            <li> No moe hives, no more itchy scalp, nothing!</li>
            <li> However, this price is ridiculous -</li>
            <li> A tad expensive though.</li>
            <li> Dont believe all the fake reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!  </li>
            <li> This vile stuff burns the eyes so bad it can make a Bronx born tough guy(me)</li>
            <li> I felt like I was suffocating from the \\&quot;vapors\\&quot; and it caused a very unpleasant burning sensation in my nose like I was smelling caustic vapors or something.  </li>
            <li> (She was too polite to say that it just looked dirty.)</li>
            <li> I must have been crazy to use a so called soap,that is also cleans,floors,dishes,laundry etc.</li>
            <li> to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was.</li>
            <li> At least for me, this is an awful product.</li>
            <li> but it got really annoying after a while.</li>
            <li> For me, it was horrible as a shampoo.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was a bit surprised at how \\&quot;strong\\&quot; this soap smells.  I was hoping after diluting it with water while bathing with it, it would be more of a hint of lavender.  And when I use it on my hands if they happen to be a bit dry, it stings slightly which surprised me because it&#x27;s suppose to be very gentle and natural.  I also tried it out in the shower and while it worked well as a body soap, I will NEVER use it on my face again.  I felt like I was suffocating from the \\&quot;vapors\\&quot; and it caused a very unpleasant burning sensation in my nose like I was smelling caustic vapors or something.  I&#x27;m going to stick with the Dr. Bonners baby soap as I&#x27;ve never had a problem with that version.  I never thought to use it in the foaming hand soap pumps though...that&#x27;s a great idea as a previous reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 15 years ago in the peppermint flavor. I use it for everything, including washing my dogs. Just tried the Lavender and it&#x27;s just as wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love!  But know you can get a way with using a very little.  If you save a bottle pour half of your new one in it and add water.  Goes twice as far and you get twice as clean!  I use it as my daily body wash and to wash my maltese dogs when the doggy shampoo runs out.</li>
            <li> I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap every time I shower. It lathers exceptionally well, has a light scent, and only a small amount is needed to create a wonderful lather.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for a lot of things. I used it as a shower soap, bath soak and even as cat shampoo sometimes. I like the squeaky clean feel so i liked it. The only problem is the smell, i didn&#x27;t mind it as much at first but it got really annoying after a while. I really liked the other citrus type, but lavender not so much. I suggest you go to a local supermarket and smell each type and see which one works best for you before you buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of expensive, fancy shower gels, and really enjoy it.  It smells wonderful, but the scent doesn&#x27;t stick around to interfere with perfumes, etc.  The purity and organic contents really appeal to me, too.  Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is all my family uses.  It rates extremely well in the cosmetics database of toxic products (1 on a scale of 0 - 10).  However, this price is ridiculous - you can get this at grocery and health food stores for $12 - $14 each.  Is this price for real?</li>
            <li> Fabulous Soap. Excellent bacteriostatic properties. Excellent cleanser. Get some.</li>
            <li> At least for me, this is an awful product. I get dandruff, every time I use it to wash my hair. I got rid of it.</li>
            <li> I had wanted to buy this product for quite some time now, but was always too thrifty to buy it from the stores. When I saw the price for 2 bottles on Amazon, I jumped at it. The product really is as good as it claims. It has so many uses, you can replace a number of products in your household. It also takes very little of the product (compared to others that take a lot of soap to do the job). It can save you a lot of money, replacing other products with this product. It works for household cleaning, hand soap, dish soap, shampoo, toothpaste, and so much more. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t prepared for is how thin it is. It is more watery than a typical shampoo or hand soap. Doesn&#x27;t affect its function, but does make it a little harder to control how much comes out.</li>
            <li> This soap contains natural ingredients and smells great.  I also use this on my eight year old.</li>
            <li> We all use these soaps.  This review is for the lavender which is almost our first fav but our first fav is the almond but they are so close that we would make it a tie.  They both smell great and clean wonderful and rinse off so easy!</li>
            <li> My skin is loving it. No more itching after showering and a little dab is all it takes!</li>
            <li> I love purchasing fair trade items, especially when they are as great a product as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  The pure castile soap line comes in several scents and can be used for shampoo, body wash, bathing baby, laundry, etc. It&#x27;s inspiring just to read the bottles!  Wonderful product and the only drawback is that it may clog dispenser bottles, but I have learned to work around that.</li>
            <li> Great smell and cleans well. You can use this stuff on anything and everything. I like it because it is natural and not harsh, plus good for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up !!</li>
            <li> Always high quality, multiple uses, no hidden ingredients, gentle on skin, dishes, septic tanks and sewer systems. NO harmful to environment.  Smells lovely! Cleans and rinses well.  You&#x27;ll never go back to your old soap.</li>
            <li> Someone had recommended this to me for shampoo. For me, it was horrible as a shampoo. I have brownish-blond hair that is long, very straight, and thin. I tried using this for a few days as shampoo, and my hair looked unwashed. A friend of mine suggested it looked like I had just put shampoo in my hair and not rinsed it out very well. (She was too polite to say that it just looked dirty.) When looking for tips online, I saw someone say that it is helpful to do a lemon water rinse after using this as shampoo. I didn&#x27;t try that. I just decided to look elsewhere for natural shampoo that will work without additional steps. (And yes, I have heard that Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has a specific line of products now aimed as shampoo. But I am leaving that as a last resort.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a body wash, it was alright. But I felt like I didn&#x27;t feel clean for as long, and didn&#x27;t continue smelling nice for as long as with other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I have used this to wash off the tiles and the tub. It works pretty well as a maintenance kind of soap--to prevent build up of dirt in the shower and bath. But I am not sure it is strong enough to use to clean a full-on dirty tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is biodegradable. I plan to take it with me on camping trips, because that is when I don&#x27;t care quite as much if I smell good or look all that clean.</li>
            <li> use code KAL996 to get free $10 towards any first purchase at the iherb site, over $40, through end of March, hurry!&lt;br /&gt; or  $5 off any other purchase, any time&lt;br /&gt;code: KAL996</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with skin irritation caused by beauty products in the past. No more. I have switched entirely to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, for soap, shampoo, face wash, toothpaste, etc.! I am a convert. The smell is light and pleasant, and no residue is left on the skin. I love this product and will continue to buy it as long as I live.</li>
            <li> For the past couple of months I have had skin irritations after I shower. I broke out in hives all over my chest and back.. Very very itchy. After trying different over the counter body soap and shampoos I finally turned to this stuff because I remembered my mother in law always has it in her shower. This has fixed ALL of my soap allergy issues! No moe hives, no more itchy scalp, nothing! I also feel very clean after using it. The soap is very concentrated so a little goes a long way. I have long and thick hair, so I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t feel clean with this, but that hasn&#x27;t been the case. It gives my hair a lot of volume! My only complaint is that I need conditioner too, as it doesn&#x27;t feel silly. I ordered the Dr. Bronners lavender conditioner and hopefully it works as well as the shampoo.</li>
            <li> For the money you paid, I can&#x27;t complain, although it is nothing special and the lavender smell does not last long as the expensive lotion/cleanser does.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased this soap.  I love it...except, I cannot use it on my hair...it doesnt wash out easy....but the fragrance is very nice and it is concentrated...</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my clothes feel soft and I enjoy the smell it leaves behind. It is a fresh and clean smell.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap.  I support anything made for. Hemp as it&#x27;s much less of a carbon footprint and it just seems to be better all around. A tad expensive though.</li>
            <li> All natural soap that leaves you feeling fresh and clean and with no build up of soap scum in the tub!  A real bargain because you only need a small amount to wash your whole body.</li>
            <li> I bought a sample size at Target as I had never heard of this soap before. Well, after trying it, I think I could be a spokesperson for it! It only takes a drop for a rich lather. My face is so soft. Both of us can&#x27;t use regular soap in our private areas but both of us can use this. Very happy I stumbled on this soap and glad I can get it from Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps for about ten years, ever since my daughter bought me a bottle to try.  I happen to be partial to the lavendar (but I&#x27;m an all-things-lavendar kinda gal).  This stuff smells like lavendar ought to smell....like it smells when you break a twig of living, growing lavendar.  I love it.  My daughter and my husband prefer the Peppermint, which I also like.  I use the peppermint more in the summers because it&#x27;s so refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed about Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap.  While I&#x27;ve never used for anything but a body wash, I have compared it to other body washes, and have found that Bronner&#x27;s is superior.  It&#x27;s more soapy and the smell is more authentic.  It&#x27;s not all tarted up with perfumes.  At least, that&#x27;s how it seems to me.  In any event, I love this stuff and I keep a small bottle of the peppermint and a small bottle of the lavendar in each of our two showers.  I&#x27;ve never found anything I like better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bronner&#x27;s castile soaps for over 20 years now.  It made perfect sense to use this at bathtime when my babies came 8 years ago.  I have used nothing but the lavender or the baby liquid castile on all three of my children since they were getting their very first bathes.  I like the lavender especially as it has a calming scent and just makes them smell delicious!  Of course it&#x27;s always been diluted for this purpose.  I also use it for washing their hair, as babies need something gentle for their sensitive scalps.  No weird or harsh chemicals and never a need to feel guilty for using questionable products on your most precious family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, even though this is a review for the lavender scent, I also often use the tea tree for household uses and it leaves things smelling very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Natural and wonderful fragrance.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This soap is great!  I cleaned my wood floors with it.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over ten years. I just love it.</li>
            <li> This is safe for all of your family&#x27;s skin, and you can use it to make shampoo, body wash, foaming hand soap, laundry soap, face wash, and household cleaner!  I love it.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff.  We use it at our preschooler in foaming soap pumps.  We dilute it down to 1 part soap 3 parts water, and it works great in the pumps and makes the cost really reasonable for having to wash 50 hands 10 times a day!</li>
            <li> Dont believe all the fake reviews for this product.I must have been crazy to use a so called soap,that is also cleans,floors,dishes,laundry etc. I dont even think this stuff is soap-it lathers but doesnt seem to clean. I used this garbage a few times and I had to take a shower with real soap-Ivory,Irish spring, Dial, Etc..afterwards. I never felt clean especially when sweaty after exercising. This fraudulent product was supposedly concocted by a \\&quot;phony doctor\\&quot; He was also supposed to be a little bit crazy i.e. the fanatical religious label. Also it says \\&quot;unscented baby mild\\&quot;-but please dont get it in or near your eyes because this \\&quot;organic soap\\&quot; has probably caused many emergency room visits. This vile stuff burns the eyes so bad it can make a Bronx born tough guy(me) almost cry! It has also caused itchy scalp and dandruff everytime I used it(about 5X). I also had itching and small welts on my body the last time I used it. Probably because this non soap wasnt able to clean off the bacterial buildup after sweating. I havent used this abomination in about 2 months until today,when I decided to try it one last time.(big mistake). If you have children PLease Please-put this stuff where it belongs-in the garbage,and be smart try to speak with an actual user before even thinking about using this horrible demons concoction.</li>
            <li> First time buyer and I give it five stars because i used it to clean my shower and it removed soap scum and my shower has never looked better. I didn&#x27;t think it would work but it surprisingly exceeded my expectations.  I&#x27;ll never use any chemical cleaners again. The hemp lavender is terrific. I didn&#x27;t use gloves and after cleaning my hands were moisturized and felt like I had just had a paraffin treatment. Thank you Amazon and Dr. Bronner!</li>
            <li> I use this mixed with water in a spray bottle to clean everything; it really is endless as to what you can use it for. I don&#x27;t like the addition of  hemp as much as the one with just lavender, so ill re- purchase just the lavender in the future; but sent really is a personal preference . The product last a long time since its concentrated , you&#x27;ll save money buy not buying so many products through out the year</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this soap, as it is so pure and no added  horrific chemicals whose name I cannot pronounce, but ..... it really is harsh on my skin and seems to dry it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was a horse/mule packer in the Sierra Nevada a long time ago.  I could was camping utensils with it, brush my teeth with it, shampoo with it, clean my body and it even kept flies off the face of my horse!  I was not hesitant to use it in a stream or lake due to its organic, chemical-free pureness.  Nowadays, I use it for bathing because I like being squeaky clean without a filmy residue.  Note:  This product can go a long way if you use a sponge or scrubbie!  (&amp;#34;Scrubbie&amp;#34; is not much of a masculine word, but, hey ... )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve a friend who owns a spa and recommended this to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is pretty awesome. A few drops (5-6) to lather up and will last my whole body. I always feel super clean and it rinses easily, so, no residue being left on me. This means shorter shower time, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally had been using shampoos and winter before last and this winter, I started getting a dry and flaky scalp pretty bad. I started using this instead of shampoos. Same deal as with using it as a body scrub. Just a 3-4 drips produces a big lather. Within 3 days, all of my scalp issues went away and have not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells great and last forever.  I got a soap foamer to dispense it, which really helps...  No complaints here! Great!</li>
            <li> We use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap and have for over a year.  Amazon has the best pricing, better even than natural stores in our area and you can&#x27;t beat Prime shipping.  This soap is all natural, lots of suds and easy on your water system.  It smells wonderful!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap, great for sensitive skin and gets hair squeaky clean.  You will need to use conditioner though.&lt;br /&gt;I order this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for years and remains consistently excellent!  The lavender is my favorite, but the other varieties are great as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients. What a nut job this guy was personally! I don&#x27;t appreciate all the religious rants, which make no sense, on this product. Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation? I&#x27;m returning the product because I don&#x27;t want to support whack jobs like this and his family, who continue to keep the label as a memorial to Dr. Bronner. The only thing it&#x27;s a memorial to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was. They would all do well to enroll in a business ethics 101 course. I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label. Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  What a shame, I actually wanted to buy this product.  http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/dr-bronner-s-crazy-ass-magic-soap-labels-18606</li>
            <li> This pure-castile is the best.  The lavender scent is wonderful; the almond scent is too!</li>
            <li> This soap smells great and is very gentle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in Minnesota, in the winter my hands get pretty dry, cracked and sometimes to the point they will bleed.  My young daughter started getting very dry hands last winter.  I can handle it after all of these years, but had to try something different when I saw her affected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this stuff for well over a year and my hands have never been so soft!  Same with my little one.  I love this stuff and have used it ever since!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost scared me a bit at first, but you are supposed to dilute this concentrated soap 1:4 or 1:5 so it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have at least one soap on the market that gives me absolutely nothing to worry about.  Thanks, Doc Bronner&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years - after staying at a retreat in Texas where this product was used in the bathrooms of the cabins.  When I asked what the awesome product was, the owners happily wrote the info down for me and raved how good it is and how long they had been using it... even bathing their dogs with it too.&lt;br /&gt;I have loved Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps since that day but after having tried them all, I stick with the peppermint only - to me it is the best.</li>
            <li> I should have looked carefully (don&#x27;t appear to be able to return), but at least from this supplier on Amazon, I&#x27;d strongly advise against purchasing Dr. Bronners from BeautyOnline.com. The packaging and appearance looked genuine, but the product does not have the same working properties, smell, etc. I realize that not every batch is identical but the difference was unmistakable. I had a current comparison bottle from a big box retail, and have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for many years - never had one that smelled like linseed oil and foamed up like commercial soap....</li>
            <li> Shower gel, house cleaning, sometimes even as a deep cleanser shampoo (it gets rid of all the excess oil.) And love the smell of Lavender:).</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves this soap.  She tried it because she read the ingredients and liked the ingredients.  She noticed that her acne got better.  So happy we found this soap.  It should be sold in more stores.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Lavendar liquid soap is wonderful.  I am allergic to so many things, but not to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps.  I was so glad to be able to use one with a slight scent of lavendar.  Very calming and relaxing in the shower.  You do not need to use much either, it foams very well.  Cleans and rinses easily.  Several organic oils make up this short list of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is the only body wash I will use from now on and it is the best. Never dries out my skin and smells great--I think I may have been able to find a less expensive way to purchase if I had really shopped around, but I liked the convenience this way.</li>
            <li> Little too perfumey for me.</li>
            <li> love this soap. i use it for shampoo, i have fine limp hair and this is great. also i rince my hair with apple cider vinager, i finally have body to my hair and not as breakage. look on google as how to use the apple cider vinager. and try the bronners for your shampoo..</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with pure ingredients and a lavender scent.</li>
            <li> Burns on any sort of open wound or scratch of the skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE this soap. I use it in the shower mainly but I plan to use it on my floors. The lavender scent is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!  I&#x27;ll never buy any other soap again. The container is large. I recommend buying some type of a pump container to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for cleaning and general use hand washing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since the 70&#x27;s and have baby skin on an old man and looking good at 63.</li>
