            <li>My doctor recommended it and she was right!</li>
            <li>It keeps my face fresh, clean and pimple-free.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has a lot of different vendors so make sure you get the most bundle of soap for the cheapest price.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the unscented Aveeno bar soap for nearly a year now and love the results.  </li>
            <li>This Aveeno product will make you smile and your skin thank you.</li>
            <li>So glad this company offers this product today.</li>
            <li>On top of that mosquitoes, flies, no-seeums and any other flying insect that comes within a mile of me love me.</li>

            <li>Very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>use a lot of Aveeno products and even when I use the Aveeno Oatmeal bath powder that comes in individual envelopes (love it), I use this soap to relieve the itchiness of insect bites.</li>
            <li>I used to be skeptical of &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; bars, but this soap is perfect!</li>
            <li>This is something I remember from the 40&#x27;s when oatmeal baths were prescibed for certain conditions.</li>
            <li>Being pregnant and having skin issues, I ultimately switched to using Aveeno bar soap to calm my irritated itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>Really moisturizing, pleasing non-intrusive smell, rather oat-y.</li>
            <li>Gentle for face.</li>
            <li>that this soap is now available in 6 bars instead of just 8 bars but costs the same per bar.</li>
            <li>My whole household uses it.</li>
            <li>This is gentle and fragrence-free.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I like the soap; it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>The price is actually a bit lower than I was used to paying at a store, and the delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all Aveeno products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for any age.</li>
            <li>But if its for temporary use for skin problems,I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have to buy it on Amazon because every store where I live has stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>I have used Aveeno moisturizing bar as my only soap for 38 years, since my first eczema breakout.</li>
            <li>Oatmeal stinks lol, but A++ for this product.  </li>
            <li>Aveeno Clear Complexion Cleansing Bar, 3.5 Ounce (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this soap delivers.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft.</li>
            <li>But not for my sensitive face which has an eczema.</li>
            <li>i have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done it all, and have the old Acne scars to prove it.</li>
            <li>But after awhile I started to get an irritation on my chest and little bumps on my arms,I switched to a stronger soap ( lever 2000 original ) and the rash/bumps disappeared.</li>
            <li>It is the only cleanser gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It doesnt leave my skin dry and tight, like many other face soaps and as long as I kept mine in a soap dish, I didnt have any issue with it dissolving quickly...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to try the coconut papaya soap next, but I&#x27;m not sure about the natural scent reacting with fibro, so have purchased the lotion to try first on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>This soap doesn&#x27;t dig deep as far as a &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; goes.</li>
            <li>Aveeno oatmeal bar soap and Aveeno fragrance free lotion are products I use everyday!!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, I had to use at least one whole bar of this soap in order to write a really informed review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Aveeno before, and when another name brand bar soap for sensitive skin was still giving me issues, I only thought of Aveeno next.  </li>
            <li>Soap does not dry my skin or leave any residue.</li>

            <li> I use this soap every single day, and have been doing so for the last 14 years.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Works wonders for dry itchy skin and eczema,.</li>
            <li> It stopped my dry skin itch.  </li>
            <li> It calms and soothes dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Keep it dry</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry well</li>
            <li> But this one won&#x27;t dry out skin -</li>
            <li> Even Ivory soap, which I used to use religiously, leaves the skin feeling tight, dry, and flaky.  </li>
            <li> This soap totally agrees with my body plus, as another reviewer mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin tight.</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t last quite as long as soap usually does.</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia and must be careful what I use or else</li>
            <li> I ordered some and from now on, I will not use anything other than this products for cleansing.</li>
            <li> and it actually DOES moisturize as it promises and no more itching back/chest after showering.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need any other face products or creams or astringents.</li>
            <li> It cleanses without drying out and making your skin feel tight.</li>
            <li> I was using this for a few months because i had eczema,and it worked well.</li>
            <li> was hoping this would help keep my feet from being dry and cracked but made them worse</li>
            <li> Over the past six months, it has become hard to find in brick and mortar stores, so I am so grateful to find it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This soap is hard to find in stores at all locations, so I buy bulk to ensure I never run out.</li>
            <li> I looked up \\&quot;heat rash\\&quot; on the internet and common treatments and this bar soap came up.</li>
            <li> I battled for 25 years with cortisone creams and other expensive lotions and bathing procedures.  </li>
            <li> If you have bad Acne of any type, use this twice a day at least, and you&#x27;ll see a difference in a few days.</li>
            <li> Non scented, non irritating cleansing bar.  </li>
            <li> At times it is difficult to find and it can be pricy also.</li>
            <li> and then i start itching terribly after showering and have to switch to a different soap.</li>
            <li> and it won&#x27;t go bad.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works wonders for dry itchy skin and eczema,. I highly recommend all Aveeno products.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, I had to use at least one whole bar of this soap in order to write a really informed review. During the summer months, my face will become inflammed with \\&quot;heat rash\\&quot; and for the longest time I had no idea how to treat the problem. I used many cleansers for sensitive acne prone skin but nothing was working. I looked up \\&quot;heat rash\\&quot; on the internet and common treatments and this bar soap came up. I ordered some and from now on, I will not use anything other than this products for cleansing. It doesnt leave my skin dry and tight, like many other face soaps and as long as I kept mine in a soap dish, I didnt have any issue with it dissolving quickly...I believe that this soap is also helping with my occasional breakouts and that is always a plus!</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  It stopped my dry skin itch.  My doctor recommended it and she was right!</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  Jennifer Anniston gets it right.  Soap does not dry my skin or leave any residue.</li>
            <li> It is what the doctor ordered, and that&#x27;s not a joke. The non-perfume, non-addative formula is what I have to use now. The product is a cleansing experience that leaves my skin irritation free and clean. The oatmeal that is in this product is known for soothing itch causing reactions. This is something I remember from the 40&#x27;s when oatmeal baths were prescibed for certain conditions. I will continue to use this product on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> it perfect price..im very happy with it</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t that pleased with the soap or the smell.  I didn&#x27;t feel it did what it claimed to do.  Will not reorder again.</li>
            <li> My mom broke out in a rash, but my son didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> good moisturizing soap</li>
            <li> Being pregnant and having skin issues, I ultimately switched to using Aveeno bar soap to calm my irritated itchy skin.  I&#x27;ve used Aveeno before, and when another name brand bar soap for sensitive skin was still giving me issues, I only thought of Aveeno next.  It does what it says.  It calms and soothes dry itchy skin.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizing, pleasing non-intrusive smell, rather oat-y. They won&#x27;t last quite as long as soap usually does.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  It does not produce the amount of lather you&#x27;d expect from a bar soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the unscented Aveeno bar soap for nearly a year now and love the results.  I have fibromyalgia and must be careful what I use or else pay the price with pain.  This soap totally agrees with my body plus, as another reviewer mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin tight. Even Ivory soap, which I used to use religiously, leaves the skin feeling tight, dry, and flaky.  The Aveeno is especially great for sensitive areas, helping to moisturize, which is great for menopause females.  I&#x27;d really like to try the coconut papaya soap next, but I&#x27;m not sure about the natural scent reacting with fibro, so have purchased the lotion to try first on my arms and legs.  Will let you know.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this soap delivers. No rashes, and safe to use in all areas of body. This soap is hard to find in stores at all locations, so I buy bulk to ensure I never run out.</li>
            <li> I have supersensitive skin. On top of that mosquitoes, flies, no-seeums and any other flying insect that comes within a mile of me love me. I think they send alerts out to the troops! lol. (Ugh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a lot of Aveeno products and even when I use the Aveeno Oatmeal bath powder that comes in individual envelopes (love it), I use this soap to relieve the itchiness of insect bites. It&#x27;s fragrance-free which is the only way I can use any products. Very gentle on the skin. It does not melt (disappear, I don&#x27;t know what to call this)  if you put it in a soap dish and shake out the water. Keep it dry and it lasts a long time! I love it.</li>
            <li> I use this soap every single day, and have been doing so for the last 14 years.  It keeps my face fresh, clean and pimple-free.  Highly recommend it for any age.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft. Oatmeal stinks lol, but A++ for this product.  I can&#x27;t wait til I see a months progress</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 1980. At times it is difficult to find and it can be pricy also. When I bought it in bulk, I saved about four dollars per bar. I still have a lot left to use but it&#x27;s a great deal and a great savings. The product comes wrapped in plastic inside the box so it&#x27;s airtight and it won&#x27;t go bad. If I have been using this product for 32 years, and has to be good.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Gentle for face.</li>
            <li> This soap causes no allergic reactions and makes your skin silky smooth. I use this soap on my entire body except my face.  I use [[ASIN:B003NS56BY Aveeno Clear Complexion Cleansing Bar, 3.5 Ounce (Pack of 3)]] on my face which is acne prone.&lt;br /&gt;Love that this soap is now available in 6 bars instead of just 8 bars but costs the same per bar.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Smooth bar of soap. Pleasant to use. Lasts a long time. Very lightly scented.</li>
            <li> one of the simplest staples for your skin</li>
            <li> Great soap for those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Oatmeal leaves the skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> was hoping this would help keep my feet from being dry and cracked but made them worse</li>
            <li> The best soap for sensitive skin like I have.  Sometimes I get rashes and this is the only soap I can use.  And seasonally I get chlorine skin after going swimming in a pool almost daily.  It is really excellent soap.</li>
            <li> Positively satisfied! I&#x27;ve been using this soap for decades!! Anyone with allergies should try. Aveeno oatmeal bar soap and Aveeno fragrance free lotion are products I use everyday!! Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> Looking for a non-scented, textured soap that won&#x27;t make you itch or blotch? This Aveeno product will make you smile and your skin thank you. Love the multi-pack this comes as, too.</li>
            <li> only concern is that it gets soggy from the water. Doesn&#x27;t dry well</li>
            <li> This soap is good for my body, it moisturizes and exfoliate my skin. Good soap to use specially in winter season. But not for my sensitive face which has an eczema.</li>
            <li> Love this soap and so does my husband.  Non-drying and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I have used Aveeno moisturizing bar as my only soap for 38 years, since my first eczema breakout. It is the only cleanser gentle enough for my sensitive skin. My whole household uses it. Over the past six months, it has become hard to find in brick and mortar stores, so I am so grateful to find it through Amazon. The price is actually a bit lower than I was used to paying at a store, and the delivery was quick. A+++</li>
            <li> Awesome, great for anyone with eczema or severe skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> i have really sensitive skin. soaps that claim to &#x27;moisturize&#x27; skin never do that for me. i&#x27;ll use them for a week or so and then i start itching terribly after showering and have to switch to a different soap. this aveeno has been great. ive been using it for a couple of months now and it actually DOES moisturize as it promises and no more itching back/chest after showering. great product. will buy again.</li>
            <li> Aveeno products are some of the best on the market. This is gentle and fragrence-free. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap ever made. It cleanses without drying out and making your skin feel tight. I have to buy it on Amazon because every store where I live has stopped carrying it. Amazon has a lot of different vendors so make sure you get the most bundle of soap for the cheapest price.</li>
            <li> I was using this for a few months because i had eczema,and it worked well. But after awhile I started to get an irritation on my chest and little bumps on my arms,I switched to a stronger soap ( lever 2000 original ) and the rash/bumps disappeared. I had Folliculitus..This soap doesn&#x27;t dig deep as far as a &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; goes. But if its for temporary use for skin problems,I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve used Aveeno Bar Oatmeal bar for fourty-five years.  So glad this company offers this product today. Thanks</li>
            <li> BEST SOAP YOU CAN PUT ON YOUR FACE!!! QUICK SERVICE AND GOOD PRICE A PLUS!!!</li>
            <li> I have eczema, mostly from shampoos and soaps. I battled for 25 years with cortisone creams and other expensive lotions and bathing procedures.  Now I can shower every day without a worry. This soap is as good as it gets, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. My skin is clean and in superb condition.  I swear by the Aveeno shampoo as well.  I&#x27;m not as confident about Aveeno conditioner, but I&#x27;ve yet to find any hair conditioner that doesn&#x27;t cause some degree of eczema.</li>
            <li> The bomb. Can&#x27;t find it anymore in the drug stores, Target, Walmart, Kmart, etc. Aveeno nailed it with the bar soap. Excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Non scented, non irritating cleansing bar.  Great for allergic and sensitive skin.  Made by a trusted source, their bath powder treats chickenpox irritations.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap for Acne or Eczema every made! If you suffer from Cystic or any kind of Acne, this is the best. I have used it for 8 years, tried others and always go back to this. Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you, it&#x27;s all what a product contains. I never have break-outs anymore. I suffered for years with Acne. BAR SOAP for Acne works 99% better than liquid soaps. I&#x27;ve done it all, and have the old Acne scars to prove it. If you have bad Acne of any type, use this twice a day at least, and you&#x27;ll see a difference in a few days. You don&#x27;t need any other face products or creams or astringents. I pay $2.97 at Walmart. Aveeno makes the stronger bar, it&#x27;s great, too. But this one won&#x27;t dry out skin - I used to be skeptical of &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; bars, but this soap is perfect! For Eczema I use this on problem areas, and Baby Shampoo for a body wash - Baby Magic, Walmart brand, whichever (Baby Magic smells best).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this simple.  I like the soap; it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry and rinses easily. Good price at the vendor I purchased it from.</li>
