            <li>Worked great on my son&#x27;s first home-hair cut!</li>

            <li>Lol luckilly my GFI is right there and dont have to go to electrical panel to reset breaker.</li>
            <li>These clippers appeared to have good reviews and they were right!  </li>
            <li>Customers were very satisfied as long as they are happy &amp; pleased I am also very pleased and confident in the product .</li>
            <li>Taking into consideration that I&#x27;m taking a considerable amount of time on each haircut, that&#x27;s very good for the listed price.</li>
            <li>Love the assortment of blade guides.</li>
            <li>give you around 10 piece of numbers and a CD to how to cut hair :)</li>
            <li>, the product is awesome ,with all the different attachments my styles are limitless.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>My trash can has gotten more use of them.</li>
            <li>They come with many guards and a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>we are both satisfied with the performance and as you get used to</li>
            <li>Have to be sure to slam power from on to off or the clippers will trip my gfi.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s easy to control it, ok.</li>
            <li>this machine works very well and the dvd is good also...</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Otherwise my husband says they work fine.</li>
            <li>and they work fine.</li>
            <li>Scissors that come with the item are cheap and do not work well</li>
            <li>its easy to use and clean...</li>
            <li>Material is cheap but does the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These clippers are great for those that like to cut their hair at home and don&#x27;t use daily.</li>
            <li>Now I give myself a hair cut whenever I need to for free....</li>
            <li>If you are expecting something on the professional level, spend more money and get better clippers.</li>
            <li>first pair have worked flawlessly for the past year or two.</li>
            <li>older model was a lot better that this set</li>
            <li>I guess so you won&#x27;t get sad if you mess up your kids hair :D :D .</li>
            <li>it got so hot that i almost burn my hand, my room was filled  with the smoke,and pluss</li>
            <li>The first one is still going strong after almost two years of consistent use.</li>
            <li>Smooth and fast.</li>
            <li>I went to Cuttys for a few years until I upgraded to &amp;#34;The Legendary Hutt&amp;#34; barbershop near the Coliseum.</li>
            <li>it goes pretty quick</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li>My old con-air clippers I got from walmart 3 yrs ago for 8 bucks work better than these and are much sharper.</li>
            <li>and it came in super fast and works very well!</li>
            <li>I would continue using my first set, but we&#x27;re remodeling</li>
            <li>I just used these for the first time on my husbands and sons hair.</li>
            <li>During the first hair cut, the clippers started SMOKING.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does get hot.</li>
            <li>First and foremost I&#x27;m from Jamaica, NY</li>
            <li>WOW this thing is super loud!!!!</li>
            <li>Have to adjust it to much just about ever time I use it .</li>
            <li>I ordered this because my boyfriend had a very crappy Conair kid</li>
            <li>When I turned it on it sounded really powerfull.</li>
            <li>It cuts really well</li>
            <li>Fast service and delivery</li>
            <li>it had a lot of power.it was a fast hair cut</li>
            <li>And does not cut hair very well either.  </li>
            <li>Just what I expected... Love it.</li>
            <li>It worked really well, giving me a whole new level in my barbing experience all together.</li>
            <li>Because of the price it&#x27;s not worth attempting a return process to spend more money.</li>
            <li>, all the accessories gives one a real professional feel while working with it.</li>
            <li>Brand new item, tried to cut my hair once</li>
            <li>Its very quiet and such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>id the middle, have to really slam the lever fast.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this set!</li>
            <li>If you clean it properly with the brush and use the oil every once in a while, it should even last years.</li>
            <li>When cutting my own hair, these clippers got too hot to hold way too fast</li>
            <li>I rated it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not a shiny silver like what&#x27;s shown in the pic more like a dull gray.</li>
            <li>The combs snap on solidly and everything works really well.</li>
            <li>old one I have</li>
            <li>a professional electric clipper does.</li>
            <li>DO not work well with thick hair, but work decent on face and for light trims.</li>
            <li>this hair cuter is very good, and it&#x27;s really hard to be broken.</li>
            <li>Certainly not using this in a confined space nor near my head atleast not without ear plugs!!!!</li>
            <li>These clippers do the basic of cutting hair and do great at it.</li>
            <li>clippers are not sharp and you cant shave with them.</li>
            <li>They are easy to hold and handle, many haircutting kits give your hands a weird feeling when using them for a little while</li>
            <li>Cool little clippers...works!</li>
            <li>After only 2 uses these clippers feel as thought they are years old.</li>
            <li>popping the fuse button on the wall I had to push reset 10 times in order to %70 finish a haircut, then got so hot that I was afraid to even try more, and it was constantly making click click</li>
            <li>The clipper haircutting function ok, but 2 of the combs (left ear taper and blending) were broken, and the cleaning brush didn&#x27;t came.</li>
            <li>Got a little hot since it took a while.</li>
            <li>Pressed for negative comments, I wish the power cord was a little more substantial, it does twist a bit.</li>
            <li>that went bad, after reading the reviews I was hoping this will perform good, but it did not.</li>
            <li>But that also means it is lighter and doesn&#x27;t drag and pull and much, so I can&#x27;t say how much of a negative it really is.</li>

            <li> these do what they promise to do-I use them to trim my facial whiskers when they get too long</li>
            <li> Using them on one men&#x27;s haircut after another, they last for about three without a long resting time.</li>
            <li> 1st haircut went fine but during the 2nd haircut the upper cutting blade flew off???</li>
            <li> this thing is so cheap as to be useless.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit longer than I expected to cut my hair and the oil container was open, spilling in the plastic package ,when I received it.</li>
            <li> but i drop it a few times,and 10 years later i found the same one.</li>
            <li> At a minimum of $15 for a haircut, there is no point in paying to have someone else cut my hair even once because these babies just about pay for themselves on a single cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not wonderful, but it is not bad neither.</li>
            <li> Horrible product by a usually great company.</li>
            <li> I just expected with a reputation like Andis for the quality to be up to par</li>
            <li> but i have only used it few times!</li>
            <li> Not worth buying or wasting money on</li>
            <li> This product is worthless, it pulls out more hair than it cuts, in my opinion this is nothing less than a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Other than that just a little adjustment to straighten the blade</li>
            <li> it had such a terrible sound that you might get stone-deaf.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money forget this and buy something else</li>
            <li> It got broken in several months.</li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon.com and decided to try it out because I&#x27;m tired of over paying for my basic \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; style hair cuts.</li>
            <li> I notice you not to buy it ,it&amp;#34;s waste time and money</li>
            <li> These are just a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Guides were not accurate.</li>
            <li> i bought this stupid machine and it rotten at the very first day.</li>
            <li> The clippers are extremely weak, and lastly they stopped working after only cutting 10% of my head.</li>
            <li> It can not work, it destroy my hair !</li>
            <li> /&gt;May be a bad unit, but was cutting the hair OK when it was working.</li>
            <li> i used it immediately and had to turn up the speed dial because my hair was so thick, but it worked a treat.</li>
            <li> Cant do it slow, or get caught up</li>
            <li> But if you know why you pay $20 per haircut when they only charge $11 then you know why cutting is serious business.</li>
            <li> So just to establish a level of credibility I&#x27;ll tell you guys about how serious I take my haircuts.</li>
            <li> Now my barber was Sugg, and if you don&#x27;t know about Sugg and The Hutt, don&#x27;t worry about this feedback because you wouldn&#x27;t recognize the subtle nuances in barbering quality</li>
            <li> but these seriously disappoint.</li>
            <li> Not a good experience.</li>
            <li> does Not GET CLOSE TO SKIN, NOT GOOD FOR SCULPING</li>
            <li> Total piece of crap.</li>
            <li> As much you use it it gets worst...</li>
            <li> My son was tired of trying to work around his barbers schedule while being in college and decided we should cut his hair.  </li>
            <li> No one was hurt but this could have been dangerous.</li>
            <li> and I began to see smoke coming from them as I was cutting my hair</li>
            <li> They are dangerous.</li>
            <li> the guy there us cutting horribly bad..</li>
            <li> The machine do not cut well, it pulls the hair even after applying oil on it, and the combs stab your head so bad</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll still be overpaying while making an equally bad move</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Worst product I have bought in years.</li>
            <li> These are the worst clippers in existence.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> got a good deal on this, has all kinds of accessories, love it.</li>
            <li> I just took it out of the box and it won&#x27;t cut my hair, it jams, the teeth don&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li> It worked really well, giving me a whole new level in my barbing experience all together. Great product, recommended for all guys and girls.</li>
            <li> Scissors that come with the item are cheap and do not work well</li>
            <li> I have never heard of this brand before, so I gave a try. Well I love it!! It cuts hair like its butter. Smooth and fast. Easy to use. I recommend this item to everyone.</li>
            <li> Not enough power to trim  the hair on your arms let alone cut hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money forget this and buy something else</li>
            <li> i bought it for my husband...its easy to use and clean...have it used it atleast 7-8 times...no problems at all. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Great product, but i have only used it few times! One thing i dont like is that sometimes it pulls the hair in my head</li>
            <li> these do what they promise to do-I use them to trim my facial whiskers when they get too long</li>
            <li> Have to adjust it to much just about ever time I use it . Don&#x27;t like doing that.</li>
            <li> I just received this and plugged it in. WOW this thing is super loud!!!! sounds like a chainsaw!!!! Certainly not using this in a confined space nor near my head atleast not without ear plugs!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my boyfriend had a very crappy Conair kid and it came in super fast and works very well! Buy this product!!</li>
            <li> im in afganistan and we dont have any barbers left..this machine works very well and the dvd is good also...great product!</li>
            <li> I think the product is really good, good quality for your money. When I turned it on it sounded really powerfull. I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It cuts really well but then I dropped it on terrazzo and something inside broke, so if not for my own clumsiness they would have been good.</li>
            <li> Nice...I didn&#x27;t regret buying this product</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good deal. 1st haircut went fine but during the 2nd haircut the upper cutting blade flew off??? No one was hurt but this could have been dangerous. Instead of trying to get a refund I just threw it in the trash. Not a good experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering a second set of these clippers. I would continue using my first set, but we&#x27;re remodeling and I have no idea where my wife put them. At a minimum of $15 for a haircut, there is no point in paying to have someone else cut my hair even once because these babies just about pay for themselves on a single cut.&lt;br /&gt;My first pair have worked flawlessly for the past year or two. The combs snap on solidly and everything works really well. Pressed for negative comments, I wish the power cord was a little more substantial, it does twist a bit. But that also means it is lighter and doesn&#x27;t drag and pull and much, so I can&#x27;t say how much of a negative it really is. There are lots of clippers in the $20-30 range. I wouldn&#x27;t be buying these again if I didn&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li> Never worked once for me. Total piece of crap. It made a vibrating noise but didn&#x27;t cut anything. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this machine to replace and old one I have that went bad, after reading the reviews I was hoping this will perform good, but it did not. The machine do not cut well, it pulls the hair even after applying oil on it, and the combs stab your head so bad, I will not recommend this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 5-12-14: As much you use it it gets worst... this machine can&#x27;t cut hair, avoid.</li>
            <li> Just the best hair cuts we could give with this kit.  Lots of choices and extras included.  Love the assortment of blade guides.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that this works as well as I would like it. I cut my own hair with it, and I don&#x27;t think it feels like it cuts hair as well as a professional electric clipper does.</li>
            <li> the title explains it all.. west of money, i was fooled by the price and the 19-pieces  it come with</li>
            <li> Guides were not accurate.</li>
            <li> Customers were very satisfied as long as they are happy &amp; pleased I am also very pleased and confident in the product .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good machine and make nice hair</li>
            <li> The product is great saving me over $40 dollars in haircuts. It takes a bit longer than I expected to cut my hair and the oil container was open, spilling in the plastic package ,when I received it. Besides that, this was a great investment.</li>
            <li> Brand new item, tried to cut my hair once and it started over heating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kept popping the fuse button on the wall I had to push reset 10 times in order to %70 finish a haircut, then got so hot that I was afraid to even try more, and it was constantly making click click click finally and not turning on when it was so hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May be a bad unit, but was cutting the hair OK when it was working. Material is cheap but does the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They give you around 10 piece of numbers and a CD to how to cut hair :) the guy there us cutting horribly bad.. I guess so you won&#x27;t get sad if you mess up your kids hair :D :D .</li>
            <li> These clippers are great for those that like to cut their hair at home and don&#x27;t use daily. If you are expecting something on the professional level, spend more money and get better clippers. These clippers do the basic of cutting hair and do great at it.They are easy to hold and handle, many haircutting kits give your hands a weird feeling when using them for a little while but these don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> They get the job done. Great price.</li>
            <li> Broke within a week! Terrible don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> It got broken in several months.</li>
            <li> this hair cuter is very good, and it&#x27;s really hard to be broken. Also, it&#x27;s easy to control it, ok.</li>
            <li> I just used these for the first time on my husbands and sons hair. Its very quiet and such a smooth shave. I am actually looking forward to their haircuts now.</li>
            <li> During the first hair cut, the clippers started SMOKING. I immediately unplugged it and unscrewed the cover to find the plastic pieces melting into the wires. Not even returning it, threw it promptly in the trash. I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star, but I digress.</li>
            <li> These clippers were a part of my beauty school supplies. Using them on one men&#x27;s haircut after another, they last for about three without a long resting time. Taking into consideration that I&#x27;m taking a considerable amount of time on each haircut, that&#x27;s very good for the listed price. If you clean it properly with the brush and use the oil every once in a while, it should even last years. Yes, it does get hot. Yes, it does get caught on knots. Yes, it works. If you want something amazing, buy a better model. My opinion is that for all of the pieces you get in this kit...this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Cool little clippers...works! So hey!...plus the price is nice!...i say buy!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good ,it got out of necesity that i had ..you can buy it, is a good price and come with comb kits for graduate de haircut</li>
            <li> Lots of bells and whistles ... none of them work ... this thing is so cheap as to be useless.  Worst product I have bought in years. 1/5</li>
            <li> Very good kit, all the accessories gives one a real professional feel while working with it. Very pleased with this kit.</li>
            <li> works amazing anddis is a leading brand and my wife is a stylist and will only use andis in her salon. we keep these clippers at home since i shave my head every 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon.com and decided to try it out because I&#x27;m tired of over paying for my basic \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; style hair cuts. To say I was satisfied is an under statement!! Fast service and delivery, the product is awesome ,with all the different attachments my styles are limitless. Now I give myself a hair cut whenever I need to for free....</li>
            <li> great product and shipped fast!! A + + + + + + + + + + + + + +</li>
            <li> i bought this stupid machine and it rotten at the very first day. it got so hot that i almost burn my hand, my room was filled  with the smoke,and pluss it had such a terrible sound that you might get stone-deaf. so my advice to everyone DO NOT BYE this machine</li>
            <li> it is very good and i love it.</li>
            <li> does Not GET CLOSE TO SKIN, NOT GOOD FOR SCULPING</li>
            <li> I rated it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not a shiny silver like what&#x27;s shown in the pic more like a dull gray. Otherwise my husband says they work fine.</li>
            <li> older model was a lot better that this set</li>
            <li> i  paid for it on(sat) and it was at my door on (mon) that was great i just used it for the fist time  it had a lot of power.it was a fast hair cut i am real happy that i got this</li>
            <li> the clippers don&#x27;t get an all around even cut. I have to keep going over and over the same spot to get the cut I want.</li>
            <li> Really short response!! The one delivered (lower model) is not the one posted here. The clippers are extremely weak, and lastly they stopped working after only cutting 10% of my head. Because of the price it&#x27;s not worth attempting a return process to spend more money. Avoid at all costs. My trash can has gotten more use of them. I received them 3/23/13, trashed 3/23/13. Horrible product by a usually great company.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my son&#x27;s first home-hair cut! Got a little hot since it took a while. Lots of pieces including a cape and scissors.</li>
            <li> This product is worthless, it pulls out more hair than it cuts, in my opinion this is nothing less than a piece of junk. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone buying this product.</li>
            <li> It can not work, it destroy my hair ! I notice you not to buy it ,it&amp;#34;s waste time and money</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work right. It is a hunk of junk. And does not cut hair very well either.  Not worth buying or wasting money on</li>
            <li> i used it immediately and had to turn up the speed dial because my hair was so thick, but it worked a treat.</li>
            <li> My son was tired of trying to work around his barbers schedule while being in college and decided we should cut his hair.  These clippers appeared to have good reviews and they were right!  My son is very particular about how his hair is cut &amp;#34;high &amp; tight&amp;#34;, and it cut them perfectly!  Looks just like his barber did it!  I would recommend these to anyone wanting to cut their hair at home.  They come with many guards and a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> Great product. Bought for my son for Christmas.  He was do happy . He said they were just what he needed</li>
            <li> I gave it as a Christmas present for my grandson he were his hair very short and he loved it</li>
            <li> When cutting my own hair, these clippers got too hot to hold way too fast and I began to see smoke coming from them as I was cutting my hair</li>
            <li> love the andis hair clipper set.one of the best product ive purchase with a great price tag.&lt;br /&gt;would definately refer it to my friends</li>
            <li> I think you get what you pay for. This is not wonderful, but it is not bad neither. I do recommend it!</li>
            <li> After only 2 uses these clippers feel as thought they are years old. They pull out your hair rather than cut it. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair and wife&#x27;s hair we are both satisfied with the performance and as you get used to it goes pretty quick</li>
            <li> The clipper haircutting function ok, but 2 of the combs (left ear taper and blending) were broken, and the cleaning brush didn&#x27;t came.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected... Love it. I use it to trim my Beard.I had one before but i drop it a few times,and 10 years later i found the same one. Very Happy.</li>
            <li> DO not work well with thick hair, but work decent on face and for light trims.</li>
            <li> So just to establish a level of credibility I&#x27;ll tell you guys about how serious I take my haircuts. First and foremost I&#x27;m from Jamaica, NY and if you&#x27;ve ever been here you know we have the highest standards of hair-cutting on Jamaica Ave. I went to Cuttys for a few years until I upgraded to &amp;#34;The Legendary Hutt&amp;#34; barbershop near the Coliseum. (The one featured in the movie Belly). Now my barber was Sugg, and if you don&#x27;t know about Sugg and The Hutt, don&#x27;t worry about this feedback because you wouldn&#x27;t recognize the subtle nuances in barbering quality so don&#x27;t read on. But if you know why you pay $20 per haircut when they only charge $11 then you know why cutting is serious business. I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event these clippers in the picture are not the ones you&#x27;ll receive in the box. The one you receive is actually the 18485 being called the 18645 but the 18485 costs only $11. If you want these then just go buy the 18485 and you&#x27;ll still be overpaying while making an equally bad move, I&#x27;ll explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers are not sharp and you cant shave with them. My old con-air clippers I got from walmart 3 yrs ago for 8 bucks work better than these and are much sharper. I just expected with a reputation like Andis for the quality to be up to par but these seriously disappoint. They overheat even though you use Cool-Care or Clipperside. They are dangerous. They feel like a kids toy. These are the worst clippers in existence. Andis should be ashamed. I just paid $17 bucks for the T-Blade replacement on the Outliner II and that was acceptable, that was Andis. These are just a waste of time. Trust me do not buy these if you life depended on it. But if you wanna gamble and ignore the reviews..go for it. Learn like i did.</li>
            <li> Have to be sure to slam power from on to off or the clippers will trip my gfi. Cant do it slow, or get caught up id the middle, have to really slam the lever fast. Lol luckilly my GFI is right there and dont have to go to electrical panel to reset breaker. Or else I&#x27;d send unit back!!! Other than that just a little adjustment to straighten the blade and they work fine.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this set! I have a different model of Andis and thought that this would be comparable but it&#x27;s not!  It pulls and pinches.</li>
            <li> This Andis trimmer is perfect for home use. This is my second purchase of this product. The first one is still going strong after almost two years of consistent use. I recommend this product.</li>
