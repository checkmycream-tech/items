            <li>Absolutely love this volumizing spray gel!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my quest to fine a great product to add volume.</li>
            <li>As a volumnizer, it does great on my fine hair, giving it a look of thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the reviews were good and my stylist recommended a product that was more exensive...</li>
            <li>and I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Not quite as good but better than anything else I have been able to find.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>My very fine hair had much better volume and control after the product dries than it has had in years.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and price.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it on weekends.</li>
            <li>If I put more than about 4 sprays it makes my hair sticky/greasy too.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>One of the best products on the market for hair volume ... was initially recommended by my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>Can brush through and retain most of the effect.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply to the hair, does not make hair become static,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use many hair products consistently, but this one is a favorite!</li>
            <li>I used all of the free sample and now ordering more.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of this, surprisingly at a thrift store, and I was absolutely amazed after trying it.  </li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend for both men and women that need more hair thickness or volume!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>Just a little sprits at roots adds great volume!</li>
            <li>We got a free sample</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic volumizer item.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and it is great.</li>
            <li>so I use a light workable hair spray to prolong the fullness.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>It is GREAT for adding volume and life to fine, flat hair.  </li>
            <li>This is my new FAVORITE hair product!  </li>
            <li>It works great for adding volume and love that I can get it from Amazon for less than I pay at the salon.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve tried it, but it will be come a staple with me:).</li>
            <li>No other gel has offered such great results and versatility as this spray gel!</li>
            <li>This is the best product i have ever used on my fine, baby thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Now I really stick out!!</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine straight hair and have tried a lot of volumizing products over the years.</li>
            <li>Adds body and shine to limp fly away hair.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair volume and better hold ... yet has a natural look and feel to the hair.</li>
            <li>Surprised I don&#x27;t see it more.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling gross or sticky after (which is why I keep using it, hoping for better results), although I do sometimes end up with a bit of crunchy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to spray It into my palm then rub it through my hair which distributes it more evenly than spraying it directly onto my hair from the bottle and allows me to control the exact number of sprays for each application.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine and limp hair and truthfully tried almost every product known to man for fuller hair including shampoo, serum, root lifters, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like I have the thicker hair I have always wanted, natural looking without a huge amount of work.</li>
            <li>First time user for KMS California.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!  </li>
            <li>In fact my hair looks better on the second day!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser first used this on my wavy hair</li>
            <li>Holds my thin hair fullness great after a quick curling iron and a tease comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pleasant not overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this tto get more fluff and prevent flat head at top.</li>
            <li>Spray onto your wet hair before drying and then once more after you put wax, etc.</li>
            <li>It really helped increase/hold the volume.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>enjoy using this product on my hair  gives my hair such volume .</li>
            <li>I got pretty great volume with this product when I took the time to blow dry my hair in sections with a round brush.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair that is oily at the roots and flat.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to add volume to my other wise flat hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this product brings out the volume in that otherwise limp hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and pretty limp.  </li>
            <li>used to use Big, Sexy Hair products, but the KMS ADD VOLUME product is much better and lasts and lasts with volume until my next hair wash [ usually every 2-3 days].  </li>
            <li>There is absolutely no stickiness after you blow dry your hair and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair is super fine, limp, and does not hold back combing at all.</li>
            <li>Be aware this is a spray gel as at first it looked so thick</li>
            <li>Seriously - if you have fine hair this product actually works - I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and now I refuse to use anything else because it is so convenient and not messy like regular gels.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair first, then spray it on my root area [from scalp to about 2 inches down the hair] with dampened hair and then finish drying it.</li>
            <li>simple process: spray, dry, and style, reasonable price</li>
            <li>Added a little body, a little volume, but inferior to other products of this kind.</li>
            <li>It is not as effective as I had hoped it would be, at least on my type of hair, which is very thick, straight, and flat.</li>
            <li>You almost cannot overdo it like some of the typical volume products that become crunchy if you use too much.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes after reading other review prior to purchasing this.  </li>
            <li>This product did nothing for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every option I could think of--very wet hair, barely damp hair (and everything in between), using only a little bit of the product, using lots of it, spraying it on my hands first and using my hands to apply it, using only on my roots, etc.</li>

            <li> I have used cheap and expensive products, but I have never found anything that actually did add volume to my fine, thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the product at her salon and have used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I should have spent the extra money.  </li>
            <li> When I dry it normally without the round brush my hair is a little fuller but still falls a bit.  </li>
            <li> It gives my super thin hair volume without being sticky or greasy, and it has a slight minty smell.</li>
            <li> I decided to check Amazon and found the same product for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li> Nothing has ever worked better than this product on my thin and weak hair.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it causes product buildup after a few days.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money, though, and I definitely don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> a few days later inbetween hair washes.  </li>
            <li> Then blow dry with head upside down.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It has a slight black licorice smell, so if you aren&#x27;t a fan of that, then it may put you off, but once your hair is dry it doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li> This is difficult to get with straight hair.</li>
            <li> During the entire 26 years of my life, I have always envied my friends with thick hair.</li>
            <li> It did not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> Have used about half the bottle on medium layered hair in over a month.</li>
            <li> I blow dry it section by section with a round brush, and it ends up looking worse than when I blow dry it with no product.</li>
            <li> I use a little hairspray to keep it set.</li>
            <li> without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Did not add volume to my fine-medium hair,  just made it a little stiff</li>
            <li> My hairdresser showed me: rub it together in my hands, work it though your hair and brush as usual.</li>
            <li> Spray on damp hair and blow dry style with a round brush to get height, body and fullness without stickiness, stiffness or otherwise artificial look.</li>
            <li> Hey, no more words to describe it!</li>
            <li> By taking the hair along my part and bending it backward, teasing it slightly and spritzing a tiny bit at the base of the hair underneath, I get some lift along the part that stays all day.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve gone through at least three bottles and am committed to it!  </li>
            <li> For fly-away, thin hair it gives some body and makes it easier to style.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has done nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in performance.</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love this volumizing spray gel! I had never used a spray gel before and now I refuse to use anything else because it is so convenient and not messy like regular gels. I have baby fine hair, and I use this gel to add volume and control when I straighten my hair, but it is also awesome for volume and taming my curls when I leave my hair curly. No other gel has offered such great results and versatility as this spray gel!</li>
            <li> My hair is super fine, limp, and does not hold back combing at all. I was hoping this product would help give it some volume but it only tangles it and makes it unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Same name as what is sold in stores but this is a pump and not what i thought it was</li>
            <li> I like this product, it gives me volume an holds my hairstyle well.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair sticky!</li>
            <li> First time user for KMS California.  Great product for the price.  Fast shipping too!  I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Love this product and price.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to! I have fine hair and I&#x27;m always looking for a volumizer that doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. This does it! Only downside is that it causes product buildup after a few days. I mostly use it on weekends.</li>
            <li> This is my new FAVORITE hair product!  It is GREAT for adding volume and life to fine, flat hair.  First time I&#x27;ve tried it, but it will be come a staple with me:).</li>
            <li> I had high hopes after reading other review prior to purchasing this.  Unfortunately, it has done nothing for my hair. If I put more than about 4 sprays it makes my hair sticky/greasy too. I&#x27;m still on my quest to fine a great product to add volume.</li>
            <li> it works well when i have a perm it take out the nots and makes it easier to brush and holds in the curls</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair. By taking the hair along my part and bending it backward, teasing it slightly and spritzing a tiny bit at the base of the hair underneath, I get some lift along the part that stays all day. This is difficult to get with straight hair. My stylist gave me this tip and a sample of KMS to use at home. I now realize you can buy it online. Amazon has the cheapest price.</li>
            <li> I started using this product as recommended by my stylist.  I bought the product at her salon and have used it for a long time.  I decided to check Amazon and found the same product for a lot less money.  Will continue to buy this product because it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to spray It into my palm then rub it through my hair which distributes it more evenly than spraying it directly onto my hair from the bottle and allows me to control the exact number of sprays for each application.  My very fine hair had much better volume and control after the product dries than it has had in years.  A good product which came promptly and I recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this, surprisingly at a thrift store, and I was absolutely amazed after trying it.  I have used cheap and expensive products, but I have never found anything that actually did add volume to my fine, thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After drying my hair, I have no &amp;#34;empty spots&amp;#34; like I used to have when I just used a regular gel or mousse.  I am buying a full-size bottle after using all the sample I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never change this stuff.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Seems like every time I find I product I like, they either stop making it or change it. KMS had a good volume gel and stopped making that version of it and this replaced it. Not quite as good but better than anything else I have been able to find. For fly-away, thin hair it gives some body and makes it easier to style.</li>
            <li> During the entire 26 years of my life, I have always envied my friends with thick hair. Nothing has ever worked better than this product on my thin and weak hair. I promise this will give you the bump and volume that you have always wanted. Spray onto your wet hair before drying and then once more after you put wax, etc. on your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used KMS Addvolume three years.  It works great for adding volume and love that I can get it from Amazon for less than I pay at the salon.</li>
            <li> Does was it says.  Adds body and shine to limp fly away hair.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR STYLIST RECOMMENDED THIS TO ME AND I LOVE IT WORKS GREAT I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE INOW BUY IT ONLINE</li>
            <li> This is truly the best product I have used.  We got a free sample and I was amazed!  I have very fine and limp hair and truthfully tried almost every product known to man for fuller hair including shampoo, serum, root lifters, etc.  This product works the best ever!  I used all of the free sample and now ordering more.  Seriously - if you have fine hair this product actually works - I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and pretty limp.  I got pretty great volume with this product when I took the time to blow dry my hair in sections with a round brush.  It really helped increase/hold the volume.  When I dry it normally without the round brush my hair is a little fuller but still falls a bit.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Love the fragrance. Works really well. As a volumnizer, it does great on my fine hair, giving it a look of thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing would be shinier than my Hair Add/Volume from KMS.  Now I really stick out!!</li>
            <li> Uck. I have fine straight hair. I bought this tto get more fluff and prevent flat head at top. It did nothing.  Worthless. It did not weigh down my hair. It feels a bit oily but is Not. I sprayed the roots and rubbed in. Then blow dry with head upside down. Like Loreal pumping volume and living proof.</li>
            <li> I find that it does indeed add volume to my hair. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic volumizer item. I have short hair and it is great. Do not hesitate in purchasing. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> One of the best products on the market for hair volume ... was initially recommended by my hairdresser.  Gives my hair volume and better hold ... yet has a natural look and feel to the hair.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine straight hair and have tried a lot of volumizing products over the years. This is by far the best one. Spray on damp hair and blow dry style with a round brush to get height, body and fullness without stickiness, stiffness or otherwise artificial look. You almost cannot overdo it like some of the typical volume products that become crunchy if you use too much. Can brush through and retain most of the effect. Like any volumizer the effect will decrease during the day so I use a light workable hair spray to prolong the fullness. Pleasant not overwhelming scent. It&#x27;s almost like I have the thicker hair I have always wanted, natural looking without a huge amount of work. Be aware this is a spray gel as at first it looked so thick I thought it had arrived frozen. I have been using this daily for several weeks and have not noticed that my hair is getting &amp;#34;used to it&amp;#34; and not responding. Have used about half the bottle on medium layered hair in over a month.</li>
            <li> It worked well.  I don&#x27;t care for the scent.  I am used to no-scent products.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!! Just a little sprits at roots adds great volume!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply to the hair, does not make hair become static, simple process: spray, dry, and style, reasonable price</li>
            <li> Great stuff! My hairdresser uses it. Surprised I don&#x27;t see it more.  I don&#x27;t use many hair products consistently, but this one is a favorite!</li>
            <li> Disappointed in performance. Added a little body, a little volume, but inferior to other products of this kind. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff but I don&#x27;t need it anymore!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my fine, thin hair. I have tried it probably ten times--I keep hoping that it will finally work--but it doesn&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;ve tried every option I could think of--very wet hair, barely damp hair (and everything in between), using only a little bit of the product, using lots of it, spraying it on my hands first and using my hands to apply it, using only on my roots, etc. I blow dry it section by section with a round brush, and it ends up looking worse than when I blow dry it with no product. The only good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling gross or sticky after (which is why I keep using it, hoping for better results), although I do sometimes end up with a bit of crunchy hair. This product was a waste of money, though, and I definitely don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser suggested this product and gave me a sample.  I got hooked! I have very fine hair and this product brings out the volume in that otherwise limp hair.  I have medium short hair and all I need is 4 sprays in my hand. My hairdresser showed me: rub it together in my hands, work it though your hair and brush as usual. I use a little hairspray to keep it set.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! My hairdresser gave me a sample last year and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since! It gives my super thin hair volume without being sticky or greasy, and it has a slight minty smell. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is a great volumizer, use it after you wash hair</li>
            <li> this stuff does what it says. i&#x27;ve given it to friends too and they agree. a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do...body....volume...structure to the hair...without being too heavy.  Hey, no more words to describe it!</li>
            <li> This is the best product i have ever used on my fine, baby thin hair.  I wash my hair first, then spray it on my root area [from scalp to about 2 inches down the hair] with dampened hair and then finish drying it. My hairdresser told me about it and used it on my hair.  I liked it so much i ordered it from Amazon for a lower price she was selling it for.  Holds my thin hair fullness great after a quick curling iron and a tease comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Big, Sexy Hair products, but the KMS ADD VOLUME product is much better and lasts and lasts with volume until my next hair wash [ usually every 2-3 days].  Also- no sticky residue or hair dulling a few days later inbetween hair washes.  Love it and highly recommend for both men and women that need more hair thickness or volume!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair that is oily at the roots and flat. I&#x27;ve tried numerous volumizing products and believe I can finally stop looking now that I have found this. There is absolutely no stickiness after you blow dry your hair and it smells amazing. I have also found that this product allows me to go an extra day without washing my hair. In fact my hair looks better on the second day! The only reason that I did not give it five stars is because it does leave some build up that causes some flakes. A fair trade in my book for volume!</li>
            <li> Good product.&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily.</li>
            <li> enjoy using this product on my hair  gives my hair such volume .</li>
            <li> My hairdresser first used this on my wavy hair and I&#x27;ve been buying it ever since.  I think I&#x27;ve gone through at least three bottles and am committed to it!  It has a slight black licorice smell, so if you aren&#x27;t a fan of that, then it may put you off, but once your hair is dry it doesn&#x27;t linger.  No funky residue, either.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews were good and my stylist recommended a product that was more exensive...I should have spent the extra money.  Did not add volume to my fine-medium hair,  just made it a little stiff</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to add volume to my other wise flat hair.  It is not as effective as I had hoped it would be, at least on my type of hair, which is very thick, straight, and flat.</li>
            <li> great volumnizer bought it because I used it when  visiting my daughter and I liked it.  Will purchase again when I need it</li>
