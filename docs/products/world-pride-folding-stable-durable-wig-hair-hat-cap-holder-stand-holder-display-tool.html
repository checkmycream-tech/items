            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>it was very sturdy and the perfect size for my wigs</li>
            <li>all my wigs nicely</li>
            <li>I see people use to display their knitted wears, but I knew I needed something for when I take pictures of my own.  </li>
            <li>The product is nice..</li>
            <li>It is very easy to put together and is of nice construction.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re very easy to put together and do their job.</li>
            <li>I got it like 9 days early! :D</li>
            <li>You just really have to improvise a very good foundation as this will not hold up once you place your wig on it.</li>
            <li>These were really easy to put together!</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the top circular piece that &amp;#34;snaps&amp;#34; in doesn&#x27;t seem to be made as a good fit.  </li>
            <li>It holds the wig just fine!</li>
            <li>Nice quality, arrived almost a week before date and is fairly easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>Holds wig up nicely, inexpensive and easy to put together and take apart</li>

            <li>These are okay for the price.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of these&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love these stands because I can disassemble them and use for travel.  </li>
            <li>and it is so flimsy that when you put the wig on top it falls over.</li>
            <li>So in love.</li>
            <li>But I have many of these and love them.</li>
            <li>so simple and perfect for more than just wigs.</li>
            <li>I love how I can fold it up and put it away when needed.  </li>
            <li>It is quite sturdy even though not the best for actual styling of a hairpiece.</li>
            <li>this is an okay purchase that I probably wont make again; I just don&#x27;t have the room for more of these.</li>
            <li>it is ok.</li>
            <li>Works way better than the styrofoam heads.  </li>
            <li>it all so very cheap and easy to use and put together.</li>
            <li>Not the most stable and strong</li>
            <li>but it did, easy to put together, be sure to look at pics before u assemble it.</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>reasonable and is a good deal for the money</li>
            <li>This item is easy to put together.</li>
            <li>I found it quite easy to put together.</li>
            <li>Falls over easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to build....</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble in three pieces.</li>
            <li>not stable - lightweight - easy to assemble but too tall for my area.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li>The stand was easy to figure out and put together.</li>
            <li>Easy to put together.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to put together.</li>
            <li>Easy to put together</li>
            <li>for the price it a just fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine, a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li>all in all, it was a quick and pain-free purchase!</li>
            <li>and they replied fast and were very nice about it and seemed willing to fix the problem if it kept going on like that.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap price and such and it works great for just holding a wig.</li>
            <li>There cheaply made but holds my wigs with no problems.</li>
            <li>They stand very well, hold up the wigs nicely depending on the weight and how you position the wigs.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; but it works and does a great job at drying short to medium length wigs.</li>
            <li>Its great for my wig especially when I wash it.  </li>
            <li>These are great for short wigs; not so great for really long wigs.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and sometimes tips over and the ring on top falls off easily.</li>
            <li>Very durable and perfect for letting wigs dry thoroughly without losing their shape.</li>
            <li>useful, but comes apart easily</li>
            <li>These are not for styling the wigs, just for display or keeping the wigs clean.</li>
            <li>Price was right!</li>
            <li>Also great for washing wigs, because it helps them dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li>Overall, they&#x27;re good for the money you spend.</li>
            <li>It came with all the pieces and and was pretty easy to put together.</li>
            <li>This allows the wigs to air out much better then the other types...love this product and I will be purchasing more of them soon!</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t come as quickly as I had hoped</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Easy assembly that really doesn&#x27;t require instructions.</li>
            <li>Took FOREVER to arrive but they were well worth the wait</li>
            <li>Took awhile to get here but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Broke right away , it was cheap and too much of a headache to return it</li>
            <li>Perfect for short or medium wigs, not so much for a long wig.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light weight stand and not very durable and falls over easily.</li>
            <li>Way better than expected, shipping was slow, but worth it, great product!</li>
            <li>Plastic but worth the price and its an easy assembly as long as you are not a moron.</li>
            <li>I rated it a 4 star because it is hard to style a wig on it, but it is great for just storing a wig on it.</li>
            <li>Can tip over easily even with the wig on it, because it is very light and he wig makes an uneven placement of weight.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap and took a long time getting to me, but the estimated shipping/arrival date was accurate, so I knew what to expect when I ordered these.</li>
            <li>However when you first get it there&#x27;s some assembly required</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised, wish there were instruction, but figured it out,  Rapid shipping</li>
            <li>I have others in the same type of plastic and paid much more for them.  </li>
            <li>The plastic seems cheap, but I&#x27;ve not had any issues with it so far.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It was very inexpensive and was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It works great with long or short wigs though!</li>
            <li>Very sturdy at an a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>and I had some trouble getting part of the hoop to fit into one of the slots, but it&#x27;s overall pretty good for what I paid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Simple, easy for travel.</li>
            <li>They hold my short and medium wigs just fine, but if you have a longer wig, they tend to topple over.</li>
            <li>the stand folds flat and is easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li>flimsy as expected but not horrible.</li>
            <li>It even came really fast</li>
            <li>The wig topples over because the thing is very unstable.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting very heavy/long wigs on these though</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this stand for anyone with a short- to medium-length wig, or anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind having their long, beautiful locks resting on a flat surface~</li>
            <li>too light for a long wig</li>
            <li>Easy to put together came in pink</li>
            <li>My wigs fit on it like a charm, haven&#x27;t used it to style and dry wigs yet, but will update once I do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent wig stand.</li>
            <li>Not that steady tho</li>
            <li>I like it because it got here within a decent amount of time</li>
            <li>But if you keep it on a flat surface, fixed surface (like not on a table that rolls and can be moved around), it is fine.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this to you who are unsure of this product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m just greatf that the price wasn&#x27;t high, so that&#x27;s why I am patent to wait.</li>
            <li>Light weight and takes not much room when stored</li>
            <li>It does take some forcing/bending to get the pieces into place, but I think that&#x27;s normal, so don&#x27;t let it worry</li>
            <li>When I am not using them they fold completely flat, so it makes it easy to keep a couple in different rooms.</li>
            <li>They break down flat for easy travel and seem pretty durable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and not a creepy face.</li>
            <li>They are a little top heavy when the wig is on them, but at the same time, they are very lightweight and easy to put together.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was very very hard to assemble, but it does keep the shape of the wig nicely</li>
            <li>are a little cheap plastic material</li>
            <li>Came in after my wigs, but still two weeks early.</li>
            <li>Such clever wig stands and so inexpensive, too.</li>
            <li>the other had right parts but had to zip tie it together .</li>
            <li>Instructions are not in English but not hard to figure out.</li>
            <li>Holds my long wig nicely but the length of the hair must rest on something and because it is long &amp; heavy &amp; will tip the stand over if you let the length of the hair hang down over the edge of a dresser or something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty durable, but not for a really heavy wig.</li>

            <li> Not the most stable and strong</li>
            <li> but it did, easy to put together, be sure to look at pics before u assemble it.</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> reasonable and is a good deal for the money</li>
            <li> This item is easy to put together.</li>
            <li> I found it quite easy to put together.</li>
            <li> Falls over easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to build....</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble in three pieces.</li>
            <li> not stable - lightweight - easy to assemble but too tall for my area.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li> The stand was easy to figure out and put together.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to put together.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together</li>
            <li> for the price it a just fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine, a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> all in all, it was a quick and pain-free purchase!</li>
            <li> and they replied fast and were very nice about it and seemed willing to fix the problem if it kept going on like that.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap price and such and it works great for just holding a wig.</li>
            <li> There cheaply made but holds my wigs with no problems.</li>
            <li> They stand very well, hold up the wigs nicely depending on the weight and how you position the wigs.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; but it works and does a great job at drying short to medium length wigs.</li>
            <li> Its great for my wig especially when I wash it.  </li>
            <li> These are great for short wigs; not so great for really long wigs.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and sometimes tips over and the ring on top falls off easily.</li>
            <li> Very durable and perfect for letting wigs dry thoroughly without losing their shape.</li>
            <li> useful, but comes apart easily</li>
            <li> These are not for styling the wigs, just for display or keeping the wigs clean.</li>
            <li> Price was right!</li>
            <li> Also great for washing wigs, because it helps them dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li> Overall, they&#x27;re good for the money you spend.</li>
            <li> It came with all the pieces and and was pretty easy to put together.</li>
            <li> This allows the wigs to air out much better then the other types...love this product and I will be purchasing more of them soon!</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t come as quickly as I had hoped</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Easy assembly that really doesn&#x27;t require instructions.</li>
            <li> Took FOREVER to arrive but they were well worth the wait</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get here but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Broke right away , it was cheap and too much of a headache to return it</li>
            <li> Perfect for short or medium wigs, not so much for a long wig.</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light weight stand and not very durable and falls over easily.</li>
            <li> Way better than expected, shipping was slow, but worth it, great product!</li>
            <li> Plastic but worth the price and its an easy assembly as long as you are not a moron.</li>
            <li> I rated it a 4 star because it is hard to style a wig on it, but it is great for just storing a wig on it.</li>
            <li> Can tip over easily even with the wig on it, because it is very light and he wig makes an uneven placement of weight.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap and took a long time getting to me, but the estimated shipping/arrival date was accurate, so I knew what to expect when I ordered these.</li>
            <li> However when you first get it there&#x27;s some assembly required</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, wish there were instruction, but figured it out,  Rapid shipping</li>
            <li> I have others in the same type of plastic and paid much more for them.  </li>
            <li> The plastic seems cheap, but I&#x27;ve not had any issues with it so far.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It was very inexpensive and was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It works great with long or short wigs though!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy at an a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> and I had some trouble getting part of the hoop to fit into one of the slots, but it&#x27;s overall pretty good for what I paid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simple, easy for travel.</li>
            <li> They hold my short and medium wigs just fine, but if you have a longer wig, they tend to topple over.</li>
            <li> the stand folds flat and is easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li> flimsy as expected but not horrible.</li>
            <li> It even came really fast</li>
            <li> The wig topples over because the thing is very unstable.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting very heavy/long wigs on these though</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this stand for anyone with a short- to medium-length wig, or anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind having their long, beautiful locks resting on a flat surface~</li>
            <li> too light for a long wig</li>
            <li> Easy to put together came in pink</li>
            <li> My wigs fit on it like a charm, haven&#x27;t used it to style and dry wigs yet, but will update once I do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent wig stand.</li>
            <li> Not that steady tho</li>
            <li> I like it because it got here within a decent amount of time</li>
            <li> But if you keep it on a flat surface, fixed surface (like not on a table that rolls and can be moved around), it is fine.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this to you who are unsure of this product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just greatf that the price wasn&#x27;t high, so that&#x27;s why I am patent to wait.</li>
            <li> Light weight and takes not much room when stored</li>
            <li> It does take some forcing/bending to get the pieces into place, but I think that&#x27;s normal, so don&#x27;t let it worry</li>
            <li> When I am not using them they fold completely flat, so it makes it easy to keep a couple in different rooms.</li>
            <li> They break down flat for easy travel and seem pretty durable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and not a creepy face.</li>
            <li> They are a little top heavy when the wig is on them, but at the same time, they are very lightweight and easy to put together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was very very hard to assemble, but it does keep the shape of the wig nicely</li>
            <li> are a little cheap plastic material</li>
            <li> Came in after my wigs, but still two weeks early.</li>
            <li> Such clever wig stands and so inexpensive, too.</li>
            <li> the other had right parts but had to zip tie it together .</li>
            <li> Instructions are not in English but not hard to figure out.</li>
            <li> Holds my long wig nicely but the length of the hair must rest on something and because it is long &amp; heavy &amp; will tip the stand over if you let the length of the hair hang down over the edge of a dresser or something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty durable, but not for a really heavy wig.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little skinnier than an actual head would be, but it holds my wigs shape and is definitely  higher quality than expected for $2.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as you leave the heavier parts of a wig on solid surface doesn&#x27;t topple over.</li>
            <li> So I bought this for a long wig I was getting and</li>
            <li> My wig is long so it hangs off the side of the dresser</li>
            <li> Came two weeks earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> tracking didn&#x27;t update for a very long time</li>
            <li> Seems like the wig holder wouldn&#x27;t last me too long, and this wig holder is DEFINETLY not useful for styling the wig on the wig holder</li>
            <li> It helps me style, brush, dry, and store my wigs!</li>
            <li> Came on time and does what I got it for, not much else to say</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> Stronger than I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> They are not very sturdy but workable.</li>
            <li> but it is not very stable or holds the hair well:</li>
            <li> They took a while to arrive as expected, but within the expected delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> They are roughly the size of a wig head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It allows my wig to dry in a few hours because the air can circulate all around it and through it.  </li>
            <li> A little flimsy, but works as expected</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t choose the color, but I ordered two and got a black one and a pink one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it would be with long wigs tho.....</li>
            <li> Not worth the the price.</li>
            <li> D&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two and got 1 pink, 1 black!</li>
            <li> I got the black one.</li>
            <li> Mine came in black and it is plastic for those of you who were wondering.</li>
            <li> The black one didn&#x27;t come with a ring</li>
            <li> not sure how long it will last because of the thin plastic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little wobbly (hence the 4 stars) but</li>
            <li> Heavy duty</li>
            <li> A bit hard to assemble and disassemble, but other than that, they hold my wigs, no tipping or breaking.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it!</li>
            <li> The product arrived broken, not worth the hassle to return, not a durable stand at all, quite flimsy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that hard to figure out as on the package it shows you what it&#x27;s supposed to look like.</li>
            <li> I do not like that it is plastic, but at least it holds the wig itself.</li>
            <li> This is thin and lightweight, but seems quite sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Was broken when I received it</li>
            <li> Holds my wigs, not perfect for grooming them, but it&#x27;s doable.</li>
            <li> Wish they would let you pick the colors instead of just random.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this time, mine got lost in transit.</li>
            <li> About time someone isn&#x27;t making their things expensive.</li>
            <li> you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to admit that I was rather disappointed that I received a boring ol&#x27; black wig stand instead of something cuter, like pink.</li>
            <li> It took forever to arrive and is very poor quality.</li>
            <li> It is the worst cheapest item I have ever received.</li>
            <li> terrible would not buy again.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Seems like the wig holder wouldn&#x27;t last me too long, and this wig holder is DEFINETLY not useful for styling the wig on the wig holder</li>
            <li> Took FOREVER to arrive but they were well worth the wait</li>
            <li> I do not like that it is plastic, but at least it holds the wig itself.</li>
            <li> This item is easy to put together. Love my wig stand</li>
            <li> Great for drying wigs.</li>
            <li> So I bought this for a long wig I was getting and well what can I say? It&#x27;s a decent wig stand. However when you first get it there&#x27;s some assembly required but it&#x27;s not that hard to figure out as on the package it shows you what it&#x27;s supposed to look like. Also while putting it together don&#x27;t worry about breaking it, it&#x27;s supposed to bend in place.</li>
            <li> Way better than expected, shipping was slow, but worth it, great product!</li>
            <li> Currently using this as a hat stand for my Victorian hat.  Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> So simple to put together and use</li>
            <li> These are okay for the price. Instructions are not in English but not hard to figure out. There cheaply made but holds my wigs with no problems.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and well balanced</li>
            <li> flimsy as expected but not horrible.</li>
            <li> The directions were in Chinese, however the pictures were not(snark!!). I found it quite easy to put together. It holds the wig just fine! Heavy duty it ain&#x27;t but for that price what does one expect.</li>
            <li> A bit flimsy. Broke one already but hey, it comes with two.</li>
            <li> Such clever wig stands and so inexpensive, too.</li>
            <li> Look at and it falls apart...get what you pay for</li>
            <li> reasonable and is a good deal for the money</li>
            <li> Nice for the price! Holds my wigs, not perfect for grooming them, but it&#x27;s doable. They&#x27;re cheap and took a long time getting to me, but the estimated shipping/arrival date was accurate, so I knew what to expect when I ordered these. No fault there!</li>
            <li> Perfect for drying wigs after washing them.</li>
            <li> Broke right away , it was cheap and too much of a headache to return it so I let it go smh !!!!</li>
            <li> These were great but lost wigs in a fire</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, wish there were instruction, but figured it out,  Rapid shipping</li>
            <li> Came on time and does what I got it for, not much else to say</li>
            <li> Wish they would let you pick the colors instead of just random. Very easy to put together and holds my wigs very nicely. Excellent price. Not the most stable and strong but it&#x27;s not like I shake the stands. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product it was very sturdy and the perfect size for my wigs it all so very cheap and easy to use and put together. I will be buying more of these&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to you who are unsure of this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together came in pink I love it It even came really fast</li>
            <li> These are great for short wigs; not so great for really long wigs. They are a little top heavy when the wig is on them, but at the same time, they are very lightweight and easy to put together. I would definitely recommend these if I needed to travel with wigs.</li>
            <li> This is a good sturdy stand for wigs. I&#x27;m not sure how it would be with long wigs tho.....</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 wig stands and they are perfect for my wigs.  I have others in the same type of plastic and paid much more for them.  I am very satisfied and will purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> Easy assembly that really doesn&#x27;t require instructions. My wigs fit on it like a charm, haven&#x27;t used it to style and dry wigs yet, but will update once I do. As long as you leave the heavier parts of a wig on solid surface doesn&#x27;t topple over.</li>
            <li> It does its job. Sturdy semi flex construction. FIts all my wigs nicely, it can be re dissasembled and taken  on travel. WIll stock up f0r future wigs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would work that gr8&#x27; but it did, easy to put together, be sure to look at pics before u assemble it. Light weight and takes not much room when stored</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with this wig stand! It was super-easy to assemble, and it&#x27;s lightweight yet durable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions for assembly were in Chinese and Korean, however, but there were also illustrations so it wasn&#x27;t rocket science to figure out. It does take some forcing/bending to get the pieces into place, but I think that&#x27;s normal, so don&#x27;t let it worry you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to admit that I was rather disappointed that I received a boring ol&#x27; black wig stand instead of something cuter, like pink. If possible, the seller should consider offering its buyers a choice in which colour stand they will receive! It might brighten someone&#x27;s day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, it was a quick and pain-free purchase! I would recommend this stand for anyone with a short- to medium-length wig, or anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind having their long, beautiful locks resting on a flat surface~</li>
            <li> Love it! It helps me style, brush, dry, and store my wigs! I highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose . . . And Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy for travel.</li>
            <li> Great for the price. It&#x27;s a little wobbly (hence the 4 stars) but for the price it a just fine. My wig is long so it hangs off the side of the dresser but now the bangs aren&#x27;t getting all messed up.</li>
            <li> Not put together very good</li>
            <li> It looks just like how it was pictured. I got the black one.</li>
            <li> I loved the stand for it&#x27;s cheap price and such and it works great for just holding a wig. It looked exactly as pictured and it was very nice. I rated it a 4 star because it is hard to style a wig on it, but it is great for just storing a wig on it.</li>
            <li> Received within two weeks of ordering, way before the estimated delivery date! It&#x27;s perfect for displaying my cutest hat that I bought this for(to keep form). The plastic seems cheap, but I&#x27;ve not had any issues with it so far.</li>
            <li> Holds mine up, but occasionally topples over.</li>
            <li> The product arrived broken, not worth the hassle to return, not a durable stand at all, quite flimsy. Won&#x27;t try this again</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, the item is perfect to hold a wig, nothing fancy, for the price is a good buy. i will reorder from this company.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, arrived almost a week before date and is fairly easy to assemble. Mine came in black and it is plastic for those of you who were wondering. It&#x27;s a little skinnier than an actual head would be, but it holds my wigs shape and is definitely  higher quality than expected for $2.&lt;br /&gt;However I would not recommend it for longer wigs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t ask for a puzzle. The wig topples over because the thing is very unstable. Not worth the the price.</li>
            <li> Great price! Took forever to get here. But for $1.50 how could I complain?</li>
            <li> Great price, but unstable. Falls over easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to build.... Not that steady tho</li>
            <li> It seems to be durable and can come apart for traveling.  The price was right.</li>
            <li> Love these stands because I can disassemble them and use for travel.  Also great for washing wigs, because it helps them dry quickly.</li>
            <li> Holds wig up nicely, inexpensive and easy to put together and take apart so it&#x27;s portable, good product!</li>
            <li> This is lightweight plastic that you have to snap it together and it is so flimsy that when you put the wig on top it falls over. It is the worst cheapest item I have ever received. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it! I threw it away! Plus it comes from China and it took forever to get to me and I ended up having to write the seller to receive it!</li>
            <li> Thought this was metal</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Shipping was faster than I expected. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I got it like 9 days early! :D So happy! You can&#x27;t choose the color, but I ordered two and got a black one and a pink one! So in love. The black one didn&#x27;t come with a ring but I don&#x27;t think I need it. I haven&#x27;t gotten my wigs yet but I&#x27;ll take update my review and take a picture. :D</li>
            <li> The stands are quite sturdier than the ones I get at the local beauty supply store.  I love them and will order again!  The added bonus is that they are barbie pink...kudos to the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy at an a very reasonable price.  Took awhile to get here but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Works fine, a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this time, mine got lost in transit. But I have many of these and love them. I am laid up from an accident so I can&#x27;t always get upstairs to put things away. I keep these wig stands upstairs and downstairs. That way when I come in and just can&#x27;t make the steps I just whip off the wig and put it on the stand close to me until I can put it away. When I am not using them they fold completely flat, so it makes it easy to keep a couple in different rooms.</li>
            <li> Keeps my wigs in good shape. Stronger than I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> Received 1/26/2015. Works great.</li>
            <li> They stand very well, hold up the wigs nicely depending on the weight and how you position the wigs.&lt;br /&gt;They are a little cheap plastic material but they&#x27;re very easy to put together and do their job. A good experience. :D&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two and got 1 pink, 1 black!</li>
            <li> Perfect for type of wig I have &amp; can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This is a great stand for drying wigs. It was very inexpensive and was well worth the price. It is very lightweight and sometimes tips over and the ring on top falls off easily. but it&#x27;s not a big deal though. It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; but it works and does a great job at drying short to medium length wigs.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble in three pieces. Purchased this to hold my Batman mask in an upright position.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, just a tad wobbly and I had some trouble getting part of the hoop to fit into one of the slots, but it&#x27;s overall pretty good for what I paid.&lt;br /&gt;The tracking didn&#x27;t update for a very long time and I wound up contacting the seller about it and they replied fast and were very nice about it and seemed willing to fix the problem if it kept going on like that.</li>
            <li> It came with all the pieces and and was pretty easy to put together. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty durable, but not for a really heavy wig. It works great with long or short wigs though!</li>
            <li> These were really easy to put together! They hold my short and medium wigs just fine, but if you have a longer wig, they tend to topple over. Overall, they&#x27;re good for the money you spend.</li>
            <li> so simple and perfect for more than just wigs. I also use it to make art projects involving head-bands or masks.</li>
            <li> They need to have some weight at the bottom.</li>
            <li> This device was easy to put together and my wig fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> They are not very sturdy but workable. You just really have to improvise a very good foundation as this will not hold up once you place your wig on it. It keeps my wigs in place and in good condition nonetheless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I ordered but if you want multiple I recommend buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> nice stand, works good.</li>
            <li> One brisk when putting together .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and not a creepy face. Plastic but worth the price and its an easy assembly as long as you are not a moron.</li>
            <li> This allows the wigs to air out much better then the other types...love this product and I will be purchasing more of them soon!</li>
            <li> Horrible&lt;br /&gt;Would not stay assembled&lt;br /&gt;Flimsy</li>
            <li> I love how I can fold it up and put it away when needed.  It&#x27;s a space saver and seems to be sturdy. I have 3 of them.</li>
            <li> Its great for my wig especially when I wash it.  It allows my wig to dry in a few hours because the air can circulate all around it and through it.  It was a great price too.</li>
            <li> Ordered two, and I am impressed. A bit hard to assemble and disassemble, but other than that, they hold my wigs, no tipping or breaking.</li>
            <li> not stable - lightweight - easy to assemble but too tall for my area.</li>
            <li> It took forever to arrive and is very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Works great for coloring my wigs</li>
            <li> They seem sturdy and work well enough. They didn&#x27;t come as quickly as I had hoped (They came after the wigs I ordered :c), but that&#x27;s okay. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting very heavy/long wigs on these though</li>
            <li> I get creeped out by the mannequin heads I see people use to display their knitted wears, but I knew I needed something for when I take pictures of my own.  To avoid the severed head look, this stand was perfect.  Now I don&#x27;t have to jump out of my skin when I walk into my walk in closet to grab a knitting project.</li>
            <li> Excellent I&#x27;m very satisfied. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Good price. Can tip over easily even with the wig on it, because it is very light and he wig makes an uneven placement of weight.  But if you keep it on a flat surface, fixed surface (like not on a table that rolls and can be moved around), it is fine.  Easy to assemble.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the top circular piece that &amp;#34;snaps&amp;#34; in doesn&#x27;t seem to be made as a good fit.  I ordered two and it is the same in both.  It just won&#x27;t stay snapped in place, but it doesn&#x27;t seemto affect the use.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here but I&#x27;m just greatf that the price wasn&#x27;t high, so that&#x27;s why I am patent to wait. About time someone isn&#x27;t making their things expensive.</li>
            <li> useful, but comes apart easily</li>
            <li> The product is nice..waitng for it to arrive, was a challenge..Otherwise no issues.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this stand. It is very easy to put together and is of nice construction. Holds my long wig nicely but the length of the hair must rest on something and because it is long &amp; heavy &amp; will tip the stand over if you let the length of the hair hang down over the edge of a dresser or something. Very happy!</li>
            <li> Maybe not the best for longer wigs, but it was bought already knowing the limitations. Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very durable and perfect for letting wigs dry thoroughly without losing their shape. I would buy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light weight stand and not very durable and falls over easily. It&#x27;s was very very hard to assemble, but it does keep the shape of the wig nicely</li>
            <li> I like that the stand folds flat and is easy to pack for travel.  It is quite sturdy even though not the best for actual styling of a hairpiece.</li>
            <li> too light for a long wig</li>
            <li> Works Good for the Price !</li>
            <li> I like it because it got here within a decent amount of time and it seems sturdy. The stand was easy to figure out and put together.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy, but works as expected</li>
            <li> Very nice, better than metal or foam heads, keeps shape of wig without stretching.  No problem to put together, it just snaps and then holds.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together. Came two weeks earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Great ... but&lt;br /&gt;slow shipping</li>
            <li> Perfect for short or medium wigs, not so much for a long wig. These are not for styling the wigs, just for display or keeping the wigs clean.</li>
            <li> this is an okay purchase that I probably wont make again; I just don&#x27;t have the room for more of these.</li>
            <li> terrible would not buy again. 1package had 2 of same parts in it. so could not put together. the other had right parts but had to zip tie it together .</li>
            <li> This is thin and lightweight, but seems quite sturdy.  I use it for hats and it works well.</li>
            <li> the good thing is it is portable but it is not very stable or holds the hair well: not sure how long it will last because of the thin plastic</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to assemble.  Price was right!</li>
            <li> Was broken when I received it</li>
            <li> Came in great condition, works well, love it!</li>
            <li> it is ok. They are easy to put together. they do the job</li>
            <li> sturdy, easy to set up, got here in 13 days, and works perfectly</li>
            <li> Good wig stands. Good price.</li>
            <li> They took a while to arrive as expected, but within the expected delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;Just order them in advance and you will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great to bring to conventions to store styled wigs on in the hotel room. They break down flat for easy travel and seem pretty durable. They are roughly the size of a wig head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are NOT for styling wigs on!</li>
            <li> Came in after my wigs, but still two weeks early. Easy to put together</li>
            <li> Works way better than the styrofoam heads.  I love it!</li>
