            <li>Look is appealing.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>Good fragrance and at the right strength.</li>

            <li>Great look and smell as well as super soft on the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a good lather and not too strong of a scent, and my hands feel pretty soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and looks much better on the vanity than other options.</li>
            <li>Nice, natural product.</li>
            <li>The Milky Way color has some really cool texture to it  </li>
            <li>So odd to say, but these are actaully so visually appealing that they make good decor.</li>

            <li>It smelled great and left me clean, so no complaint from me.</li>
            <li>and I went through it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>For the holidays, my company hosted a \\&quot;Time to Unwind\\&quot; holiday event where the employees were given massages,  pumice stones, organic lip balms, teas, essential oils, eye masks, hand exercise balls and most all handmade</li>
            <li>I give this soap 5 stars because the scent is even better than the regular soaps I used to buy, and I really like how it looks.</li>
            <li>YOU EVER SO MUCH, SANTA MONICA SOAP CO.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s supposed to really help keep skin moist, and I really like the name &amp;#34;Milky Way&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Price reasonable and arrive promptly.</li>
            <li>the Santa Monica Soap Co. We purchased over 100 soaps in the following scents: The Milky Way, Orange Crush, Sweet Melon, Lavender and Tropical Mango -- all of which smelled wonderful!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because I want to use a natural product that would not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a soap with shea butter, since I like natural ingredients</li>
            <li>leaves your skin soft while exfoliating as well.</li>
            <li>I am always nervous about trying new soaps, since I really don&#x27;t like it when soaps dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell, but has small seedy bits; doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I had not experienced these soaps prior to ordering them for the company event, I will purchase more for myself in the future, since they have several other scents I would love to try.</li>
            <li>Lasts for an average amount of time (especially for a soft, fresh bar).</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I&#x27;m not that big into manscaping, so I&#x27;m not that fussy when it comes to which soap I buy: as long as it&#x27;s natural.</li>

            <li> ; This is a woman who is very hard to please with any stuff like this, so I was amazed at her answer.</li>
            <li> The Milky Way bar makes me think I&#x27;m a geologist while merely washing my hands as I inspect the layers of this soap!  </li>

            <li> I bought this because I want to use a natural product that would not irritate my skin.  This soap is great!  It does not irritate my skin, I have noticed that the sent is not over powering, and it lasts all day.  I have used it for about a month and like it&#x27;s over all feel.</li>
            <li> I like this soap. The fragrance is good but not quite as strong as I would like it to be . I would purchase it again and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> For the holidays, my company hosted a \\&quot;Time to Unwind\\&quot; holiday event where the employees were given massages,  pumice stones, organic lip balms, teas, essential oils, eye masks, hand exercise balls and most all handmade soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The majority of the incredible scented handmade soaps came from this vendor, the Santa Monica Soap Co.

I also like the way they describe the scent contents in the \\&quot;Product Description\\&quot; of each soap -- giving you some idea of what the soap smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH, SANTA MONICA SOAP CO. FOR YOUR SOAPS!</li>
            <li> I give this soap 5 stars because the scent is even better than the regular soaps I used to buy, and I really like how it looks. I expected the soap to be like other natural products I&#x27;ve used - good for the environment but annoying to use, but was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This soap has a unique fresh aroma. I like to handmade aspect and that each bar has one-of-a-kind coloration pattern. Nice, natural product.</li>
            <li> Great soap!  It smells good and looks much better on the vanity than other options. The Milky Way bar makes me think I&#x27;m a geologist while merely washing my hands as I inspect the layers of this soap!  WASH ON!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Refreshing and surprising scent.  Loved the &amp;#34;Milky Way&amp;#34; look in the bar, very unique.</li>
            <li> I was shopping on Amazon and stumbled upon the Milky Way soap.  My girlfriend is into soaps, and I figured I&#x27;d get her a little something.  She loves it!  And it makes her smell great.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;m not that big into manscaping, so I&#x27;m not that fussy when it comes to which soap I buy: as long as it&#x27;s natural. A friend recommended this soap, so I gave it a try. It smelled great and left me clean, so no complaint from me. I put it in my shower and my girlfriend used it, when I asked her what she thought she said &amp;#34;I love it.&amp;#34; This is a woman who is very hard to please with any stuff like this, so I was amazed at her answer. She loved the smell on me and on her.</li>
            <li> The bar is a little small and I went through it pretty quickly. Other than that I have no qualms about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great. Feels great on my skin. None of the stickiness you get from retail soap bars. The smell lasts all day, which is hard for any soap to do on me because I have a labor intensive job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to all at SMS Co.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I found my Christmas gifts for the year</li>
            <li> So odd to say, but these are actaully so visually appealing that they make good decor. Otherwise its a good smelling bar of soap. I have bought a few</li>
            <li> The milky way is a favorite- excellent soap!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, but has small seedy bits; doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I am always nervous about trying new soaps, since I really don&#x27;t like it when soaps dry out my skin.  I was looking for a soap with shea butter, since I like natural ingredients and it&#x27;s supposed to really help keep skin moist, and I really like the name &amp;#34;Milky Way&amp;#34;, so I gave this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a good lather and not too strong of a scent, and my hands feel pretty soft after using it.  I will definitely be getting this one again.</li>
            <li> Great look and smell as well as super soft on the skin.  The Milky Way color has some really cool texture to it  - can&#x27;t wait to try the other colors.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li> In the words of the retail lady in Fight Club \\&quot;This is the best soap\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your skin soft while exfoliating as well. Not a \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; type cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great as well.</li>
            <li> Smells like candy. Like a red bubble gum ball. Not a great aroma for an adult. I do like the Iceland scent and the lavender scent from the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance and at the right strength. Soap lathers and cleanses fine. Look is appealing. Price reasonable and arrive promptly. Lasts for an average amount of time (especially for a soft, fresh bar). What more could you ask for?</li>
