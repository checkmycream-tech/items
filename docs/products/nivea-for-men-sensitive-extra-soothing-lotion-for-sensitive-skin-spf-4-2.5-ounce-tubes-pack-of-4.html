            <li>I have been using this product for some years now, and i love it</li>

            <li>I love this stuff for my face.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have any scent.  </li>
            <li>Need more.</li>
            <li>so he was really glad to find it here.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product, I use it daily</li>
            <li>I am quite appreciative of this company having such an awesome product available.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used this face lotion for many years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it keeps his face from getting to chapped, that his face starts to peal.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best moisturizer for sensitive skin I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Well packaged, great value for the money (would cost you about $24 buying individually).</li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s so light and not greasy, its not coloured or fragrant, it just does what it says on the tin</li>
            <li>This was an Alcohol free product and everything out there contains alcohol.</li>
            <li>to use with my razor Is this available?</li>
            <li>This stuff is light, absorbs quickly, and has no scent.  </li>
            <li>seller delivered me more than a year&#x27;s worth - exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>The problem with the product is that, while it soothes and moisturizes, it&#x27;s greasy  as hell and does not absorb quickly, leaving your face looking oily all day.  </li>
            <li>Item was shipped quickly and i had no issues at all with it.</li>
            <li>-- this does have a pleasant but not overpowering fragance to it) to help prevent dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, light lotion for daily use.</li>
            <li>luckily i found it here</li>
            <li>Unfortunately...this stuff leaves your face feeling super greasy.  </li>
            <li>Best guys face lotion out there by far it beats out any other lotion on the market bar</li>
            <li>I spread Nivea over my whole face and forehead and am comfortable with it all day and evening.  </li>
            <li>No scent to it, which is nice, especially if you have a sensitivity to fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Razor burn is gone, the pain when shaving is gone, the post-shave discomfort is gone, and my face skin is healthy and never dried out.  </li>
            <li>This one is just right.  </li>
            <li>the SPF is good no matter how little.</li>
            <li>I really wish I could agree with all of the stellar reviews!  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Nivea...truly a life changing product!</li>
            <li>SPF4 is better than nothing, and considering you&#x27;re a guy who already cares enough to use lotion</li>
            <li>Keep it in stock, Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks for providing this option to this consumer!</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped reduce redness and irritation on his face.</li>
            <li>The sensitive aftershave balm from Nivea is also his favorite, for the same reasons.</li>
            <li>handy, too, that it comes in small enough containers that it&#x27;s easy to include in a TSA-compliant 3-1-1 zip-lock bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With Amazon&#x27;s regular shipment service, you get a better price and no having to hunt for the stuff locally</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and types of facial moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The big difference is that the latter is much greasier (despite the \\&quot;Fast absorbing and non-greasy\\</li>
            <li>On the positive side, it does work, and after about 12 hours my face feels almost back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot;, but I can&#x27;t stand the greasiness.  </li>
            <li>and it really works especially if you are growing a new beard</li>
            <li>I started getting dry skin on my face right about when I moved from NZ to UK about 15 years ago, so I do blame the water, but moving to the USA hasn&#x27;t improved things.</li>
            <li>Try Neutrogena Moisture for Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li>has some spf for sun protection, and it doesn&#x27;t cause my sensitive skin to break out.  </li>
            <li>I have ridiculously sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Unlike a couple other reviewers, I find it&#x27;s absorbed readily, and isn&#x27;t at all obvious (i.e., I don&#x27;t think my face is shiny!).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this product as a daily facial moisturizer and it works very well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this as an aftershave and to avoid dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My husband does not like to use &amp;#34;product.&amp;#34; Every moisturizer I&#x27;ve forced him to try was one or more of the following: too stinky, greasy, pasty, stung his eyes, breakout inducing.</li>
            <li>there is no other product for the price like it</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s product title is Nivea for Men Sensitive, Extra Soothing Lotion, but the actual product I received was Nivea for Men Sensitive Lotion.</li>
            <li>To begin with, the product is described as \\&quot;Exra Soothing\\&quot; but what you&#x27;ll receive  is the regular sensitive lotion</li>
            <li>My husband uses the Nivea for Sensitive Skin and it seems to be the only lotion he has tried that did not burn his skin.  </li>
            <li>And Nivea&#x27;s new sensitive lotion contains chamomille, aloe and other chemicals that irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I grew up in a humid climate and now live in a dry one, so I have to use it every morning after a shower to fight off an over-dry face.  </li>
            <li>only regret is that it&#x27;s only an SPF 4, so if I&#x27;m going to be outdoors for anything other than the drive to work, my dermatologist would counsel me to use something much stronger!</li>

            <li> /&gt;Someone bought me a tube of this years ago and ever since then every other product has failed to be a suitable replacement.  </li>
            <li> No flowery fragrance, a tiny amount goes a long way, it doesn&#x27;t cause pimples or any irritation.  </li>
            <li> For whatever reason, I&#x27;ve long needed to use lotion on my face, just one of those things I guess.</li>
            <li> the problem is I noticed a few months back that it started to disappear off of the shelves at various stores, only place I found it was at BBB</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Skin remains soft and elastic throughout the day, even during the dead of winter.</li>
            <li> As long as they keep making this lotion, I&#x27;ll order it.</li>
            <li> Anytime I&#x27;ve tried other products I toss them and come back to this.  </li>
            <li> And my face doesn&#x27;t feel taught and dry anymore.  </li>
            <li> I was desperately looking for something that was fast absorbing, and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling like I had just slathered Vaseline all over it.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I started using it daily, my skin is less oily and feels moist all day.</li>
            <li> , not sure what other reviewers are talking about, as this is definitely the same product that i used to buy at the store - not greasy either like i saw some people say.</li>
            <li> He likes that he only has to use a little at a time and its not greasy, and that it has no offending smell.  </li>
            <li> Looks like my face is wet for hours.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin or make him break out like other products.  </li>
            <li> Other products (by Aveeno, Neutrogena, and even other products by Nivea) are either too thick, too greasy, too odorous, or all of the above.  </li>
            <li> so I saved and little cash with buying in bulk and got the product I wanted.</li>
            <li> This product really soothes my skin and provides relief whether I&#x27;m out in the heat or the cold.</li>
            <li> It has no cheap &amp;#34;man fragrance,&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin or eyes.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember I would get painful razor burn on my face and neck after shaving several days in a row.  </li>
            <li> so I usually don&#x27;t buy it in bulk</li>
            <li> For some reason this stuff is really hard to come by on the West coast</li>
            <li> I got the 4-pack, and I&#x27;m afraid I may only get through one before I start looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> however over the past year it has become impossible to find at any local drugstore or target...</li>
            <li> It is somewhat thick, however, the Neutrogena product that some other reviewers talked about doesn&#x27;t work for me because it is too thin -- it absorbs poorly on my skin -- and has no SPF value.  </li>
            <li> I suffered for about 2 years trying lots of different (some very expensive) products, and they either didn&#x27;t help or caused side effects like breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Not too thick, not too thin.  </li>
            <li> Nivea&#x27;s newer product now is too thin and too expensive.</li>
            <li> Too sad that Nivea has discontinued it and has nothing close to it.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it is being discontinued.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years, and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing! Walmart stopped carrying it so this is my second time ordering it from this supplier. Well packaged, great value for the money (would cost you about $24 buying individually). The product itself works great. I have to shave every morning for work and my skin get&#x27;s irritated. This product really soothes my skin and provides relief whether I&#x27;m out in the heat or the cold. Will be coming back time and time again!</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s product title is Nivea for Men Sensitive, Extra Soothing Lotion, but the actual product I received was Nivea for Men Sensitive Lotion. The big difference is that the latter is much greasier (despite the \\&quot;Fast absorbing and non-greasy\\&quot; line in the Product Features section). I&#x27;ll be returning the product.</li>
            <li> For some reason this stuff is really hard to come by on the West coast so it&#x27;s nice I can order it from Amazon now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone bought me a tube of this years ago and ever since then every other product has failed to be a suitable replacement.  Other products (by Aveeno, Neutrogena, and even other products by Nivea) are either too thick, too greasy, too odorous, or all of the above.  This stuff is light, absorbs quickly, and has no scent.  I grew up in a humid climate and now live in a dry one, so I have to use it every morning after a shower to fight off an over-dry face.  One tube lasts for months and months when used as sparingly as I do.  I hope Nivea continues to produce this for years to come.</li>
            <li> My husband does not like to use &amp;#34;product.&amp;#34; Every moisturizer I&#x27;ve forced him to try was one or more of the following: too stinky, greasy, pasty, stung his eyes, breakout inducing. He&#x27;s tried a lot, from all price ranges, from CVS to Kiehls, from gels to creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ONLY face moisturizer that he will use. It has no cheap &amp;#34;man fragrance,&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin or eyes. The sensitive aftershave balm from Nivea is also his favorite, for the same reasons.</li>
            <li> I really like this as an aftershave and to avoid dry skin.  Unlike a couple other reviewers, I find it&#x27;s absorbed readily, and isn&#x27;t at all obvious (i.e., I don&#x27;t think my face is shiny!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s handy, too, that it comes in small enough containers that it&#x27;s easy to include in a TSA-compliant 3-1-1 zip-lock bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that it&#x27;s only an SPF 4, so if I&#x27;m going to be outdoors for anything other than the drive to work, my dermatologist would counsel me to use something much stronger!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer for sensitive skin I&#x27;ve ever used. And I&#x27;ve tried them all. My skin looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> Nivea sure missed the boat here.  To begin with, the product is described as \\&quot;Exra Soothing\\&quot; but what you&#x27;ll receive  is the regular sensitive lotion--I don&#x27;t know if the extra soothing exists anymore.  You&#x27;ll notice a mismatch between the description and the photos.    The problem with the product is that, while it soothes and moisturizes, it&#x27;s greasy  as hell and does not absorb quickly, leaving your face looking oily all day.  Maybe that&#x27;s why one reviewer here says he shaves with it!    Try Neutrogena Moisture for Sensitive Skin.</li>
            <li> Perhaps individual body chemistry is involved for people who don&#x27;t like this product.  It is somewhat thick, however, the Neutrogena product that some other reviewers talked about doesn&#x27;t work for me because it is too thin -- it absorbs poorly on my skin -- and has no SPF value.  Anytime I&#x27;ve tried other products I toss them and come back to this.  I spread Nivea over my whole face and forehead and am comfortable with it all day and evening.  No greasy feeling for me personally.</li>
            <li> Best guys face lotion out there by far it beats out any other lotion on the market bar none.love it</li>
            <li> Great Product quick response time. Item was shipped quickly and i had no issues at all with it. I have used this product for many years and Walmart has stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> Great product, very good results. Never have complaints with this product. I have been using this product for some years now, and i love it</li>
            <li> This stuff works great after shaving (also recommend Nivea after shave, [[ASIN:B001FB5IGO Nivea for Men Post Shave Replenishing Balm, 3.3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]] -- this does have a pleasant but not overpowering fragance to it) to help prevent dry skin.  No scent to it, which is nice, especially if you have a sensitivity to fragrances.  With Amazon&#x27;s regular shipment service, you get a better price and no having to hunt for the stuff locally (my local stores stopped carrying it).  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this product in a rather unorthodox way...I shave with it.  For as long as I can remember I would get painful razor burn on my face and neck after shaving several days in a row.  I tried every shaving cream and gel out there, and nothing helped.  When on a business trip, I ran out of shaving cream and tried using my Nivea lotion.  It works great, provides a great, close shave, and protects the skin more than shaving cream.  Now I use this product exclusively, and haven&#x27;t bought shaving cream in years.  Once done shaving, I wash my face and neck and then apply a second coat to moisturize my skin.  Razor burn is gone, the pain when shaving is gone, the post-shave discomfort is gone, and my face skin is healthy and never dried out.  Thanks, Nivea...truly a life changing product!</li>
            <li> My husband uses the Nivea for Sensitive Skin and it seems to be the only lotion he has tried that did not burn his skin.  I am happy we were able to locate this over the internet.</li>
            <li> good price. couldn&#x27;t find this in any store</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, I&#x27;ve long needed to use lotion on my face, just one of those things I guess. I started getting dry skin on my face right about when I moved from NZ to UK about 15 years ago, so I do blame the water, but moving to the USA hasn&#x27;t improved things. I suffered for about 2 years trying lots of different (some very expensive) products, and they either didn&#x27;t help or caused side effects like breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;Once I found this stuff I was in heaven. It works, it&#x27;s so light and not greasy, its not coloured or fragrant, it just does what it says on the tin an nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;Now the problem is I noticed a few months back that it started to disappear off of the shelves at various stores, only place I found it was at BBB and I bought all the had. Then they day came when i ran out. I searched, and lo - I found, this fantastic supply of it! I bought 2 cases of the stuff which should last a couple of years, which is when I guess the shelf life expires.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m dreading that day arriving as I will have to start the hunt again, as the replacement from Nivea is just not the same, it leaves my skin oily and causes break outs.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my face.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and moisturizes properly.  I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have any scent.  It lasts a long time so I usually don&#x27;t buy it in bulk but I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores so I saved and little cash with buying in bulk and got the product I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best after shave moisturizer I have ever used. Great product. Too sad that Nivea has discontinued it and has nothing close to it. This was an Alcohol free product and everything out there contains alcohol.</li>
            <li> Have used this lotion for years, but they stopped carrying it in stores. Ordering a 4-pack here was a great solution. It&#x27;s a nice, light lotion for daily use. SPF4 is better than nothing, and considering you&#x27;re a guy who already cares enough to use lotion the SPF is good no matter how little.</li>
            <li> I have tried several post-shave moisturizers over several years, ranging from basement to penthouse brands. This one is the winner, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;Thick and soothing during application but absorbs immediately without any remaining residue. Skin remains soft and elastic throughout the day, even during the dead of winter. I keep a tube in my laptop bag for those times I was rushing and forgot to apply in the AM. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am loking for Nivea for men shaving conditioner. to use with my razor Is this available? I have looked and can&#x27;t find it.  Thank you for you help</li>
            <li> All gone.  Need more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of lotions over the years and this is the only one that works for me. Ever since I started using it daily, my skin is less oily and feels moist all day. As long as they keep making this lotion, I&#x27;ll order it.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product.  Can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore so he was really glad to find it here.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin or make him break out like other products.  Keep it in stock, Thanks!</li>
            <li> I had been looking everywhere for this product in stores since my son uses it daily.  No one around here carried it anymore so I decided to look on Amazon.  I was thrilled to find it and now he has a year supply.</li>
            <li> This is the best product, I use it daily and it really works especially if you are growing a new beard</li>
            <li> I cant find this product in the stores any longer. there is no other product for the price like it</li>
            <li> I am quite appreciative of this company having such an awesome product available. Thanks for providing this option to this consumer!</li>
            <li> Excellent but disco item</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and types of facial moisturizers.  Some that weren&#x27;t labeled &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; were too fragrant or too greasy.  This one is just right.  No flowery fragrance, a tiny amount goes a long way, it doesn&#x27;t cause pimples or any irritation.  And my face doesn&#x27;t feel taught and dry anymore.  This is the one.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this face lotion for many years and love it.  has some spf for sun protection, and it doesn&#x27;t cause my sensitive skin to break out.  smells good and rubs in well.  however over the past year it has become impossible to find at any local drugstore or target...luckily i found it here, not sure what other reviewers are talking about, as this is definitely the same product that i used to buy at the store - not greasy either like i saw some people say.</li>
            <li> I really wish I could agree with all of the stellar reviews!  I was desperately looking for something that was fast absorbing, and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling like I had just slathered Vaseline all over it.  Unfortunately...this stuff leaves your face feeling super greasy.  On the positive side, it does work, and after about 12 hours my face feels almost back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot;, but I can&#x27;t stand the greasiness.  Looks like my face is wet for hours.  I got the 4-pack, and I&#x27;m afraid I may only get through one before I start looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I have ridiculously sensitive skin.  Like Dove soap makes me break out like a lizard.  So I love this moisturizer - works great with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the stores in my area, though, no longer stock this!  And Nivea&#x27;s new sensitive lotion contains chamomille, aloe and other chemicals that irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller delivered me more than a year&#x27;s worth - exactly what I wanted.  Super happy with everything involved.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cream but unfortunately it is being discontinued.  I don&#x27;t what he will do when he&#x27;s out.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many different face lotions for my husbands over the years including expensive brands.  This one is the only one that he asks for again.  He has problems with redness after he shaves and sometimes gets hives from lotions so this one is the best for him.  He likes the consistency, and the fact that it is non-greasy and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe Nivea discontinued this.  This is a great face moisturizer.  Not too thick, not too thin.  Nivea&#x27;s newer product now is too thin and too expensive. Oh, well, stock up on this while you can !</li>
            <li> My husband uses this now in place of a prescription lotion. It&#x27;s really helped reduce redness and irritation on his face.</li>
            <li> I get this for my husband.  He likes that he only has to use a little at a time and its not greasy, and that it has no offending smell.  I love it because it keeps his face from getting to chapped, that his face starts to peal.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a daily facial moisturizer and it works very well with my sensitive skin. The product has no scents or dyes and has an SPF of 4.</li>
