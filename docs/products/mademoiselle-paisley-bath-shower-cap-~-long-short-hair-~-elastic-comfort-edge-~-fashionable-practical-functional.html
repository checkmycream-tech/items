            <li>Great shower cap, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This shower cap it fabulous!!!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m thrilled to have this one to take with me!</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s good, so no water gets in, but</li>
            <li>Seller was good .</li>
            <li>I love it, great fit!!!</li>
            <li>Very cute design.</li>
            <li>Nice shower cub - well made and at a good price.</li>
            <li>This is so much better when I travel!</li>
            <li>Nice looking bath item</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The spotted leopard pattern is cute too.  </li>
            <li>I love the animal print pattern.  </li>
            <li>but I thought it was cute and stylish.</li>
            <li>Was happy to pay this price, just don&#x27;t like the product and REALLY don&#x27;t like the vendor.</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to getting many years of use</li>
            <li>I like it better than one I paid $30.00 for.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and the materials are good quality, but I don&#x27;t ever use it - too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>Covers completely and is made of great quality.  </li>
            <li>However, it slips easily over my forehead into my eyes, making me have to continuously move it up so that it&#x27;s not covering my eyes while I shower.</li>
            <li>Worth the money :)</li>
            <li>Love the pattern, the travel case is super cute, and the cap itself dries really fast.</li>
            <li>So the fit isn&#x27;t great, although again, it does keep my hair dry.</li>
            <li>Was hesitant to spend over $5 for a shower cap, but this one is well worth it!  </li>
            <li>The price was right, the fit was great and my hair stays dry in the shower.  </li>
            <li>But, how cute can you really look in a shower cap?</li>
            <li>These shower caps are very pretty.  </li>
            <li>Trendy, stylish, heavy plastic.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Came early and already in love with it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t think its worth the price.</li>
            <li>The bouffant size is great for people with long hair or a big head like mine.  </li>
            <li>Seemed pretty well made.  </li>
            <li>Pretty.  </li>
            <li>This would be 5 stars if it fit a little better.</li>
            <li>I wanted something with relatively SOFT fabric touching my skin, with the exposed elastic band preferably hemmed, and generally soft plastic so that it compressed well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this shower cap based on the positive review online</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair totally dry, so again, love that.</li>
            <li>It fits very well and holds all your hair in place and not a speck of water will get through.</li>
            <li>Just wish it wouldn&#x27;t slip so much.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room.  </li>
            <li>but when I got it it really wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need another shower cap, but couldn&#x27;t resist the cute leopard print to go with my leopard-printed train cases,and other travel item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and roomy, and can fit long hair (I have short hair) without slipping off.</li>
            <li>cute little carry bag</li>
            <li>Love the little carry pouch....</li>
            <li>I will be ordering again when I need a new one.</li>
            <li>I went online to return it within a month of purchase, but my request was denied, despite the fact that it was brand new and still had the label on.</li>
            <li>so the water comes right off when you hang it to dry.</li>
            <li>A little tight around the elastic and great if you have &#x27;big hair&#x27;</li>
            <li>I also hate how shower caps can easily accumulate that stinky/greasy hair kind of smell</li>
            <li>It holds my long hair in very well.  </li>
            <li>The elastic is tight enough to keep my hair dry and is large enough to fit anyone.  </li>
            <li>Kept my hair dry and had a snug, but not too tight of a fit on my head.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how dry the cap remains even after showering.  </li>

            <li> when I take it with me or when I am done with it, just dry the cap off and put it back in the pouch and hang it up till the next time!  </li>
            <li> The little bag it comes with is really cute and can tie the shower cap up small and tight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I have a pretty average size head for a woman of 31, but this thing is TIGHT!  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is it seems to take a bit longer to dry than my other one, but I haven&#x27;t used that one in awhile</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> It keeps my head dry in the shower.</li>
            <li> and I can get all of my hair (in a bun or loose, either way) in it with room to spare.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been pretty difficult to find a shower cap that can contain and hold my entire head of hair while I shower.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair (middle of back length)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really an animal print person</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit too tight actually as I always have an imprinted line on my forehead when I get out of the shower and remove the cap</li>
            <li> I would like to see other patterns to chose from.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find any shower caps to buy these days, despite the fact that a shower cap is an essential item for the process of coloring one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Fairly stiff plastic, not particularly comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear this cap - it slips down to my eyes and needs to be readjusted continually.</li>
            <li> It fits snuggly around the opening but not too tight</li>
            <li> I hate the plastic cheap caps whenever I want to prepoo or DC, so I went ahead and purchased this.</li>
            <li> so perhaps I&#x27;m wrong.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Way too big (and I have a big head!). I can&#x27;t wear this cap - it slips down to my eyes and needs to be readjusted continually. It&#x27;s cute and the materials are good quality, but I don&#x27;t ever use it - too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I have a pretty average size head for a woman of 31, but this thing is TIGHT!  I guess that&#x27;s good, so no water gets in, but sheesh! Sassy print, too.</li>
            <li> Nice shower cub - well made and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  I love it.  The elastic is tight enough to keep my hair dry and is large enough to fit anyone.  I will be ordering again when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> This cap is not a cheapo.  It holds my long hair in very well.  I was surprised how dry the cap remains even after showering.  The spotted leopard pattern is cute too.  But, how cute can you really look in a shower cap?</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> A little tight around the elastic and great if you have &#x27;big hair&#x27;</li>
            <li> Nice looking bath item but I really don&#x27;t think its worth the price. Oh well</li>
            <li> These shower caps are very pretty.  I love the animal print pattern.

My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit too tight actually as I always have an imprinted line on my forehead when I get out of the shower and remove the cap but well worth it. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love it, great fit!!!</li>
            <li> shower caps are wonderful..wish they have the zebra print will buy..excellent..</li>
            <li> This would be 5 stars if it fit a little better. Love the pattern, the travel case is super cute, and the cap itself dries really fast.

            <li> Grandmas was happy.  Seemed pretty well made.  She was impressed.</li>
            <li> Quality wonderful. Pretty.  Gift for mother in law. Travel bag a big plus since they travel a lot. .</li>
            <li> Came early and already in love with it. I&#x27;m not really an animal print person but I thought it was cute and stylish. I hate the plastic cheap caps whenever I want to prepoo or DC, so I went ahead and purchased this. It&#x27;s nice and roomy, and can fit long hair (I have short hair) without slipping off. I don&#x27;t mind the print it leaves on my forehead. The travel pouch is a bonus because it can keep it tucked away when not in use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need another shower cap, but couldn&#x27;t resist the cute leopard print to go with my leopard-printed train cases,and other travel item. The little bag it comes with is really cute and can tie the shower cap up small and tight so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room.  It is durable and does the job. I have fine hair, a few inches past my shoulders, and I can tie it up in a pony tail and it fits all of my hair. The only thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is it seems to take a bit longer to dry than my other one, but I haven&#x27;t used that one in awhile so perhaps I&#x27;m wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought this shower cap based on the positive review online but when I got it it really wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. I wanted something with relatively SOFT fabric touching my skin, with the exposed elastic band preferably hemmed, and generally soft plastic so that it compressed well.&lt;br /&gt;PRO: attractive leopard print, cute little carry bag&lt;br /&gt;CON: larger and bulkier than it appeared, a lot of space to allocate for a shower cap esp for travel. Exposed elastic band. Fairly stiff plastic, not particularly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNFRIENDLY RETURN POLICY:  I went online to return it within a month of purchase, but my request was denied, despite the fact that it was brand new and still had the label on. Stated that it was beyond the allowable return period, but didn&#x27;t state what that was? 1 week? I was out of town; I think under 1 month should be fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m stuck with something I won&#x27;t use, and will go back to just using the freebies I&#x27;ve picked up from hotel amenity packages. Was happy to pay this price, just don&#x27;t like the product and REALLY don&#x27;t like the vendor.</li>
            <li> Great coverage if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> This item is great. I love the color. It keeps my head dry in the shower. I like its pouch. I bought this with travel in mind.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant to spend over $5 for a shower cap, but this one is well worth it!  Covers completely and is made of great quality.  Won&#x27;t need to buy another shower cap for a while.</li>
            <li> This is a cut packaging of the cap in a sack. I like the print as I have a leopard print rug in my bathroom and this continues the theme. Seller was good .</li>
            <li> Trendy, stylish, heavy plastic.  Looking forward to getting many years of use</li>
            <li> The price was right, the fit was great and my hair stays dry in the shower.  Love the little carry pouch....great when I take it with me or when I am done with it, just dry the cap off and put it back in the pouch and hang it up till the next time!  It is an excellent price.  I like it better than one I paid $30.00 for.</li>
            <li> Great shower cap, just what I was looking for. Kept my hair dry and had a snug, but not too tight of a fit on my head. Made of plastic so the water comes right off when you hang it to dry. Very cute design.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for showers...when you don&#x27;t want to ruin your hair-do!</li>
            <li> This is such a great product!! Worth the money :)</li>
            <li> This shower cap it fabulous!!! I have long, thick hair (middle of back length) and I can get all of my hair (in a bun or loose, either way) in it with room to spare. This is so much better when I travel! I have to use two of the shower caps the hotel provides so I&#x27;m thrilled to have this one to take with me!</li>
