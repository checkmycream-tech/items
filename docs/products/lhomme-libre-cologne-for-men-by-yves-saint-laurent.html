            <li>the smell catches attention very nice..</li>
            <li>Very nice sense of freshness and \\&quot;day-time\\&quot; scent.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very nice and manly.</li>
            <li>The scent also elicits compliments, so if you don&#x27;t believe me, believe the ladies who took the time to tell me they liked it!</li>
            <li>Loved being able to find it on Amazon for a great price!</li>
            <li>It has been a pleasant surprise and is my go to cologne now.</li>
            <li>should add that this feels more like a winter cologne and might not be ideal for a&lt;br /&gt;sweaty summer.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loved it</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend and he loved</li>
            <li>Although he loved the scent, but the bottle was leaking and we couldn&#x27;t find the crack.</li>
            <li>I received L&#x27;Homme Libre from amazon today its a nice smelling scent for a great price</li>
            <li>This is a good \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; fragrance that transitions well from school/work to a night out.</li>
            <li>so the price they&#x27;re selling it for here is insanely good.</li>
            <li>Everything was good.  </li>
            <li>Smells SO good.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li>I love it and amazingly happy with my purchase! :)</li>
            <li>I looked at all the various websites selling this product and found that Amazon.com offered the best price and learned through the experience that the service and shipping were perfect.</li>
            <li>Love it, and Oooh!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>the ladies love it, then you will to!</li>
            <li>smells amazing...</li>
            <li>This cologne smells amazing</li>
            <li>I have received compliments from men and women at work on how nice I smell.</li>
            <li>The cologne is the best; even my husband liked the smell [unusual</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice perfume.</li>
            <li>I own the Aqua De Gio - and this perfume does not match that scent.</li>
            <li>The person I bought it for really liked it</li>
            <li>NIce.  </li>
            <li>I have the original L&#x27;Homme (a great fragrance BTW), which is a staple in my cabinet, alongside some Chanel colognes.</li>
            <li>I have had many people tell me how great I smell when I wear it which makes me want to buy more and more of it.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent and I love it too!  </li>
            <li>Has a wonderful fresh spice &amp; woody aroma that is unique.</li>
            <li>I love light scented fresh smells and its awesome</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made for my husband!</li>
            <li>One of my best choices in cologne so far.  </li>
            <li>I dont like the smell to strong, my son tell me !</li>
            <li>This is an all-around great smelling cologne that I&#x27;d recommend wearing in Spring/Fall/Winter, as I&#x27;m imagining this cologne just not smelling very good on a hot summer day.</li>
            <li>Unique and in a good way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice to smell once it&#x27;s first sprayed but within an hour the smell is gone, it needs to be reapplied.</li>
            <li>The seller packaged this very well, and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the product.</li>
            <li>and I must say I&#x27;m really enjoying it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this YSL L&#x27;Homme Libre and i have enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>watery scent notes I get from L&#x27;homme Libre along with a touch of spicyness are exquisite and different!</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>Many compliments.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne and my girlfriends favorite that i have.</li>
            <li>I just love this cologne.  </li>
            <li>I sampled it at a retail store and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I have a bottle of this and absolutely love it...</li>
            <li>Personally, I think this scent is so great!</li>
            <li>It was a refreshing smell, so I thought...</li>
            <li>If you are able to do so more power to you</li>
            <li>but there are better fragrances out there in this category.</li>
            <li>and I have received many comments.</li>
            <li>but this is one that everyone will love.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve gotten many compliments when i&#x27;ve worn it myself.</li>
            <li>Love the stuff... not too much more to say about it.</li>
            <li>I love how this cologne smells.</li>
            <li>This cologne is a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice fragrance and considered a \\&quot;flanker\\&quot; for the main L&#x27;Homme fragrance line.</li>
            <li>WOMEN LOVE IT,AND WAS DELIVERED RIGHT AWAY TOO!!</li>
            <li>Does not smell like the original one!</li>
            <li>gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very fresh, wont offend anyone, and personally think it is the perfect scent for what i was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have purchased this Spray before from a store and liked it right away.</li>
            <li>The Ladies Love it Mooooore! ; )</li>
            <li>I will literally sit next to him and smell him whenever he wears it because it smells so good!</li>
            <li>I thought it was so elegant, and clean.  </li>
            <li>It just starts off strong......</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear a lot of cologne because strong scents nauseate me, but no complaints there with this.</li>
            <li>I like it more than the original, its fresher and more wearable for daytime/work wear, but also can be an upscale fragrance for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>First off, this scent smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelt!!</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with this product, it has a distinct smell and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, that aside, the fragrance itself is fine.</li>
            <li>HUge</li>
            <li>and I downgraded to the extremely cheap but</li>
            <li>my boyfriend loves it and it smells fantastic on him</li>
            <li>he is still using the product and smelling fantastic.</li>
            <li>Smells rather cheap.</li>
            <li>I am very choosy about perfume because I can&#x27;t wear all kind all perfume.</li>
            <li>and I liked it a lot, but not as much as L&#x27;Homme,</li>
            <li>Enjoy it and buy it.</li>
            <li>Good for young professionals</li>
            <li>its not the best smell ever, dont get me wrong its good...</li>
            <li>I sprayed it on my wrist to make sure it was the right one, and it is.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very powerful.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;H smells nice and clean but the scent disappears pretty quickly and the LNDL&#x27;H is VERY spicy and very strong.</li>
            <li>Clean but cheap.</li>
            <li>If you like fresh and sweet cologne, there is non better.</li>
            <li>Its a really unique cologne</li>
            <li>the one hand, L&#x27;Homme Libre isn&#x27;t original.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a nice smell to catch the attention of a fine young woman on a night out...</li>
            <li>Like I said its a nice smell - but many other better colognes out there.</li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Leaves you smelling clean.</li>
            <li>To me, the scent is clean and not overbearing.</li>
            <li>It is by far one of his favorite scents of all time!</li>
            <li>I will say that I will most certainly buy this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I know a lot about the cologne out there, at least at dillards fragrance store and the reviews on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Libre has tonka bean in it, the best note that can be in any fragrance.</li>
            <li>But this one really gives me a pleasure for sure.</li>
            <li>it last forever and is good on nose.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell</li>
            <li>I received a tester for this cologne thru an offer on Xbox Live and was quite surprised by how great it smelled.  </li>
            <li>Thia is true the odor fades away too quickly.</li>
            <li>It is fresh and unique.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very clean and fresh smelling without being too aquatic.</li>
            <li>ELEGANT, CLASSY, SOSHITICATED, &amp; SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>, the smell is good (as it should be) but does not lasts long.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite new cologne.</li>
            <li>Truly a long lasting great smelling product!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell extremely masculine (which may be why the ladies like it so much), and has a nice woody/spicy/aqua-y aroma.</li>
            <li>My requirements are that the odor should be&lt;br /&gt;light, fresh and it should not offend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sort of minty and fresh, but comes across as more sophisticated than other &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; fragrances.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li>When I sprayed it on for the first time, I was like damn this ish is strong, but after a while it begans to settle in and calm down and smell nice.....</li>
            <li>Strong enough to last and give the cologne a good oomph of manliness without being over powering.</li>
            <li>I got a trial size from an xbox live offer and was hooked, had to find a regular size bottle, found this one and the price was too good to pass up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about fakes ordering online, but it got here fast and is genuine, I highly reccomend!</li>
            <li>This is a more moderate, soft scent, so it&#x27;s fine to wear in just about any setting and you won&#x27;t have to worry about anyone being overwhelmed by it, unless of course, you decide to douse yourself in it.</li>
            <li>i love this perfume,, it is definitly the original, dont listen to anybodyz bad review, its is the real thing, my wife bought me my first YSL from amazon and it was fantastic, this one is as awesome as the last one ,,</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it, and so do I!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more for the younger man though, so if you&#x27;re looking for a smell that will compliment you well at the cigar bar</li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>It came faster than expected and it was still in the package nice and neat</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Otherwise you will be paying $20 more for the exact same product...</li>
            <li>I am definitely an avid cologne collecto.</li>
            <li>but the great value is how long it last...</li>
            <li>I was interested in this myself and ended up buying two of them after showing my pops how this smelt.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how to explain the description like oak,rose</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It is the real deal, NO DUPES HERE!</li>
            <li>This is a good one for everyday use.</li>
            <li>THis is, by far, my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li>This is not my favorite fragrance, but for the quality, value, and versatility, it&#x27;s hard to get much better than L&#x27;Homme Libre.</li>
            <li>and I have to agree with each positive review on here...</li>
            <li>It is not a fake as it is the real cologne</li>
            <li>I am aware that a lot of reviewers don&#x27;t like this as much when compared to La Nuit De L&#x27;homme</li>
            <li>the bottle itself is gorgeous and heavy!</li>
            <li>It opens with a sweet top note that dries down very well.</li>
            <li>The scent also fades quickly - it stays on the skin itself all day, but you can&#x27;t smell it around you after a couple of hours, so naturally neither can anyone else.</li>
            <li>Certainly wows the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t project as much as the other two colognes, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s a more subtle for an evening night out, this is a great option to have in the collection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than other places, and was glad to see it arrived exactly as described, and in the retail packaging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to really describe the smell of it, but it&#x27;s really, really good.</li>
            <li>My wife really enjoys it as well.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very timely and it was 53% off.</li>
            <li>I can not resist smelling it or spraying it on me, its not offensive what so ever, and you can spray it on as much as you want, its never over baring.</li>
            <li>I really dont think that its something</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this cologne to anyone looking for an all-around great scent that gets quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li>Hahaha, this is my number one Cologne in my collection.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>As one of my predecessors wrote :the top notes project very well for the first 30 minutes, then it calms down.</li>
            <li>Besides even the bottle lookes differently from the original ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is not a typical scent and differs in good ways to the usual aquatic citrusy type of men&#x27;s scents we see nowadays.</li>
            <li>Smells EXACTLY like my old spice men&#x27;s shampoo.</li>
            <li>what I can say is so far I&#x27;ve got nothing but positive comments</li>
            <li>you are looking for a fresh, clean long lasting scent I would highly recommend this cologne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I give this a high five for quality and wonderfullness.</li>
            <li>The box I received WAS a little sketch (when you take out the insert, you can see areas of the cardboard that were cut away with a utility knife), but the scent is OK and nothing leaked.</li>
            <li>overall, its not my home run smell, but its worth a try.</li>
            <li>got a sample of Libre from Xbox LIVE</li>
            <li>its been a while since buying a new fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to any man that is looking for a new scent.</li>
            <li>I would say buy this, if you want to try something new....</li>
            <li>goood price got from xbox live as</li>
            <li>Was looking for an everyday cologne, and smelt this fragrance at the mall and thought this would be great for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got some for my dad a few Christmas&#x27; back and in return I also got this product because it smells really nice and all the shawtys gettin on ya</li>
            <li>I like this cologne because it is not super strong like some others that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, but gives a long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his first time actually wearing cologne (he was an axe lover)</li>
            <li>Im looking for more cologne options and hoping that someone with similar taste can recommend me other names.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>Even the bottle looks less classy, with the transparent, cheap plastic cap and thinner glass.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, has a crisp fresh&lt;br /&gt;smell and doesn&#x27;t offend my nose.</li>
            <li>But not last so much.</li>
            <li>The cologne smells amzing but it doesn&#x27;t last much.</li>
            <li>a free sample.i wear it everyday</li>
            <li>Not TOO masculine or sporty.  </li>
            <li>That scent is just WOW.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s probably my least favorite of the four.</li>
            <li>It says it&#x27;s available at Dillards and other department stores for the same prices of 3.3oz&#x3D;75, 2.0 59 and etc.</li>
            <li>Clean smell, but a little</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s DISHONEST to post a higher price than its retail on amazon and then pretend to offer a discount.&lt;br /&gt;Personally if the same price, I&#x27;d rather go buy from depatment store...readily available.</li>
            <li>prices are mainly the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I highly recommend this cologne, although, if you want to go for a show stopper, definitely get YSL- La Nuit De L&#x27;Homme.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it is a little soapy smelling in the beginning, but when it dries on the skin, it transforms a little bit and leaves amazing undertones.  </li>
            <li>I bought this cologne because I wanted to try something new after years of having only Armani Code and Burberry.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Not that I mind citrusy or aquatic scents but after so many different designers having the same similar scent, it can get repetitive.</li>
            <li>Burberry Brit is a near second.</li>
            <li>WOW i can smell it on my shirt the next day as if i just sprayed it....</li>
            <li>/&gt;After purchasing and using it for a few days, i have determined that this fragrance does not project very far, and stays very close to the skin.</li>
            <li>I actually do like a masculine scent (such as dolce and gabbana)</li>
            <li>The only downfall I have with this cologne is that it costs about $10 too much if you ask me, and its longevity is only slightly above average.</li>

            <li> I found that L&#x27;HL was the best of both worlds.</li>

            <li> the smell catches attention very nice..</li>
            <li> Very nice sense of freshness and \\&quot;day-time\\&quot; scent.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very nice and manly.</li>
            <li> The scent also elicits compliments, so if you don&#x27;t believe me, believe the ladies who took the time to tell me they liked it!</li>
            <li> Loved being able to find it on Amazon for a great price!</li>
            <li> It has been a pleasant surprise and is my go to cologne now.</li>
            <li> should add that this feels more like a winter cologne and might not be ideal for a&lt;br /&gt;sweaty summer.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loved</li>
            <li> Although he loved the scent, but the bottle was leaking and we couldn&#x27;t find the crack.</li>
            <li> I received L&#x27;Homme Libre from amazon today its a nice smelling scent for a great price</li>
            <li> This is a good \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; fragrance that transitions well from school/work to a night out.</li>
            <li> so the price they&#x27;re selling it for here is insanely good.</li>
            <li> Everything was good.  </li>
            <li> Smells SO good.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li> I love it and amazingly happy with my purchase! :)</li>
            <li> I looked at all the various websites selling this product and found that Amazon.com offered the best price and learned through the experience that the service and shipping were perfect.</li>
            <li> Love it, and Oooh!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> the ladies love it, then you will to!</li>
            <li> smells amazing...</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing</li>
            <li> I have received compliments from men and women at work on how nice I smell.</li>
            <li> The cologne is the best; even my husband liked the smell [unusual</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice perfume.</li>
            <li> I own the Aqua De Gio - and this perfume does not match that scent.</li>
            <li> The person I bought it for really liked it</li>
            <li> NIce.  </li>
            <li> I have the original L&#x27;Homme (a great fragrance BTW), which is a staple in my cabinet, alongside some Chanel colognes.</li>
            <li> I have had many people tell me how great I smell when I wear it which makes me want to buy more and more of it.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent and I love it too!  </li>
            <li> Has a wonderful fresh spice &amp; woody aroma that is unique.</li>
            <li> I love light scented fresh smells and its awesome</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made for my husband!</li>
            <li> One of my best choices in cologne so far.  </li>
            <li> I dont like the smell to strong, my son tell me !</li>
            <li> This is an all-around great smelling cologne that I&#x27;d recommend wearing in Spring/Fall/Winter, as I&#x27;m imagining this cologne just not smelling very good on a hot summer day.</li>
            <li> Unique and in a good way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice to smell once it&#x27;s first sprayed but within an hour the smell is gone, it needs to be reapplied.</li>
            <li> The seller packaged this very well, and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the product.</li>
            <li> and I must say I&#x27;m really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this YSL L&#x27;Homme Libre and i have enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> watery scent notes I get from L&#x27;homme Libre along with a touch of spicyness are exquisite and different!</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> Many compliments.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne and my girlfriends favorite that i have.</li>
            <li> I just love this cologne.  </li>
            <li> I sampled it at a retail store and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I have a bottle of this and absolutely love it...</li>
            <li> Personally, I think this scent is so great!</li>
            <li> It was a refreshing smell, so I thought...</li>
            <li> If you are able to do so more power to you</li>
            <li> but there are better fragrances out there in this category.</li>
            <li> and I have received many comments.</li>
            <li> but this is one that everyone will love.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve gotten many compliments when i&#x27;ve worn it myself.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff... not too much more to say about it.</li>
            <li> I love how this cologne smells.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice fragrance and considered a \\&quot;flanker\\&quot; for the main L&#x27;Homme fragrance line.</li>
            <li> WOMEN LOVE IT,AND WAS DELIVERED RIGHT AWAY TOO!!</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the original one!</li>
            <li> gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very fresh, wont offend anyone, and personally think it is the perfect scent for what i was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have purchased this Spray before from a store and liked it right away.</li>
            <li> The Ladies Love it Mooooore! ; )</li>
            <li> I will literally sit next to him and smell him whenever he wears it because it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I thought it was so elegant, and clean.  </li>
            <li> It just starts off strong......</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of cologne because strong scents nauseate me, but no complaints there with this.</li>
            <li> I like it more than the original, its fresher and more wearable for daytime/work wear, but also can be an upscale fragrance for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> First off, this scent smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> Hands down the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelt!!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this product, it has a distinct smell and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, that aside, the fragrance itself is fine.</li>
            <li> HUge</li>
            <li> and I downgraded to the extremely cheap but</li>
            <li> my boyfriend loves it and it smells fantastic on him</li>
            <li> he is still using the product and smelling fantastic.</li>
            <li> Smells rather cheap.</li>
            <li> I am very choosy about perfume because I can&#x27;t wear all kind all perfume.</li>
            <li> and I liked it a lot, but not as much as L&#x27;Homme,</li>
            <li> Enjoy it and buy it.</li>
            <li> Good for young professionals</li>
            <li> its not the best smell ever, dont get me wrong its good...</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on my wrist to make sure it was the right one, and it is.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very powerful.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;H smells nice and clean but the scent disappears pretty quickly and the LNDL&#x27;H is VERY spicy and very strong.</li>
            <li> Clean but cheap.</li>
            <li> If you like fresh and sweet cologne, there is non better.</li>
            <li> Its a really unique cologne</li>
            <li> the one hand, L&#x27;Homme Libre isn&#x27;t original.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a nice smell to catch the attention of a fine young woman on a night out...</li>
            <li> Like I said its a nice smell - but many other better colognes out there.</li>
            <li> It smells great and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Leaves you smelling clean.</li>
            <li> To me, the scent is clean and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> It is by far one of his favorite scents of all time!</li>
            <li> I will say that I will most certainly buy this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I know a lot about the cologne out there, at least at dillards fragrance store and the reviews on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Libre has tonka bean in it, the best note that can be in any fragrance.</li>
            <li> But this one really gives me a pleasure for sure.</li>
            <li> it last forever and is good on nose.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell</li>
            <li> I received a tester for this cologne thru an offer on Xbox Live and was quite surprised by how great it smelled.  </li>
            <li> Thia is true the odor fades away too quickly.</li>
            <li> It is fresh and unique.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very clean and fresh smelling without being too aquatic.</li>
            <li> ELEGANT, CLASSY, SOSHITICATED, &amp; SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> , the smell is good (as it should be) but does not lasts long.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite new cologne.</li>
            <li> Truly a long lasting great smelling product!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell extremely masculine (which may be why the ladies like it so much), and has a nice woody/spicy/aqua-y aroma.</li>
            <li> My requirements are that the odor should be&lt;br /&gt;light, fresh and it should not offend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sort of minty and fresh, but comes across as more sophisticated than other &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; fragrances.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li> When I sprayed it on for the first time, I was like damn this ish is strong, but after a while it begans to settle in and calm down and smell nice.....</li>
            <li> Strong enough to last and give the cologne a good oomph of manliness without being over powering.</li>
            <li> I got a trial size from an xbox live offer and was hooked, had to find a regular size bottle, found this one and the price was too good to pass up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about fakes ordering online, but it got here fast and is genuine, I highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> This is a more moderate, soft scent, so it&#x27;s fine to wear in just about any setting and you won&#x27;t have to worry about anyone being overwhelmed by it, unless of course, you decide to douse yourself in it.</li>
            <li> i love this perfume,, it is definitly the original, dont listen to anybodyz bad review, its is the real thing, my wife bought me my first YSL from amazon and it was fantastic, this one is as awesome as the last one ,,</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it, and so do I!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely more for the younger man though, so if you&#x27;re looking for a smell that will compliment you well at the cigar bar</li>
            <li> ;).</li>
            <li> It came faster than expected and it was still in the package nice and neat</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Otherwise you will be paying $20 more for the exact same product...</li>
            <li> I am definitely an avid cologne collecto.</li>
            <li> but the great value is how long it last...</li>
            <li> I was interested in this myself and ended up buying two of them after showing my pops how this smelt.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly how to explain the description like oak,rose</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is the real deal, NO DUPES HERE!</li>
            <li> This is a good one for everyday use.</li>
            <li> THis is, by far, my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite fragrance, but for the quality, value, and versatility, it&#x27;s hard to get much better than L&#x27;Homme Libre.</li>
            <li> and I have to agree with each positive review on here...</li>
            <li> It is not a fake as it is the real cologne</li>
            <li> I am aware that a lot of reviewers don&#x27;t like this as much when compared to La Nuit De L&#x27;homme</li>
            <li> the bottle itself is gorgeous and heavy!</li>
            <li> It opens with a sweet top note that dries down very well.</li>
            <li> The scent also fades quickly - it stays on the skin itself all day, but you can&#x27;t smell it around you after a couple of hours, so naturally neither can anyone else.</li>
            <li> Certainly wows the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t project as much as the other two colognes, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s a more subtle for an evening night out, this is a great option to have in the collection.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than other places, and was glad to see it arrived exactly as described, and in the retail packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to really describe the smell of it, but it&#x27;s really, really good.</li>
            <li> My wife really enjoys it as well.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very timely and it was 53% off.</li>
            <li> I can not resist smelling it or spraying it on me, its not offensive what so ever, and you can spray it on as much as you want, its never over baring.</li>
            <li> I really dont think that its something</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this cologne to anyone looking for an all-around great scent that gets quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> Hahaha, this is my number one Cologne in my collection.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> As one of my predecessors wrote :the top notes project very well for the first 30 minutes, then it calms down.</li>
            <li> Besides even the bottle lookes differently from the original ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is not a typical scent and differs in good ways to the usual aquatic citrusy type of men&#x27;s scents we see nowadays.</li>
            <li> Smells EXACTLY like my old spice men&#x27;s shampoo.</li>
            <li> what I can say is so far I&#x27;ve got nothing but positive comments</li>
            <li> you are looking for a fresh, clean long lasting scent I would highly recommend this cologne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I give this a high five for quality and wonderfullness.</li>
            <li> The box I received WAS a little sketch (when you take out the insert, you can see areas of the cardboard that were cut away with a utility knife), but the scent is OK and nothing leaked.</li>
            <li> overall, its not my home run smell, but its worth a try.</li>
            <li> got a sample of Libre from Xbox LIVE</li>
            <li> its been a while since buying a new fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any man that is looking for a new scent.</li>
            <li> I would say buy this, if you want to try something new....</li>
            <li> goood price got from xbox live as</li>
            <li> Was looking for an everyday cologne, and smelt this fragrance at the mall and thought this would be great for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got some for my dad a few Christmas&#x27; back and in return I also got this product because it smells really nice and all the shawtys gettin on ya</li>
            <li> I like this cologne because it is not super strong like some others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, but gives a long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s his first time actually wearing cologne (he was an axe lover)</li>
            <li> Im looking for more cologne options and hoping that someone with similar taste can recommend me other names.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Even the bottle looks less classy, with the transparent, cheap plastic cap and thinner glass.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, has a crisp fresh&lt;br /&gt;smell and doesn&#x27;t offend my nose.</li>
            <li> But not last so much.</li>
            <li> The cologne smells amzing but it doesn&#x27;t last much.</li>
            <li> a free sample.i wear it everyday</li>
            <li> Not TOO masculine or sporty.  </li>
            <li> That scent is just WOW.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s probably my least favorite of the four.</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s available at Dillards and other department stores for the same prices of 3.3oz&#x3D;75, 2.0 59 and etc.</li>
            <li> Clean smell, but a little</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s DISHONEST to post a higher price than its retail on amazon and then pretend to offer a discount.&lt;br /&gt;Personally if the same price, I&#x27;d rather go buy from depatment store...readily available.</li>
            <li> prices are mainly the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I highly recommend this cologne, although, if you want to go for a show stopper, definitely get YSL- La Nuit De L&#x27;Homme.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little soapy smelling in the beginning, but when it dries on the skin, it transforms a little bit and leaves amazing undertones.  </li>
            <li> I bought this cologne because I wanted to try something new after years of having only Armani Code and Burberry.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Not that I mind citrusy or aquatic scents but after so many different designers having the same similar scent, it can get repetitive.</li>
            <li> Burberry Brit is a near second.</li>
            <li> WOW i can smell it on my shirt the next day as if i just sprayed it....</li>
            <li> /&gt;After purchasing and using it for a few days, i have determined that this fragrance does not project very far, and stays very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> I actually do like a masculine scent (such as dolce and gabbana)</li>
            <li> The only downfall I have with this cologne is that it costs about $10 too much if you ask me, and its longevity is only slightly above average.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;homme Libre is steps above Davidoff Echo by far and in my opinion different from the other L&#x27;homme scents..</li>
            <li> The smell does last for a long time, which I do like....</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It is hard to say much about this product, so this review will be short.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too strong and it isn&#x27;t too weak, and just a few sprays last all day.</li>
            <li> I blindly bought this cologne from just reading the reviews and I am very satisfied to say the least.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a scent in a long time</li>
            <li> The mid notes last for maybe two and a half hours.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this cologne on a regular basis if you like other YSL colognes you will probably like this as well.</li>
            <li> I bought it from amazon because I got the large bottle for less $ than what I paid for the small bottle</li>
            <li> Since Libre is a new fragrance (2011), it is highly unlikely that Amazon is selling old stock, testers, etc.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it to a friend, but I&#x27;m still going to wear it because I spent the money on it.</li>
            <li> It was designed for a younger demographic and it&#x27;s one of those aquatic, sporty fragrances that people either love or hate.</li>
            <li> , I think high schoolers might have a tough time pulling it</li>
            <li> The smell actually stayed on my wrist for another day, and that was after heavy exercise and showering!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not sure about buying it without smelling it, go to your local department store, and test it out.</li>
            <li> I chose Amazon due to my 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li> For those who agree what other colognes are your favorites?</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time and I usually get complimented on it.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t identify scents or anything like that, so this review is for the average layperson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Star Cologne Hands Down.</li>
            <li> Try it out at your local store and you will see what i mean.</li>
            <li> Its average length is about 4 hours, or less but it leaves a lite smell on you no matter what.</li>
            <li> I like this cologne and would purchase it along with a few other brands.</li>
            <li> At this rate (1 spray few days per week) this bottle should last me at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> And this scent is not for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Never the less.....</li>
            <li> I was a little scared because I never smelled it before.</li>
            <li> It smells a lot like Bleu de Chanel and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if they copied Bleu a little bit.</li>
            <li> I think it is not original</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its not overwhelming and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Not much more to say .</li>
            <li> I know it can be hard to shop for a scent for someone else</li>
            <li> I wear it almost daily, and haven&#x27;t gotten sick of it.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I have spritzed this every morning since I got it and haven&#x27;t tired of it.  </li>
            <li> but the price was way to expensive at the store</li>
            <li> SO EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t wear this and go wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong one (according to him)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any crazy stories to tell about how this cologne got me the woman of my dreams or the one night stand</li>
            <li> My man made me SO MAD!</li>
            <li> After 3 hours, the scent starts to fade to the point where I can&#x27;t even detect the base notes.</li>
            <li> so this one that I have bough is the worst.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it, and so do I! I sprayed it on my wrist to make sure it was the right one, and it is. The smell actually stayed on my wrist for another day, and that was after heavy exercise and showering! The seller packaged this very well, and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the product. Not to mention, its a lot cheaper than it is at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I like this cologne and would purchase it along with a few other brands. My wife really enjoys it as well.</li>
            <li> I love it and amazingly happy with my purchase! :)</li>
            <li> Since you can&#x27;t give a product any half-stars... 4.5/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample of Libre from Xbox LIVE and I must say I&#x27;m really enjoying it. It&#x27;s hard for me to really describe the smell of it, but it&#x27;s really, really good. It doesn&#x27;t smell extremely masculine (which may be why the ladies like it so much), and has a nice woody/spicy/aqua-y aroma. This is an all-around great smelling cologne that I&#x27;d recommend wearing in Spring/Fall/Winter, as I&#x27;m imagining this cologne just not smelling very good on a hot summer day. The only downfall I have with this cologne is that it costs about $10 too much if you ask me, and its longevity is only slightly above average. Regardless, this is a sure-fire hit for any guy that&#x27;s between about the ages of 20 and 30.</li>
            <li> Wow! I have another one besides the sport!.... Love it, and Oooh! The Ladies Love it Mooooore! ; )</li>
            <li> Great product, great quality , 100% recommended</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and service. I looked at all the various websites selling this product and found that Amazon.com offered the best price and learned through the experience that the service and shipping were perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cologne ever since Acqua Di Gio was claimed by teenagers.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s Burberry sport that I like and I downgraded to the extremely cheap but&lt;br /&gt;crsip/light Claiborne Cologne For Men. My requirements are that the odor should be&lt;br /&gt;light, fresh and it should not offend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne meets all those requirements. It lasts a long time, has a crisp fresh&lt;br /&gt;smell and doesn&#x27;t offend my nose. Hopefully it will be a while before the kids get&lt;br /&gt;to this cologne. Having said that, every nose and skin are different and I recommend&lt;br /&gt;you get a sniff at your local store first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that this feels more like a winter cologne and might not be ideal for a&lt;br /&gt;sweaty summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m inlove with this scent . I was a little scared because I never smelled it before. I&#x27;m glad I bought it!!!</li>
            <li> I like this cologne because it is not super strong like some others that I have tried. This is a good one for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I love this! I bought it for my husband for Christmas and it smells so yummy! He loves it! HUge bottle and the bottle itself is gorgeous and heavy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this YSL L&#x27;Homme Libre and i have enjoyed it. Since it arrived, this is actually my second bottle, so hopefully that explains a lot about it. I love light scented fresh smells and its awesome</li>
            <li> Just got this as a gift from the wifey and man does it smell great! This is not a typical scent and differs in good ways to the usual aquatic citrusy type of men&#x27;s scents we see nowadays. Not that I mind citrusy or aquatic scents but after so many different designers having the same similar scent, it can get repetitive. The combination of the violet leafs with the ozonic watery scent notes I get from L&#x27;homme Libre along with a touch of spicyness are exquisite and different! Great for day or night, very good projection and I don&#x27;t get the same type of similar scent as Davidoff Echo as some that critique this fragrance have mentioned.. L&#x27;homme Libre is steps above Davidoff Echo by far and in my opinion different from the other L&#x27;homme scents..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any crazy stories to tell about how this cologne got me the woman of my dreams or the one night stand I&#x27;ll never forget, but what I can say is so far I&#x27;ve got nothing but positive comments and I have to agree with each positive review on here...it lasts for a while. After a nine hour shift where I&#x27;m going in and out of kitchens, trash compactors, cash control rooms, and even outside I could still smell this on me. It&#x27;s definitely more for the younger man though, so if you&#x27;re looking for a smell that will compliment you well at the cigar bar you&#x27;ll probably want to pass, but if you&#x27;re looking for a nice smell to catch the attention of a fine young woman on a night out...this will definitely do the job well ;).</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT!! WOMEN LOVE IT,AND WAS DELIVERED RIGHT AWAY TOO!! I GET COMPLIMENTED ON HOW GOOD IT SMELLS EVERY TIME I USE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I received a tester for this cologne thru an offer on Xbox Live and was quite surprised by how great it smelled.  I haven&#x27;t bought a scent in a long time (the last scent I bought was OP Juice)so its been a while since buying a new fragrance.  I have to say I have spritzed this every morning since I got it and haven&#x27;t tired of it.  Its not overwhelming and lasts all day.  Its a really unique cologne and I will definitely buy again once I run out.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite new cologne. I got a trial size from an xbox live offer and was hooked, had to find a regular size bottle, found this one and the price was too good to pass up.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! It&#x27;s his first time actually wearing cologne (he was an axe lover) thankfully I changed that. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this product, it has a distinct smell and lasts a long time. I would recommend this product to any man that is looking for a new scent. The shipping was very timely and it was 53% off. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> THis is, by far, my new favorite scent. Burberry Brit is a near second. It is a little pricey, but totally worth it. Scent sticks around for awhile.</li>
            <li> I bought a Men&#x27;s health magazine and there was an ad for this fragrance in it. It says it&#x27;s available at Dillards and other department stores for the same prices of 3.3oz&#x3D;75, 2.0 59 and etc. It&#x27;s DISHONEST to post a higher price than its retail on amazon and then pretend to offer a discount.&lt;br /&gt;Personally if the same price, I&#x27;d rather go buy from depatment store...readily available.</li>
            <li> The smell is very impressive! But not last so much. Anyway I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Love love love. Smells great! My boyfriend loved it this got it for him for his birthday. He wears it every day</li>
            <li> Item arrived when promised and packaged very good. I like the smell and it lasts all day in an office environment. I have received compliments from men and women at work on how nice I smell.</li>
            <li> Seriously...what can you write about a cologne?  It smells very good and have received compliments on it.  Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> i love this perfume,, it is definitly the original, dont listen to anybodyz bad review, its is the real thing, my wife bought me my first YSL from amazon and it was fantastic, this one is as awesome as the last one ,,</li>
            <li> It came faster than expected and it was still in the package nice and neat ;) my boyfriend loves it and it smells fantastic on him</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance but this one was totally fake.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling Cologne I have ever given my husband! I would recommend this to anyone! Truly a long lasting great smelling product!</li>
            <li> Have purchased this Spray before from a store and liked it right away. I bought it from amazon because I got the large bottle for less $ than what I paid for the small bottle</li>
            <li> Unique and in a good way. Many compliments.</li>
            <li> Gucci by Gucci, and  Acqua Di Gio are my two go to colognes... And now I can add YSL&#x27;s L&#x27;homme Libre to that list! It doesn&#x27;t project as much as the other two colognes, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s a more subtle for an evening night out, this is a great option to have in the collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not sure about buying it without smelling it, go to your local department store, and test it out. However, buy it on Amazon. Otherwise you will be paying $20 more for the exact same product... It&#x27;s simply a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I know a lot about the cologne out there, at least at dillards fragrance store and the reviews on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Libre has tonka bean in it, the best note that can be in any fragrance. This is my favorite cologne and my girlfriends favorite that i have. I can not resist smelling it or spraying it on me, its not offensive what so ever, and you can spray it on as much as you want, its never over baring. Its average length is about 4 hours, or less but it leaves a lite smell on you no matter what. If you like fresh and sweet cologne, there is non better. This is an Gio killer. Try it out at your local store and you will see what i mean. Or just buy it know cause its way cheaper on amazon, about $35 bucks cheaper, and you will defiantly be happy with this cologne. I guarantee that.</li>
            <li> I just love this cologne.  I sampled it at a retail store and fell in love with it.  I thought it was so elegant, and clean.  I had to buy it but the price was way to expensive at the store so I went home and got on Amazon.  They had it way cheaper so I bought it.  It is not a fake as it is the real cologne and it just is wonderful.  I have had many people tell me how great I smell when I wear it which makes me want to buy more and more of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne because I wanted to try something new after years of having only Armani Code and Burberry. It has been a pleasant surprise and is my go to cologne now. I did notice it is a heavier cologne, so I would recommend it at night</li>
            <li> The cologne smells amzing but it doesn&#x27;t last much.</li>
            <li> The cologne is the best; even my husband liked the smell [unusual we both like the same scent] This one is called &amp;#34;Libre&amp;#34; so watch your names when buying. Had to order on line as none of the Belks had any in stock.&lt;br /&gt;The prices are mainly the same. I chose Amazon due to my 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it got the 3.3 oz bottle perfect size...smells amazing...arrived with no damage and on time will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent and I love it too!  Loved being able to find it on Amazon for a great price!</li>
            <li> I have a bottle of this and absolutely love it... the smell catches attention very nice..</li>
            <li> As one of my predecessors wrote :the top notes project very well for the first 30 minutes, then it calms down. The mid notes last for maybe two and a half hours. After 3 hours, the scent starts to fade to the point where I can&#x27;t even detect the base notes. After 3 to 4 hours, the smell is totally gone, it is not even a skin scent. Thia is true the odor fades away too quickly. I have been using this prefume for theast 2 years so this one that I have bough is the worst.  Besides even the bottle lookes differently from the original ones.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t NOT recommended you purchase this product, the smell is good (as it should be) but does not lasts long.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume as a gift for a family member. Although he loved the scent, but the bottle was leaking and we couldn&#x27;t find the crack. I could have sent it back but It was a bit of a headache. he is still using the product and smelling fantastic.</li>
            <li> 1. Smells EXACTLY like my old spice men&#x27;s shampoo. Clean smell, but a little too masculine.&lt;br /&gt;2. This stuff is very powerful. I purchased the 3.3 oz and 1 spray is all it takes to carry this scent everywhere you go. At this rate (1 spray few days per week) this bottle should last me at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;3. I actually do like a masculine scent (such as dolce and gabbana) but this stuff is too shampoo like. Smells rather cheap. Clean but cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice perfume. Leaves you smelling clean. I own the Aqua De Gio - and this perfume does not match that scent. I would not recommend it to a friend, but I&#x27;m still going to wear it because I spent the money on it. Like I said its a nice smell - but many other better colognes out there.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made for my husband! He asked for this cologne for christmas and I ordered it for him. Personally, I think this scent is so great! It&#x27;s alluring and smells so good on him!</li>
            <li> Has a wonderful fresh spice &amp; woody aroma that is unique.I compare it&#x27; s originality to Fahrenheit (of which I&#x27;ve always been a fan!).If the ladies love it, then you will to!</li>
            <li> Muy buen perfume, buen olor, suave, recomendado, ademas muy buen precio, es uno de mis perfumes favoritos, el olor se mantiene</li>
            <li> This was something that my wife bought me for christmas, I smelled a sample of it out of my MAXIM magazine... It was a refreshing smell, so I thought... When I sprayed it on for the first time, I was like damn this ish is strong, but after a while it begans to settle in and calm down and smell nice..... I dont know if anyone else has felt that way also, but it had to grow on me just as the usher cologne had to also.... I would say buy this, if you want to try something new.... I really dont think that its something I would where outside of a date with my wife, or maybe a family gathering.... The smell does last for a long time, which I do like.... It just starts off strong......</li>
            <li> I have to start off by saying that I bought this product at the mall. I just can&#x27;t buy cologne on the internet without even knowing what it smells like. If you are able to do so more power to you and I hope this review helps. When I went to the mall I smelled L&#x27;Homme, L&#x27;Homme Libre and La Nuit de L&#x27;Homme all by YSL. L&#x27;H smells nice and clean but the scent disappears pretty quickly and the LNDL&#x27;H is VERY spicy and very strong. I found that L&#x27;HL was the best of both worlds. Strong enough to last and give the cologne a good oomph of manliness without being over powering. I will say that I will most certainly buy this product on Amazon. The 3.3oz bottle was $83 in stores, the 2 oz was $60. They had a gift set with a 3.3oz and 1.3oz together for $88 so I bought that. SO EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this cologne on a regular basis if you like other YSL colognes you will probably like this as well.</li>
            <li> I am definitely an avid cologne collecto. This is one of the best colognes I have ever worn. I receive multiple compliments from women on a weekly basis. Certainly wows the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a fresh, clean long lasting scent I would highly recommend this cologne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I like it more than the original, its fresher and more wearable for daytime/work wear, but also can be an upscale fragrance for special occasions.  Sort of minty and fresh, but comes across as more sophisticated than other &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; fragrances.  Good for young professionals, I think high schoolers might have a tough time pulling it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about fakes ordering online, but it got here fast and is genuine, I highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> I always buy this cologne for my husband and this was the best price I could find. Its a great scent!</li>
            <li> I am very choosy about perfume because I can&#x27;t wear all kind all perfume. I gives me a headace. But this one really gives me a pleasure for sure.</li>
            <li> Great seller -- prompt delivery. This cologne is something I got as an office gift. To me, the scent is clean and not overbearing. The scent also elicits compliments, so if you don&#x27;t believe me, believe the ladies who took the time to tell me they liked it!</li>
            <li> Smells like shaving cream.  Not a bad smell but there are better fragrances out there in this category.</li>
            <li> goood price got from xbox live as a free sample.i wear it everyday so i oderd a big bottle .</li>
            <li> The person I bought it for really liked it</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0056Z278M Yves Saint Laurent L&#x27;Homme Libre Eau De Toilette Spray for Men, 3.3 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT COLOGNE!!!! ELEGANT, CLASSY, SOSHITICATED, &amp; SMOOTH. This Cologne Always Gets Me Alot Of Compliments And The Fragrance Last All Day!!! 5 Star Cologne Hands Down.</li>
            <li> I blindly bought this cologne from just reading the reviews and I am very satisfied to say the least. I am aware that a lot of reviewers don&#x27;t like this as much when compared to La Nuit De L&#x27;homme but I differ from that opinion. It opens with a sweet top note that dries down very well. L&#x27;homme Libre lasts on my skin for up to about 6-7 hours. I definitely recommend this cologne to anyone looking for an all-around great scent that gets quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> This was given to me as a gift for Christmas...and I was not that fond of it...i use Chrome or ADG daily...6 months later I used it and found out how well made it is...its not the best smell ever, dont get me wrong its good...but the great value is how long it last...WOW i can smell it on my shirt the next day as if i just sprayed it....it last forever and is good on nose. overall, its not my home run smell, but its worth a try.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very clean and fresh smelling without being too aquatic. This is a more moderate, soft scent, so it&#x27;s fine to wear in just about any setting and you won&#x27;t have to worry about anyone being overwhelmed by it, unless of course, you decide to douse yourself in it.</li>
            <li> Got some for my dad a few Christmas&#x27; back and in return I also got this product because it smells really nice and all the shawtys gettin on ya</li>
            <li> I wear it almost daily, and haven&#x27;t gotten sick of it.  Receive compliments still, and I&#x27;ve ben using it for about a year.</li>
            <li> was recommended by my wife</li>
            <li> NIce.  Bought it for a gift.  Hope it works.</li>
            <li> I received L&#x27;Homme Libre from amazon today its a nice smelling scent for a great price but it was made in November of 2011.</li>
            <li> Hahaha, this is my number one Cologne in my collection.</li>
            <li> One of my best choices in cologne so far.  It lasts for a long time and I usually get complimented on it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. Its shelf life is expired. Does not smell like the original one!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of cologne because strong scents nauseate me, but no complaints there with this.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelt!! For those who agree what other colognes are your favorites? Im looking for more cologne options and hoping that someone with similar taste can recommend me other names.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was interested in this myself and ended up buying two of them after showing my pops how this smelt. He ended up getting it for his birthday.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last long. It&#x27;s very nice to smell once it&#x27;s first sprayed but within an hour the smell is gone, it needs to be reapplied.</li>
            <li> I have the original L&#x27;Homme (a great fragrance BTW), which is a staple in my cabinet, alongside some Chanel colognes. I tried L&#x27;Homme Libre at the store and I liked it a lot, but not as much as L&#x27;Homme, so I didn&#x27;t end up buying it. However, since I spotted L&#x27;Homme Libre at a great price on Amazon ($51 for 3.3 oz!), I figured why not. This is a very nice fragrance and considered a \\&quot;flanker\\&quot; for the main L&#x27;Homme fragrance line. It was designed for a younger demographic and it&#x27;s one of those aquatic, sporty fragrances that people either love or hate. I am NOT a fragrance expert. I don&#x27;t know what \\&quot;notes\\&quot; smell like and I can&#x27;t identify scents or anything like that, so this review is for the average layperson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the one hand, L&#x27;Homme Libre isn&#x27;t original. It smells a lot like Bleu de Chanel and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if they copied Bleu a little bit. Libre is not the same quality as L&#x27;Homme. Even the bottle looks less classy, with the transparent, cheap plastic cap and thinner glass. HOWEVER, that aside, the fragrance itself is fine. This is a good \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; fragrance that transitions well from school/work to a night out. I sprayed this a couple times today and I already received two compliments. For all it lacks in originality, it makes up for inoffensiveness. You can&#x27;t wear this and go wrong. The scent also fades quickly - it stays on the skin itself all day, but you can&#x27;t smell it around you after a couple of hours, so naturally neither can anyone else. Since Libre is a new fragrance (2011), it is highly unlikely that Amazon is selling old stock, testers, etc. so the price they&#x27;re selling it for here is insanely good. The box I received WAS a little sketch (when you take out the insert, you can see areas of the cardboard that were cut away with a utility knife), but the scent is OK and nothing leaked. This is not my favorite fragrance, but for the quality, value, and versatility, it&#x27;s hard to get much better than L&#x27;Homme Libre. 3 stars for the fragrance itself, 1 star for the price.</li>
            <li> First off, this scent smells amazing.  Not TOO masculine or sporty.  Very nice sense of freshness and \\&quot;day-time\\&quot; scent.  Yes, it is a little soapy smelling in the beginning, but when it dries on the skin, it transforms a little bit and leaves amazing undertones.  Projects well and have received a lot of compliments from strangers.  I would not recommend this cologne for clubbing or nightlife events as it doesn&#x27;t have that much of a lasting power, I&#x27;d say 4-6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I highly recommend this cologne, although, if you want to go for a show stopper, definitely get YSL- La Nuit De L&#x27;Homme.  That scent is just WOW.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say . I don&#x27;t know exactly how to explain the description like oak,rose but it&#x27;s very nice and manly.</li>
            <li> The boyfriend loved it! It is by far one of his favorite scents of all time! It smells great and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing and I have received many comments. Very happy with my purchase. Buy the big bottle. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I think it is not original</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son for Christmas.  I know it can be hard to shop for a scent for someone else but this is one that everyone will love.</li>
            <li> Everything was good.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like this scent but it&#x27;s probably my least favorite of the four.</li>
            <li> Smells SO good. I just bought it for my friend overseas cuz he wanted it and i&#x27;ve gotten many compliments when i&#x27;ve worn it myself.</li>
            <li> Perfectly balanced fragrance. Not too strong, but gives a long lasting smell. Love the stuff... not too much more to say about it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to say much about this product, so this review will be short. I love how this cologne smells. It is fresh and unique. This cologne scent is currently one of my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased this cologne on Amazon because of really attractive price!</li>
            <li> My man made me SO MAD! I bought the wrong one (according to him) And this scent is not for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;Never the less..... it smells good! It is the real deal, NO DUPES HERE!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely a great cologne... it smells great and I have received a lot of compliments when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#loveit</li>
            <li> This cologne is a favorite of mine. Much cheaper than other places, and was glad to see it arrived exactly as described, and in the retail packaging.</li>
            <li> Wonderful deal!!! Very happy</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  The ladies at Sephora described it as &amp;#34;sex on a stick&amp;#34; cologne.  They&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li> Btw, l&#x27;homme is french for The Man. That&#x27;s how I feel when I wear this cologne.</li>
            <li> I dont like the smell to strong, my son tell me ! whats Cain of colone is that daddy! I dont recoment  this spray.</li>
            <li> I am quite the adventurer of great fragrances and scents. I give this a high five for quality and wonderfullness. Enjoy it and buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what the ladies will say. This is a cologne you need to wear. You won&#x27;t regret it. Trust me. Just buy it. Actually don&#x27;t buy it braise I don&#x27;t want you to smell like me.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend for Christmas, and it smells delicious! It isn&#x27;t too strong and it isn&#x27;t too weak, and just a few sprays last all day. It has a manly/ocean-like smell to it. I will literally sit next to him and smell him whenever he wears it because it smells so good! Definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li> Great product! Shipped in perfect time.</li>
            <li> Was looking for an everyday cologne, and smelt this fragrance at the mall and thought this would be great for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing and using it for a few days, i have determined that this fragrance does not project very far, and stays very close to the skin. So it is great for work environments and going to the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very fresh, wont offend anyone, and personally think it is the perfect scent for what i was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the price was great on Amazon.</li>
