            <li> Love this product for volume and lift it gives my roots when I blow dry upside down.  </li>
            <li> will probably last a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always feeling self conscious about how little volume/density I have to my hair and it makes it a constant challenge to style.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time and I&#x27;ve never had any issues with the sprayer clogging or not working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, limp hair.</li>
            <li> It thickens my hair from the root and absolutely delivers volume and height in the root of my very heavy hair for days!</li>
            <li> Product works well to give volume but it made my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I have also read reviews on Sephora where a few people reported it stopped working if used daily</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this as long as its in production!!!!</li>
            <li> It is unlike any other volume product I have used because my hair does not get tacky and it fluffs up my hair, for two days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and have never found anything even remotely close to giving my hair volume!  </li>
            <li> And unlike some other products it does not irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> I generously mist it into my damp hair around the roots, comb it through and flip my head over to blow dry and round brush it upside down.</li>
            <li> Did not work as advertised, and certainly not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it usually falls flat.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with thin hair needing a boost.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult area in my bangs and this manages it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped, but it does give my hair some extra texture.</li>
            <li> Smells GREAT.  So-so for 48hr volume.</li>
            <li> Gives me volume without the stickiness some volume products produce. I have &amp; will continue to buy &amp; use.</li>
            <li> Really great product for fine damaged hair</li>

            <li> I love that it gives you volume and a certain amount of hold without any weight (i have thin oily hair).</li>
            <li> I have tried all types of products for adding volume but this is the only one that does not make your hair greasy feeling after a day.  It leaves a clean feel to your hair and for me it lasts for up to 4 days.  I have very fine hair and cannot wash my hair every day.  It is pricy.</li>
            <li> I get this product from my hair dresser it&#x27;s creates lasting fullness for my fine hair w/out weight or stickiness.</li>
            <li> Did not work as advertised.  Will not reorder</li>
            <li> I like this products. This is my second bottle. I use it after shampooing my hair and use it as a setting lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff! I have medium/soft African American hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but like the volume plumping strand better.</li>
            <li> Love this product for volume and lift it gives my roots when I blow dry upside down.  I use it with Sexy Hair Spray Clay and Alterna Volume Plumping Strand Expand and I look like I have a LOT OF HAIR.  I love the combo!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. It thickens my hair from the root and absolutely delivers volume and height in the root of my very heavy hair for days! I absolutely recommend it! :-)</li>
            <li> This is the best new product Ihave purchased in years.&lt;br /&gt;The shine, the control and the volume just the absolute&lt;br /&gt;Best.  No heavy products on your this does not weight down&lt;br /&gt;Your hair, it does not make your hair feel as if you have product,&lt;br /&gt;Just a clean moveable shine hair.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this product. My hair has thinned out and with the Alterna Bamboo I get volume and my hair really does look full and bouncy the next day.  I purchased two.  Don&#x27;t ever want to be without it.</li>
            <li> It left a residue on m,y hair i will not order again</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used it on me first.  I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> The last time I visited my hair stylist she recommended this product to help with my hair volume as I have very fine hair.  I spray this onto my wet hair and use it right before blow-drying and either straight-ironing or curling. It works perfectly - I can see the difference when I use it and my hair feels thicker and noticeably has more volume.  I would recommend this to anyone with thin hair needing a boost.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I have a difficult area in my bangs and this manages it so well I don&#x27;t need to touch up my bangs all day.</li>
            <li> I try a LOT of hair products but this is one of the TOP ones. Their hairspray is also terrific!</li>
            <li> Works for some volume if used in addition to mousse. Did not work as advertised, and certainly not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  It is unlike any other volume product I have used because my hair does not get tacky and it fluffs up my hair, for two days.  Really!</li>
            <li> On my second bottle, love this it ads volume and shine, will always try to keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> The Best.  I have really fine hair...this stuff is MAGIC!  I instantly and ALL DAY have volume.  I literally cannot believe this stuff.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and have never found anything even remotely close to giving my hair volume!  Hallelujah! :)</li>
            <li> product is authentic and as promised .It came fairly quickly .Product in and of itself it slightly drying but after I washed my hair most of the residue came right out.I would use it when I go out or need and extra oomph but I would not use it every day or would just use it at the roots so the ends stay silky.I have also read reviews on Sephora where a few people reported it stopped working if used daily but this was not everyone &#x27;s experience .It will probably last a long time bc I will use this on occasion not all the time .For everday I really love callista tools embellish expand thickening styling cream bc it gives my hair a soft non-stiff volume. The alterna product is great for day one but It feels kind of dry and stiff on day two.</li>

            <li> I have thinner hair and this gives nice volume and makes my hair super soft but still holds a curl.</li>
            <li> Product works well to give volume but it made my hair dry. Had to wash it out the following day and reapply.</li>
            <li> This has really worked for my hair.  It actually does give me more volume and I need that.</li>
            <li> Works wonders in terms of volume. And has a very fresh scent. Definitely will be buying more of this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Boots volume and fullness</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for my extremely fine hair.  It makes me feel like I have twice the hair when I use it.  And unlike some other products it does not irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> I really like the bamboo Volume 48 hour product.  It does what is claims to do and has a wonderful smell!</li>
            <li> Works great. Really. I have thin hair and it usually falls flat. I use this while styling with hair dryer. My hair will last all day in to the morning. I don&#x27;t use it after styling. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  My hair is brushable after use!</li>
