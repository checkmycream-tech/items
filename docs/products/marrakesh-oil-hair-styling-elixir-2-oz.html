            <li>Great product, good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very nice earthy but sweet scent.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and is very easy to work through your hair.</li>
            <li>Love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>SHINY, SMELL GOOD, TANGLE FREE,</li>
            <li>The exotic appearing branding was effective.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Leave it smelling wonderful and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair an awesome smoothness and makes it feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>It is not overly oily and it does add a nice sheen, even more so if you apply it sparingly when your hair is dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very fine color treated hair</li>
            <li>It was too strong!</li>
            <li>I have straight fine hair, but lots of it, I&#x27;m always looking for products to make me hair beautiful and shiny(who isn&#x27;t?!!).</li>
            <li>The scent is like a lovely warm vanilla, I am so in love with this product :)</li>
            <li>I think it was the scent that first attracted me to this product, I  LOVE the smell!!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is very friable and this product is great for my ends.</li>
            <li>It is excellent protection for her hair and leaves her hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>IT IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Then I use more for shine.</li>
            <li>And I actually love the smell as well (as does my husband).  </li>
            <li>I though it would be a great substitute, but it does not come close to the real thing.</li>
            <li>I love this product, love the smell and how it makes my hair feel and</li>
            <li>And yes, I did try the Neutrogena oil on my hair but the light sesame oil scent was not as nice on the hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t buy many hair products.</li>
            <li>And I love the smell</li>
            <li>Has anyone ever experienced this unusual business practice??</li>
            <li>it -- you&#x27;ll LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Love this hair oil.</li>
            <li>and I love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>My stylist talked me in to trying this and said many of her clients had luck with it.</li>
            <li>My hair already looks 75% better..</li>
            <li>and I wanted to get her more.  </li>
            <li>Amazon had a much better price.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but many people don&#x27;t care for it</li>
            <li>For instance, I notice that it works better on my hair than on my daughter&#x27;s reddish hair.</li>
            <li>I bought it thinking it would be a much better product than Silk</li>
            <li>it also helps to nourish your hair to make it healthy.....</li>
            <li>Love this it keeps my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>and I love it both ways.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It helps smooth frizz and protect hair from heat damage--the smell is amazing</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.  </li>
            <li>It is a thicker oil, with a lovely spiced smell.</li>
            <li>And I really love the fragrance of the product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Hair&amp;#34; over heels in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>but I decided to see if there was something out there that worked better and was hopefully cheaper.  </li>
            <li>It also feels and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>This is so much more affordable than Moroccanoil, but in my opinion, it works even better.  </li>
            <li>Also I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>I tried more (about 4-5 pumps for hair about 8&amp;#34; below my shoulders).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I buy the gift packs for birthdays and Christmas with overwhelming approval.</li>
            <li>My hair feels much more healthy than when I was using Morrocan Oil.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it and use it every day.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell and how it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li>but, I love it</li>
            <li>If you apply properly it&#x27;s the best product I have used.  </li>
            <li>It contains mostly cyclopentasiloxane.</li>
            <li>Smooth and silky locks!</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, too.</li>
            <li>and I love what it does to my hair</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>It also smells lovely.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>Marrakesh Oil does not lay on top of the hair like most oils.  </li>
            <li>It gets absorbed and creates great shine and smooth hair.</li>
            <li>She pulled out this magical Marrakesh oil.</li>
            <li>Not only is it great for my hair but its good for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent and when anyone gets close to my hair</li>
            <li>they say they love it to and ask me what I use.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 2 years now and my hair has never been so healthy.</li>
            <li>Many commented about how they love the smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also really pleased with how lightweight it seems to be in my hair.  </li>
            <li>but I do love this product.</li>
            <li>On the visit I discovered this oil, the gal mixed one squirt of oil in with a handful of mousse (for even distribution) - and the results were wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>this is my wife&#x27;s favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>and I AM SOOOO GLAD</li>
            <li>I was most impressed that even on the second day, the oil still didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>The fragrance reminded me of chocolate and had an exotic smell to it.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Better than most tea tree oil from the hair salon.</li>

            <li>got this to try to find a more affordable option to Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Serum, which I adore, but it&#x27;s $30.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>and it keeps it not frizzy and smooth but not too oily!</li>
            <li>love it, buyer for life.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff and my hair dresser doesn&#x27;t always have it.</li>
            <li>It looks healthy again.</li>
            <li>Of all the oils for hair, this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It does not make my hair greasy and it smells fantastic!</li>

            <li>Makes my hair shine and look healthy without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>and it is especially great for flat ironing.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair so soft, and smell so good!</li>
            <li>I have super knotty hair, and this works like magic!  </li>
            <li>Works great, very strong, good for color treated dark toned hair.</li>
            <li>kind of a sweet, earthy smell.</li>
            <li>I loved the product so much, I immediately ordered a bottle for my sister!  </li>
            <li>the ring!&lt;br /&gt;-It smells great-similar to a sweet, spicy, warm aroma therapy scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty good</li>
            <li>Originally purchased it from my hair dresser and then found it on her a tad cheaper!</li>
            <li>this is perfect for a thermal protector and helps dry your hair 3 times faster.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it makes styling my hair after washing.</li>
            <li>And did not really care for the smell - Vanilla, if you ask me compared to the exotic awesome smell of the Moroccan oil.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff, makes my hair so shiny and smooth</li>
            <li>this is a really great product for naturally curly hair.</li>

            <li>This oil gives your hair a great natural shine.  </li>
            <li>Smells good but flakes if you put to much.</li>
            <li>My co-worker told me about this product and how much she loved it.  </li>
            <li>Its just as good as the stuff I got from the salon and paid twice as much for it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent; in fact, I&#x27;m sure many people wouldn&#x27;t mind it at all, but it was overpowering to me.  </li>
            <li>It works great for straightening or after I blow dry for a nice shine and friz control.  </li>
            <li>I would happily recomend it to anyone looking for an nice smelling oil to keep dry hair in order.</li>
            <li>I have also found that it is just as wonderful as a quick facial moisturizer.  </li>

            <li>I have used Marrakesh oil for about a year now, and it is great for hair that is curly and tends to friz, especially in humid weather conditions!  </li>
            <li>It was nice to find it online at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but it does smooth your hair when frizzy.</li>

            <li>I love this product soooooooo much!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit greasy to the touch at first, but it absorbs into the hair well and makes it look rich and healthy.</li>
            <li>I originally had this oil used on my hair after having it trimmed at a beauty shop in Tucson, Arizona.</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair that grows slower than molasses in winter time.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the original scent.</li>
            <li>This product definitely gives you a wonderful shine and makes your hair really soft.</li>
            <li>This product is great to have if your skin is dry.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, leaves hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My wife swears by this formula for keeping her hair soft, shining, healthy, and lovely.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin nice and soft and my hair is silky smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I always receive compliments on my hair and how soft, shiny and healthy it looks!</li>

            <li>Marrakesh Oil which combines argan oil with hemp oil and smells lovely, which I bought on the US Amazon site, Fushi Organic Argan Oil which is pure argan oil and has no scent, which I purchased on the UK Amazon site, and Moroccan Gold Shimmer Shine spray, which my beautician uses on my hair after she trims it.  </li>
            <li>Marrakesh Oil which combines argan oil with hemp oil and smells lovely, which I bought on the US Amazon site, Fushi Organic Argan Oil which is pure argan oil and has no scent, which I purchased on the UK Amazon site, and Moroccan Gold Shimmer Shine spray, which my beautician uses on my hair after she trims it.  </li>
            <li>It smoked a little, like most pressing oils do, however, the results were amazing!</li>
            <li>but some may find it overly sweet.</li>
            <li>The nice smell, the non-greasy after-feel, and that soft, silky sheen...</li>
            <li>and I had this head full of fried hair.</li>
            <li>I entered the meeting with straight, shining, healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li>In it you will also find a recipe for Laurel&#x27;s Soft &amp; Shiny Hair-Rinse which you can make in your own kitchen from ingredients you probably already have on hand.  </li>
            <li>All three of those I can confidently tell you are very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>This product is the bomb, it leaves your hair feeling sooo soft and nice.</li>
            <li>Do I love this so much</li>
            <li>I am in love with this whole line of hair products and I am a hair product junkie.</li>
            <li>My hair is wild and wirey and this oil tames it nicely.  </li>
            <li>Another oil that I have tried that I&#x27;m loving so far is Nutiva coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>We love it so much</li>
            <li>it smells really sweet like treacle</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and it makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>The fragerance is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to fool around with my eye and skin creams, I just quickly dab some witch hazel on my face and neck with a cotton ball as an astringent after cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li>It helps my frizzy hair tremendously.  </li>
            <li>It makes it super shiny, and it smells SOOOOO</li>
            <li>I will have to buy a couple more just to make sure I have back up at all</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly</li>
            <li>so you might want to try the Dreamsicle or High Tide scents if you want something more feminine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you want a fulfilling life:)</li>
            <li>love what this product does for my long hair, soft, easy, conditioned, nice smell and moisterised  love this product thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several positive comments about how nice my hair smells, and I get a product that helps style my hair as well!  </li>
            <li>I personally like the smell of the original which is kind of musky</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>my hairdresser recommended this to me one day when I told her I was having a bit of difficulty finding a good serum for my very long, straight and fine (but lots of it) hair.</li>
            <li>There was a problem with the first order; however, seller rectified problem by sending another bottle!  </li>
            <li>It is much shinier and just looks more healthy in general.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this oil, and again, I can&#x27;t get past how good it smells!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Marrakesh oil for 10 years and this product never fails me!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product smells amazing dries hair in half the time and non-</li>
            <li>It works best for me in damp hair, but I know some people use a tiny amount to control dry hair.</li>
            <li>It is the best product out there and actually makes my hair dry faster and does not make my hair feel or look greasy like some products.</li>
            <li>So I came to Amazon, read lots of reviews and finally settled upon this product because it seemed like a good compromise between price and positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine &amp; straight.</li>
            <li>try to use little portion because is really oily but very good for hair.</li>
            <li>Good for very dry hair</li>
            <li>I will probably buy it again good product for very dry hair which I do have.</li>
            <li>I used very little in my hair as recommended and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to flat iron curl or blow dry to get bouncy beautiful tresses now!</li>
            <li>Works great and never feels heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this oil it is fabulous</li>
            <li>Makes it practically tangle free, and works so well with blow drying it straight.  </li>
            <li>worth every penny</li>
            <li>The only thing i liked was the container...</li>
            <li>and im thrilled amazon has it at such a gr8 price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It may or may not work as well for you, but it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>There, you can click on the link to my website on Lulu and get your free e-booklet entitled, \\&quot;Laurel&#x27;s Personal Regimen for Healthy Hair at 50-Plus.\\</li>
            <li>This product is by far the most healing, smoothing, heavenly scented oil I have found.</li>
            <li>I purchased bottles for my 2 daughters, and they love how soft it makes their hair feel.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s anti humidity properties because my hair still frizzes, but the time it saves in blow drying alone makes it worth a repurchase for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty new to embracing my curls and learning more about my hair</li>
            <li>You can find those in many other well rated hair oil treatments that even include argan oil at 1/3 the price if you&#x27;re ok with the silicone mixture.</li>
            <li>Ships super fast!  </li>
            <li>However, I think I have gotten used to it because now it is pretty mild.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a couple good products this way, and this is hands down my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>The company sent it out right away</li>
            <li>it absorbs right in and makes it shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li>The price was right --I</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and dry and this stuff makes my hair look much better than when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase, because some people claimed this product smelled really strong, but I was pleasantly surprised by the scent!</li>
            <li>But I wasn&#x27;t sure about paying so much for what seemed like a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; non-greasy oil such as ([[ASIN:B000052YOR Neutrogena Body Oil, Light Sesame</li>
            <li>The smell is delicious and it&#x27;s one of the few things which really makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Also this product line does NOT animal test and is free of most harsh chemicals which is extremely important to me.</li>
            <li>so i could use it and see if i liked it after long term use.</li>
            <li>super soft hair, weightless and non-greasy, great price, and slightly heavier scent.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the scent is so strong, it completely overpowers my Alba Botanica gardenia-scented shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>wonderful scent, a little goes a long way, keeps hair manageable, fresh, shiney.</li>
            <li>Transformed my dreads into fabulous smelling, soft, sumptuous locks!  </li>
            <li>This does cost a little more, but for all that--it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li>I very much recommend it.</li>
            <li>I bought this because i flat iron my hair almost everyday and wanted some added protection and moisture, and i must say i&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use too much( which I did the first time!)</li>
            <li>Marrakesh Oil Elixir really turned me on to Moroccan hair oil treatments!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li>This stuff really gives you Hollywood hair!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Scott for your recommendation!</li>
            <li>I first purchased this product while on a business trip to Miami.</li>
            <li>He married me and moved me to his home in Sugar City, Idaho.  </li>
            <li>It eliminates most of my frizziness--not all--but enough to make it look smoother.</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells absolutely divine!  </li>
            <li>I most definitely will repurchase after the bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>When I first pumped this stuff into my hand, I thought &amp;</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many differnt similar types of product but nothing compares to how this makes your hair feel and smell.  </li>
            <li>I work one pump into my ends while my hair is damp and then run whatever is left on my hands over the top of my head.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and smooth, and it smells deicious.</li>
            <li>Great for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty well going to call up the company and let them know this.</li>
            <li>I put Marrakesh oil prior to blow drying, and it always makes my hair more manageable and protects it from the heat.</li>
            <li>It seems to work pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my husband asked if someone smoked a pipe in our house.  </li>
            <li>The product did exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I love it and will reorder when my supply runs low.</li>
            <li>and they had ULTRA fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying this product from Amazon from now on! :)</li>
            <li>People say they like the smell, but the first time I used this oil</li>
            <li>The first time I ever heard of this was when my friend added to my hair after dying it.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it really works!</li>
            <li>The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars is that the pump bottle doesn&#x27;t work, so I have to unscrew the top and get the product off the tube to use.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product!</li>
            <li>It took me awhile to get used to the smell(didn&#x27;t like it at first), but now I don&#x27;t even notice it.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this I was amazed.</li>
            <li>The only scents I wear are accidental because of my soap and hair products and I don&#x27;t tend to get anything that&#x27;s overwhelmingly scented and</li>
            <li>but it was always pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>I first started this product about 6 months ago.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am in love!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The product has a light to moderate smell, but it fades away pretty quickly once your hair absorbs it.</li>
            <li>i have used the frizz ease products since i was 15 yrs old, and i try every new serum tht comes out just to see if somthing works better.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny and easy to manage on days when it just wants to be a fuzz ball.</li>
            <li>A great product makes my hair nice and soft and easy to style with blower dryer only need a little bit goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>I use this oil right after my shower and it leaves my hair much smoother than normal with a super silky feel.  </li>
            <li>The only negative is the smell, hemp is not the most pleasant of odors in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I notice I need to use more to get the same result, but others may not need to use as much as I do and may even prefer this formula.</li>
            <li>I have long hair, fine hair that gets super tangled when I take a shower</li>
            <li>Look at ingredients list, cannabis is on there and can provide a positive test for marijuana.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of positive reviews on this product, and they aren&#x27;t lying.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and got and didn&#x27;t really use it much at first.</li>
            <li>My curls are now uniform, soft and full of life.  </li>
            <li>It is my secret to beautiful, silky hair.</li>
            <li>and it is less that half of what salons charge so it happy for me!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Really makes a Positive difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this product on people with thick, dry hair and people with fine, damaged hair and this product is great for both.</li>
            <li>, my hair becomes super soft and shiny, and it makes untangling so much easier.</li>
            <li>It  doesn&#x27;t have the same effect on my fine colored hair as the Moroccan oil has...</li>
            <li>spray with Nexxus Heat Protex Heat Protection Styling Spray ( also helps to soften hair better than any other heat protective styling spray), and put it up in jumbo hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>Not an easy mess to clean.</li>
            <li>This particular coconut oil seems to be working quite well with my hair!  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>Thanks in advance...</li>
            <li>and it looks very shiny every day.</li>
            <li>I think I will go for the whole set.</li>
            <li>I also want to point out that it was fast and efficient service.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it either way!</li>
            <li>I was getting really discusted and was about ready to cut it shorter and start over.</li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft silky and fresh.</li>
            <li>a couple of drops in the hand covers the whole head of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer</li>
            <li>and this really takes the frizz out.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Seemed to change the very weight of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Once removed, the whole label came off.</li>
            <li>Sure it says it contains hemp and argan, but in what quantities?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on my wet hair and worked it in.</li>
            <li>If you color your hair, it really enhances the color as well.  </li>
            <li>wish it was available at a local salon</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It has a very distinctive scent to it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this in January, and I still haven&#x27;t used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Much smarter buy than drugstore after shower care products.</li>
            <li>Gives my thin hair body and great manageability.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to spread around in your hair either...</li>
            <li>I think some people may have used too much</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>Works very well in humidity as well.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend really likes the way it smells in my hair, and I like the way it makes my hands smell and feel, as well.</li>
            <li>My stylist uses it on me at the salon and tried to sell me a bottle for almost 3 times as much as it was sold for on here.</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair one or two times a week, since I straighten or smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair that I straighten and its pin straight after I use this product.</li>
            <li>I apply this while hair is damp and it keeps hair smooth until next washing.</li>
            <li>I did not realize how much moisture my hair lacked.  </li>
            <li>It can be overpowering but this product works so well that you don&#x27;t need to use much as all.</li>
            <li>I can dispense the amount I need with one hand and not worry about losing the whole bottle or a dropper.&lt;br /&gt;-This</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Love this product when applied to my wet hair and going to use blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I also changed my shampoo and conditioner around the time I started using that, so I think it&#x27;s a combination of both of those things, but my hair really does look healthier now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it on the whole family.</li>
            <li>When my hair is straight I put some in the palm of my hand, rub it around my hands and then scrunch the ends of my hair into my hands</li>
            <li>that I really like; no lingering sweetness.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely would and do&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li>Love the smell and leaves hair in such a suuuuper soft silky feeling.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected, but good product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not real crazy about this product.</li>
            <li>Now my review is very positive because I had such powerful results</li>
            <li>I put it in a braid (very rare till recently).</li>
            <li>It appears to be a good product, recommended by a hair stylist, does not completely take care of a dry scalp problem, but does improve it.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for years now and do not even use conditioner, put it on right after shampooing, leaving my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It smells really great, very sweet, but it dies down to a subtle smell after 20 or so minutes.</li>
            <li>This particular oil is ok on my hair, it adds shine, but my hair does not really absorb it to gain anything for the curls.  </li>
            <li>Originally in this booklet, my final suggested step was to use a soft-hold hairspray before combing out your hair.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I often simply use the original Marrakech oil as my signature scent.</li>
            <li>I love their hair oil over every other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Obviously this is not the original Earthly Body Marrakesh Oil.</li>
            <li>I will not be reordering due to this, so if you don&#x27;t care for super sweet scents, avoid this serum.</li>
            <li>Even after a whole day of wearing my hair down, I could still easily run my fingers through it without brushing it out first.  </li>
            <li>My hair is dry and fine</li>
            <li>I no longer can live without it!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t live without it ever again!</li>
            <li>I use this product as a part of a new regimen to alleviate my hair problems and it really does help, it also makes de-tangling easier if you apply it beforehand.</li>
            <li>and then a drop or two to smooth out when dry.</li>
            <li>I only wish it were cheaper (for the same quality of course) because I could use this by the buckets : )</li>
            <li>I use it mainly in the winter months.</li>
            <li>The pros:&lt;br /&gt;It does a decent job of controlling frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not drying in the slightest which I&#x27;ve found with many, even more expensive oils.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t use much so the price is not bad considering how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine, blonde frizzy hair and Marrakesh Oil Hair Styling Elixir really does soften and reduces frizzies, and I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>, it is so much more calm than usual!</li>
            <li>and then some, I have long thick bleached blonde hair and this is so nourishing and exquisite....</li>
            <li>The sales person and a co-worker highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I wish it de tangled a little more</li>
            <li>I did try using a little more to control the frizz</li>
            <li>This product has by far worked very well whether or not I style it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I normally do not buy into a lot of extra products due to the cost and, I never seem to be totally happy with them.  </li>
            <li>I AM SHOCKED at how awesome this stuff is!</li>
            <li>This product really makes your hair shine &amp; leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li>It smells and works much better than the Frizz-Ease products without making hair greasy or limp.    </li>
            <li>Love this product, it makes my coarse, thick, curly hair shiny and smooth</li>
            <li>It does wonders on my normally frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I have straight blonde hair, and curl my hair with hot roller too.</li>
            <li>Just a few pumps will do ya :)</li>
            <li>My own hair is medium length and thick.</li>
            <li>the oil leaves your hair soft and workable, without a major buildup, and gives it just the right shine</li>
            <li>I honestly thought it would just be some greasy anti-frizz serum that would totally weigh my hair down</li>
            <li>We will be buying more, but it does last a long time!</li>
            <li>Not as heavy as moroccan oil, which can easily make your hair look greasy if you apply just a smidge too much of it.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, flat hair, which likes to frizz up in the wet,</li>
            <li>Great but a little heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length hair, super fine but fairly thick, and naturally wavy with some frizz.  </li>
            <li>Even with the new formula.  </li>
            <li>Depending on the humidity where you live, you may not need to do these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this when I ran out of Moroccan Oil and didn&#x27;t have the money to buy a new bottle.</li>
            <li>My Sister is a hair stylist, she is always giving me new things to try.</li>
            <li>I bought this to seal the moisture in my hair after washing, conditioning and moisturizing as part of a new haircare routine, and it works perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this really leaves hair soft and brings out the natural curl.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>After all of my flat-ironing, coloring and blow drying, I realized that I was dealing with some pretty severe damage after not protecting it properly.</li>
            <li>my hair is just soooooooooo soft and shiny with this product!</li>
            <li>So I gave it a try, WOW!</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle at the salon for double this price ($22).</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Makes your hair silky soft and managable!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I bought it the first time in a salon for about double the price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years having bought it originally at a beauty parlor and subsequently on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is light weight so it does not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>After some use I noticed the bottle (which was going down slowly) was suddenly disappearing quickly; my husband had tried and liked it so much he was using it every morning too!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this product got such great reviews because it did nothing for my dry, frizzy, damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer this one to the other popular one in the blue bottle because it is a lighter oil and does not leave my hair greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>You want one that your hair will easily absorb and hold to give your hair shine, reduce frizz, and not build up and make your hair look limp and oily.  </li>
            <li>This product did not control my frizz at all, but worked fine at adding some moisture and a little shine.  </li>
            <li>it was a half a bottle and it has lasted MONTHS, ive now used the last of it and needed more and decieded to check amazon to see if they have it.</li>
            <li>It tamed my wild gray hair, making it manageably soft and shiny but not limp!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not sure how all these other people have had good experiences with it.</li>
            <li>This oil is not the same as the pure Argan oil that used to be sold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I was looking for a hair product that would smooth out my ends, so that I could go just a little longer before I got a hair cut.  </li>
            <li>My hair has static and is hard to comb through after a shower.</li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s a clear oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pump packaging is MUCH easier to use and though it&#x27;s a very similar product it seems a bit \\&quot;lighter\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to substitute - do not waste your time and money.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair reallly soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>I was transitioning to natural hair</li>
            <li>My hair is color treated blonde, fine/thick, shoulder legnth straight with a bit of wave.</li>
            <li>I left the hotel  with straight hair but by the time we finished eating at the pier, I had an Afro.</li>
            <li>There, I found the climate to be much dryer than it was at my former home in Murray, Kentucky where I had lived for twenty-six years.  </li>
            <li>It shines the hair without leaving an oily residue, and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, just marvelously soft.  </li>
            <li>It shines the hair without leaving an oily residue, and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, just marvelously soft.  </li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Your skin becomes so soft and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>I have used at least 3 bottles of this product and like the results: shine (wish there was more, but it&#x27;ll do)while conditioning.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this product and WOW.</li>
            <li>I used it yesterday and it made my hair soft, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li>but my hair can only be tamed so much.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and silky and what a shine.  </li>
            <li>I have been purchasing this product for nearly one year.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>This one makes hair crunchy and it is not as nourishing so far in my opinion.</li>
            <li>And I have sensitive skin, no breakouts, prefer this over</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that is course and prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Adds shine and makes hair soft.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I initially bought it instead of Moroccan Oil, and much prefer it.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair shiny, soft and keeps it from curling or frizzing.</li>
            <li>I tend to be sensitive to smells, so</li>
            <li>This is extremely reasonable and is the same quality of one you&#x27;d buy in stores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my hair considerably softer and I&#x27;ve found no fault with it.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair soft shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>So far I have tried the oils and conditioners.</li>
            <li>but Marrakesh oil keeps it so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Having thick waist-length hair myself, I am very excited about discovering Moroccan argan oil.  </li>
            <li>My biggest problem is that most products that are designed for breakage, conditioning, etc. are really heavy or greasy, leaving my hair flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li>I think the Marraskesh Oil works nearly as well, but I like the subtle scent of Josie Maran&#x27;s product MUCH more than this one.</li>
            <li>i have very dry frizzy natural curly hair, and i first got this from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>I add some to my hair when damp (you don&#x27;t need much) and it makes my hair dry faster when blow drying and my hair is very soft and never oily.</li>
            <li>The result is big, soft, wavy curls, lots of shine and no frizzy hair even in high humidity or rain.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended especially if one has problems with hair loss.</li>
            <li>It helps make my hair soft and cuts down on the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, want to THANK the company for making thing right when my 1st shipment was received damaged.</li>
            <li>I have long, wavy hair but prefer it to be straight.  </li>
            <li>but because you don&#x27;t need much, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I use 4 pumps, spread it on my palms, and apply it to my wet hair -- ends first.</li>
            <li>With this, I actually get to have hair like normal people.</li>
            <li>Then, I quickly apply a little of the argan oil to my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I order this product and was amazed at the fast shipping and the price was less than 1/2 of of the salon&#x27;s price for the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>I have very long, very thick hard to manage hair, and this oil is the best hair treatment I have found so far.  </li>
            <li>About a month later I received a new bottle of Moroccan Oil as a gift, but I haven&#x27;t touched it.</li>
            <li>I looooove this product because I live in the South where it is constantly humid no matter the time of year.</li>
            <li>It is a very reasonably priced product compared to other similiar oils for hair.  </li>
            <li>This most recent purchase, even though the packaging is the same as what I had previously bought, the product inside is not the same.</li>
            <li>If you choose to use a soft mousse instead of soft hairspray suggested in the next step, you can just mix the oil with the mousse in the palm of your hand and then apply it throughout your hair.  </li>

            <li>it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that loses moisture, attracts frizz and rebels with fly aways.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(Can&#x27;t use it for my younger daughter because she is very sensitive to any fragrances/has eczema.)</li>
            <li>But after adding this to my hair it suddenly becomes soft and silky!</li>
            <li>The days I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I just put enough marrakesh oil in to tame the frizz and smooth the ends</li>
            <li>My hair can appear dry and frizzy especially in the hot weather</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t do without this for my older daughter&#x27;s long, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and will continue to buy it for as long as I can.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle, and I don&#x27;t use very much (about 1 pump for my ends, sometimes two on wet hair).</li>
            <li>Not on par with other argan oil treatments that simply contain more argan oil and less silicone.</li>
            <li>If you would like to obtain the complete booklet, just click on my name above this review, and you will be taken to my profile page here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/wavy hair that requires taming on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>The product left my hair incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>(mostly cuz I thin my hair so often.)  </li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because it said it was okay for thin hair.</li>
            <li>I find myself randomly smelling my own hair throughout the day after I use this.</li>
            <li>It has made my hair super soft and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It smells a bit strange initially, but it keeps my hair smooth and flyaways down.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that controls it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li>I apply one pump to one and a half pump (I have pretty long hair) to my towel dried hair and it shortens my drying time and leaves my hair softer and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see it on Amazon and for a few dollars less than what I paid for it in Miami.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat</li>
            <li>A very small amount really helps make my hair more manageable and shiny without making it heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten very dry and somewhat fuzzy as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  </li>
            <li>The only possible down side that can figure is that the scent is slightly stronger than most hair products.  </li>
            <li>I put a tinyyyy bit on each section (my hair is very thin and fine, so too much of anything just makes it greasy).</li>
            <li>, we can give you a full refund.\\&quot;, they WILL NOT give me a refund unless I remove my negative comment.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and really shines.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, no matter how much I use.</li>
            <li>One of the bottles was half full and had leaked all over the inside of the box and other bottles.</li>
            <li>I try every new product and really like the softening and frizz control, and combine them in my hands to apply as the Sabino is verrry thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser uses this herself and it works very well , but she has thinner, only slightly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>i have a lot of little fly-aways, but this keeps my hair so much smoother than it would otherwise be.</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to style and in half the time usually takes .</li>
            <li>You do have to be a little bit careful with the amount just because the smell is a bit strong but other than that it works wonders.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, I think I had my first bottle for 6 months before replacing.</li>
            <li>first bottle lasted almost a year; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it was a bad scent (in fact, I liked it), but if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, you might want to try something else.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Anyway, this is a great product and is light and non-greasey and adds shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I think it would do amazing for people with coarser, thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for an amazing product line</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I have to mention how amazing this stuff smells too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s growing nicely, too.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair oily, just very manageable, plus it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to every and anyone that wants to know which oil is best to use on their clients, family and friends hair.</li>
            <li> They both require some adjustment to figure out how much to apply, but the results are the best I have ever had.</li>
            <li> The scent reminded him of his grandfather&#x27;s tobacco pipe, it kind of smells like vanilla pipe tobacco.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the smell is out of this world good.</li>
            <li> It mentioned on the bottle at the time that it was good for straightening hair but it also seems to help mine curl more.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Gives a warm spicy smell too.</li>
            <li> Oh it smells nice too</li>
            <li> so we smell good.  :)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair have a nice shine to it and is not too oily.</li>
            <li> I am using the conditioner as well now, loving that too.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Earth Body for an excellent product!!</li>
            <li> Great product, good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very nice earthy but sweet scent.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and is very easy to work through your hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> SHINY, SMELL GOOD, TANGLE FREE,</li>
            <li> The exotic appearing branding was effective.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Leave it smelling wonderful and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair an awesome smoothness and makes it feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> It is not overly oily and it does add a nice sheen, even more so if you apply it sparingly when your hair is dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very fine color treated hair</li>
            <li> It was too strong!</li>
            <li> I have straight fine hair, but lots of it, I&#x27;m always looking for products to make me hair beautiful and shiny(who isn&#x27;t?!!).</li>
            <li> The scent is like a lovely warm vanilla, I am so in love with this product :)</li>
            <li> I think it was the scent that first attracted me to this product, I  LOVE the smell!!  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is very friable and this product is great for my ends.</li>
            <li> It is excellent protection for her hair and leaves her hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> IT IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Then I use more for shine.</li>
            <li> And I actually love the smell as well (as does my husband).  </li>
            <li> I though it would be a great substitute, but it does not come close to the real thing.</li>
            <li> I love this product, love the smell and how it makes my hair feel and</li>
            <li> And yes, I did try the Neutrogena oil on my hair but the light sesame oil scent was not as nice on the hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy many hair products.</li>
            <li> And I love the smell</li>
            <li> Has anyone ever experienced this unusual business practice??</li>
            <li> it -- you&#x27;ll LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love this hair oil.</li>
            <li> and I love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> My stylist talked me in to trying this and said many of her clients had luck with it.</li>
            <li> My hair already looks 75% better..</li>
            <li> and I wanted to get her more.  </li>
            <li> Amazon had a much better price.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but many people don&#x27;t care for it</li>
            <li> For instance, I notice that it works better on my hair than on my daughter&#x27;s reddish hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking it would be a much better product than Silk</li>
            <li> it also helps to nourish your hair to make it healthy.....</li>
            <li> Love this it keeps my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> and I love it both ways.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It helps smooth frizz and protect hair from heat damage--the smell is amazing</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.  </li>
            <li> It is a thicker oil, with a lovely spiced smell.</li>
            <li> And I really love the fragrance of the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Hair&amp;#34; over heels in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> but I decided to see if there was something out there that worked better and was hopefully cheaper.  </li>
            <li> It also feels and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> This is so much more affordable than Moroccanoil, but in my opinion, it works even better.  </li>
            <li> Also I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> I tried more (about 4-5 pumps for hair about 8&amp;#34; below my shoulders).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I buy the gift packs for birthdays and Christmas with overwhelming approval.</li>
            <li> My hair feels much more healthy than when I was using Morrocan Oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it and use it every day.  </li>
            <li> and I love the smell and how it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> but, I love it</li>
            <li> If you apply properly it&#x27;s the best product I have used.  </li>
            <li> It contains mostly cyclopentasiloxane.</li>
            <li> Smooth and silky locks!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, too.</li>
            <li> and I love what it does to my hair</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> It also smells lovely.</li>
            <li> What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> Marrakesh Oil does not lay on top of the hair like most oils.  </li>
            <li> It gets absorbed and creates great shine and smooth hair.</li>
            <li> She pulled out this magical Marrakesh oil.</li>
            <li> Not only is it great for my hair but its good for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the scent and when anyone gets close to my hair</li>
            <li> they say they love it to and ask me what I use.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 years now and my hair has never been so healthy.</li>
            <li> Many commented about how they love the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also really pleased with how lightweight it seems to be in my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I do love this product.</li>
            <li> On the visit I discovered this oil, the gal mixed one squirt of oil in with a handful of mousse (for even distribution) - and the results were wonderful!  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> this is my wife&#x27;s favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> and I AM SOOOO GLAD</li>
            <li> I was most impressed that even on the second day, the oil still didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> The fragrance reminded me of chocolate and had an exotic smell to it.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Better than most tea tree oil from the hair salon.</li>

            <li> got this to try to find a more affordable option to Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Serum, which I adore, but it&#x27;s $30.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff and my hair dresser doesn&#x27;t always have it.</li>
            <li> It looks healthy again.</li>
            <li> Of all the oils for hair, this is my favorite.  </li>

            <li> I have used Marrakesh oil for about a year now, and it is great for hair that is curly and tends to friz, especially in humid weather conditions!  </li>
            <li> It was nice to find it online at a reasonable price.</li>

            <li> The three brands that I am familiar with and have used myself are;</li>
            <li> I love this product soooooooo much!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit greasy to the touch at first, but it absorbs into the hair well and makes it look rich and healthy.</li>
            <li> I originally had this oil used on my hair after having it trimmed at a beauty shop in Tucson, Arizona.</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair that grows slower than molasses in winter time.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the original scent.</li>
            <li> This product definitely gives you a wonderful shine and makes your hair really soft.</li>
            <li> This product is great to have if your skin is dry.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, leaves hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>

            <li> Makes my skin nice and soft and my hair is silky smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I always receive compliments on my hair and how soft, shiny and healthy it looks!</li>
            <li> and it provides the right frizz coverage, makes my hair incredibly soft, and is great if you want to straighten or use hot tools on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Marrakesh Oil which combines argan oil with hemp oil and smells lovely, which I bought on the US Amazon site, Fushi Organic Argan Oil which is pure argan oil and has no scent, which I purchased on the UK Amazon site, and Moroccan Gold Shimmer Shine spray, which my beautician uses on my hair after she trims it.  </li>
            <li> Marrakesh Oil which combines argan oil with hemp oil and smells lovely, which I bought on the US Amazon site, Fushi Organic Argan Oil which is pure argan oil and has no scent, which I purchased on the UK Amazon site, and Moroccan Gold Shimmer Shine spray, which my beautician uses on my hair after she trims it.  </li>
            <li> It smoked a little, like most pressing oils do, however, the results were amazing!</li>
            <li> but some may find it overly sweet.</li>
            <li> The nice smell, the non-greasy after-feel, and that soft, silky sheen...</li>
            <li> and I had this head full of fried hair.</li>
            <li> I entered the meeting with straight, shining, healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li> In it you will also find a recipe for Laurel&#x27;s Soft &amp; Shiny Hair-Rinse which you can make in your own kitchen from ingredients you probably already have on hand.  </li>
            <li> All three of those I can confidently tell you are very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> This product is the bomb, it leaves your hair feeling sooo soft and nice.</li>
            <li> Do I love this so much</li>
            <li> I am in love with this whole line of hair products and I am a hair product junkie.</li>
            <li> My hair is wild and wirey and this oil tames it nicely.  </li>
            <li> Another oil that I have tried that I&#x27;m loving so far is Nutiva coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> We love it so much</li>
            <li> it smells really sweet like treacle</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, and it makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> The fragerance is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to fool around with my eye and skin creams, I just quickly dab some witch hazel on my face and neck with a cotton ball as an astringent after cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li> It helps my frizzy hair tremendously.  </li>
            <li> It makes it super shiny, and it smells SOOOOO</li>
            <li> I will have to buy a couple more just to make sure I have back up at all</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly</li>
            <li> so you might want to try the Dreamsicle or High Tide scents if you want something more feminine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you want a fulfilling life:)</li>
            <li> love what this product does for my long hair, soft, easy, conditioned, nice smell and moisterised  love this product thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several positive comments about how nice my hair smells, and I get a product that helps style my hair as well!  </li>
            <li> I personally like the smell of the original which is kind of musky</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> my hairdresser recommended this to me one day when I told her I was having a bit of difficulty finding a good serum for my very long, straight and fine (but lots of it) hair.</li>
            <li> There was a problem with the first order; however, seller rectified problem by sending another bottle!  </li>
            <li> It is much shinier and just looks more healthy in general.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this oil, and again, I can&#x27;t get past how good it smells!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Marrakesh oil for 10 years and this product never fails me!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product smells amazing dries hair in half the time and non-</li>
            <li> It works best for me in damp hair, but I know some people use a tiny amount to control dry hair.</li>
            <li> It is the best product out there and actually makes my hair dry faster and does not make my hair feel or look greasy like some products.</li>
            <li> So I came to Amazon, read lots of reviews and finally settled upon this product because it seemed like a good compromise between price and positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine &amp; straight.</li>
            <li> try to use little portion because is really oily but very good for hair.</li>
            <li> Good for very dry hair</li>
            <li> I will probably buy it again good product for very dry hair which I do have.</li>
            <li> I used very little in my hair as recommended and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to flat iron curl or blow dry to get bouncy beautiful tresses now!</li>
            <li> Works great and never feels heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this oil it is fabulous</li>
            <li> Makes it practically tangle free, and works so well with blow drying it straight.  </li>
            <li> worth every penny</li>
            <li> The only thing i liked was the container...</li>
            <li> and im thrilled amazon has it at such a gr8 price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It may or may not work as well for you, but it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> There, you can click on the link to my website on Lulu and get your free e-booklet entitled, \\&quot;Laurel&#x27;s Personal Regimen for Healthy Hair at 50-Plus.\\</li>
            <li> This product is by far the most healing, smoothing, heavenly scented oil I have found.</li>
            <li> I purchased bottles for my 2 daughters, and they love how soft it makes their hair feel.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s anti humidity properties because my hair still frizzes, but the time it saves in blow drying alone makes it worth a repurchase for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to embracing my curls and learning more about my hair</li>
            <li> You can find those in many other well rated hair oil treatments that even include argan oil at 1/3 the price if you&#x27;re ok with the silicone mixture.</li>
            <li> Ships super fast!  </li>
            <li> However, I think I have gotten used to it because now it is pretty mild.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a couple good products this way, and this is hands down my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> The company sent it out right away</li>
            <li> it absorbs right in and makes it shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> The price was right --I</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and dry and this stuff makes my hair look much better than when I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase, because some people claimed this product smelled really strong, but I was pleasantly surprised by the scent!</li>
            <li> But I wasn&#x27;t sure about paying so much for what seemed like a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; non-greasy oil such as ([[ASIN:B000052YOR Neutrogena Body Oil, Light Sesame</li>
            <li> The smell is delicious and it&#x27;s one of the few things which really makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Also this product line does NOT animal test and is free of most harsh chemicals which is extremely important to me.</li>
            <li> so i could use it and see if i liked it after long term use.</li>
            <li> super soft hair, weightless and non-greasy, great price, and slightly heavier scent.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the scent is so strong, it completely overpowers my Alba Botanica gardenia-scented shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> wonderful scent, a little goes a long way, keeps hair manageable, fresh, shiney.</li>
            <li> Transformed my dreads into fabulous smelling, soft, sumptuous locks!  </li>
            <li> This does cost a little more, but for all that--it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> I very much recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i flat iron my hair almost everyday and wanted some added protection and moisture, and i must say i&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use too much( which I did the first time!)</li>
            <li> Marrakesh Oil Elixir really turned me on to Moroccan hair oil treatments!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> This stuff really gives you Hollywood hair!</li>
            <li> Thanks, Scott for your recommendation!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product while on a business trip to Miami.</li>
            <li> He married me and moved me to his home in Sugar City, Idaho.  </li>
            <li> It eliminates most of my frizziness--not all--but enough to make it look smoother.</li>
            <li> Plus, it smells absolutely divine!  </li>
            <li> I most definitely will repurchase after the bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> When I first pumped this stuff into my hand, I thought &amp;</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many differnt similar types of product but nothing compares to how this makes your hair feel and smell.  </li>
            <li> I work one pump into my ends while my hair is damp and then run whatever is left on my hands over the top of my head.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and smooth, and it smells deicious.</li>
            <li> Great for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty well going to call up the company and let them know this.</li>
            <li> I put Marrakesh oil prior to blow drying, and it always makes my hair more manageable and protects it from the heat.</li>
            <li> It seems to work pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my husband asked if someone smoked a pipe in our house.  </li>
            <li> The product did exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I love it and will reorder when my supply runs low.</li>
            <li> and they had ULTRA fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this product from Amazon from now on! :)</li>
            <li> People say they like the smell, but the first time I used this oil</li>
            <li> The first time I ever heard of this was when my friend added to my hair after dying it.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it really works!</li>
            <li> The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars is that the pump bottle doesn&#x27;t work, so I have to unscrew the top and get the product off the tube to use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product!</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to get used to the smell(didn&#x27;t like it at first), but now I don&#x27;t even notice it.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this I was amazed.</li>
            <li> The only scents I wear are accidental because of my soap and hair products and I don&#x27;t tend to get anything that&#x27;s overwhelmingly scented and</li>
            <li> but it was always pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> I first started this product about 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> Other than that I am in love!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The product has a light to moderate smell, but it fades away pretty quickly once your hair absorbs it.</li>
            <li> i have used the frizz ease products since i was 15 yrs old, and i try every new serum tht comes out just to see if somthing works better.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny and easy to manage on days when it just wants to be a fuzz ball.</li>
            <li> A great product makes my hair nice and soft and easy to style with blower dryer only need a little bit goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> I use this oil right after my shower and it leaves my hair much smoother than normal with a super silky feel.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is the smell, hemp is not the most pleasant of odors in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I notice I need to use more to get the same result, but others may not need to use as much as I do and may even prefer this formula.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, fine hair that gets super tangled when I take a shower</li>
            <li> Look at ingredients list, cannabis is on there and can provide a positive test for marijuana.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of positive reviews on this product, and they aren&#x27;t lying.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and got and didn&#x27;t really use it much at first.</li>
            <li> My curls are now uniform, soft and full of life.  </li>
            <li> It is my secret to beautiful, silky hair.</li>
            <li> and it is less that half of what salons charge so it happy for me!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> Really makes a Positive difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on people with thick, dry hair and people with fine, damaged hair and this product is great for both.</li>
            <li> , my hair becomes super soft and shiny, and it makes untangling so much easier.</li>
            <li> It  doesn&#x27;t have the same effect on my fine colored hair as the Moroccan oil has...</li>
            <li> spray with Nexxus Heat Protex Heat Protection Styling Spray ( also helps to soften hair better than any other heat protective styling spray), and put it up in jumbo hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> Not an easy mess to clean.</li>
            <li> This particular coconut oil seems to be working quite well with my hair!  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> Thanks in advance...</li>
            <li> and it looks very shiny every day.</li>
            <li> I think I will go for the whole set.</li>
            <li> I also want to point out that it was fast and efficient service.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it either way!</li>
            <li> I was getting really discusted and was about ready to cut it shorter and start over.</li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft silky and fresh.</li>
            <li> a couple of drops in the hand covers the whole head of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer</li>
            <li> and this really takes the frizz out.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Seemed to change the very weight of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Once removed, the whole label came off.</li>
            <li> Sure it says it contains hemp and argan, but in what quantities?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on my wet hair and worked it in.</li>
            <li> If you color your hair, it really enhances the color as well.  </li>
            <li> wish it was available at a local salon</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It has a very distinctive scent to it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this in January, and I still haven&#x27;t used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Much smarter buy than drugstore after shower care products.</li>
            <li> Gives my thin hair body and great manageability.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to spread around in your hair either...</li>
            <li> I think some people may have used too much</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> Works very well in humidity as well.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really likes the way it smells in my hair, and I like the way it makes my hands smell and feel, as well.</li>
            <li> My stylist uses it on me at the salon and tried to sell me a bottle for almost 3 times as much as it was sold for on here.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair one or two times a week, since I straighten or smooth it out.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I straighten and its pin straight after I use this product.</li>
            <li> I apply this while hair is damp and it keeps hair smooth until next washing.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how much moisture my hair lacked.  </li>
            <li> It can be overpowering but this product works so well that you don&#x27;t need to use much as all.</li>
            <li> I can dispense the amount I need with one hand and not worry about losing the whole bottle or a dropper.&lt;br /&gt;-This</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product when applied to my wet hair and going to use blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I also changed my shampoo and conditioner around the time I started using that, so I think it&#x27;s a combination of both of those things, but my hair really does look healthier now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it on the whole family.</li>
            <li> When my hair is straight I put some in the palm of my hand, rub it around my hands and then scrunch the ends of my hair into my hands</li>
            <li> that I really like; no lingering sweetness.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely would and do&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li> Love the smell and leaves hair in such a suuuuper soft silky feeling.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, but good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real crazy about this product.</li>
            <li> Now my review is very positive because I had such powerful results</li>
            <li> I put it in a braid (very rare till recently).</li>
            <li> It appears to be a good product, recommended by a hair stylist, does not completely take care of a dry scalp problem, but does improve it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years now and do not even use conditioner, put it on right after shampooing, leaving my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It smells really great, very sweet, but it dies down to a subtle smell after 20 or so minutes.</li>
            <li> This particular oil is ok on my hair, it adds shine, but my hair does not really absorb it to gain anything for the curls.  </li>
            <li> Originally in this booklet, my final suggested step was to use a soft-hold hairspray before combing out your hair.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I often simply use the original Marrakech oil as my signature scent.</li>
            <li> I love their hair oil over every other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Obviously this is not the original Earthly Body Marrakesh Oil.</li>
            <li> I will not be reordering due to this, so if you don&#x27;t care for super sweet scents, avoid this serum.</li>
            <li> Even after a whole day of wearing my hair down, I could still easily run my fingers through it without brushing it out first.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and fine</li>
            <li> I no longer can live without it!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t live without it ever again!</li>
            <li> I use this product as a part of a new regimen to alleviate my hair problems and it really does help, it also makes de-tangling easier if you apply it beforehand.</li>
            <li> and then a drop or two to smooth out when dry.</li>
            <li> I only wish it were cheaper (for the same quality of course) because I could use this by the buckets : )</li>
            <li> I use it mainly in the winter months.</li>
            <li> The pros:&lt;br /&gt;It does a decent job of controlling frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not drying in the slightest which I&#x27;ve found with many, even more expensive oils.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use much so the price is not bad considering how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine, blonde frizzy hair and Marrakesh Oil Hair Styling Elixir really does soften and reduces frizzies, and I love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> , it is so much more calm than usual!</li>
            <li> and then some, I have long thick bleached blonde hair and this is so nourishing and exquisite....</li>
            <li> The sales person and a co-worker highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I wish it de tangled a little more</li>
            <li> I did try using a little more to control the frizz</li>
            <li> This product has by far worked very well whether or not I style it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I normally do not buy into a lot of extra products due to the cost and, I never seem to be totally happy with them.  </li>
            <li> I AM SHOCKED at how awesome this stuff is!</li>
            <li> This product really makes your hair shine &amp; leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li> It smells and works much better than the Frizz-Ease products without making hair greasy or limp.    </li>
            <li> Love this product, it makes my coarse, thick, curly hair shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> It does wonders on my normally frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have straight blonde hair, and curl my hair with hot roller too.</li>
            <li> Just a few pumps will do ya :)</li>
            <li> My own hair is medium length and thick.</li>
            <li> the oil leaves your hair soft and workable, without a major buildup, and gives it just the right shine</li>
            <li> I honestly thought it would just be some greasy anti-frizz serum that would totally weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> We will be buying more, but it does last a long time!</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as moroccan oil, which can easily make your hair look greasy if you apply just a smidge too much of it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, flat hair, which likes to frizz up in the wet,</li>
            <li> Great but a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length hair, super fine but fairly thick, and naturally wavy with some frizz.  </li>
            <li> Even with the new formula.  </li>
            <li> Depending on the humidity where you live, you may not need to do these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this when I ran out of Moroccan Oil and didn&#x27;t have the money to buy a new bottle.</li>
            <li> My Sister is a hair stylist, she is always giving me new things to try.</li>
            <li> I bought this to seal the moisture in my hair after washing, conditioning and moisturizing as part of a new haircare routine, and it works perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this really leaves hair soft and brings out the natural curl.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> After all of my flat-ironing, coloring and blow drying, I realized that I was dealing with some pretty severe damage after not protecting it properly.</li>
            <li> my hair is just soooooooooo soft and shiny with this product!</li>
            <li> So I gave it a try, WOW!</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle at the salon for double this price ($22).</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair silky soft and managable!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I bought it the first time in a salon for about double the price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years having bought it originally at a beauty parlor and subsequently on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is light weight so it does not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> After some use I noticed the bottle (which was going down slowly) was suddenly disappearing quickly; my husband had tried and liked it so much he was using it every morning too!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product got such great reviews because it did nothing for my dry, frizzy, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer this one to the other popular one in the blue bottle because it is a lighter oil and does not leave my hair greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> You want one that your hair will easily absorb and hold to give your hair shine, reduce frizz, and not build up and make your hair look limp and oily.  </li>
            <li> This product did not control my frizz at all, but worked fine at adding some moisture and a little shine.  </li>
            <li> it was a half a bottle and it has lasted MONTHS, ive now used the last of it and needed more and decieded to check amazon to see if they have it.</li>
            <li> It tamed my wild gray hair, making it manageably soft and shiny but not limp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not sure how all these other people have had good experiences with it.</li>
            <li> This oil is not the same as the pure Argan oil that used to be sold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I was looking for a hair product that would smooth out my ends, so that I could go just a little longer before I got a hair cut.  </li>
            <li> My hair has static and is hard to comb through after a shower.</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s a clear oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pump packaging is MUCH easier to use and though it&#x27;s a very similar product it seems a bit \\&quot;lighter\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to substitute - do not waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair reallly soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> I was transitioning to natural hair</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated blonde, fine/thick, shoulder legnth straight with a bit of wave.</li>
            <li> I left the hotel  with straight hair but by the time we finished eating at the pier, I had an Afro.</li>
            <li> There, I found the climate to be much dryer than it was at my former home in Murray, Kentucky where I had lived for twenty-six years.  </li>
            <li> It shines the hair without leaving an oily residue, and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, just marvelously soft.  </li>
            <li> It shines the hair without leaving an oily residue, and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, just marvelously soft.  </li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Your skin becomes so soft and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I have used at least 3 bottles of this product and like the results: shine (wish there was more, but it&#x27;ll do)while conditioning.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this product and WOW.</li>
            <li> I used it yesterday and it made my hair soft, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li> but my hair can only be tamed so much.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and silky and what a shine.  </li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product for nearly one year.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> This one makes hair crunchy and it is not as nourishing so far in my opinion.</li>
            <li> And I have sensitive skin, no breakouts, prefer this over</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is course and prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Adds shine and makes hair soft.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I initially bought it instead of Moroccan Oil, and much prefer it.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair shiny, soft and keeps it from curling or frizzing.</li>
            <li> I tend to be sensitive to smells, so</li>
            <li> This is extremely reasonable and is the same quality of one you&#x27;d buy in stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my hair considerably softer and I&#x27;ve found no fault with it.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair soft shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li> So far I have tried the oils and conditioners.</li>
            <li> but Marrakesh oil keeps it so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> Having thick waist-length hair myself, I am very excited about discovering Moroccan argan oil.  </li>
            <li> My biggest problem is that most products that are designed for breakage, conditioning, etc. are really heavy or greasy, leaving my hair flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> I think the Marraskesh Oil works nearly as well, but I like the subtle scent of Josie Maran&#x27;s product MUCH more than this one.</li>
            <li> i have very dry frizzy natural curly hair, and i first got this from my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I add some to my hair when damp (you don&#x27;t need much) and it makes my hair dry faster when blow drying and my hair is very soft and never oily.</li>
            <li> The result is big, soft, wavy curls, lots of shine and no frizzy hair even in high humidity or rain.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended especially if one has problems with hair loss.</li>
            <li> It helps make my hair soft and cuts down on the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, want to THANK the company for making thing right when my 1st shipment was received damaged.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair but prefer it to be straight.  </li>
            <li> but because you don&#x27;t need much, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I use 4 pumps, spread it on my palms, and apply it to my wet hair -- ends first.</li>
            <li> With this, I actually get to have hair like normal people.</li>
            <li> Then, I quickly apply a little of the argan oil to my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I order this product and was amazed at the fast shipping and the price was less than 1/2 of of the salon&#x27;s price for the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick hard to manage hair, and this oil is the best hair treatment I have found so far.  </li>
            <li> About a month later I received a new bottle of Moroccan Oil as a gift, but I haven&#x27;t touched it.</li>
            <li> I looooove this product because I live in the South where it is constantly humid no matter the time of year.</li>
            <li> It is a very reasonably priced product compared to other similiar oils for hair.  </li>
            <li> This most recent purchase, even though the packaging is the same as what I had previously bought, the product inside is not the same.</li>
            <li> If you choose to use a soft mousse instead of soft hairspray suggested in the next step, you can just mix the oil with the mousse in the palm of your hand and then apply it throughout your hair.  </li>
            <li> If you choose to use a soft mousse instead of soft hairspray suggested in the next step, you can just mix the oil with the mousse in the palm of your hand and then apply it throughout your hair.  </li>
            <li> it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that loses moisture, attracts frizz and rebels with fly aways.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(Can&#x27;t use it for my younger daughter because she is very sensitive to any fragrances/has eczema.)</li>
            <li> But after adding this to my hair it suddenly becomes soft and silky!</li>
            <li> The days I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I just put enough marrakesh oil in to tame the frizz and smooth the ends</li>
            <li> My hair can appear dry and frizzy especially in the hot weather</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t do without this for my older daughter&#x27;s long, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and will continue to buy it for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, and I don&#x27;t use very much (about 1 pump for my ends, sometimes two on wet hair).</li>
            <li> Not on par with other argan oil treatments that simply contain more argan oil and less silicone.</li>
            <li> If you would like to obtain the complete booklet, just click on my name above this review, and you will be taken to my profile page here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair that requires taming on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The product left my hair incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> (mostly cuz I thin my hair so often.)  </li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because it said it was okay for thin hair.</li>
            <li> I find myself randomly smelling my own hair throughout the day after I use this.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair super soft and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit strange initially, but it keeps my hair smooth and flyaways down.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that controls it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I apply one pump to one and a half pump (I have pretty long hair) to my towel dried hair and it shortens my drying time and leaves my hair softer and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I was glad to see it on Amazon and for a few dollars less than what I paid for it in Miami.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat</li>
            <li> A very small amount really helps make my hair more manageable and shiny without making it heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten very dry and somewhat fuzzy as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  </li>
            <li> The only possible down side that can figure is that the scent is slightly stronger than most hair products.  </li>
            <li> I put a tinyyyy bit on each section (my hair is very thin and fine, so too much of anything just makes it greasy).</li>
            <li> , we can give you a full refund.\\&quot;, they WILL NOT give me a refund unless I remove my negative comment.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and really shines.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, no matter how much I use.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was half full and had leaked all over the inside of the box and other bottles.</li>
            <li> I try every new product and really like the softening and frizz control, and combine them in my hands to apply as the Sabino is verrry thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this herself and it works very well , but she has thinner, only slightly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> i have a lot of little fly-aways, but this keeps my hair so much smoother than it would otherwise be.</li>
            <li> My hair is easy to style and in half the time usually takes .</li>
            <li> You do have to be a little bit careful with the amount just because the smell is a bit strong but other than that it works wonders.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I think I had my first bottle for 6 months before replacing.</li>
            <li> first bottle lasted almost a year; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it was a bad scent (in fact, I liked it), but if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, you might want to try something else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really works to tame it.  </li>
            <li> I used it several times, and it certainly made my hair less dry and static-filled, but unfortunately I found the scent too strong for my personal taste.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, seeing as how I really don&#x27;t need extra oil in my life anywhere.</li>
            <li> It nearly elimates any frizz in any weather and does not give the greasy feeling that other serums may.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel very soft and it also cut down on the tangles.</li>
            <li> I think the price is a little too high.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone who has trouble with hair friz, poofiness, or unwanted curls in humid weather.</li>
            <li> Must be careful, using too much will give you an oily look (they have a cream version that is less greasy)</li>
            <li> When I applied it for the first time, my hair became flat and dull.</li>
            <li> If you have curly or dry hair, you will understand this pain, finding the right oil is hard.  </li>
            <li> Running a small amount through after I shower makes it so much easier to brush and style.</li>
            <li> --I recommend this to anyone who uses a flat iron on their hair.  </li>
            <li> I have waist long wavy blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long term but short term</li>
            <li> and I can tell it is going to last a long time.   </li>
            <li> i use this before flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> it only takes a dime size amount of this product for long hair.</li>
            <li> like the other review i read , i wash my hair at night , then apply this and let dry naturally overnight, then i flat iron in the morning.</li>
            <li> I use 3 pumps throughout on 50% dry hair (I still use my regular leave in conditioner)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fragile dry.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought a hairdryer to use because I work out 6 days a week and just don&#x27;t have time to let it air dry.</li>
            <li> so I can blow dry my hair silky straight without the frizz I usually get.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, difficult to manage hair and the oil helps significantly with frizziness while maintaining body.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair when I get out of the shower and my hair is still damp and then blow dry and flat iron it.</li>
            <li> Or when dry hair and going to use the flat iron/straightener.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t wash my hair it looks very greasy and dull.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you have thick or coarse hair.</li>
            <li> one complaint is that the packaging was very sticky when it arrived and it may have leaked in transit.</li>
            <li> and I got it one day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Moroccanoil user.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of the Marrakesh X Leave in Treatment and was looking for a heavier serum to deal with the D.C. humidity.</li>
            <li> You only need one or two pumps depending on how long your hair is - mine is down my back</li>
            <li> When I use this after shampoo and conditioning, instead of it taking about 40 minutes to blow dry (yes, that long) it takes about 10.</li>
            <li> I suffer from several chronic illnesses and as a result my hair was in pretty bad shape thanks to a lack of nutrients and neglect.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t compare it to other oils like it, but I will definitely purchase this again.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks, and I usually wash my hair every 4-5 days (because of this it doesn&#x27;t get oily as fast)</li>
            <li> I use some as a deep conditioner prior to showering, wash it out, then apply a little bit at the ends.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and use two pumps)</li>
            <li> Someone recommended Morrocan Oil to me for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Helps my hair comb out a lot easier and cuts time on blow dry.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with thinning, dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Three pumps while my hair is damp and blow dry...</li>
            <li> Made a difference in my dry hair in a week.  </li>
            <li> I like to use 2 squirts, rub it all over my hands and apply it through all of my damp hair (after I towel dry it).</li>
            <li> It turns my frizzy, dry hair to silky hair.  </li>
            <li> Apply after shampooing and toweling hair dry.</li>
            <li> , I straighten my hair, I blow it dry a lot.</li>
            <li> With this, I apply it after the shower, blow my hair dry, apply another pump, and style with a curling iron/wand or straightener.</li>
            <li> Tonight I let me hair air dry after using this and while it is still frizzy</li>
            <li> Since my hair is so dry, I also use some coconut oil from Parachute, 100% coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Controls dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Now after I work out and take a shower, I use a couple squirts alone on my damp hair then let it air dry, it gives my hair some overnight moisturization treatment.   </li>
            <li> and I needed something to keep my hair from being so dry and fly-away.  </li>
            <li> My curl pattern is a combination of 3b and 3c (or for you Devacurl girls corkicelli) and it is soooooooooo dry...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, I just let it air dry</li>
            <li> Now she doesn&#x27;t have dry ends.</li>
            <li> Leaves my normally dry hair moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I use a drop after washing my hair before I blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> I have very very dry and damaged long hair.</li>
            <li> I think it will last a long time however because a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and no static electricity.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft and manageable while not feeling heavy and greasy!</li>
            <li> this product keeps your hair soft slickly and shiney.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser has been using this on my hair for a couple of years now, and I finally broke down and bought it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way, so the bottle will last for months!</li>
            <li> My hair does not look or feel dry anymore!</li>
            <li> I did not pack for such a massive hair makeover and was not sure how to transform myself in time for the morning</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair when it&#x27;s wet or dry</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if my hair is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> In the morning my hair is dry, I sometimes add a little extra Sabino to the ends as I section my hair for each roller,</li>
            <li> once mine runs out, which it doesn&#x27;t seem like it will for a long time since a little bit does go a long way.</li>
            <li> but I could deal with it, but it made my hair staticky and fly away which is a very annoying feeling.</li>
            <li> I have heavily processed platinum hair that is occasionally straightened with a CHI straightener.  </li>
            <li> I am heading back to Miami in a few weeks and refuse to leave home without this product.</li>
            <li> Here is the partial quote from my booklet specifically regarding the use of argan oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but personally I don&#x27;t have any issues with this being too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> Now I just use this when my hair is wet</li>
            <li> I went back a few days after purchasing and bought the 4 piece set with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> if you are bothered by heavy perfumes or similar scented products, I recommend you try an unscented version.</li>
            <li> I apply it on my wet hair when I get done washing it.</li>
            <li> This product helps keep the ends of my curly hair from snarling up to make it easier to comb out when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy but sinks in and leaves it moisturized.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair that always seems to need taming.</li>
            <li> Even though I use it on wet hair, on dry hair for morning styling and again at night before brushing, this little bottle lasted a very long time.</li>
            <li> and I was worried it would get sickly, but once you apply it it has that exotic Argan oil smell</li>
            <li> My hair is just slightly longer than my shoulders, and I used about a nickel size amount and only applied to the bottom half of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Add shine and control to dry hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long, coarse hair and this stuff does the trick.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Be warned though, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only tiny con I have is it is very thick and needs to be spread carefully and evenly or it has a tendency to get gunky.</li>
            <li> This oil calms my hair without giving it an oily look unlike 99% of the other oils or elixirs I have used.</li>
            <li> I use it every time after I wash my hair (every other day).</li>
            <li> I give these bottles to other people and I could not give the one bottle out.</li>
            <li> I have other argon oil that has a dropper</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell aside, I have extremely damaged hair</li>
            <li> It smells wonderul, and what remains after application can be rubbed into your hands instead of being washed off like other hair products.  </li>
            <li> My shoulder-length hair is very dry and without a product like this it really suffers in our hot, windy, dry summers.</li>
            <li> I used this in my hair after showering on towl dry hair and then blew my hair dry and straightened it as usual.</li>
            <li> I have color-treated hair that looks sorta fuzzy and a bit dry -- not damaged, but not smooth either.</li>
            <li> I put a little through my ends before blow drying and then a little before flat ironing.</li>
            <li> After having a major surgery my hair was in serious need of repair.</li>
            <li> but I felt this product dried out my hair and left my hair feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> It deserves it , my hair is dry and hard to blow dry .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it to return it with shipping costs, so I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> This bottle will probably last me 6 months (at least)</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and use it on wet hair before drying and again on dried hair before ironing.</li>
            <li> I was using JF frizz-ezz for thick hair for years as that was the only thing that helped-well this has knocked that product out</li>
            <li> have frizzy coarse thick hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy...</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t weigh your hair down and won&#x27;t make it oily.</li>
            <li> down are gone.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighed down and greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have frizzies and it does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> you only need a small amount!</li>
            <li> It smoothed out my dry ends and keeps m my hair shiny without weighing it down and making it look greasy or limp!</li>
            <li> And I only used a very small amount........</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, dry hair, and it&#x27;s hard to make it do any of the listed traits above.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair silky and a lot less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Careful to use small amount or you will have greasy sticky hair.  </li>
            <li> My 1st bottle lasted 13 months and I have ultra thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>

            <li> I am Caucasian with very long and thick wavy hair that just does not like to behave.</li>
            <li> It feels thicker than Moroccan Oil, but still doesn&#x27;t weight down my thin blonde hair.</li>
            <li> It reminds me a little bit of cotton candy.</li>
            <li> A little oil in my hair</li>
            <li> I have colored hair and need a little moisture.</li>
            <li> This product has never made me hair look greasy or feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my hair in the store and my hair shined and started to relax a bit.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses it so decided to order some for my everyday use.</li>
            <li> I now do not have to wash my hair everyday, it looks get.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it you are so missing out.  </li>
            <li> I have used Marrakesh Oil for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday and my  hair looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> My hair/scalp are not oily at all, so I can go a few days adding the oil to my hair.</li>
            <li> I had used half of the trial sized vial one night as a leave-in treatment &amp; it worked wonders on my hair!</li>
            <li> Florida weather, but this stuff helps tame a lot of the frizz, and untangles post-shower knots.</li>
            <li> Which is no easy task.</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t need to use all those other \\&quot;shine\\&quot; and \\&quot;silkening\\&quot; hair products that I usually used before!</li>
            <li> A small about of this before/after heat styling and all those little hairs that go every direction but</li>
            <li> and I once lost my grip on the small bottle and wasted a quarter of the oil on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> NO MORE FRIZZIES....</li>
            <li> ( although do not like the smell, so not sure on/for what), but will NOT be using on my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually have no problem growing my hair, so I figured the ends were just breaking off.</li>
            <li> When you remove the towel, finger a small amount of Moroccan argan kernel oil throughout your hair or spray it throughout if you are using a spray formula.  </li>
            <li> When you remove the towel, finger a small amount of Moroccan argan kernel oil throughout your hair or spray it throughout if you are using a spray formula.  </li>
            <li> After blow-drying, I use a small amount to add shine to my hair and then apply hair spray.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive for the amount, but you only need a (nickel amount for me)tiny amount to run through your hair.</li>
            <li> I had to add my usual hair lotion and oil regimen to make it look the way it does with just my usual</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it felt so sticky and smelled so artificial.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this is even close to oil.</li>
            <li> I usually use a mousse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive size, especially for the size</li>
            <li> It smells like cotton candy, and while some may like that scent, it&#x27;s definitely not my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle</li>
            <li> Use a small amount and rub in palms before sporadically applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product in the past from beauty supply stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and hate to tie it back when I ride.</li>
            <li> Been using it for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> , it was looking a bit shabby to say the least.</li>
            <li> If not to benefit your hair, then at least for the smell.</li>
            <li> and I think this does actually help a bit, nothing crazy because of the extent of the damage I have done to my hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Not at all, it is way to thick and makes your hair look greasy by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF</li>
            <li> you have thick hair</li>
            <li> It is frizzy, it is CORSE, it is damaged, it is thick, it is tangly.</li>
            <li> I use five to seven pumps of the elixir in my waist length, fairly thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Works well on my thick wavy hair, helps with drying time quite a bit.</li>
            <li> have thick medium textures hair that is fizzy and unruly.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I combine the Marrakesh Oil with  Sabino Moisture Block, as my hair requires serious frizz control.  </li>
            <li> It was very dry and impossible to de-tangle.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have always had thin hair and this product makes my hair seem thicker and WAY shinier and softer.  </li>
            <li> I have really weird wavy, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just expensive packaging.</li>
            <li> Since I am unable to resolve my issue with the seller, I have asked Amazon to help.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Hey maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong.</li>
            <li> but I am addicted!</li>
            <li> I am beyond addicted to the smell!</li>
            <li> It makes my thin hair shiny and manageable!</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and flyaway, but I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> This product just makes my hair look dirty and oily.  </li>
            <li> and my hair ended up feeling/looking dirty.    </li>
            <li> I can get even the worst tangles out with very little effort with this product.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t make it in a perfume.</li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed because I thought i had ordered a spray oil rather than a serum.</li>
            <li> I decided to order it when I got home and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Annoying but didn&#x27;t detract from the product.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair like twice a day because this crap is so sticky.</li>
            <li> I hate frizz.  </li>
            <li> The worst?</li>
            <li> Worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product ... was recommended by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and leaves hair in such a suuuuper soft silky feeling. worth every penny</li>
            <li> It was great and loved it..</li>
            <li> I have straight hair that can go limp.  This product gives it shine and body.  It is not heavy the fragrance is soft and wonderful.  My daughters are both using this product and they love it, too!</li>
            <li> the oil leaves your hair soft and workable, without a major buildup, and gives it just the right shine</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny and easy to manage on days when it just wants to be a fuzz ball.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product smells amazing dries hair in half the time and non- greasy a must try &amp; you will be hooked like me</li>
            <li> MY HAIR STYLIST USED THIS ON MY HAIR AND I LOVED IT!!! IT SMELLS GOOD TOO! LEAVES HAIR SMOOTH AND SHINNY.</li>
            <li> My salon was out of Moroccan Oil so I tried this instead. The pump packaging is MUCH easier to use and though it&#x27;s a very similar product it seems a bit \\&quot;lighter\\&quot;. I notice I need to use more to get the same result, but others may not need to use as much as I do and may even prefer this formula. My shoulder-length hair is very dry and without a product like this it really suffers in our hot, windy, dry summers. I like how the Moroccan Oil smells and the Marrakesh Oil also has a pleasant fragrance but some may find it overly sweet. It reminds me a little bit of cotton candy. It smells and works much better than the Frizz-Ease products without making hair greasy or limp.    Even though I use it on wet hair, on dry hair for morning styling and again at night before brushing, this little bottle lasted a very long time. Overall I found this product an acceptable substitute with the same effects (silky, shiny, frizz-free hair) and the Amazon price is 1/3 what I paid.</li>
            <li> BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE....STOP WHAT YOU&#x27;RE DOING AND ORDER THIS PRODUCT!  IT IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! IT MAKES YOUR HAIR....SHINY, SMELL GOOD, TANGLE FREE,NO MORE FRIZZIES....ETC. ETC.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have very coarse and frizzy hair. I use it before blow drying and it helps a lot.  Then I use more for shine. Free shipping and price made this a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick hard to manage hair, and this oil is the best hair treatment I have found so far.  It&#x27;s a light oil the protects from heat styling so I can blow dry my hair silky straight without the frizz I usually get. (mostly cuz I thin my hair so often.)  Did I mention it smells divine too?  Well it does.</li>
            <li> Great product...should have bought 2!  Can&#x27;t beat the price either. My salon charges almost triple what I paid....it was a no brainer to purchase on amazon!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Would like for you guys not to discontinue the bands body and hand lotion</li>
            <li> Someone recommended Morrocan Oil to me for my dry hair.  So I came to Amazon, read lots of reviews and finally settled upon this product because it seemed like a good compromise between price and positive reviews.  I&#x27;m really happy with it.  I have long hair, fine hair that gets super tangled when I take a shower but this product is working like a charm to get the tangles out. And I actually love the smell as well (as does my husband).  So I can&#x27;t compare it to other oils like it, but I will definitely purchase this again.  I think it will last a long time however because a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I though it would be a great substitute, but it does not come close to the real thing.</li>
            <li> I used this in my hair after showering on towl dry hair and then blew my hair dry and straightened it as usual. This product made my hair feel very soft and it also cut down on the tangles. The only negative is the smell, hemp is not the most pleasant of odors in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this product, love the smell and how it makes my hair feel and how well it controls my hair. I will probably purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I had some Moroccan oil used on my hair at a salon, and i loved it! But I wasn&#x27;t sure about paying so much for what seemed like a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; non-greasy oil such as ([[ASIN:B000052YOR Neutrogena Body Oil, Light Sesame Formula - 8.5 fl oz]]...I thought it was just expensive packaging. And yes, I did try the Neutrogena oil on my hair but the light sesame oil scent was not as nice on the hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried a sample of this Marrakesh oil &amp; it was ab~fab! Worked perfectly for my frizzy hair. I had used half of the trial sized vial one night as a leave-in treatment &amp; it worked wonders on my hair! It felt smooth &amp; silky...And I didn&#x27;t need to use all those other \\&quot;shine\\&quot; and \\&quot;silkening\\&quot; hair products that I usually used before! (Although it did also work nicely as a light hair \\&quot;gel\\&quot; for daily touch-up conditioning!) That lasted for about 2 weeks, and then my hair began to miss it. The nice smell, the non-greasy after-feel, and that soft, silky sheen...Oh yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Marrakesh Oil Elixir really turned me on to Moroccan hair oil treatments! Now I just gotta have this Earthly Body hair oil!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Tried another brand &amp; it did not even come close to comparing. This does cost a little more, but for all that--it&#x27;s worth it!! I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> Does anyone have the ingredient list for this product? Does it only contain argan oil and hemp oil, or is it mixed with silicones and additives? Thanks in advance...</li>
            <li> Bought this as I ran out of Moroccan Oil (which I LOVE!!!). Based on the reviews I thought I could substitute and was hoping to like this oil, but no such luck. It  doesn&#x27;t have the same effect on my fine colored hair as the Moroccan oil has... And did not really care for the smell - Vanilla, if you ask me compared to the exotic awesome smell of the Moroccan oil. If you are trying to substitute - do not waste your time and money. The only thing i liked was the container... I might still use the oil for something else ( although do not like the smell, so not sure on/for what), but will NOT be using on my hair.</li>
            <li> Even with the new formula.  Been using it for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy many hair products. My hair is fine &amp; straight. I wash my hair every day because I produce enough oil and it looks very shiny every day. When I don&#x27;t wash my hair it looks very greasy and dull. When I don&#x27;t wash my hair I put it in a braid (very rare till recently). This product has by far worked very well whether or not I style it. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but when I want to style my hair I definitely use this product for styling and for heat protection. It smells really good and makes my hair look healthier and bouncier. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair detangeler ever.  I can get even the worst tangles out with very little effort with this product.  And I love the smell</li>
            <li> Love this product! Next time I order I think I will go for the whole set. I also want to point out that it was fast and efficient service. The company sent it out right away and I got it one day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> This product is truly wonderful!  My hair does not look or feel dry anymore!</li>
            <li> Although CP Cosmetics policy states \\&quot;For any unshipped item, we can give you a full refund.\\&quot;, they WILL NOT give me a refund unless I remove my negative comment. Since I am unable to resolve my issue with the seller, I have asked Amazon to help.  Has anyone ever experienced this unusual business practice??</li>
            <li> This stuff really gives you Hollywood hair! It is amazing. I have color-treated hair that looks sorta fuzzy and a bit dry -- not damaged, but not smooth either. I want shiney waves, and this finally gives it to me without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder-length hair. I use 4 pumps, spread it on my palms, and apply it to my wet hair -- ends first. Then I work it up through my hair getting it all over except for the 2 inches closest to my scalp. Then comb it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it -- you&#x27;ll LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Love this hair oil. It smells really great, very sweet, but it dies down to a subtle smell after 20 or so minutes. It makes your hair reallly soft and shinny. You can also you it on your skin. I will buy this again when I am out (it lasts quite a while. I have very long hair and use two pumps)</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!    It works great, smells, great, feels great!  After applying to hair, the left over product on your hands can be rubbed onto your arms.  This oil is the best!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, makes my hair so shiny and smooth and it is less that half of what salons charge so it happy for me!</li>
            <li> This product definitely gives you a wonderful shine and makes your hair really soft. However, what I was wanting it to do was to control my frizzy hair and it does do that to some extent, but not enough. What&#x27;s great about this product is how LONG is lasts... I&#x27;ve had my bottle for months now and it&#x27;s still going strong. You only need one or two pumps depending on how long your hair is - mine is down my back so I use about 3 pumps. This product has never made me hair look greasy or feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Marrakesh Oil for about a year and I love, love, love it. My hair is very thin and flyaway, but I have a lot of hair. This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that controls it without weighing it down. And it has a wonderful, sweet, earthy aroma. It works best for me in damp hair, but I know some people use a tiny amount to control dry hair. I highly recommend it either way!</li>
            <li> I came across this is my local beauty supply store over a year ago. I was transitioning to natural hair and I was on a product spree. it was sitting on the counter and it smelled pleasant. the store manager said it coul dbe used on your hair or skin. I went ahead and got and didn&#x27;t really use it much at first. Gradually I incorporated it into my hair routine and over time i noticed stronger healthier hair. I ran out of it and went back to the beauty supply and they were out of it. after about three months i gave up the search. I was looking around on amazon today and came across it once again by chance. I&#x27;m happy I found it and the price is much better than what I paid the first time. I would happily recomend it to anyone looking for an nice smelling oil to keep dry hair in order. I can&#x27;t say you&#x27;ll be as happy as I was but I don&#x27;t think it will hurt.</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated blonde, fine/thick, shoulder legnth straight with a bit of wave. After all of my flat-ironing, coloring and blow drying, I realized that I was dealing with some pretty severe damage after not protecting it properly. It seemed like one day I woke up and I had this head full of fried hair. I was also trying to grow it out for about a year and was getting no where with it. I usually have no problem growing my hair, so I figured the ends were just breaking off. I tried a lot of different treatments and shampoo/conditioners, styling products. I was getting really discusted and was about ready to cut it shorter and start over. My stylist talked me in to trying this and said many of her clients had luck with it. That was 2 months ago. I started using it daily- I use 3 pumps throughout on 50% dry hair (I still use my regular leave in conditioner), 1 pump on ends before styling, and maybe even 1 more for finishing (its great for smoothing). I also use it on my ends before bed. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy...it absorbs right in and makes it shiny and bouncy. Smells realy good...kind of a sweet, earthy smell. My hair already looks 75% better..it&#x27;s growing nicely, too. This is a great price- I paid $25 at the salon. It lasts forever- I&#x27;m about 2/3 through the bottle from 2 months ago. I&#x27;ll be ordering it from Amazon going forward. I buy from Amazon constanly but have never bothered to write a review before. Had to this time...it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Smells good but flakes if you put to much.</li>
            <li> i have very dry frizzy natural curly hair, and i first got this from my hairdresser. i have used the frizz ease products since i was 15 yrs old, and i try every new serum tht comes out just to see if somthing works better. my hairdresser used this on my hair and i loved the smell and how unbelievably soft and shiny and stright my hair was. she even gave me the bottle she had so i could use it and see if i liked it after long term use. it was a half a bottle and it has lasted MONTHS, ive now used the last of it and needed more and decieded to check amazon to see if they have it. im so thrilled at the price!!!!!!!!!! this is a really great product for naturally curly hair. like the other review i read , i wash my hair at night , then apply this and let dry naturally overnight, then i flat iron in the morning. my hair is just soooooooooo soft and shiny with this product! i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and im thrilled amazon has it at such a gr8 price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product am a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled with this product!  I have heavily processed platinum hair that is occasionally straightened with a CHI straightener.  Marrakesh oil is perfect to use out of the shower to lock in moisture and shine and is great to use as a heat protector before using hot tools.  It has the most incredible scent and makes your hair shinier and healthier.  I used to use CHI Silk Infusion but will only use this for now on.</li>
            <li> I bought a gift basket of Marrakesh products for my daughter for Christmas because it was on her list.  We had bought the Marrakesh oil in a salon and I wanted to get her more.  Amazon had a much better price.  This stuff is the best for hair.  Really works.  She liked all the stuff in her basket but the oil is the best.  I tried it and like it, too.</li>
            <li> OMG is all I can say about this product.  I guess this is what the pros use on the stars of Hollywood.  I have always had thin hair and this product makes my hair seem thicker and WAY shinier and softer.  If your hair is too curly on humid days, this would be great for that as well.  It is the best hair product I have found yet.  Thanks, Scott for your recommendation!</li>
            <li> Love it. I have thick, coarse hair and use it on wet hair before drying and again on dried hair before ironing. Works great and never feels heavy or greasy. I personally like the smell of the original which is kind of musky but many people don&#x27;t care for it so you might want to try the Dreamsicle or High Tide scents if you want something more feminine.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Helps my hair comb out a lot easier and cuts time on blow dry. Leaves a nice scent and great shine in hair!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product while on a business trip to Miami. I went to dinner and shopping with co-workers one evening;  I left the hotel  with straight hair but by the time we finished eating at the pier, I had an Afro. I did not pack for such a massive hair makeover and was not sure how to transform myself in time for the morning meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While shopping on the pier, I stumbled across this product. The sales person and a co-worker highly recommended it. I put a few drops on my hair in the store and my hair shined and started to relax a bit.  So I bought a bottle, went back to the hotel, and used it as a pressing oil. It smoked a little, like most pressing oils do, however, the results were amazing! I entered the meeting with straight, shining, healthy looking hair. Best of all, it stayed that way all day, even after another evening on the pier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who has trouble with hair friz, poofiness, or unwanted curls in humid weather. It may or may not work as well for you, but it is worth a try. For instance, I notice that it works better on my hair than on my daughter&#x27;s reddish hair. It does not give her the same shine as me unless she uses it as a pressing oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first bottle lasted almost a year; a little goes a long way. I am heading back to Miami in a few weeks and refuse to leave home without this product. I was glad to see it on Amazon and for a few dollars less than what I paid for it in Miami.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product got such great reviews because it did nothing for my dry, frizzy, damaged hair. I bought it thinking it would be a much better product than Silk but I felt this product dried out my hair and left my hair feeling stiff. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with thinning, dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! A little goes a long way. Great for using w/my hair straightener. Leaves hair smooth and shiny w/o leaving it oily. My hairdresser uses it so decided to order some for my everyday use.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, but good product</li>
            <li> Ships super fast!  There was a problem with the first order; however, seller rectified problem by sending another bottle!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this product, it makes my coarse, thick, curly hair shiny and smooth and I get a million compliments on how luscious it smells!</li>
            <li> The smell is delicious and it&#x27;s one of the few things which really makes my hair soft and shiny. It bounces now.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i flat iron my hair almost everyday and wanted some added protection and moisture, and i must say i&#x27;m very impressed! I put this on my hair after showering and the smell is absolutely amazing! My hair feels so much softer and for lack of a better word, feels flowy&#x3D;) I absolutely recommend this oil it is fabulous and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily like most shine sprays! Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Having thick waist-length hair myself, I am very excited about discovering Moroccan argan oil.  It works wonderfully well for moisturizing and shining the hair without leaving it feeling greasy.  What follows is quoted from my hair-care booklet which is available at my website as a free e-book download.  If you would like to obtain the complete booklet, just click on my name above this review, and you will be taken to my profile page here on Amazon.  There, you can click on the link to my website on Lulu and get your free e-booklet entitled, \\&quot;Laurel&#x27;s Personal Regimen for Healthy Hair at 50-Plus.\\&quot;  In it you will also find a recipe for Laurel&#x27;s Soft &amp; Shiny Hair-Rinse which you can make in your own kitchen from ingredients you probably already have on hand.  Here is the partial quote from my booklet specifically regarding the use of argan oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED ADDITIONAL STEPS:  Originally in this booklet, my final suggested step was to use a soft-hold hairspray before combing out your hair.  However, in June of 2009 a wonderful widower, Arthur Dearing II, found me and rescued me from my isolated seclusion.  He married me and moved me to his home in Sugar City, Idaho.  There, I found the climate to be much dryer than it was at my former home in Murray, Kentucky where I had lived for twenty-six years.  So, I found it necessary to add some steps.  Depending on the humidity where you live, you may not need to do these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In \\&quot;Step 8\\&quot; I recommend using Moroccan argan kernel oil on your hair.  There is a lot of information online about the marvelous benefits of applying this oil to the hair.  I have also found that it is just as wonderful as a quick facial moisturizer.  If I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to fool around with my eye and skin creams, I just quickly dab some witch hazel on my face and neck with a cotton ball as an astringent after cleansing my face.  Then, I quickly apply a little of the argan oil to my face and neck.  It is quickly absorbed, doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes, and is wonderfully moisturizing without feeling greasy.  That is also its great advantage as an after-shampoo application for the hair.  It shines the hair without leaving an oily residue, and your hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, just marvelously soft.  The three brands that I am familiar with and have used myself are; Marrakesh Oil which combines argan oil with hemp oil and smells lovely, which I bought on the US Amazon site, Fushi Organic Argan Oil which is pure argan oil and has no scent, which I purchased on the UK Amazon site, and Moroccan Gold Shimmer Shine spray, which my beautician uses on my hair after she trims it.  All three of those I can confidently tell you are very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Step 8:  Use argan oil:  When you remove the towel, finger a small amount of Moroccan argan kernel oil throughout your hair or spray it throughout if you are using a spray formula.  If you choose to use a soft mousse instead of soft hairspray suggested in the next step, you can just mix the oil with the mousse in the palm of your hand and then apply it throughout your hair.

            <li> Excellent product. Fast delivery. One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  Highly recommend ! I suggest this product to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended Marrakesh Oil to me 2 years ago and I am forever thankful--I recommend this to anyone who uses a flat iron on their hair.  It helps smooth frizz and protect hair from heat damage--the smell is amazing and I can tell a big difference in the overall feel of my hair throughout the day.  I&#x27;ve purchased several bottles as gifts for friends and they always agree this will be a staple in their routine from now on.  Love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My stylist used this on my hair the last time I had a cut/color.  I have long, wavy hair but prefer it to be straight.  This oil smells great, in a 1960s sort of patchouli way, so if you don&#x27;t like that, you probably won&#x27;t like the smell!  BUT, it does wonders for my hair.  Makes it practically tangle free, and works so well with blow drying it straight.  I am hooked.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Makes my hair silky smooth and smells great!</li>
            <li> All you need is a little, smells great !</li>
            <li> A very small amount really helps make my hair more manageable and shiny without making it heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. I have curly frizzy hair and a couple of drops of the Marrakesh Oil leave my hair beautiful. I get lots of compliments on my hair. I will continue to use this product as part of my daily routine. thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this product soooooooo much!  It makes my hair feel and look amazing.  I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.  A little bit goes a long way.  Excellent value for the price. I have waist long wavy blonde hair.  It works great for straightening or after I blow dry for a nice shine and friz control.  It does not make my hair oily looking.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, it is great and better than any others I have tried. My hair has never been healthier</li>
            <li> marrakesh hair oil elixir is very good . it makes my hair shine and it smells so good. i use it every time i wash my hair.it does,nt leave any oily feeling on my hair, but my hair feels silky,i bought the marrakesh oil elixir this time as a christmas present for my daughters.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  I&#x27;ve purchased this product several times and will continue to purchase.  It helps my frizzy hair tremendously.  I like the scent as well.</li>
            <li> First of all I love the smell of this oil!  I have used at least 3 bottles of this product and like the results: shine (wish there was more, but it&#x27;ll do)while conditioning.  I have medium length hair, super fine but fairly thick, and naturally wavy with some frizz.  I like to use 2 squirts, rub it all over my hands and apply it through all of my damp hair (after I towel dry it). After blow-drying, I use a small amount to add shine to my hair and then apply hair spray.  It is a very reasonably priced product compared to other similiar oils for hair.  I actually prefer this one to the other popular one in the blue bottle because it is a lighter oil and does not leave my hair greasy looking.  I also think it has helped condition and protect my hair from heating tools.  It eliminates most of my frizziness--not all--but enough to make it look smoother.</li>
            <li> I was offered this product at my stylists salon during a routine trim and touch up of my hair.  I normally do not buy into a lot of extra products due to the cost and, I never seem to be totally happy with them.  I think it was the scent that first attracted me to this product, I  LOVE the smell!!  It goes beyond that though, my hair was silky feeling and smooth.  It also had a shine to it which was wonderful.  Since that day, I have been purchasing this item with continued happiness of the outcome it provides for me.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. This was recommended to me by my Hair stylist. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I order this product and was amazed at the fast shipping and the price was less than 1/2 of of the salon&#x27;s price for the exact same thing. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 years now and I LOVE it! Being a hairstylist, I have tried every product out there so I know what works the best. I have used this product on people with thick, dry hair and people with fine, damaged hair and this product is great for both. It won&#x27;t weigh your hair down and won&#x27;t make it oily. It also will help with your color if you are in the sun a lot.</li>
            <li> I have been using Marrakesh oil for years, and I love it! It is a thicker oil, with a lovely spiced smell. I have thick hair that is naturally wavy - I&#x27;ve read many others opt for the light version but personally I don&#x27;t have any issues with this being too heavy for my hair. I use almost daily, always working a squirt or two into my hair after shampooing and prior to blow drying. I love the smell, and I think it does a great job holding the style of my hair a definitely creating shine!</li>
            <li> This is a great for tangles and it Leaves my hair sleek and shiny.  And I really love the fragrance of the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Transformed my dreads into fabulous smelling, soft, sumptuous locks!  Seemed to change the very weight of my hair.  I loved the product so much, I immediately ordered a bottle for my sister!  Nice stuff!</li>
            <li> Tried a sample of this product from the beauty supply store.  It worked great on my over processed, curly hair so I bought a bottle on Amazon.  My curls are now uniform, soft and full of life.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Hair&amp;#34; over heels in love with this product.  Great price, speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fought with trying to straighten my wavy (and frizzy with humidity) hair for decades. My hair stylist recommended this product, but I now buy online because it is a third of the price online compared to the salon. It is the best product out there and actually makes my hair dry faster and does not make my hair feel or look greasy like some products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Moroccanoil user.  It worked just fine. but I decided to see if there was something out there that worked better and was hopefully cheaper.  I have to say, I absolutely love Marrakesh Oil!  I apply a little to towel dried hair and blow dry as usual.  A little goes a long way.  I have hair that is to my mid-lower back and I use about 1-1.5 pumps.  Since using it, my hair is the softest that it has ever been.  It also feels and looks healthy.  This is so much more affordable than Moroccanoil, but in my opinion, it works even better.  Plus, it smells absolutely divine!  I most definitely will repurchase after the bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> A small about of this before/after heat styling and all those little hairs that go every direction but down are gone.  Also great for you hair, makes it smooth, soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It turns my frizzy, dry hair to silky hair.  Been using it for two years.</li>
            <li> Never greasy, smells great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. It does wonders on my normally frizzy hair. I put it on my hair when I get out of the shower and my hair is still damp and then blow dry and flat iron it. It definitely makes my hair smoother. Also I love the smell. I bought my first bottle at the salon for double this price ($22).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of the Marrakesh X Leave in Treatment and was looking for a heavier serum to deal with the D.C. humidity. I decided to try this product and WOW. It&#x27;s a bit greasy to the touch at first, but it absorbs into the hair well and makes it look rich and healthy. My hair is dry and fine and I wear it short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that the packaging was very sticky when it arrived and it may have leaked in transit. Annoying but didn&#x27;t detract from the product. I rinsed off the bottle and was good to go.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair oily, just very manageable, plus it smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years.</li>
            <li> I had priced this at my beauty salon and it was $25.00. Very pleased with the price and product.</li>
            <li> I love it. Best oil I have ever used 4 my hair .smells good n leaves my hair so soft</li>
            <li> Great consistency of product and smells fantastic! A little goes a LONG way, so the bottle will last for months!</li>
            <li> Introduced by my hair dresser in 2010- this is the best detangler- softness- shine-healthy to hair shaft and the best savings. I don&#x27;t have to buy creme rinses every month. My 1st bottle lasted 13 months and I have ultra thick long hair. It&#x27;s expensive for the amount, but you only need a (nickel amount for me)tiny amount to run through your hair. Totally surprised and happy that my Hubby found this on amazon.Apply after shampooing and toweling hair dry. The price was right --I bought 3 bottles. I love the product.  Marnikins</li>
            <li> Excellent product - really keeps my hair moist, hydrated and beautiful!!!  I would highly recommend this product and will continue to buy it for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> Love this hair oil!!! Smells amazing! Product was as described and was a great price! I definitely would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I used it yesterday and it made my hair soft, shiny, and manageable. I have thick, curly, dry hair, and it&#x27;s hard to make it do any of the listed traits above. The oil smells amazing, too! I very much recommend it.</li>
            <li> WOW! I AM SHOCKED at how awesome this stuff is! I have used biosilk silk protein in my hair for 13 years, my bottle ran out and I picked this up on  a whim during Prime Day (lol). This oil brought my hair back to life! I haven&#x27;t had my hair trimmed in 11 months, it was looking a bit shabby to say the least. But after adding this to my hair it suddenly becomes soft and silky! My split ends and frizz are whipped into shape! The scent is like a lovely warm vanilla, I am so in love with this product :)</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, leaves hair feeling soft and smooth. I gave it three stars because it said it was okay for thin hair. Not at all, it is way to thick and makes your hair look greasy by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you have thick hair this is perfect for a thermal protector and helps dry your hair 3 times faster.</li>
            <li> When I first pumped this stuff into my hand, I thought &amp;#34;uh oh, there&#x27;s silicone in here.&amp;#34; I looked for an ingredients list on the package and if there was a list, it was covered by a white product sticker. Once removed, the whole label came off. What&#x27;s in it? Who knows? Sure it says it contains hemp and argan, but in what quantities?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on my wet hair and worked it in. It did disappear like people said it would, that being said, my hair was just as frizzy as not using it. I tried more (about 4-5 pumps for hair about 8&amp;#34; below my shoulders). Not enough. I had to add my usual hair lotion and oil regimen to make it look the way it does with just my usual routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, ugh. It reminds me of this stuff my mom used to use called Sulfur 8. But that being said, once my hair dries the odor is gone. It&#x27;s not worth it to return it with shipping costs, so I&#x27;m stuck with it. Bummer.</li>
            <li> I only wish it were cheaper (for the same quality of course) because I could use this by the buckets : )</li>
            <li> Anyone who has ever used this oil knows it is the absolutely best for shine, shine, shine and eliminating the frizz.  My hairdresser has been using this for years and one day I woke up and said &amp;#34;why the heck don&#x27;t I just buy some for myself to use at home&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m glad I did and you will be too.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t do without this for my older daughter&#x27;s long, curly hair.  It makes it super shiny, and it smells SOOOOO good!&lt;br /&gt;(Can&#x27;t use it for my younger daughter because she is very sensitive to any fragrances/has eczema.)</li>
            <li> My hair... How to describe my hair. Unruly? The worst? My husband refers to it as lioness. The lion&#x27;s mane.. And probably in his mind, frizz ball. I highlight my hair, I straighten my hair, I blow it dry a lot. I needed SOMETHING to help me protect it. It is frizzy, it is CORSE, it is damaged, it is thick, it is tangly. But this stuff definitely helps! I have only been using it for a few weeks, and I usually wash my hair every 4-5 days (because of this it doesn&#x27;t get oily as fast) but I style it sometimes 2-3 times between washes. With this, I apply it after the shower, blow my hair dry, apply another pump, and style with a curling iron/wand or straightener. This makes my hair manageable and does NOT make it greasy! It is lightweight and it smells HEAVENLY. I cannot figure out what it smells like but it makes me do a double sniff (think double take but sniff style). I haven&#x27;t used it long term but short term it gets the job done. I wish it de tangled a little more but my hair can only be tamed so much. Tonight I let me hair air dry after using this and while it is still frizzy (I have NEVER found a product that makes it frizzless), it is so much more calm than usual! Just get some. If not to benefit your hair, then at least for the smell. ;)</li>
            <li> This product just makes my hair look dirty and oily.  I had to wash my hair 3 times to get all of it..  And I only used a very small amount........</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it you are so missing out.  I&#x27;ve tried many differnt similar types of product but nothing compares to how this makes your hair feel and smell.  DEVINE!</li>
            <li> i have a lot of little fly-aways, but this keeps my hair so much smoother than it would otherwise be. i use it daily, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the most healing, smoothing, heavenly scented oil I have found. I have naturally curly/wavy hair that requires taming on a daily basis. This oil calms my hair without giving it an oily look unlike 99% of the other oils or elixirs I have used. After having a major surgery my hair was in serious need of repair. This oil provided the support my hair needed during the time of nutrient deficiency and provides the finishing touch now during my time of health. The scent is amazingly heavenly and I no longer put my perfume in my hair, like I used to. In fact, I often simply use the original Marrakech oil as my signature scent. I buy the gift packs for birthdays and Christmas with overwhelming approval. I recommend the marrokesh oil hair styling elixir to any hair type during any stage of life or health.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I ran out of Moroccan Oil and didn&#x27;t have the money to buy a new bottle. About a month later I received a new bottle of Moroccan Oil as a gift, but I haven&#x27;t touched it. I ended up preferring Marrakesh. I&#x27;m now on my second bottle. It feels thicker than Moroccan Oil, but still doesn&#x27;t weight down my thin blonde hair. I work one pump into my ends while my hair is damp and then run whatever is left on my hands over the top of my head. My hair feels much more healthy than when I was using Morrocan Oil.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best things I have ever put on my hair. If you got curly/wavy hair it is a must!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Makes my hair feel wonderful and love the smell.  I feel it makes it easier to style my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Marrakesh Oil for quite a few years.  It is a staple in my hair care regimen.  It makes my hair soft and smooth, and it smells deicious.</li>
            <li> y hairdresser turned me on to this product.  I love it and use it every day.  Great for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair. It&#x27;s so good I&#x27;m pretty well going to call up the company and let them know this. I have really weird wavy, thick hair. It will frizz like no-bodies business. With this, I actually get to have hair like normal people.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and makes my hair feel light. Great oil!&lt;br /&gt;I get complements all the time on the scent. LOVE!</li>
            <li> This product really makes your hair shine &amp; leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Marakesh Oil by my hairdresser.  He applies it to my hair prior to blow drying and it is especially great for flat ironing.  It leaves your hair soft and silky and what a shine.  I receive compliments on the shine all the time.  If you color your hair, it really enhances the color as well.  It is $25.00 at the salon and only $8.99 here.  Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> I give Marrakesh Hair Oil a five star it deserves every bit of it. This product is the bomb, it leaves your hair feeling sooo soft and nice. I will recommend this product to every and anyone that wants to know which oil is best to use on their clients, family and friends hair. MARRAKESH HAIR OIL is it.</li>
            <li> I like to use this on my hair after I shower.  It makes my hair feel soft and no static electricity.</li>
            <li> and then some, I have long thick bleached blonde hair and this is so nourishing and exquisite....contact me, want me, please</li>
            <li> my prior hair dresser used it and I love the smell and how it makes my hair look and feel. I can only buy this now online since the beauty stores (like Sally) don&#x27;t carry it. but, I love it</li>
            <li> Add shine and control to dry hair without weighing it down.  Also found it was a good conditioner.  It never builds up.  I put it on 3 days in a row with no build up at all</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  I use this product after washing, applying to damp hair.  It has helped with dryness issues and my hairdresser has even noticed the difference in my hair since I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this product for nearly one year. The smell is intoxicating not to mention the wonderful sheen it leaves in your hair and it&#x27;s all natural. I love it!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully for the ends of long hair. Stops friz in it&#x27;s tracks.  Careful to use small amount or you will have greasy sticky hair.  If you apply properly it&#x27;s the best product I have used.  My hairdresser turned me on to this.</li>
            <li> I love this product it does not leave your hair oily and tames the frizz!  Since my hair is so dry, I also use some coconut oil from Parachute, 100% coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is not the same as the pure Argan oil that used to be sold. This one makes hair crunchy and it is not as nourishing so far in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I really like it so far.  Have fine hair but it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and really shines.</li>
            <li> Works great, very strong, good for color treated dark toned hair. And I have sensitive skin, no breakouts, prefer this over it&#x27;s a ten products.</li>
            <li> It deserves it , my hair is dry and hard to blow dry . My hair is easy to style and in half the time usually takes . This product gives it shine also . I have tried products that cost alot . This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Not on par with other argan oil treatments that simply contain more argan oil and less silicone. I was surprised that it felt so sticky and smelled so artificial. Only then did I check the ingredients. It contains mostly cyclopentasiloxane. After that is dimethicone, phenyltrimethicone, cyclomethicone, and isopropyl myristate. You can find those in many other well rated hair oil treatments that even include argan oil at 1/3 the price if you&#x27;re ok with the silicone mixture. At the bottom of the ingredient list is argan oil, hemp, and fragrance. It was enough to get it into my search results. The exotic appearing branding was effective.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have ever used! I have thick, naturally curly hair that always seems to need taming. This oil is perfect. It does not leave a residue, it is good consistency, and it smells good! This is a staple in my house!</li>
            <li> I put Marrakesh oil prior to blow drying, and it always makes my hair more manageable and protects it from the heat. I have straight blonde hair, and curl my hair with hot roller too.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this is light but gives some body and prevents the fly-aways in winter months. Makes hair shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Takes the moisture out of your hair, allowing for very quick drying time. Smooth and silky locks!</li>
            <li> I originally had this oil used on my hair after having it trimmed at a beauty shop in Tucson, Arizona. It seems to work pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome for when your hair gets unruley with frizz! you only need a small amount! wish it was available at a local salon</li>
            <li> The only hair oil I use. It&#x27;s perfect and the smell is amazing. I&#x27;m on my second bottle!</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine, blonde frizzy hair and Marrakesh Oil Hair Styling Elixir really does soften and reduces frizzies, and I love the fragrance.  My hairdresser uses this herself and it works very well , but she has thinner, only slightly frizzy hair.  I combine the Marrakesh Oil with  Sabino Moisture Block, as my hair requires serious frizz control.  I try every new product and really like the softening and frizz control, and combine them in my hands to apply as the Sabino is verrry thick and sticky.  They both require some adjustment to figure out how much to apply, but the results are the best I have ever had. I wash my hair at night, apply the products and go to bed (NO BLOW DRYING).  In the morning my hair is dry, I sometimes add a little extra Sabino to the ends as I section my hair for each roller, spray with Nexxus Heat Protex Heat Protection Styling Spray ( also helps to soften hair better than any other heat protective styling spray), and put it up in jumbo hot rollers.  The result is big, soft, wavy curls, lots of shine and no frizzy hair even in high humidity or rain.</li>
            <li> I purchased bottles for my 2 daughters, and they love how soft it makes their hair feel.  It shortens the drying time and smells good, too.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighed down and greasy at all.  My hair is fine and dry and this stuff makes my hair look much better than when I don&#x27;t use it.  It is much shinier and just looks more healthy in general.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this to me.  I have naturally curly hair that is course and prone to frizz.  This product did not control my frizz at all, but worked fine at adding some moisture and a little shine.  I did try using a little more to control the frizz and my hair ended up feeling/looking dirty.    It has a very distinctive scent to it.  The first time I used it my husband asked if someone smoked a pipe in our house.  The scent reminded him of his grandfather&#x27;s tobacco pipe, it kind of smells like vanilla pipe tobacco.</li>
            <li> The product did exactly what I was expecting. It tamed my wild gray hair, making it manageably soft and shiny but not limp! I love it and will reorder when my supply runs low.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Makes my hair feel silky and soft.  I love the way it smells, too.</li>
            <li> I got the kit. I love em all and use them all! Best smell ever!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! Makes my hair silky and a lot less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! The smell is amazing and it&#x27;s my new favorite hair product. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday and my  hair looks and feels healthier. My hairdresser said to use it daily when I get out of the shower, so I&#x27;ve been following his instructions and it&#x27;s paying off.  It was starting to frizz from coloring and I feel this product is saving it!!  I will continue to buy this oil, and again, I can&#x27;t get past how good it smells!</li>
            <li> This is basically some sticky chemical substance they have poured into a bottle. I&#x27;m not sure how this is even close to oil. I&#x27;m also not sure how all these other people have had good experiences with it. My scalp dries up and contracts dandruff a day after I put it on. I have to wash my hair like twice a day because this crap is so sticky. Worst.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t straighten my hair without it! Smells great too.</li>
            <li> I love  the oil! I think the price is a little too high. The smell is amazing and I love what it does to my hair</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS. Will be buying as my regular after shower hair care product. I purchased this in January, and I still haven&#x27;t used the whole bottle. I use it every time after I wash my hair (every other day). I use five to seven pumps of the elixir in my waist length, fairly thick, wavy hair. I don&#x27;t have frizz, my hair becomes super soft and shiny, and it makes untangling so much easier. It also smells lovely. Much smarter buy than drugstore after shower care products.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as moroccan oil, which can easily make your hair look greasy if you apply just a smidge too much of it. This is light, smells great, and makes my hair shine. What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this formula for keeping her hair soft, shining, healthy, and lovely. Highly Recommended especially if one has problems with hair loss.</li>
            <li> love what this product does for my long hair, soft, easy, conditioned, nice smell and moisterised  love this product thanks</li>
            <li> I have used Marrakesh oil for about a year now, and it is great for hair that is curly and tends to friz, especially in humid weather conditions!  And this price is great!</li>
            <li> Marrakesh Oil does not lay on top of the hair like most oils.  It gets absorbed and creates great shine and smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I once got my hair done by a friend. She pulled out this magical Marrakesh oil. At first I was skeptical, seeing as how I really don&#x27;t need extra oil in my life anywhere. However, I was amazed to find this product makes my hair softer than it&#x27;s ever been from a hair product. On top of that, the smell is out of this world good. I find myself randomly smelling my own hair throughout the day after I use this. Do I love this so much I bought a backup bottle? Yes. Yes, I do.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this oil while I was at the shop one day.  She stated it was the only product from which she got results after chemo.  It makes my hair soft and manageable.  I don&#x27;t have frizzies and it does not weigh my hair down.  Not only is it great for my hair but its good for my skin.  The fragerance is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Adds shine and makes hair soft. I use it daily after drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly in the winter months. Gives my thin hair body and great manageability. Leave it smelling wonderful and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Intoxicating smell and brilliant shine. I am in love with this whole line of hair products and I am a hair product junkie. My hair stylist uses this line and that&#x27;s how I found out about it. I had never heard of it before. Great price as well.</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes hair soft and not oily.  It is now my replacement of the citre shine sleek frizz away I&#x27;ve used for years.  So happy with it.  Musky smell, easy pump bottle (glass).  WOW</li>
            <li> i try to use it after the bath. try to use little portion because is really oily but very good for hair.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair grow. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the product! It helps de-frizz my curly hair. You don&#x27;t need much to spread around in your hair either...I think some people may have used too much and that&#x27;s why they said it&#x27;s like glue. I LOVE the scent and when anyone gets close to my hair they say they love it to and ask me what I use. This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen for it anywhere and they had ULTRA fast shipping! I will definitely be buying this product from Amazon from now on! :)</li>
            <li> Great but a little heavy.  Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed because I thought i had ordered a spray oil rather than a serum. However, this stuff is amazing! My hair has never been so soft and manageable while not feeling heavy and greasy! I put a little through my ends before blow drying and then a little before flat ironing. I would recumbent this to anyone. The smell is different but I like it.</li>
            <li> My Sister is a hair stylist, she is always giving me new things to try. This is one I am sticking with. I have curly and coarse hair, so I can use quite a bit of product.  Now I just use this when my hair is wet and then a drop or two to smooth out when dry. I really like the smell but some people review that they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I could not find this product in the local beauty stores.  It was nice to find it online at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 years now and my hair has never been so healthy. This does not leave an oily residue or make your hair feel greasy..</li>
            <li> I love the scent, I wish they would make a perfume! Must be careful, using too much will give you an oily look (they have a cream version that is less greasy) but it does smooth your hair when frizzy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!  Gives good control and makes my hair shine.  I no longer can live without it!</li>
            <li> Oh my! I was looking for a serum spray when I came across this and read some of the prior reviews...  Many commented about how they love the smell and I must say I whole-heartedly agree, it smells and feels luxurious.  I&#x27;m also really pleased with how lightweight it seems to be in my hair.  Great value for money, I&#x27;d still love to find a spray for ease of use but I do love this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Controls dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice but need a larger bottle without an increase in price.</li>
            <li> I love how this product works! My hair looks wonderful! I have long, thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling to it! :) happy customer.</li>
            <li> I had already been using this product before ordering it through amazon.  The salon I regularly purchased it from was no longer carrying it and could not find it anywhere locally thus I ordered it here.  The time line in processing, packaging and delivering my order definitely deserved 5 stars and I would come back as a return customer.  The product itself is excellent.</li>
            <li> I discovered this oil during a trip to my local beauty school where I get my cut and color done.  Every visit they offer to put a product in your hair when they style.  I&#x27;ve found a couple good products this way, and this is hands down my favorite so far.  I have very fine color treated hair so it&#x27;s frizzy and it&#x27;s fragile dry.  I usually use a mousse.  On the visit I discovered this oil, the gal mixed one squirt of oil in with a handful of mousse (for even distribution) - and the results were wonderful!  It&#x27;s light, smells awesome and most of all I find it helps moisturize AND tame the frizzies.  Now after I work out and take a shower, I use a couple squirts alone on my damp hair then let it air dry, it gives my hair some overnight moisturization treatment.   After some use I noticed the bottle (which was going down slowly) was suddenly disappearing quickly; my husband had tried and liked it so much he was using it every morning too!    I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This oil is of good quality. I have coarse, difficult to manage hair and the oil helps significantly with frizziness while maintaining body. It is not greasy and is very easy to work through your hair. The pump dispenses the perfect amount of oil and I can tell it is going to last a long time.   People say they like the smell, but the first time I used this oil it was all I could smell for the rest of the day. It was too strong! However, I think I have gotten used to it because now it is pretty mild.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes your hair feel awesome, and healthy! I highly recommend this if you want a fulfilling life:)</li>
            <li> I am currently on my 3rd bottle of this stuff!! It smells heavenly!! Its makes my hair frizz-free and allows for my hair to look presentable after just air-drying.  Also, this stuff lasts forever! This bottle will probably last me 6 months (at least)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and happy with it. It smoothes your hair and help styling. I recommend it</li>
            <li> Just about to reorder!  Smells amazing and my hair always feels healthier after I&#x27;ve used it!  Hight recommend this lovely product!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It nearly elimates any frizz in any weather and does not give the greasy feeling that other serums may.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Originally purchased it from my hair dresser and then found it on her a tad cheaper! Makes your hair silky soft and managable!</li>
            <li> this is my wife&#x27;s favorite hair product. this product helps keep hair looking great and holds the style.</li>
            <li> There are two things you should know before I make my review...&lt;br /&gt;1. I have super fine hair that grows slower than molasses in winter time.  I&#x27;m trying to grow it out, and I haven&#x27;t had a hair cut in about 8 months.&lt;br /&gt;2. I have tried every hair product known to mankind.  I&#x27;m basically a hair junkie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I was looking for a hair product that would smooth out my ends, so that I could go just a little longer before I got a hair cut.  My biggest problem is that most products that are designed for breakage, conditioning, etc. are really heavy or greasy, leaving my hair flat and lifeless.  I knew I wanted a hair oil, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a product that I might throw out after one or two uses.  After reading some reviews, I went with this Marrakesh Oil....and I AM SOOOO GLAD I DID!!  Wow!  I&#x27;m completely impressed.  My hair is just slightly longer than my shoulders, and I used about a nickel size amount and only applied to the bottom half of my hair.  The product left my hair incredibly soft.  Even after a whole day of wearing my hair down, I could still easily run my fingers through it without brushing it out first.  I was most impressed that even on the second day, the oil still didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.  The only possible down side that can figure is that the scent is slightly stronger than most hair products.  I&#x27;m not saying it was a bad scent (in fact, I liked it), but if you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, you might want to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up...super soft hair, weightless and non-greasy, great price, and slightly heavier scent.  Just try it...trust this hair junkie.  I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever heard of this was when my friend added to my hair after dying it.  The fragrance reminded me of chocolate and had an exotic smell to it.  It mentioned on the bottle at the time that it was good for straightening hair but it also seems to help mine curl more.  When I use it I feel like I am feeding my hair vitamins and my hair is happy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything like was advertised.</li>
            <li> wonderful scent, a little goes a long way, keeps hair manageable, fresh, shiney.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The only hair product I use. My hair stylist uses it as well and it&#x27;s the only thing that protects, strengthens and adds shine without looking greasy. Works very well in humidity as well.</li>
            <li> I looooove this product because I live in the South where it is constantly humid no matter the time of year. I recently bought a hairdryer to use because I work out 6 days a week and just don&#x27;t have time to let it air dry. When I use this after shampoo and conditioning, instead of it taking about 40 minutes to blow dry (yes, that long) it takes about 10. I cannot believe the difference. I will say I don&#x27;t know how I feel about it&#x27;s anti humidity properties because my hair still frizzes, but the time it saves in blow drying alone makes it worth a repurchase for me.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for hair and skin. The aroma is beautiful! I used very little in my hair as recommended and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> My hair is wild and wirey and this oil tames it nicely.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if my hair is wet or dry.  I always apply it after shampooing even though I use a conditioner.  If my hair becomes frizzy, I rub a couple of drops into the palms of my hands and apply it to my hair and it works like magic!</li>
            <li> A great product makes my hair nice and soft and easy to style with blower dryer only need a little bit goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling GREAT and not weighed down, but gives a nice shine. Gives a warm spicy smell too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and it is the only product that keeps my hair from frizzing.  It also gives it some shine.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was half full and had leaked all over the inside of the box and other bottles. Not an easy mess to clean. I give these bottles to other people and I could not give the one bottle out.</li>
            <li> I use this product on the days after I&#x27;ve washed my hair when I just need to freshen it up (or get rid of my \\&quot;bed head\\&quot;).  I initially bought it instead of Moroccan Oil, and much prefer it.  I&#x27;ve had several positive comments about how nice my hair smells, and I get a product that helps style my hair as well!  It&#x27;s a definite \\&quot;win-win\\&quot; in the hair dept.</li>
            <li> Good Product. Came on Time. No complaints</li>
            <li> Makes my gray hair shine!</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful</li>
            <li> I had read a lot about this product online so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I honestly thought it would just be some greasy anti-frizz serum that would totally weigh my hair down but I was wrong. I love this stuff, and it smells great. You do have to be a little bit careful with the amount just because the smell is a bit strong but other than that it works wonders. It smoothed out my dry ends and keeps m my hair shiny without weighing it down and making it look greasy or limp! Definitely recommend it and I have my mom and sister hooked on this stuff too!</li>
            <li> Better than most tea tree oil from the hair salon.</li>
            <li> I love this Marrakesh hair oil. It keeps my dry ends under control and the smell is wonderful, not chemical smelling, more natural.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase, because some people claimed this product smelled really strong, but I was pleasantly surprised by the scent! To me, it smells like french toast...like cinnamon and maple. It&#x27;s not overly strong or spicy, and just leaves a light, sweet smell in my hair. My boyfriend really likes the way it smells in my hair, and I like the way it makes my hands smell and feel, as well. Plus, it really works! I have very fine, flat hair, which likes to frizz up in the wet, Florida weather, but this stuff helps tame a lot of the frizz, and untangles post-shower knots. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, no matter how much I use. I went back a few days after purchasing and bought the 4 piece set with the shampoo and conditioner. The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars is that the pump bottle doesn&#x27;t work, so I have to unscrew the top and get the product off the tube to use. Hopefully the pump in the 4 piece set will work, and I&#x27;ll just have a spare bottle. Otherwise, very pleased.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product! I got it for about 10 bucks and it works wonders on your hair. It not only eliminates hair frizz but it also nourishes your hair, making it look healthy and shiny! The best part would have to be the smell that it gives out, I love it, its coconut. If any complains would have to be that when it arrived it had spilt a bit and the bottle was greasy..but who cares? I wiped it up and it works, and its awesome! Its a MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser has been using this on my hair for a couple of years now, and I finally broke down and bought it. It smells great and has a wonderful effect on my hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE MarKesh Elixer.  My hair feels healthy and it gives it a healthy shine.  I never like to run out of it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Makes my hair look defrizzed, healthy, and shiny. Has a nice fragrance too! I bought two of these bottles and I am very happy that I did. My mother uses and loves this product also. Good hair product and good price on amazon!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My stylist uses it on me at the salon and tried to sell me a bottle for almost 3 times as much as it was sold for on here. My hair is very coarse and this makes it like silk.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 8 months love it! Makes your hair shiny, soft and keeps it from curling or frizzing.</li>
            <li> I have been using Marrakesh oil elixir now for a few years and it works great!  It took me awhile to get used to the smell(didn&#x27;t like it at first), but now I don&#x27;t even notice it.  I have curly, frizzy, non-complient hair and marrakesh oil really works to tame it.  I only wash my hair one or two times a week, since I straighten or smooth it out.  After washing and conditioning, I put some marrakesh oil in before styling.  The days I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I just put enough marrakesh oil in to tame the frizz and smooth the ends and it looks great.  My hair/scalp are not oily at all, so I can go a few days adding the oil to my hair. Anyway, this is a great product and is light and non-greasey and adds shine to my hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Works well on my thick wavy hair, helps with drying time quite a bit. Would recommend and cheaper to buy online than in any store.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product! Its just as good as the stuff I got from the salon and paid twice as much for it... But, its a \\&quot;Great\\&quot; deal on here!!! :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product! A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a few years and this is the best price I&#x27;ve gotten it at!&lt;br /&gt;Great service Amazon!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair so soft, and smell so good! The first time I used this I was amazed. And after using it for several months now, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Great for taming frizzy hair and smells great. A little goes a long way. I have curly hair that I straighten and its pin straight after I use this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff ... a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> LOOOOOVVVVVE this product.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for hair. I love how easy it makes styling my hair after washing. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> smells DIVINE. i use this before flat ironing my hair. I put a tinyyyy bit on each section (my hair is very thin and fine, so too much of anything just makes it greasy). This is perfection. And again...the smell...OMG</li>
            <li> Several people had told me about this oil and I needed something to keep my hair from being so dry and fly-away.  I used it several times, and it certainly made my hair less dry and static-filled, but unfortunately I found the scent too strong for my personal taste.  It&#x27;s not a bad scent; in fact, I&#x27;m sure many people wouldn&#x27;t mind it at all, but it was overpowering to me.  I tend to be sensitive to smells, so if you are bothered by heavy perfumes or similar scented products, I recommend you try an unscented version.</li>
            <li> Helps a lot with frizzy fly away hair, leave a nice gloss and don&#x27;t have to use a lot. Oh it smells nice too</li>
            <li> My hair has static and is hard to comb through after a shower. This helps make it easier to comb</li>
            <li> it only takes a dime size amount of this product for long hair. this product keeps your hair soft slickly and shiney. I apply it on my wet hair when I get done washing it. it keeps it looking and feeling great for three days. also helps your hair to stay healthy and grow longer faster. I purchased two bottle of this from this seller and it was at a great price per bottle excellent stuff highly reconamend it.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever worked on my hair before.  I apply this while hair is damp and it keeps hair smooth until next washing.</li>
            <li> If you have curly or dry hair, you will understand this pain, finding the right oil is hard.  You want one that your hair will easily absorb and hold to give your hair shine, reduce frizz, and not build up and make your hair look limp and oily.  My curl pattern is a combination of 3b and 3c (or for you Devacurl girls corkicelli) and it is soooooooooo dry...I&#x27;m pretty new to embracing my curls and learning more about my hair I did not realize how much moisture my hair lacked.  This particular oil is ok on my hair, it adds shine, but my hair does not really absorb it to gain anything for the curls.  Another oil that I have tried that I&#x27;m loving so far is Nutiva coconut oil.  This particular coconut oil seems to be working quite well with my hair!  I use some as a deep conditioner prior to showering, wash it out, then apply a little bit at the ends.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I bought it the first time in a salon for about double the price on Amazon.  Helps with curly hair frizz.... will continue to buy from this provider.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real crazy about this product. Hey maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, I just let it air dry and this product seems to be drying out my hair instead of moisturizing it.  The smell of it also isn&#x27;t what I thought it would be, just don&#x27;t care for this product. Hey maybe I should apply heat like my hair dryer and see if that changes the results.</li>
            <li> Love it-love it-love it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that loses moisture, attracts frizz and rebels with fly aways. I also have a relaxer so I have to be cautious about the mixture of products I use. I was using JF frizz-ezz for thick hair for years as that was the only thing that helped-well this has knocked that product out the ring!&lt;br /&gt;-It smells great-similar to a sweet, spicy, warm aroma therapy scent. It can be overpowering but this product works so well that you don&#x27;t need to use much as all. Just a few pumps will do ya :)&lt;br /&gt;-It has a pump! I have other argon oil that has a dropper and that&#x27;s ok except it&#x27;s oil so your hands get slippery and I once lost my grip on the small bottle and wasted a quarter of the oil on the bathroom counter. (argon oil isn&#x27;t cheap so I was pissed) This pump design solves that concern for me. I can dispense the amount I need with one hand and not worry about losing the whole bottle or a dropper.&lt;br /&gt;-This gave my hair a richer color (maybe it&#x27;s the hemp oil) even though it&#x27;s a clear oil.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s works great as a protector for blow drying, flat ironing and curling and even on braids/ cornrows. It smooths fly aways and also work for my nightly hair wrap.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive size, especially for the size but I am addicted! I will have to buy a couple more just to make sure I have back up at all times.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you have disobedient hair!!!</li>
            <li> I lovethe way this makes my hair smell.  It also leaves my hair very soft.  Just a little goes a long way.  I will definitely be using this item again.</li>
            <li> I use it every day after my shower! I apply one pump to one and a half pump (I have pretty long hair) to my towel dried hair and it shortens my drying time and leaves my hair softer and frizz free. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product, good price and fast shipping. Thanks!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this product to me. I won&#x27;t live without it ever again! Nice smooth silky hair. I am beyond addicted to the smell! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny, silky and smooth! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The pros:&lt;br /&gt;It does a decent job of controlling frizz.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t make my fine/thick hair look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t a great detangler.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very strong, super sweet scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is the deal breaker for me. It smells like cotton candy, and while some may like that scent, it&#x27;s definitely not my favorite. In fact, the scent is so strong, it completely overpowers my Alba Botanica gardenia-scented shampoo and conditioner. I will not be reordering due to this, so if you don&#x27;t care for super sweet scents, avoid this serum.</li>
            <li> Someone I know uses this product and I love the look and feel of my hair once this product is applied.</li>
            <li> I have straight fine hair, but lots of it, I&#x27;m always looking for products to make me hair beautiful and shiny(who isn&#x27;t?!!). The smell was some what over welming but I could deal with it, but it made my hair staticky and fly away which is a very annoying feeling. I think it would do amazing for people with coarser, thicker hair.</li>
            <li> This product helps keep the ends of my curly hair from snarling up to make it easier to comb out when it&#x27;s wet.  I love this product as well as others in the Marrakesh line.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle and I love this oil. I add some to my hair when damp (you don&#x27;t need much) and it makes my hair dry faster when blow drying and my hair is very soft and never oily. I also will use a bit on my ends and bangs to give some shine and to control frizz. It&#x27;s a small bottle but because you don&#x27;t need much, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have super knotty hair, and this works like magic!  Running a small amount through after I shower makes it so much easier to brush and style.</li>
            <li> It appears to be a good product, recommended by a hair stylist, does not completely take care of a dry scalp problem, but does improve it.</li>
            <li> Yummy, conditions with a fabulous yummy scent!</li>
            <li> I love their hair oil over every other brand I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy but sinks in and leaves it moisturized.</li>
            <li> This product shipped immediately and arrived within days.  I was extremely happy with the speedy service and the product.  It has made my hair super soft and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair and also my 4-year-old daughter&#x27;s hair.  We love it so much sometimes we even rub it on our arms so we smell good.  :)</li>
            <li> Love this product when applied to my wet hair and going to use blow dryer. Or when dry hair and going to use the flat iron/straightener. Makes my hair have a nice shine to it and is not too oily. Use a small amount and rub in palms before sporadically applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have frizzy coarse thick hair.</li>
            <li> Really makes a Positive difference in my hair. Helps w/ frizz, it smooths, protects from my straightener heat damage. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy and smells great. I am using the conditioner as well now, loving that too.</li>
            <li> Best hair oil I have ever used and I refuse to use anything else (makes your hair shine too)..  The smell  makes it even better... Very exotic fragrance..  Too bad they don&#x27;t make it in a perfume. Great for ethnic hair which can be unruly.</li>
            <li> Smells so delicious! Awesome product and well priced.</li>
            <li> Good for very dry hair it smell great I will probably buy it again good product for very dry hair which I do have.</li>
            <li> The only scents I wear are accidental because of my soap and hair products and I don&#x27;t tend to get anything that&#x27;s overwhelmingly scented and this oil is too scented for me. I don&#x27;t quite know how to explain the smell, but it reminds me of a head shop or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell aside, I have extremely damaged hair and I think this does actually help a bit, nothing crazy because of the extent of the damage I have done to my hair. My hair is shinier, softer, and looks healthier too, but I still have flyaways. I also changed my shampoo and conditioner around the time I started using that, so I think it&#x27;s a combination of both of those things, but my hair really does look healthier now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this to try to find a more affordable option to Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Serum, which I adore, but it&#x27;s $30. I think the Marraskesh Oil works nearly as well, but I like the subtle scent of Josie Maran&#x27;s product MUCH more than this one. If you aren&#x27;t bothered by smells I think this is a great option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this religiously for about a year. It&#x27;s magic. A little goes a long way, I think I had my first bottle for 6 months before replacing. I LOVE the smell, it smells like pancakes with maple syrup!!! Makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great: my hair is fine, curly and dry. and it keeps it not frizzy and smooth but not too oily! love it, buyer for life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Marrakesh oil for 10 years and this product never fails me! It is my secret to beautiful, silky hair. The product has a light to moderate smell, but it fades away pretty quickly once your hair absorbs it. I always receive compliments on my hair and how soft, shiny and healthy it looks! Marrakesh is a staple in my hair routine. Thanks, Earth Body for an excellent product!!</li>
            <li> Look at ingredients list, cannabis is on there and can provide a positive test for marijuana. .. otherwise it smells great, works well</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! I have straight hair and with this oil it holds a beautiful soft curl all day. My hair looks fuller too!! Shipped quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product in the past from beauty supply stores but it was always pretty pricey. This is extremely reasonable and is the same quality of one you&#x27;d buy in stores.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it on the whole family. It helps keep out tangles, add shine, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. I have very fine hair that is very friable and this product is great for my ends.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product got some getting used to but now I actually love it!  This product works great on my hair when it is curly or when I straighten it.  It gives my hair an awesome smoothness and makes it feel so soft.  When my hair is straight I put some in the palm of my hand, rub it around my hands and then scrunch the ends of my hair into my hands and it creates a great whispy or piecy look.  Some mornings I use this on  my curls to refresh them when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to seal the moisture in my hair after washing, conditioning and moisturizing as part of a new haircare routine, and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair considerably softer and I&#x27;ve found no fault with it. It is not drying in the slightest which I&#x27;ve found with many, even more expensive oils. It smells nice - when you first pump it into your hand it smells really sweet like treacle and I was worried it would get sickly, but once you apply it it has that exotic Argan oil smell that I really like; no lingering sweetness. It is not overly oily and it does add a nice sheen, even more so if you apply it sparingly when your hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair type, it&#x27;s great. I am Caucasian with very long and thick wavy hair that just does not like to behave. I suffer from several chronic illnesses and as a result my hair was in pretty bad shape thanks to a lack of nutrients and neglect. It was very dry and impossible to de-tangle. I use this product as a part of a new regimen to alleviate my hair problems and it really does help, it also makes de-tangling easier if you apply it beforehand.</li>
            <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;The smell is also so good.  I use it in the am &amp; pm&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair and me healthy.</li>
            <li> I first started this product about 6 months ago. I have been searching for an amazing product line and I FOUND IT!&lt;br /&gt;I have thick medium textures hair that is fizzy and unruly.  This product made my hair soft shiny and manageable.  Which is no easy task. Ive tried it all. Argon oil joico redkin biosilk goldwell aquage kenra Chi rusk the list goes on and on. I cant believe how well my hair has responded to this. I don&#x27;t have to flat iron curl or blow dry to get bouncy beautiful tresses now! Yaaaay! So far I have tried the oils and conditioners. And next I will buy the shampoo and miracle mask. I prefer the original scent. I find it soothing  utter aroma therapy . Now my review is very positive because I had such powerful results I cant say that everyone will love it but I absolutely would and do&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product. I say if you&#x27;ve tried it all the what&#x27;s the worst that can happen? Also this product line does NOT animal test and is free of most harsh chemicals which is extremely important to me. I hope this helps someone.  Cheers!</li>
            <li> I rely on this product...you don&#x27;t  have to use a lot and it really tames the fly aways and calms my &amp;#34;Bad Hair Days&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This is a brush in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Marrakesh oil is great on your hair.  Not oily if you only use two or three squirts.  The smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This will probably be my 5th, 6th bottle since discovering it 2 years ago. First of all it smells like warm cinnamon buns right out of the over or snickerdoodle cookies. Makes my hair shiny and silky and noticeably fights frizz. I have thick, long, coarse hair and this stuff does the trick. I start with my ends and work my way up. The only tiny con I have is it is very thick and needs to be spread carefully and evenly or it has a tendency to get gunky. Other than that I am in love!</li>
            <li> my hairdresser recommended this to me one day when I told her I was having a bit of difficulty finding a good serum for my very long, straight and fine (but lots of it) hair. Beacuse my hair is so fine, many serums end up making my hair look greasy. not this stuff...it&#x27;s amazing. I use 3 pumps (my hair is lower/mid back) and it provides the right frizz coverage, makes my hair incredibly soft, and is great if you want to straighten or use hot tools on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have to mention how amazing this stuff smells too. Very nice earthy but sweet scent. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and my hair dresser doesn&#x27;t always have it. It&#x27;s great I can find it here. Thanks! L</li>
            <li> I use this oil right after my shower and it leaves my hair much smoother than normal with a super silky feel.  Love how it feels and smells!</li>
            <li> I tried this product while I was vising with my daughter and was impressed with how my hair looked, felt and smelled. I decided to order it when I got home and have not been disappointed. This is an excellent product for the price and it smells incredible in my hair. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years now and do not even use conditioner, put it on right after shampooing, leaving my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This helps put moisture in my daughters hair instead of damaged. Now she doesn&#x27;t have dry ends. It looks healthy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Marrakesh Oil Styling Elixir for a couple of years now.  It&#x27;s really a great product for smoothing and protecting your hair if you use heat-styling products.  It&#x27;s also great for controlling fly-aways and adding texture and shine.  Best of all, it never leaves my hair feeling oily. Oh, and it smells great and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> This oil gives your hair a great natural shine.  It is light weight so it does not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Of all the oils for hair, this is my favorite.  It smells wonderul, and what remains after application can be rubbed into your hands instead of being washed off like other hair products.  Be warned though, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff! It does not make my hair greasy and it smells fantastic! This product is a staple for me!</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the Moroccan Oil. I like the smell better, too.</li>
            <li> My hair can appear dry and frizzy especially in the hot weather but Marrakesh oil keeps it so soft and silky.  I have really thick hair and I use only one pump before blow drying, then another pump to finish the style on the ends. It looks beautiful the day after, also!  I highly recommend it if you have thick or coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I have permed hair and this elixir makes my hair look great!!  No frizz at all.  I hate frizz.  It softens my hair and makes it easy to style each day.  The scent is wonderful and I love the finish it puts on my hair.  My hair is a mixture of gray and brown hair and is cut at the nape of my neck.  I can run my fingers with Marrakesh Oil through it and what a wonderful difference it makes for me.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> love it !  but I wish I would have purchased two bottles for the price of $10.53.from Abs Supply..!  My biggest regret, now I see its more expensive from a different buyer. Leaves my hair shiney and beautiful, like if I just left the salon.</li>
            <li> If you ride a motorcycle, this is a must have. I have very long hair and hate to tie it back when I ride. A little oil in my hair and I can just brush it out with a boar bristle brush!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Not at all like the marrakesh oil I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use too much( which I did the first time!) this really leaves hair soft and brings out the natural curl.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the Marrakesh and the Macadamia styling elixir and I prefer the Marrakesh.  The smell is very nice and the way is makes my hair smooth is the best of any product I&amp;#34;ve tried.  You don&#x27;t use much so the price is not bad considering how long it lasts. This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with this product.  It smells amazing, and it makes my hair super soft. I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my hair so shiny and perfect without any effort!</li>
            <li> I have colored hair and need a little moisture. I love this product as it doesn&#x27;t look greasy but makes my hair shine. Great product especially blondes. And the smell is great.</li>
            <li> I truly like this product.  The argon oil wonderful for my skin and hair.  Makes my skin nice and soft and my hair is silky smooth and shiny.  I am on my second bottle and can&#x27;t imagine not using it.  Even got my daughter using it on her hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It smells delicious too!! I&#x27;m definitely buying it again... once mine runs out, which it doesn&#x27;t seem like it will for a long time since a little bit does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.I recommend it.Cant get a better hair product.Try it and you will always use it again and again.Benn buying it for years.</li>
            <li> I have shorter hair and if I use this on it after washing I do not have to use a hair dryer at all. No frizzes, just shape it with a brush or hands and it dries  perfect.  Wonderful fragrance too.</li>
            <li> I love the marrakesh oil styling elixer. I have been using it for about a year now &amp; my hair is so much more manageable &amp; healthy. I,have got my daughter, sister &amp; step daughter using it. Great product.</li>
            <li> Was purchasing this product through my hair dresser and was very pleased to find it on-line.  This product is awesome if you have curly hair in live where there is high humidity.  It helps make my hair soft and cuts down on the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, want to THANK the company for making thing right when my 1st shipment was received damaged.</li>
            <li> Love this hair product! It smells a bit strange initially, but it keeps my hair smooth and flyaways down. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about 5 years.  Very pleased with the shine it gives my hair and manageability in styling</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Leaves my normally dry hair moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for the great price on this wonderful product. It makes my thin hair shiny and manageable!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years having bought it originally at a beauty parlor and subsequently on Amazon. This most recent purchase, even though the packaging is the same as what I had previously bought, the product inside is not the same. When I applied it for the first time, my hair became flat and dull. One of my co-workers asked me if I was losing my hair! I achieved the same result the second and third time I used it. Obviously this is not the original Earthly Body Marrakesh Oil.</li>
            <li> I have very very dry and damaged long hair. This leaves it fully hydrated and it smells so good! This stuff is like food for your hair, I&#x27;m not kidding. This is my second bottle, and I don&#x27;t use very much (about 1 pump for my ends, sometimes two on wet hair). Definitely get this product! I like it way better than Morrocanoil, and the price is great. There are plenty of positive reviews on this product, and they aren&#x27;t lying. The more you use it, the better the results are. It also doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy and it can be used as a heat protectant! This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this! It smells great and keeps fly away hair under control! We will be buying more, but it does last a long time!</li>
            <li> I use a drop after washing my hair before I blow dry it.  Makes my hair shine and look healthy without feeling oily.</li>
