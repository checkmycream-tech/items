            <li> When I first put it on, I was afraid I was going to turn out as white as a ghost, but after rinsing it off, I was left with glowing, soft skin.</li>
            <li> sucks because I really like pale skin</li>
            <li> Extremely drying and didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I mean oily or dry.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a while ago but wanted to wait and try it on a few times before writing a review.</li>

It works wonderfully, my skin whitens and brightens as advertised and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my usually sensitive skin. My only complaint is that it wears off a few hours :( sucks because I really like pale skin but I was born with tanned skin and would like to be paler permanently.</li>
            <li> I am brown Asian and depends on type of skin I mean oily or dry. Mine is normal skin type and it makes difference within one use. It also depends how you use it and I used after washing my face with clarisonic brush. Your face needs to be clear and clean before applying!</li>
