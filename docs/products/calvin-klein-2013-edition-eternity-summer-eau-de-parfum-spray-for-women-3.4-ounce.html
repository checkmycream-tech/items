            <li>It is still nice but does seem to fade quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a light, soft, pretty fragrance that is perfect for summer.</li>
            <li>but,  I got it very quickly and well before.  </li>
            <li>Smells like alcohol strongly.</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts forever because everything else is too strong for me and hurts my nose.</li>
            <li>Will certainly purchase it again once it runs out!!!</li>
            <li>the scent is soooo light to me and gives off a Summer-y/fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something light...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like spraying on a summer garden with a light breeze.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice summer scent and is great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>My daughter liked the original bottle I had  on me and tried it and really like it.</li>
            <li>I loved it last year and thought I&#x27;d never find another bottle.  </li>
            <li>My wife really has enjoyed this perfume.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a light floral scent that&#x27;s just right for summer</li>
            <li>Although it smells wonderful, light and flowery but not over powering, the aroma does not last long.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light crisp and slightly sweet.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely great for anyone who typically enjoys CK scents.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, but doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li>It smells like you bathed in Roses, tulips, and fresh stuff lool.</li>
            <li>It just smells of a fresh summer.  </li>

            <li>am certainly planning on getting another one for myself, and one to give her as a gift!</li>
            <li>In fact it smells just as nice as 2008 &amp; 2009 limited editions.</li>
            <li>They all have very gentle scents</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t last all day, but light fragrances don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>This is a very airy, fresh smelling perfume.  </li>
            <li>Product came exactly when they promised.</li>
            <li>i was very disapointed!</li>

            <li>It is hard to find this in stores especially at such a great price!</li>
            <li>I havebeen hooked to your regular Eternity, but love this one as much.  </li>
            <li>I have used Eternity Summer from past years and loved it, but not this time.  </li>

            <li>It is a soft scent that is super for summer.  </li>
            <li>Much too powdery and florally and not youthful at all.</li>
            <li>This item was purchased as a gift and it was well received and appreciated.  </li>
            <li>With reasonable shipping.</li>
            <li>Very feminine.  </li>
            <li>However, the folks at Amazon we&#x27;re very accommodating and issued me a refund.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is sensual, light, airy and last all day.</li>
            <li>It is a nice scent but to me the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li>I wear Eternity Classic in the winter and switch in the spring to this..  </li>
            <li>I wear Banana Republic Classic and Pacifica Lilac scents</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This parfum has the scent of soft summer rain and the essence of flowers drifting gently on the summer breeze.  </li>
            <li>Very soft smell.</li>
            <li>It looks great, but the quality is not good as I expected.</li>
            <li>I recommend this item to anyone looking for a gift for a young lady.</li>
            <li>Not heavy or sultry like an evening perfume.</li>
            <li>The perfume works exactly like my wife expected.</li>
            <li>smells like pure alcohol, or old or imitation, not recommended.</li>
            <li>It has a clean subtle scent but lingers on throughout the day.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this year&#x27;s fragrance.  It is very similar to the 2011 fragrance.  Wish they had it year round.  I do think the 2011 frangrance lasts longer than the 2013 fragrance.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this summer fragrance,  Best perfume purchase in a while.  Thank You Calvin Klien for creating this wonderful, light and great smelling perfume.  I havebeen hooked to your regular Eternity, but love this one as much.  Hope you bring this back and add alotionand bath gel.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for Christmas.  So hopefully it smells good. (c:  I was told I wouldn&#x27;t received it until after the holiday but,  I got it very quickly and well before.  That was awesome!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this perfume. It has a clean subtle scent but lingers on throughout the day. And the purchase price at Amazon was phenomenal. Will certainly purchase it again once it runs out!!!</li>
            <li> excellent product, very good</li>
            <li> This is a light and refreshing perfume spray, perfect in the summer. I wear Eternity Classic in the winter and switch in the spring to this..  I love them both and love to  switch up in the seasons.</li>
            <li> This scent does not even come close to the regular Eternity.  Big disappointment, but I did not return it because it was not expensive.  So my advice is put your money towards the better quality perfumes.</li>
            <li> Very nice light summer fragrance. I received lots of complements when I wore this fragrance. I will order this again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light floral scent that&#x27;s just right for summer and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on it from women who&#x27;ll stop me and ask what scent I&#x27;m wearing.  It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t last all day, but light fragrances don&#x27;t and it sometimes needs to be re-applied. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t want it any heavier.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful fragrance. The price is great and it got to me so fast. I love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking that you can&#x27;t go wrong with an Eternity fragrance, but I did not like this scent at all. Much too powdery and florally and not youthful at all.</li>
            <li> Grate smell!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I gave these five stars because this scent is absolutely beautiful. I can smell this on myself all day long. I also get many comments about this fragrance mostly from men.&lt;br /&gt;It is a soft scent that is super for summer. I am very happy!!!!</li>
            <li> I went to visit my family overseas and took the fragrance along w/ me.... My sister-in-law fell in love w/ it!&lt;br /&gt;I am certainly planning on getting another one for myself, and one to give her as a gift! I wish it wasn&#x27;t a limited time scent.&lt;br /&gt;CK should keep this fragrance as an all year round scent. It&#x27;s refreshing, feminine, alluring, and carries a hint of passion that flows through the senses. A winner in any season! Thank you for the promptness on delivery and the well-cared for packaging.</li>
            <li> It looks great, but the quality is not good as I expected. The fragrance does not stay long as it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> The scent still nice but doesn&#x27;t last or smell like when it first introduced.  My daughter liked the original bottle I had  on me and tried it and really like it. Ordered it and noticed it wasn&#x27;t the same  I ran out around the same time and ordered it also from amazon. I noticed the same thing. Never had a perfume where you couldn&#x27;t count on the same Sven for years. It is still nice but does seem to fade quickly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Totally as advertised. This is my second purchase and I love this product.</li>
            <li> Smells flowery, just like summer</li>
            <li> I have loved Eternity Summer for years.  Some years are better than others.  This one is a great one.  Wonderful, light fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances. It is hard to find this in stores especially at such a great price!</li>
            <li> Although it smells wonderful, light and flowery but not over powering, the aroma does not last long.  It&#x27;s gone by the time I get to work.  Even when I spray my clothes instead, it just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I loved it last year and thought I&#x27;d never find another bottle.  So glad I checked on Amazon!</li>
            <li> smells like pure alcohol, or old or imitation, not recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. It was delivered faster than expected</li>
            <li> I used to wear this all the time and loved it so I was happy to find it again. It smelled nothing like it did before. I was very disappointed. I called Amazon to say I wanted to return it and why.  They refunded me. I will never but cologne on line again.</li>
            <li> This is a very airy, fresh smelling perfume.  I have been an Eternity lover for years but this one is a nice change for summer.</li>
            <li> It is a nice scent but to me the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> The perfume was well packaged.  This item was purchased as a gift and it was well received and appreciated.  I recommend this item to anyone looking for a gift for a young lady.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very soft smell.</li>
            <li> AS A MAN YOU ALWAYS TELL YOUR WIFE SHE SMELL AWESOME WHEN SHE ASKS, THIS TIME IT IS THE TRUTH OR YOU ACTUALLY MEAN IT.  PERFECT GIFT FOR YOUR WIFE SHE WILL LOVE IT, MINE DOES, AND SHE CANT WAIT UNTIL SPRING EACH YEAR TO GET THIS LIMITED EDITION PERFUME.  SHE DIED WHEN WE FOUND IT ON AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Love this scent! I did not realize it was a seasonal thing, yeah I can be little slow with things. I realized that when I ran out about 1 year later you can imagine my surprise when I went to the store and could not find!! So I googled it and this was the cheapest vendor. With reasonable shipping. Product came exactly when they promised. No problems!</li>
            <li> Awesome.. The perfume works exactly like my wife expected.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a really great smell but for my taste I didn&#x27;t like it I would not buy it again</li>
            <li> purchased with a gift card from my brother for my birthday</li>
            <li> I have been an Eternity fan for at least 30 years!  Love this lighter edition for summer! Don&#x27;t miss out!</li>
            <li> i was very disapointed! it smells no like the summer(((( very heavy flavor.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as perfume bought in stores. Smells like alcohol strongly.</li>
            <li> Very, very pleased with shipping and packaging. Thank you. LOVE this 2013 edition</li>
            <li> This parfum has the scent of soft summer rain and the essence of flowers drifting gently on the summer breeze.  I purchased the original Eternity and loved it and then I purchased Eternity Moment.  They all have very gentle scents but, they area long lasting fragrances.  I can smell it on my clothes after placing them in my laundry cart.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a soft floral perfume this is the perfect one. Light scent, long lasting and perfect for wearing daily.</li>
            <li> Love the scent!  The perfume reminds me of Summer when it is still Winter.  The scent is light crisp and slightly sweet.  I wear Banana Republic Classic and Pacifica Lilac scents</li>
            <li> Perfect scent for this hot summer. Nice and light and non overpowering. Very feminine.  So get this one before it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> I gave this five stars because this scent is absolutely beautiful. I can smell this on myself all day long. I also get many comments about this fragrance mostly from men,so I know for a fact men love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I heard nice reviews on it, but it&#x27;s just ok to me.  Smells ok but not the best, nevertheless, I will use it but only in the summer.</li>
            <li> I love, love love this perfume. I purchased it in May 2013 for the first time and I was in love. I purchased it in Macy&#x27;s for abt $65. I was never a perfume wearer...the scent is soooo light to me and gives off a Summer-y/fresh fragrance. It smells like you bathed in Roses, tulips, and fresh stuff lool. I&#x27;m in love. Never thought I&#x27;d be a perfume wearer but this IS my scent. I hope it lasts forever because everything else is too strong for me and hurts my nose. I love this. If you&#x27;re looking for something light...this is for you !! THE BEST...&amp; I&#x27;m still wearing it throughout all the seasons. Currently wearing it..Love this fragrance. 2 thumbs UP</li>
            <li> I have used Eternity Summer from past years and loved it, but not this time.  Ick.  However, the folks at Amazon we&#x27;re very accommodating and issued me a refund.</li>
            <li> My wife really has enjoyed this perfume. It is a nice summer scent and is great for everyday use. Not heavy or sultry like an evening perfume. This is definitely great for anyone who typically enjoys CK scents. The price was great and the company who filled the order had the product shipped and delivered in a great time frame!</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Calvin Klein. This fragrance is sensual, light, airy and last all day.</li>
            <li> love this fragrance!  Nice smelling floral.</li>
            <li> This is a favorite of mine and I cannot find it in the stores, also this is a BETTER price.....</li>
            <li> I smelled this parfum from one of those paper samples that come in sales ads and liked it.  The real thing is even better.  It is a soft scent that is super for summer.  It&#x27;s like spraying on a summer garden with a light breeze.  I do not smell it all day so it does not overwhelm you, but I know others smell it.  The other Calvin Klien summer scents had been highly rated and this one lives up to the past ones.  It is a soft subtle breezy scent.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Very nice / as described and packaged well, arrived quickly.  I had never sampled this one before but the description and reviews made me want to own it.  It&#x27;s a great summer scent.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, but doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> Very nice sweet smell. I love this! And it last longer.</li>
            <li> As always you can rely on Calvin Klein to come out with the best summer scents!! Was not disappointed at all with this product!! In fact it smells just as nice as 2008 &amp; 2009 limited editions. Summers scent a must have a hint of sun, sand, warm nights, flowers very fresh.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!!  It just smells of a fresh summer.  I get lots of compliments on this one!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I have used the regular eternity for years and wanted a change. this makes you feel like you are on a summer beach on a gorgeous day. I always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This is a light, soft, pretty fragrance that is perfect for summer. I love it but I would have to give it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t last very long on me.</li>
