            <li>have great difficulty finding these packets in any store and am thrilled Amazon has them available.</li>
            <li>Handy for cleaning airline seat arms/table tops too.</li>
            <li>Not as nice as the GermX but better quality than the &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; wipes.</li>
            <li>According to the news....and many videos....</li>

            <li>wonderful especially on road trips, etc.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m happy to finally have some in my pockets again for those times</li>
            <li>Higher quality cloth-like material than their &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; version which feels more like paper.</li>
            <li>so she can clean and sanitize her hands before eating.  </li>
            <li>The Purell wipes were nice and fresh and work very well.</li>

            <li>Moist and size of cloth is large enough for a good clean up!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and product received was as advertised.  </li>
            <li>quickly-</li>
            <li>I used to be able to get them locally, but not any more.</li>
            <li>they came quickly and were nicey packaged.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>use these regularly on dog walks - larger size wipe is welcome!</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied and will reorder this product.</li>
            <li>They are compact, large enough to wipe hands, and good to clean airplane eating trays as well.</li>
            <li>Product fresh and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Very convenient, easy to carry ...  </li>
            <li>These are the bigger cloths, not the papery kind you might get at a BBQ house.</li>
            <li>My wife keeps a few in her purse when we&#x27;re out, they come in very handy.</li>
            <li>Price was right</li>
            <li>We (my sister and I) use these packets whenever soap and water aren&#x27;t available â€” particularly when on road trips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The item arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>The are great- nice and wet, and large enough to take care of basic hand washing when out and about.  </li>
            <li>The shipment is fast too!</li>
            <li>They are much, much larger and better than the paper ones you see everywhere.  </li>
            <li>These are very well-priced and arrived exactly on time.</li>
            <li>These wipes are more expensive than some others, but the material is nice, holds up well, and can be used more than once (within a reasonable amount of time) if you seal it back up.</li>
            <li>Package, actually several packages with one wipe each, fit well in pocket.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to carry with us.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>Wrapped for storage in pocket or purse, there when you&#x27;re covered in BBQ sauce or just need to wipe your hands after touching some unknown goop.</li>
            <li>Received product when expected, satisfied that product is what was advertised</li>
            <li>I thought this was just the plain Purell, not the kind with lotion/aloe, etc.</li>
            <li>These are nice and soft, unlike the other brands you get in the pop-top dispenser.</li>
            <li>They will do the job and I am glad to have something to use, but I will keep looking and hoping for the return of the other brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen often enough how they clean, forks, etc., and it gives me the creeps.</li>
            <li>Easy to take along and doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>These are the original, soft, large wipes that work wonders when traveling, especially for cleaning your seat area on a plane or surfaces in hotels.</li>
            <li>The wipes are more expensive than carrying a bottle of hand sanitizer, but a lot more convenient.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Better quality material than the lower cost Purell wipes, we use them everyday!</li>
            <li>This box will be distributed among staff at an assisted living community as part of an educational meeting on infection control, proper hand-washing techniques, and what to use if you can&#x27;t wash your hands.  </li>
            <li>These hand wipes are much larger and more absorbent than any others I&#x27;ve ever found, so I don&#x27;t feel that I&#x27;m simply sanitizing my hands, but actually cleaning them.</li>
            <li>When I first settle in I wipe sown my entire area with one or two of these pads.  </li>
            <li>Such a handy little packet of sanitary goodness!</li>
            <li>They do not dry out and are very convenient when traveling - especially on a plane.</li>
            <li>They are smaller and of less strong material than the Germ-X individually packaged wipes.  </li>
            <li>Major bummer.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the package is rather large compared to the tiny ones you get complimentary at some restaurants like Chick-fil-a.</li>
            <li>Because I work in my garden frequently, my hands are frequently dry.</li>

            <li> My only complaint is the package is rather large compared to the tiny ones you get complimentary at some restaurants like Chick-fil-a.</li>
            <li> Because I work in my garden frequently, my hands are frequently dry.</li>
            <li> Supplier was OxKom, product arrived a little quicker than expected and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> These are strong, soft wipes with a touch of &amp;#34;clean-smelling&amp;#34; fragrance that is left behind for just a few minutes after the alcohol evaporates.  </li>
            <li> These are almost the same... packaged a little smaller, not quite as big and &amp;#34;cottony soft&amp;#34; as the Germ-X ones, but it&#x27;s the same idea.</li>
            <li> for the average consumer they are much larger; I would prefer the wholesale restaurant supply version of these wipes in the tiny squares.</li>
            <li> The only problem was that the boxes were slightly crushed.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these for a long time.</li>
            <li> Though the wipe is small,it&#x27;st big enough for my boys little hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed they don&#x27;t dry out while in the unopened packets, like some other brands.  </li>
            <li> They are in small individual package.</li>
            <li> somehow, I usually get it next day!!</li>
            <li> I also use these to sanitize any utensils I may use in a foreign restaurant.  </li>
            <li> I have used these before and had switched to a different type (smaller) Purell wipes and was not happy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to open the package, but they work well</li>
            <li> They are a little smaller than the GermX wipes we have always used in the past</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that they used to be 8x6 and now are 7x5.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I&#x27;ve had is sometimes</li>
            <li> I wipe down everything in sight -</li>
            <li> the price goes up and the size goes down.</li>
            <li> After wiping your hands, wipe down the seat area.  </li>
            <li> Never a packet that has dried out like other brands.</li>
            <li> so I can grab a few on the way out the door.</li>
            <li> I go through quite a few of these</li>
            <li> I feel like it leaves a sticky residue, when the plain version doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these in the past and won&#x27;t travel without them.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy them at Costco, but no more.</li>
            <li> A tad expensive, but if it means avoid one cold or flu, it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunate when I shopped, these were for sale -</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the store we bought them at quit carrying them.  </li>
            <li> Cough, cold and flu season are upon us!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is my second time purchase. Love the wipes! They are in small individual package. Though the wipe is small,it&#x27;st big enough for my boys little hands. Good buy! The shipment is fast too!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and product received was as advertised.  My wife keeps a few in her purse when we&#x27;re out, they come in very handy.</li>
            <li> Product fresh and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that I always pack with my daughter&#x27;s lunch so she can clean and sanitize her hands before eating.  I&#x27;ve also never had a problem with it being shipped quickly- somehow, I usually get it next day!!</li>
            <li> I thought this was just the plain Purell, not the kind with lotion/aloe, etc. I feel like it leaves a sticky residue, when the plain version doesn&#x27;t. The page doesn&#x27;t say that this is the version with moisturizer. Major bummer.</li>
            <li> It is always nice to have a couple of these around in the car or kids bag.  Never know when you need it and not in the washroom.  Individually wrapped prevents it drying up like those bulk one.  A tad expensive, but if it means avoid one cold or flu, it&#x27;s well worth it.  Packaging and delivery is on the mark!  I would definitely buy from OxKom again.</li>
            <li> I have used these before and had switched to a different type (smaller) Purell wipes and was not happy. So I came back and ordered these again and I am VERY HAPPY with these. They do not dry out and are very convenient when traveling - especially on a plane. I wipe down everything in sight - According to the news....and many videos....planes are the filthiest places. (Maybe I should stop watching those videos LOL. Anyway, the Purell Wipes are wonderful, individually wrapped and always moist. The only complaint is that they used to be 8x6 and now are 7x5. I guess it just goes with the times...the price goes up and the size goes down. I would definitely recommend this and will reorder when needed.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to get these.</li>
            <li> These are great when sanitizing my hands. I keep a bunch of them in my bag.</li>
            <li> What I was looking for. Not as nice as the GermX but better quality than the &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; wipes. I keep the dispensing box in the garage so I can grab a few on the way out the door. Supplier was OxKom, product arrived a little quicker than expected and exactly as advertised. I go through quite a few of these so I liked the price/quality ratio.</li>
            <li> I am all about the wipes and this is the jumbo size a girl taking NYC subways needs to get by.  The dispenser bit works nicely and the wipes are all fresh.</li>
            <li> Because I work in my garden frequently, my hands are frequently dry. The alcohol in the product made my hands feel like they were burning.</li>
            <li> Love it ! .. wonderful especially on road trips, etc.  Very convenient, easy to carry ...  Really nice to use before restaurant meals.</li>
            <li> Just as good as germx but cheaper</li>
            <li> Received item as scheduled.  The only problem was that the boxes were slightly crushed.</li>
            <li> We (my sister and I) use these packets whenever soap and water aren&#x27;t available â€” particularly when on road trips.&lt;br /&gt;I have great difficulty finding these packets in any store and am thrilled Amazon has them available.</li>
            <li> Fine product. Never a packet that has dried out like other brands. They were shipped quickly and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Order arrived in great time! Love having these Hand Sanitizers in my handbag, car, and anywhere I might need them. Like them because they are easy to use and carry around.</li>
            <li> Use these on every airline flight.  Got them as soon as prime delivery even though they weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> These wipes are more expensive than some others, but the material is nice, holds up well, and can be used more than once (within a reasonable amount of time) if you seal it back up.</li>
            <li> Excellent and handy product.  Package, actually several packages with one wipe each, fit well in pocket.</li>
            <li> Great product, very handy.</li>
            <li> These are great! Better quality material than the lower cost Purell wipes, we use them everyday!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these for a long time. They are much, much larger and better than the paper ones you see everywhere.  Thank you for offering these for sale!</li>
            <li> fantastic! These are the bigger cloths, not the papery kind you might get at a BBQ house. I use these for traveling, esp in airplanes.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years. I carry them with me all the time. I used to be able to get them locally, but not any more.</li>
            <li> I travel quite a lot, and wouldn&#x27;t want to do so without these.  Great for debugging tray tables on aircraft and anywhere hand washing.</li>
            <li> famiy leaving for south africa armed with your wonderful hand sanitizer.  they came quickly and were nicey packaged.  thank you.  great product, great service.  thank you.</li>
            <li> Good product and was delivered promptly as promised. Higher quality cloth-like material than their &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; version which feels more like paper.</li>
            <li> The are great- nice and wet, and large enough to take care of basic hand washing when out and about.  Only complaint I&#x27;ve had is sometimes it&#x27;s hard to open the package, but they work well so I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> These stay in my purse and car! Great for washing hands on the go. Especially if you tend to eat in your car on the road- these are a must. My only complaint is the package is rather large compared to the tiny ones you get complimentary at some restaurants like Chick-fil-a. I was looking for those (they are made my Purell, too) but for the average consumer they are much larger; I would prefer the wholesale restaurant supply version of these wipes in the tiny squares. Maybe I&#x27;ll check at a restaurant supply store. However, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> We received on time. The Purel wipes are great when you are no homeðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Perfect for hiking.  Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> These are strong, soft wipes with a touch of &amp;#34;clean-smelling&amp;#34; fragrance that is left behind for just a few minutes after the alcohol evaporates.  Great for times when hand-washing is not possible. This box will be distributed among staff at an assisted living community as part of an educational meeting on infection control, proper hand-washing techniques, and what to use if you can&#x27;t wash your hands.  Cough, cold and flu season are upon us!  After opening a packet, I will be carrying a wipe or two with me from now on.  The wipes are more expensive than carrying a bottle of hand sanitizer, but a lot more convenient.</li>
            <li> Kill those germs on the plane.  After wiping your hands, wipe down the seat area.  Your seat belt buckle, the tray table, the arm rests.  Everything has the potential to be carrying germs from the prior passenger.</li>
            <li> family loves to take these everywhere---</li>
            <li> Prroduct came promptly and as pictured.  I like to carry these in the car or my purse to have a quick way to clean your hands.  These are a must if you have children.</li>
            <li> This is a dispensing box of individually wrapped hand sanitizing wipes.  They work.  They are smaller and of less strong material than the Germ-X individually packaged wipes.  Unfortunate when I shopped, these were for sale - Germ-X was not.  They will do the job and I am glad to have something to use, but I will keep looking and hoping for the return of the other brand.</li>
            <li> These hand wipes are much larger and more absorbent than any others I&#x27;ve ever found, so I don&#x27;t feel that I&#x27;m simply sanitizing my hands, but actually cleaning them. These are very well-priced and arrived exactly on time. I am completely pleased with my order.</li>
            <li> Living in NYC and traveling via plane weekly, these are staples in my luggage and backpack to combat germs. They are compact, large enough to wipe hands, and good to clean airplane eating trays as well. You won&#x27;t regret buying these</li>
            <li> I have purchased these in the past and won&#x27;t travel without them.  Airplanes are notoriously unsanitary.  When I first settle in I wipe sown my entire area with one or two of these pads.  I&#x27;ve also noticed they don&#x27;t dry out while in the unopened packets, like some other brands.  I also use these to sanitize any utensils I may use in a foreign restaurant.  I&#x27;ve seen often enough how they clean, forks, etc., and it gives me the creeps.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to carry with us.</li>
            <li> service was good. The item arrived very fast. The Purell wipes were nice and fresh and work very well. We&#x27;re glad to have them along on our vacation in Asia.</li>
            <li> Easy to take along and doesn&#x27;t dry out. I keep plenty in my purse, house and truck. They are good at cleaning permanent marker off hands.</li>
            <li> use these regularly on dog walks - larger size wipe is welcome!</li>
            <li> They are a little smaller than the GermX wipes we have always used in the past but they are a close second.  Seller was great. Delivery was fast.  Overall very satisfied and will reorder this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Germ-X wipes for years but haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere! I used to buy them at Costco, but no more. These are almost the same... packaged a little smaller, not quite as big and &amp;#34;cottony soft&amp;#34; as the Germ-X ones, but it&#x27;s the same idea. I&#x27;m happy to finally have some in my pockets again for those times I can&#x27;t wash my hands!</li>
            <li> I used these individually wrapped Purell wipes before and always carried them in my purse or pocket.  Unfortunately, the store we bought them at quit carrying them.  Happy to be able to purchase them again in bulk.  I have tried other brands, but find Purell to be the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price for the amount you get!</li>
            <li> Great for purse/wallet.  Handy for cleaning airline seat arms/table tops too.</li>
            <li> I like the product but wish they were the same size as the GermX wipes, just slightly larger.</li>
            <li> These are the original, soft, large wipes that work wonders when traveling, especially for cleaning your seat area on a plane or surfaces in hotels. Convenient packages.</li>
            <li> The product is good and we got it fast from the seller.</li>
            <li> These are very nice. Perfect for my clients.</li>
            <li> Such a handy little packet of sanitary goodness! These are nice and soft, unlike the other brands you get in the pop-top dispenser. Wrapped for storage in pocket or purse, there when you&#x27;re covered in BBQ sauce or just need to wipe your hands after touching some unknown goop. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good product!  Moist and size of cloth is large enough for a good clean up!</li>
            <li> Received product when expected, satisfied that product is what was advertised</li>
            <li> Looking all over town for these! Best pricing compared to the GermX products that is no longer carried locally. This item came up on the suggestions. Price was right and I had within 2 days! These wipes are a must for this time of year!!</li>
            <li> Easy to carry and use.</li>
