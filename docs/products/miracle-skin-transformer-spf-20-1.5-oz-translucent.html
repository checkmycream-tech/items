            <li>Translucent is the best for my skin!!</li>
            <li>ow, very good for aging skin.  </li>
            <li>its hydrated and gives me a great finish</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Returning for fresh tube of an awesome product</li>
            <li>Love it and you will too!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice when the claims a product makes are truth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>I am 52 Have pretty nice skin to begin with but always had a problem with discoloration from the sun, redness, brown spots....feels great on skin (use transparent) and a micro dot of my sephora</li>
            <li>I know many people don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is much more even.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I love the way this feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after put this on.  </li>
            <li>I tried both translucent and tinted and love them both.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time for more then 1step application :)</li>
            <li>AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample in my Birchbox and really liked it, so I had to try the full size version.</li>
            <li>Love this product, goes on smooth and makes my skin feel like velvet</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job as a primer.</li>
            <li>Goes on soooo smooth and the moisture it adds is noticeable immediately.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash my face with any chemicals, I find that letting my shower water clean it is perfect, but the hot water will sometimes dry out the skin.</li>
            <li>Tried a quick online search found it here.</li>
            <li>my new favorite primer.</li>
            <li>This item is the first that I&#x27;ve used that goes on with a true matte finish - leaving your skin looking and feeling fresh and non-oily.  </li>
            <li>I just love how it makes your skin look and feel so luminous and soft.</li>
            <li>Putting this on right after a shower feels like wrapping my face in silk.  </li>
            <li>Love it and gave my half used one to my daughter who is 20 for her sun problems (we have very light skin) and just ordered another for myself-have problem matching makeup to my skin</li>
            <li>Just rec&#x27;d another tube - great protection from weather but the tube was past expiration date.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy, but let it dry before you add check color or powder on your nose.  </li>
            <li>I really like how this product makes my skin feel and use it as a primer for my makeup.</li>
            <li>its better than smash box and all the other primers I tried from Sephora.</li>
            <li>I usually get nice compliments on my skin but</li>
            <li>I use just the smallest drop and it goes a very long way, it makes my skin smooth and gives me coverage for any season in arizona.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it everyday for about 5 years now and definitely love it.</li>
            <li>My skin is normal, so I cannot speak on the moisturizing benefits.</li>
            <li>And I have had minimal breakouts since first using!</li>
            <li>I use the clear formula as an SPF and primer for my face.</li>
            <li>You feel soft immediately.  </li>
            <li>Just makes for a very smooth base and makes all my make up work better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend the Translucent versus the tints because you can create the shade you want with your powder or other foundation much easier.</li>
            <li>but I was in desperate need of a sunblock (I live in arizona) as well as a very light moisturizer to use after I shower.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m in the transition phase of using less and less makeup, primarily foundation, and this is the only translucent item on the market that I don&#x27;t need to worry about not wearing foundation and it will last.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday for about 5 years now and definitely love it. I used to purchase the miracle skin Men product but it&#x27;s more expensive and harder to find. The translucent miracle skin seems to essentially be the same.</li>
            <li> I am 52 Have pretty nice skin to begin with but always had a problem with discoloration from the sun, redness, brown spots....feels great on skin (use transparent) and a micro dot of my sephora makeup- I usually get nice compliments on my skin but omg not like this-everyone says what are you doing? Love it and gave my half used one to my daughter who is 20 for her sun problems (we have very light skin) and just ordered another for myself-have problem matching makeup to my skin so that&#x27;s why I got the transparent..going to order the men&#x27;s for my husband for christmas. Love it and you will too!</li>
            <li> I really like how this product makes my skin feel and use it as a primer for my makeup. Some reviewers have said that it improves the overall condition of their skin, and although I cannot vouch for that, it does double duty as a sunblock with 20 spf, which I do appreciate. Would I buy it again? Yes.  I haven&#x27;t seen any other product like this on the market.</li>
            <li> This product is a 1.5 ounces not 1.7 as stated.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is the MIRACLE FOR OTHERS but did not do to much for me, do not like to give negative reviews</li>
            <li> I have used this product about a year ow, very good for aging skin.  Also will be ordering&lt;br /&gt;the cleanser soon.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample in my Birchbox and really liked it, so I had to try the full size version.

            <li> Love this! Makes my oily skin look matte all day, without feeling heavy. Pricey but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> my new favorite primer. its better than smash box and all the other primers I tried from Sephora. its hydrated and gives me a great finish</li>
            <li> I use this every day, and it is the only product I use on my face. I don&#x27;t wear any makeup but I was in desperate need of a sunblock (I live in arizona) as well as a very light moisturizer to use after I shower. I don&#x27;t wash my face with any chemicals, I find that letting my shower water clean it is perfect, but the hot water will sometimes dry out the skin. My older sister used to give me all of her half used moisturizers and I would try them out and this one was the only one that has never made me break out. I use just the smallest drop and it goes a very long way, it makes my skin smooth and gives me coverage for any season in arizona. I only use the translucent one but it is all I need. I love this!!!!</li>
            <li> Just rec&#x27;d another tube - great protection from weather but the tube was past expiration date. Sunscreen works best when  within date of expiration. Returning for fresh tube of an awesome product</li>
            <li> This item is the first that I&#x27;ve used that goes on with a true matte finish - leaving your skin looking and feeling fresh and non-oily.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results as well.  My skin tone is much more even.  And I have had minimal breakouts since first using!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! I just love how it makes your skin look and feel so luminous and soft.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my skin. It&#x27;s hard to explain. Just makes for a very smooth base and makes all my make up work better.</li>
            <li> I use the clear formula as an SPF and primer for my face. Does a fantastic job as a primer. My skin is normal, so I cannot speak on the moisturizing benefits. It replaced my morning moisturizer and my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt I will be ordering this product again.  I love the way my skin feels after put this on.  You feel soft immediately.  Must have.  I tried both translucent and tinted and love them both. Translucent is the best for my skin!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, goes on smooth and makes my skin feel like velvet</li>
            <li> Putting this on right after a shower feels like wrapping my face in silk.  Goes on soooo smooth and the moisture it adds is noticeable immediately. I can almost hear my skin say &amp;#34;Awww&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love. All about one step skin care. Ulta is going to stop carrying this (already out of stock at one I go to). Tried a quick online search found it here. Also got 2 for the price one compared to what I used to spend at Ulta for just one. Product itself is amazing. If you use moisturizer, sunscreen and a primer separately then this is a must to simplify your routine. I don&#x27;t have time for more then 1step application :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice when the claims a product makes are truth.  This Miracle Skin Transformer feels weightless, is invisible on my skin and totally covers or minimizes all my flaws.  If I want some color I dust a bit of powder over it.  It&#x27;s quick and easy, but let it dry before you add check color or powder on your nose.  Lasts all day!  I&#x27;m totally thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and loved it.  When I ran out I ordered for myself and continue to use on a daily basis.  Makes my skin feel smooth and silky.</li>
