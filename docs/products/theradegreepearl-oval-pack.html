            <li>I have them in a variety of sizes and they are wonderful.</li>
            <li>20 Minutes at one time on the eyes is wonderful relief, restores vision</li>
            <li>It was perfect.  </li>
            <li>Happy I bought it.</li>
            <li>They did great in all these areas.</li>
            <li>Great for your neck, face, temples, or</li>
            <li>Perfect fit for my hand.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with both and deserve an upgrade to 5 stars.</li>
            <li>The one good thing about them is they don&#x27;t take over night to freeze like the gel kind.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I also have the face pack that this brand sells and love it!  </li>
            <li>Besides the fact that it lost its temperature after 5  minutes, I really liked the concept of this item.  </li>
            <li>very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I like that they conform to your body shape (and this size fit nicely in my bra)</li>
            <li>These ice packs are ok.</li>
            <li>These are pretty much the best thing ever for headaches.</li>
            <li>Works great, but I thought it would be slightly bigger.</li>
            <li>great products and terrific customer service.</li>
            <li>all right, nice and hot.  </li>
            <li>the picture makes it look like the plastic bag is full of pearls.</li>
            <li>So, not only did they replace the defective one I purchased as an add-on, but they bent over backwards to make sure I was a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will get more use out of them when my little one becomes more mobile.</li>
            <li>Plus, they&#x27;re very spa like pretty for those that care about that :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another upside to these is how quickly they are ready to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We very much like the oval pack but looked forward to having all three items shown in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The drawback came when I went to use it as a hot pack.  </li>
            <li>I may try it again, but I&#x27;ll be sure to try a much smaller increment of time first.  </li>
            <li>Only one item came, misleading on both image and weight, didn&#x27;t say how many item per order under Product Description at all.</li>
            <li>It contains 5 oval packs totally filled with pearls and no air, plus a pink Eye-ssential Mask also completely filled with pearls.</li>
            <li>Works very well and can reuse it.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I had received a free sample in this size and needed a second one (for the purpose of sore breasts during breastfeeding).</li>
            <li>They seem to freeze much quicker than water or liquid based packs I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Probably 20 seconds in our microwave was too much</li>
            <li>I would like to use this on my eye for a stye that&#x27;s coming on, but there is so much air inside the plastic bag</li>
            <li>The face pack is the perfect temp and stays cold longer.  </li>
            <li>Fair for the money very small but that my fault I guess.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a standard microwave -- nothing special about it.)  </li>
            <li>The beads make it pliable, not hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li>5&amp;#34;  by  2.5&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;will write more after use--&lt;br /&gt;sorry  TOO  SMALL 4</li>
            <li>Be aware that even though you see three items listed for the Therapearl Oval Pack you only receive the oval shaped pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wrap mine in a paper towel at work, so that it&#x27;s not too hot - especially on my hand.</li>
            <li>It is smaller than I expected but that means it can easily be slipped into a pocket or a sock to hold in place.  </li>
            <li>And when my mild arthritis kicks up it&#x27;s just the thing to help out with a nice bit of cold.  </li>
            <li>After only two very gentle uses the bag tore open on the side while I was resting it on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon customer service who was very helpful, and they sent me a second order, same thing on the reorder</li>
            <li>: You have a warm pad for little areas for which the big, wide, long electrical ones are just way too cumbersome.</li>
            <li>so I generally get gel packs.  </li>
            <li>It stayed cold as long as was allowed (about 15-20 min) and was a great help in relieving soreness and itching.  </li>
            <li>I like this pack as a cold pack, it molds well and feels good.  </li>
            <li>I tried using it a few times without success, so called the company.</li>
            <li>I was worried these would be too small, not flexible enough, nor hold their cool (don&#x27;t use for heat)...</li>

            <li> Needless to say, stores don&#x27;t carry a variety of ice packs.  </li>
            <li> So, as a cold pack I&#x27;d give it 5-stars, but as a heat pack, 3-stars.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the perfect size. I just love it. Works very well and can reuse it. Never used the heat part but freezing it works well. Happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> Works great, but I thought it would be slightly bigger.</li>
            <li> 5&amp;#34;  by  2.5&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;will write more after use--&lt;br /&gt;sorry  TOO  SMALL 4 me&lt;br /&gt;wondered why folks concerned re bag staying cold long enough [20mins]&lt;br /&gt;for a small boned person--would probably b ok&lt;br /&gt;i happen to have mom&#x27;s  smarts  &amp;  dads long heavy bones &amp; smaller grandchildren---yep--they get them</li>
            <li> I did receive the oval shaped Therapearl Pack, but I believed it was also suppose to include the round and the retangular Therapearl Packs with it, three items total.  I contacted Amazon customer service who was very helpful, and they sent me a second order, same thing on the reorder only the oval pack arrived.  Be aware that even though you see three items listed for the Therapearl Oval Pack you only receive the oval shaped pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We very much like the oval pack but looked forward to having all three items shown in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W. Black, Amarillo, TX</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had received a free sample in this size and needed a second one (for the purpose of sore breasts during breastfeeding). I like that they conform to your body shape (and this size fit nicely in my bra), however they really don&#x27;t stay cold for that long. I&#x27;m sure I will get more use out of them when my little one becomes more mobile.</li>
            <li> These ice packs are ok. I use them, I like them but they don&#x27;t stay cold very long. The one good thing about them is they don&#x27;t take over night to freeze like the gel kind.</li>
            <li> I use these on my eyebrows when they&#x27;re all red from being waxed or plucked. They&#x27;re also great for bug bites or bruises!</li>
            <li> I was worried these would be too small, not flexible enough, nor hold their cool (don&#x27;t use for heat)... They did great in all these areas. They pearls are loose enough to mold to whatever body part you are using it for. I specifically used them for my ankles, thumbs, and wrists. I bought 4 of these total so I could back both side of my wrist at the same time. It&#x27;s a must if you&#x27;re icing multiple parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another upside to these is how quickly they are ready to use. They seem to freeze much quicker than water or liquid based packs I&#x27;ve used. Plus, they&#x27;re very spa like pretty for those that care about that :)</li>
            <li> These are pretty much the best thing ever for headaches. I have them in a variety of sizes and they are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I like this pack as a cold pack, it molds well and feels good.  It is smaller than I expected but that means it can easily be slipped into a pocket or a sock to hold in place.  The drawback came when I went to use it as a hot pack.  We microwaved it as per the instructions on the back, for 20 seconds.  The pack itself came out all right, nice and hot.  But, OMG!  The smell was horrendous!  I could still smell it the next morning.  Probably 20 seconds in our microwave was too much (it&#x27;s a standard microwave -- nothing special about it.)  I may try it again, but I&#x27;ll be sure to try a much smaller increment of time first.  So, as a cold pack I&#x27;d give it 5-stars, but as a heat pack, 3-stars.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my hand.  And when my mild arthritis kicks up it&#x27;s just the thing to help out with a nice bit of cold.  When it starts to lose its coolness I just shake the pearls up a little bit.  It lasts for about 15 minutes, so I bought two, just in case I needed to use it longer.</li>
            <li> I bought it for relief from Myasthenia Gravis. 20 Minutes at one time on the eyes is wonderful relief, restores vision</li>
            <li> I would like to use this on my eye for a stye that&#x27;s coming on, but there is so much air inside the plastic bag the pearls are in. It&#x27;s already that way at room temperature. When I put it in the microwave for 20 seconds (even tried just 10 seconds), it expands and becomes a miniature football. This can&#x27;t possibly mold around any part of the body. I tried using it a few times without success, so called the company. The woman I spoke with said I should not leave it in the microwave for 20 seconds--that&#x27;s too long. Well, then why do the instructions say to do that? She&#x27;s going to send me another one. Maybe I just bought a defective one and the one she sends won&#x27;t do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the picture makes it look like the plastic bag is full of pearls. Not so, they hardly cover the bottom of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast Forward to May 1, 2014 - Today I received a box from the TheraPearl company. It contains 5 oval packs totally filled with pearls and no air, plus a pink Eye-ssential Mask also completely filled with pearls. So, not only did they replace the defective one I purchased as an add-on, but they bent over backwards to make sure I was a satisfied customer. Thank you TheraPearl -- great products and terrific customer service. I am very pleased with both and deserve an upgrade to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, stores don&#x27;t carry a variety of ice packs.  I bought this one to tuck into my bra after a biopsy.  It was perfect.  It stayed cold as long as was allowed (about 15-20 min) and was a great help in relieving soreness and itching.  The beads make it pliable, not hard as a rock.  very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Fair for the money very small but that my fault I guess. They stay cold forx10 minutes not very good for my elbow as this is the size of a small hand</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and works wonderfully. 28-30 seconds in the microwave - just like on the instructions: You have a warm pad for little areas for which the big, wide, long electrical ones are just way too cumbersome. I wrap mine in a paper towel at work, so that it&#x27;s not too hot - especially on my hand. Great for your neck, face, temples, or anywhere you need a little short-term heat.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that it lost its temperature after 5  minutes, I really liked the concept of this item.  I am a massage therapist and ice all of my minor aches and pains.  I hate having to put a barrier between my skin and ice so I generally get gel packs.  After only two very gentle uses the bag tore open on the side while I was resting it on my forehead.  I also have the face pack that this brand sells and love it!  The face pack is the perfect temp and stays cold longer.  I think the material in the small packs that they sell is much thinner.  I wanted to recommend this product, but it is a lemon.</li>
            <li> Only one item came, misleading on both image and weight, didn&#x27;t say how many item per order under Product Description at all.</li>
            <li> Does not stay cold real long, but it is small.</li>
            <li> i like it, doesnt stay cold that long, but its better than putting ice on my face</li>
