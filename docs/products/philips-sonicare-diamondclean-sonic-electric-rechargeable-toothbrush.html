            <li>/&gt;Update: March 27, 2014&lt;br /&gt;After doing my research, I had to (somewhat reluctantly) admit to myself that Sonicare still seems like the best way to take care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Amazon was the best price that I could find.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, it works, and it cleans!</li>
            <li>Best toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li>It was the best toothbrush I have ever used in my life.</li>
            <li>It stoppped working twice, but the warranty is awesome, so it got replaced</li>
            <li>It is GREAT!!</li>
            <li>but this is the best!</li>
            <li>The best toothbrush I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed that I can brush twice a day for 2 months just on one charge.</li>
            <li>And all the settings it has is awesome.</li>
            <li>this $185 might turn out to be a wonderful investment!</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of removing plaque from my teeth and makes them feel like glass once I am through.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working flawlessly ever since I purchased it: I think it&#x27;s been about two years.  </li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of cleaning...</li>
            <li>I think this must be the best electric toothbrush out there.  </li>
            <li>It is the best oral care brush ever made.  </li>
            <li>I am the type of person that likes to have the BEST of everything with all of my electronics!</li>
            <li>All in all we are very happy we purchased it!</li>

            <li>/&gt;Ok, so this toothbrush has a great tendency to splatter/spray toothpaste out of my mouth to surrounding areas like my arm, hair, mirror, countertop, everywhere!</li>
            <li>this is a wonderful device!  </li>
            <li>it was supposedly the best of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve entered and graduated dental hygiene school and come to value power brushes as a great tool for everyone to improve their oral health.</li>

            <li>This is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This was never a problem with the Elite model, which was a great product for brushing your teeth instead of fancy-pants industrial design.  </li>

            <li>Farewell and stay vigilant, as it is a great toothbrush, but</li>
            <li>My Phillips Sonicare toothbrush worked great for three weeks</li>
            <li>Great results.  </li>
            <li>After 2 months of use, I&#x27;m still happy with my purchase.  </li>

            <li>Adding a charging function to the case brings this up to date in a great way.  </li>
            <li>Still looks great, though...</li>
            <li>If this toothbrush was any fancier, it would fly off to remind you</li>
            <li>I asked her why she was &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; with my career choice, and she said it just made her happy.</li>
            <li>Just went to the hygienist today, and she said my teeth looked great.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years and was happy this one was recommended.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush does do a great job cleaning, but the quality control has disintegrated.  </li>
            <li>They have worked great, holding a charge for 3 weeks or so and have cleaned and revitalized how our mouths feel.  </li>
            <li>Great if you can afford it.</li>
            <li>Wife and I have it does great job</li>

            <li>The charger glass is great too.</li>
            <li>My dentist is happy with the results too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am happy with the toothbrush performance, it is as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Great product and</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush when it is in working order.  </li>
            <li>Instead of putting it in a plastic bag you can throw it in the case and charge it on your computer, through the case if needed, now that&#x27;s a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself works great.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>

            <li>Takes some getting used to, but does a great job.</li>
            <li>so it is a win win.  </li>
            <li>I have since bought one for each of our four daughters and they are equally happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great looking toothbrush</li>
            <li>toothbrush itself is great as well.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>especially love the travelling case and charging glass - quite amazing.</li>
            <li>Gapless brush head design (except for power button) greatly reduces chances for build-up over time&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can say is I&#x27;m so happy that I purchased this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please understand the product is great unless it breaks.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Works great with braces.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush also does a great job of cleaning your teeth and massaging gums.  </li>
            <li>, it looks great too.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush until it stopped working after 2 years, with no support offered by Philips.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy if you like spending $90/year on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>great job, sonicare, for your continued improvements .</li>
            <li>Sonic always makes great products.</li>

            <li>If I should win the lottery I will purchase one for everybody</li>
            <li>Diamondclean comes with two heads and a great travel set.</li>
            <li>The built-in timer that tells you when to brush another area of your mouth is GREAT.  </li>
            <li>They design is great, handle is slim and you have to get use to it though.</li>
            <li>Great job on the design.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li>So all in all, great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>. feels great in your hand and the vibrations on your teeth,&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li>It does a great job too, once I figured out how to use it without looking into the mirror.</li>
            <li>I called in sonicare and they were happy to give me a replacement body.  </li>
            <li>I travel for a living so the travel case that charges the toothbrush is great if you are on the go a lot.</li>

            <li>Works great and</li>

            <li>It helped me a lot when I found that my hand dexterity was not that great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for kids and teens.  </li>
            <li>options for cleaning are just amazing, and the way the head of the brush is design is perfect.</li>

            <li>Functionally, it works great</li>
            <li>Though it looks, sounds, and feels great, within one month</li>
            <li>Worked great at the beginning.  </li>
            <li>greatly improving the brushing effectiveness</li>
            <li>So happy to have this device.</li>

            <li>The design is well thought out, and for travelling it works great.  </li>
            <li>My dentist hygienist cannot believe how great my teeth look since I purchased this brush.  </li>
            <li>so that was all great.</li>
            <li>I have owned a couple of Sonicare&#x27;s and have been happy with them all.</li>

            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>This brush was great for about 1 year.  </li>
            <li>So five stars for being a great power brush.</li>
            <li>Great for home and travel use.</li>
            <li>For the one year they both worked, they were great.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is great</li>
            <li>and phillips has a great process to repair</li>
            <li>Its great.</li>
            <li>great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>you know you have received a great product.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of stimulating your gums.</li>

            <li>it works great.  </li>
            <li>So happy with this investment</li>
            <li>really..so gross..destroys the great look of the brush.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush.  </li>
            <li>Totally happy with how it performs.  </li>
            <li>Then the amount of hardware on bathroom sink did not make me happy.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and just works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>But I love it!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>you have money to burn and like Apple like styling, this is a very nice looking update to the Sonicare line</li>
            <li>Has a very nice feel to it, in the hand and in use.</li>
            <li>so it is very nice having the carrying case that doubles as a charger.  </li>
            <li>The two chargers are very handy.</li>
            <li>The glass is very handy, as is the travel case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Phillips customer service is very nice and offered a replacement immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charging glass is very nice and WELL built.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is very nice with a magnetic close, it also acts like a dock by having the option to charge the toothbrush while it sits inside the case.  </li>
            <li>very nice philips sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The travel case is very nice, but it doesn&#x27;t include storage space for the charger.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice travel case and combination charger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nicely made and runs a couple weeks on a charge.  </li>
            <li>But if you can handle the cost, it is a very nice brush.</li>
            <li>A very nice product, but replacing it once a year means the cost, not including replacement heads, is around $15-$16/mo.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality product.</li>
            <li>While not a match for an Ultrasonex in working order, this Sonicare is a very good toothbrush --- probably the best of those now available.  </li>
            <li>The DiamondClean is amazing!</li>
            <li>The glass charger is amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just simply Amazing!</li>
            <li>This leaves my mouth feeling amazing!  </li>
            <li>I can say is that it is amazing!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>also remarkable improvements in gum health.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and find they are the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>of the things I appreciate the most about this product is that it&#x27;s perfectly suited for traveling.</li>
            <li>I really love it and it cleans the teeth just perfect, leaving my mouth feeling fresher and cleaner longer.</li>
            <li>the product arrived, I immediately opened it to find a very attractive toothbrush and many accessories.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that I am still very happy with my SoniCare brush.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is also impeccable, and lasts for well over a week of twice a day 2 - 5 minute brushing sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have heard many of my patients tell me that they like the Oral-B spinbrush the best as comopared to Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The minimalism design and impeccable build quality reminds you of Apple products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I love the product until it breaks which makes perfect sense to anyone that loves their product.</li>
            <li>This is as sexy as toothbrushes for people with gingivitis get. :D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>The case itself it also excellent quality, well built, and stylish.  </li>
            <li>I always thought Flexcare did an awesome job on cleaning my teeth, but I think Diamondclean does a better job.</li>
            <li>good look and great performance</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own 1-year warranty!</li>
            <li>Product is excellent &amp; enjoyed using it...</li>
            <li>Being able to just set the toothbrush in the glass rather than fuss with getting it on a peg is the greatest!</li>
            <li>Good food, great company and...</li>
            <li>The best word I can think of is elegant.</li>
            <li>Love it, buy it, it&#x27;s the best !!</li>
            <li>Everyone should own one of these!</li>
            <li>excellent product - hope battery life is more than 2 years.</li>
            <li>Awesome brush, make sure you utilize the diamond brushing heads.  </li>
            <li>the best tooth brush ever made #LOVE</li>
            <li>And this perfect Ida with the glass :-)</li>

            <li>and I loved mine</li>
            <li>Quality wise, it&#x27;s a piece of garbage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea-)</li>
            <li>It might be a good toothbrush, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a killer, in a good way.</li>
            <li>The fit and finish of this product is absolutely excellent.</li>
            <li>Removing the reservoir was really good for this upgrade.</li>
            <li>good job sonicare.</li>
            <li>I believe this is the best product available in the market.</li>
            <li>It seems like it might indeed be a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy that I made the purchase using coupons and discounts that were available at the time.</li>
            <li>This is a good product to have.</li>
            <li>Yes, this brush is that good.</li>
            <li>In my case anything that let&#x27;s me avoid appointments is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I have found it to be a superior product to brushes offered by Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>RPM is incredible; dramatically more than the Oral-</li>
            <li>I used a competitor&#x27;s product for 6+ years and loved it.</li>
            <li>Make no mistake, this is the best toothbrush available and a work of art.  </li>
            <li>I really loved this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The one I got for my wife and myself is still good.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I loved it for 1 1/2 year</li>
            <li>it is that good.</li>
            <li>AS GOOD AS A PRICE AS AMAZON</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>My dentist loved it too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think it is a good investment</li>
            <li>My dental  hygienist recommended Sonicare as the best electric toothbrush available.</li>
            <li>it is good ,I don&#x27;t see a difference with the cheapest one .It</li>
            <li>And, yes, you are probably paying a fair percentage of that price towards the unit&#x27;s stylistic design.</li>
            <li>toothbrush itself is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous travel case that doubles as an in-case charger when connected to the USB cable</li>
            <li>, there were just none in stock, which I found fascinating.</li>
            <li>This one is so good words can&#x27;t describe it.</li>
            <li>It feels really good on the teeth.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item June 8, 2012 and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>so I gave it a good scrub and replaced the head unit (I do this faithfully every 3 months anyways)</li>
            <li>this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>(direction wise)</li>
            <li>I therefore was expectng this one to be good</li>
            <li>but I did not expect it to be as good as it has been.  </li>
            <li>product, good design.</li>
            <li>it again when good price.</li>
            <li>It might be good to check whether the product that you purchase will be under warranty.</li>
            <li>Good quality product.</li>
            <li>The case is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>But since the toothbrush uses a Lithium Ion battery (good for three weeks)</li>
            <li>it is a good investment towards your oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>I thought my worn out elite was good until I received my diamondclean.</li>
            <li>I loved that toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I just contacted Philips and they are sending two replacement handles after a fairly painless 10 minute online chat with a representative.</li>
            <li>The sonicare feels good.</li>
            <li>And that was me, so I thought it might be a good investment for my long-term dental health.  </li>
            <li>Good for all ages.  </li>
            <li>Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for 3 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li>The fact that you can get this with FREE shipping and another rebate in the box at the time I purchased leaves me very happy</li>
            <li>it is surprising how well</li>
            <li>They laughed and said that they recommended Oral B to their clients.</li>
            <li>in all, it was a good decision and purchase.</li>
            <li>so minimizing what I need to carry when traveling is always a good thing.  </li>
            <li>and it was a good value.  </li>
            <li>it is good and works as stated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Invest in yourself - and good oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>and they are not as good as advertised</li>
            <li>This is an investment in my book, teeth feel as good as walking out of the dentist just having your teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>Good brush, good price, good all around.</li>
            <li>excellent product, very useful for my teeth</li>
            <li>It has nice features and very nice design.</li>
            <li>I already had an Oral B electric toothbrush, but while it did a very nice job of cleaning my teeth, it was not even as remotely effective as this Philips Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it helped me make a good decision once again! :)</li>
            <li>Awesome product and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>kids think I&#x27;m corny for being excited about a toothbrush, but why wouldn&#x27;t I be. :D</li>
            <li>Best of all is that I can make them feel that clean each time I brush again.  </li>
            <li>She now plans to buy herself one since she was so impressed by how clean her teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>I have a number of crowns and permanent bridges and he said that the Sonicare would be best at keeping the margins clean.  </li>
            <li>Great item, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I also love the beautiful carrying case that is included; it doubles as a USB charger and makes me feel fancy every time I travel.</li>
            <li>my teeth feel cleaner, some of the tartar or tooth film is gone and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the cleaning capability.</li>
            <li>Just for the record, I also use the Sonciare Airfloss since I got this, which is a great device to use before brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using this brush for just over a month and my teeth are more than 5 shades whiter.</li>
            <li>However, many of my friends and relatives already had bought the Philips Sonicare Toothbrush and told me how happy they were with this product.  </li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s when I decided to purchase it after so many great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Now, after over a month of use, I can report that I am very, very pleased with my decision.  </li>
            <li>Flexcare was great, this is better.</li>
            <li>After owning a Sonicare for years, I decided to upgrade to the Diamond Care based on the great reviews and stunning design.</li>
            <li>The travel case it comes with is also awesome and useful.  </li>
            <li>very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the puchase on Amazon.com and with the seller of this item.</li>
            <li>The perfect sonic toothbrush, worth the money.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great quality tooth brush with many settings to choose from.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased</li>
            <li>We are very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I am most happy with this version of the product.</li>
            <li>Great unit a lot better</li>
            <li>i was so happy with my purchase that i bought 3 more for family members.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to just drop the brush in the glass and know it&#x27;ll be charging perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great until it does not any more.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with each of them.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If they had a better brush it would be great.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>the best performing electric toothbrush out there - pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li>VERY SATISFIED WITH BOTH PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>decided to buy this top of the line one after looking at the great price on amazon.</li>
            <li>Not as good as flossing, but the results were pretty impressive!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>then I was going to buy the very best one because my teeth are worth it</li>
            <li>- otherwise it is a very satisfying brush.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, many settings, and great teeth and gum care!</li>
            <li>Being able to charge it from a USB port is very nice since i dont have to carry an additional charger with me.  </li>
            <li>but in my opinion worth it as the quality is very good and feels good to use</li>
            <li>new advanced head wonderful Polish mode wonderful  </li>
            <li>Great for travel and does a great job, worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks, and the travel case is surprisingly nice, with the USB hookup being a great idea for travel.</li>
            <li>love it the best toothbrush available</li>
            <li>Does a great job on keeping teeth clean and massaging gums!</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, amazing charge time and faultless so far... lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>a beautiful design with a slim handle that is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I love my toothbrush!</li>

            <li>I LOVE this toothbrush!</li>

            <li>Love everything else about it!</li>
            <li>So first, the compact brush head is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>It is perfect - exactly the size for those of us with a sensitivity to gagging.</li>
            <li>This is pretty pricey at monthly cost for equipment of $9.50 for the twenty months it functioned perfectly.</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I plan to get some whitener as I think using it with this product will give me top notch results!  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Ive had mine for over a year now, absolutely love it!</li>

            <li>I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>toothbrush has the most wonderful feeling in the mouth and the teeth get REALLY clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to assemble, easy to use... and you can even charge the toothbrush via the USB port on your computer (brilliant!).</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use and get used to.</li>
            <li>If you have toothpaste on your brush, and you want to toggle to your preferred setting, the toothpaste will fly off as you find your preferred setting--and when the brush is in your mouth, you can&#x27;t easily see what setting you&#x27;re on.</li>
            <li>And pleasant to the touch &#x3D;))</li>
            <li>I still loved it till it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to buy a new one as a replacement as it gave me the best feel.</li>
            <li>and they are all very high quality, excellent build quality/construction/design</li>
            <li>I chose this product based on some reviews I saw (not on Amazon) that rated it very highly AND lauded the Amazon price, which was the best I found.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is amazing.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great brush and does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li>Thankfully Philips customer service was amazing and they sent out a replacement.</li>
            <li>Switching from a manual toothbrush, the results I see with this brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>And it was definitely amazing.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush produced amazing results.  </li>
            <li>It does an amazing job of removing plaque and stains.</li>
            <li>The case is amazing...</li>
            <li>This is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing tool.</li>

            <li>the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li>If you can afford it, this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing...</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li>AMAZING TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li>It is nice at the beginning</li>
            <li>Nice case; sleek design.</li>
            <li>It might be worth the incredible price difference for these features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both commented how nice my teeth were.  </li>
            <li>If for some reason you do need to charge it it comes with the handy charging glass to keep in your hotel room.    </li>
            <li>This is a superior dental system that gets my teeth cleaner and whiter and gets me more motivated to brush.</li>
            <li>The noise of this one is also kind of grating</li>
            <li>The DiamondClean also comes with a nice travel case.</li>
            <li>Nice design.</li>
            <li>The travel case/charger is nice.     </li>
            <li>but if I do it could be handy.  </li>
            <li>Phillips impressed me so much that I felt compelled to do so.  </li>
            <li>Travel case is really nice too.  </li>
            <li>My dentist is loving me.</li>
            <li>I liked the look and feel of this unit as well as the fact</li>
            <li>It also comes with a travel case which has its own cords to charge from the wall outlet or a usb port on your computer.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend this based on my own use.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of concave and stands on the included chargers, which surround the bottom portion of the handle, preventing it from falling over.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The travel case is nice too.</li>
            <li>The travel case is nice too.</li>
            <li>I am used to a manual toothbrush and never tried any kind of electric ons in my life until my dentist recommend it to me.</li>
            <li>The travel case is really nice and works well.</li>
            <li>Comes with a nice case and accessories.</li>
            <li>I have never used the USB charging feature, but I do like the nice case for travel.  </li>
            <li>This is nice because it helps protect your brush from beingknocked off the counter or shelf in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>i loved it, and this one is even better.  </li>
            <li>Nice piece.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how this toothbrush could receive anything but 5 stars.</li>
            <li>But if you really have to have the best on the market, this is it.</li>
            <li>liked the packaging on this.</li>
            <li>is handy</li>
            <li>is handy</li>
            <li>Charging with the USb option is also handy sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The battery life is great, and the multiple options for charging are great!</li>
            <li>Could have gotten a better price by going to Bed Bath and Beyond that offered a good price, a mail in refund and 20% off on a store coupon.  </li>
            <li>Two ways to charge with the stand and the handy USB travel case.  </li>
            <li>Looks nice on my bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for in a toothbrush, is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>Looks nice on shelf.</li>
            <li>Nice touch.</li>
            <li>also think that the way this brush splits up the timer is nice.</li>
            <li>I feel like having a really nice toothbrush and going off brand</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it works effectively.  </li>
            <li>well that&#x27;s just a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>Comes with a really nice travel case as well.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this toothbrush, and my dentist seems to think it was a good choice.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a nice dual featured option.</li>
            <li>It also would have been nice if the charging cradle was glass</li>
            <li>The 30-second interval timer is really handy</li>
            <li>But once I tried the Philips Sonicare I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>The travel pouch is a nice accessory .  </li>
            <li>We are thrilled with the design.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, it would be nice to have the ability to place the cap over the brush head, however, doing so in the form would prevent ample air circulation, causing bacteria growth.  </li>
            <li>the toothbrush and holder are both nicely designed.</li>
            <li>if you are an &amp;#34;Executive summary&amp;#34; kind of person:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>Honestly they should just have 2 modes;</li>
            <li>I have always used the sonicare line, but this one is gives the most superior cleaning I have ever had at home.</li>
            <li>It comes with a handy travel case.  </li>
            <li>it is worth the money, best i ever used..nice design and material is top notch..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this toothbrush to anyone in search of the absolute best.</li>
            <li>Well built and extremely effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It could be handy to charge on your computer</li>
            <li>charger on it&#x27;s own (without the cup) make me feel like the brush will topple over...</li>
            <li>I got adept at putting the brush in my mouth, angling it so that I could see the lights in the mirror, and pressing the button until I reached the cleaning mode I wanted.</li>
            <li>Awesome Toothbrush, my mouth feels so much cleaner</li>
            <li>It would be nice if you could select the setting you want before you turn it on.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li>my gums day after day stronger, that I kept using it and started loving it.</li>
            <li>Is it worth a penny to have an incredible brushing expierence everytime</li>
            <li>Nice sleek design.</li>
            <li>But I really liked the way the Sonicare cleaned my teeth, so I bought a the DiamondClean because it had a Lithium Ion battery and Lithium Ion batteries don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; problems of NiCad batteries</li>
            <li>I really liked this toothbrush but after two years it stopped charging.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t do it, they suck to put it nicely.  </li>
            <li>This brush was nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li>The item has a nice feel to the handle.</li>
            <li>What a great product..always works with ease, changing the heads is simple and it is the best thing we as a family could have ever purchased !</li>
            <li>I do think Phillips was trying to make a trendy toothbrush.</li>

            <li>: Good advanced brush, with lift most stains with pro results brush, give an awesome clean</li>
            <li>get one of the original models - they work great.  </li>
            <li>Great product, so worth the money!</li>
            <li>and she wouldn&#x27;t suggest a particular brand but said to get the best I could afford.</li>
            <li>Our older Sonicare had been working flawlessly for 6 years when I decided to step up to the Diamond Care model.</li>
            <li>Great Toothbrush my Teeth have never been so clean.</li>
            <li>This diamond clean model is great.</li>
            <li>The clean feeling I get with this toothbrush is like nothing I&#x27;ve ever experienced with a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>She has been extremely happy and feels that her teeth and gums have never been so clean.</li>
            <li>Polish feature is great, makes your teeth really clean.</li>
            <li>I have used Phillips sonicare brooshes for a number of years but this particular one is the best.</li>
            <li>this works great to clean my aligners.</li>
            <li>Great for kids too, when they have difficulty getting their teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>this afternoon because 3 years is still a great run for something that gets dunked in water every morning and evening to clean, vibrates over 39k times/minute, for about 6 minutes per day, over about 985 days.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and love using it.  </li>
            <li>Great design, using the glass to hold the toothbrush and charge it is cool and functional.  </li>
            <li>this toothbrush is very appealing to the eye and the glass cup was and inventive way of charging it</li>
            <li>good things about this is the stylish design the power button screams of another stylish electronic that&#x27;s quite popular</li>
            <li>Everytime I brush my teeth, they feel dentist clean!!</li>
            <li>It works beautifully, adjusting from one speed to the next easily if needed with a perfect timer.</li>
            <li>If you need a new Sonicare, this is a great choice!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Contacted Philips, they said the best they can do is give me a code for 15% off a new one from their site (which lists for $220 there, instead of 180 here) since mine is &#x27;out of warranty&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Love the Sonicare, as I believe it does a great job with the dental hygiene that is so important to me.  </li>
            <li>The elegant one-button design really isn&#x27;t the best user interface</li>
            <li>I have had many electric brushes, but this one is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>I also love the convenience of the charging glass which is a really neat idea that works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>My dentist noticed a substantial reduction in mineral deposits, and my gums got a good deal more healthy.</li>
            <li>It makes the cleaning process very easy, but it broke after 9 months.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use &amp; recharge.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy review...</li>
            <li>Very easy.</li>
            <li>It also travels very easy with you</li>
            <li>The best part is once I complete the brushing, my mouth feels like it has just been overhauled!</li>
            <li>but wow!  That is an awesome toothbrush!</li>
            <li>First let me say that the ordering and shipping were handled flawlessly, I received the Philips Sonicare very quickly.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the concept of an electric toothbrush and this one is hands down the best one she has ever owned - result a beautiful smile on a beautiful girl; what more can I ask.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I bought this product and my teeth are sparkling clean and so much more whiter and brighter than they were before.  </li>
            <li>The main features which sold me are the induction charging cup and the USB travel charger and case -- they looked great in the review, and in person, are just as good as I</li>
            <li>...and i can see why...cannot say my wallet was happy but well worth the expense...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled and will keep using this until PS comes out with something better than this.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely impressed by how they handled it and that the process was completely painless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is clearly supposed to resembled an Apple Iproduct, for reasons known best to Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I tried to be a good tooth brusher and take it lightly but still got a lecture from the guy.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best tooth brushes that I have used so far.</li>
            <li>So far I am impressed with the toothbrush but the proof will be when I go for my dental check up and see if it made a difference in my tarter buildup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually attractive while also being useful.</li>
            <li>I liked the E series way better than the Oral B.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It really is the best in this category, and infinitely better and cleaning your teeth and better oral care than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a number of Sonicare toothbrush models and this model is BY FAR the best yet!</li>
            <li>Wireless charging was a smart/cool idea that honestly attracted me the most.  </li>
            <li>But it would be nice to have better directions on the alternative ways I&#x27;ve paid for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All around it&#x27;s the best electronic toothbrush I&#x27;ve had so far.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric toothbrushes you can buy.</li>
            <li>The Best, by far.  </li>
            <li>They are also some of the most popular and recommended professionaltype home toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>now I can happily say it&#x27;s been a worth while</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I have then moved onto a competitors brand which doesn&#x27;t look as nice but feels and brushes a lot better.</li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush does an excellent job of cleaning, whiting, gum massage and keeping the tartar build up nearly non existant.</li>
            <li>So far I am very impressed!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I have used.</li>
            <li>Although a bit pricey, I am happy to say that it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Amazon consistently gives me the best prices, with no shipping costs, in a secure format.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can feel a pleasant sensation in my gums, too, which is very good for blood flow and overall gum health.</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>How easy was that?!</li>
            <li>best investment we&#x27;ve ever made, love to use it and have that fresh from the dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li>At first this product was amazing, but like many others have experienced, my tooth brush broke about 1 year after I bought it and</li>
            <li>The vibration feels good on the gums and leaves teeth feeling really clean.  </li>
            <li>great toothbrush that really polishes your teeth up to a nice gleam.  </li>
            <li>More importantly my teeth loved it.</li>
            <li>I would love to be able to update on my own terms rather than water damage or planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li>Excellent upgrade from my many years old Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li>I totally loved it, my teeth are so clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it, and still happy a year later, as I update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes your teeth feel so good and clean, they feel like you have just come from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>kept on with sonicare brushes when my dentist was telling me how good of a job I was doing keeping my braces clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very attractive toothbrush and works just as well or better than my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Happily the program I use first has two words in it</li>
            <li>Forget going to the dentist and wondering if your teeth are perfect, or barely passing the exam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The whole product is beautifully engineered.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric tooth brush and it works great.</li>
            <li>First, the charging cup is great and that&#x27;s my go to way of charging it.</li>
            <li>Great device but costs too much!</li>
            <li>Result are in sync with the claims happy with the product also with amazons delivery as this was my first online import to India Mumbai.</li>
            <li>All in all this toothbrush is pretty great</li>
            <li>Feels great in my hand (that&#x27;s what she said), brushes well, and is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I was happy with flexicare.  </li>
            <li>The Diamondclean has a very smooth body and it seems to slip and slide around in my hand.</li>
            <li>This brush scrubs your teeth way better and leaves you feeling like you did when you first experienced Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Nicely designed, variable speeds makes brushing easy rather than a chore.  </li>
            <li>the brush itself is nice and sleek and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED QUICKLY AND IN GOOD CONDITION.</li>
            <li>you need a reliable brush that can be charged easily from computer or wall while looking nice, this is your way to go.</li>
            <li>Easy to Handle: The brush has a nice feel in your hand.  </li>
            <li>like the storage box, it&#x27;s easy to change the heads and nice to have a place to put them when you but them.&lt;br /&gt;It does suck to pay 200 bucks for something you&#x27;ll still be paying for b/c of the replacement heads - something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The carrying case is super nice and comes in handy for overnight trips.</li>
            <li>I have always loved Sonicare, read good reviews of this one and it was time to change my old one because after 4 years it stopped working, so I decided to go ahead and buy this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
            <li>I am now pleased to say that my Hygentist is very pleased with my clean teeth for once.  </li>
            <li>You have money to splurge a bit and value great design very highly.</li>
            <li>new Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush is the best electric toothbrush I have ever used</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a happy sound and makes me smile &amp; now my teeth sparkle</li>
            <li>It just rests on top of it.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are not in the best of condition and I have several fillings and crowns.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll save yourself over $100 and have a better tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for awhile now and it cleans like most brushes do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE has been fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>To be able to charge my toothbrush from my laptop, while its in its carrying case...</li>
            <li>more-</li>
            <li>When I opened the travel case to reveal the actual toothbrush, I wasn&#x27;t nearly as impressed.</li>
            <li>I was just expecting a bit more for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>but it sure isn&#x27;t hurting</li>
            <li>Love Phillips Sonicare!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Top notch.</li>
            <li>If you use the brushes correctly you can keep your mouth perfectly healthy</li>
            <li>He said it was the best present ever</li>
            <li>It has a visually sexy design, but ergonomics could be improved by adding a ridge or contour to grip the handle better.</li>
            <li>they last well and Philips have excellent customer service</li>
            <li>And I also love the travel case, which has a USB connector so that you can recharge your toothbrush via USB</li>
            <li>The $200 is the better bargain.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best product that I have acquired in 2011.</li>
            <li>* Remove plaque better than a manual toothbrush&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most stable.     </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting that much difference in performace over the flexcare which is already great.</li>
            <li>I opened 4 more brushes and most of the shiny chromed bases are scuffed.</li>
            <li>In all honesty I don&#x27;t think these things will bother or even be apparant to most people.</li>
            <li>I know that this technology works, but I&#x27;m a software engineer, so this is magic to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to practically review this product...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to Sonicare products, this is the top of the line.  </li>
            <li>and I love the high-quality look of it.</li>
            <li>and this makes sure I move from each section of my mouth when needed.  </li>
            <li>My wife also uses and love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I have owned more than a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The most glaring omission is not being able to store the USB cord inside the case when not in use.</li>
            <li>So, I bought the top of the line, which is this brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to find words for this toothbrush, but \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; and \\&quot;more</li>
            <li>Also if there was an industry award for throwing a product on the market without any consumer testing, the Diamondhead would be a top candidate.</li>
            <li>I gave it a week to be sure.</li>
            <li>Hoping I would be able to work it out</li>
            <li>It is way better than either the Oral-B or the Elite.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how many times I have had to have this replaced.</li>
            <li>I am already in love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there will be tweaks to improve the case, the brush, the charger, etc...</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using: I am still in love.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li>Seems like the mode should be able to be set.</li>
            <li>The brush head size is much better than any Oral B product my wife and I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this model, it turns on ok but the electric motor cuts out</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I think this is because the brush is cleaning my teeth so much better and allergens are being removed quicker.</li>
            <li>The longer you use it, the better it feels.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>, I love the timer, and it&#x27;s packaged in almost apple like design.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough of how impressed I am to this version.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter top space.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied, it delivers more than promised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m impressed not only with  Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean</li>
            <li>but with quality of service Amazon provided.&lt;br /&gt;Being an overseas buyer I can say confidently I&#x27;m protected with Amazon&#x27;s policy and Philips Sonicare HX9332/05</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The head design is better and the unit looks sleek.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I may have jumped the gun.</li>
            <li>and I love this newest edition.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>It was nice to be able to get the perks with the store card for 6 months interest free financing at time of purchase.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li>I did some research and after trying out the Sonciare HealthyWhite, which is also a great toothbrush for people who don&#x27;t want to spend so much, I decided to purchase the Sonicare DiamondClean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Most of the modes work this way</li>
            <li>but I find I like this even more.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Braun electric toothbrush for many years, with no complaints.</li>
            <li>We just felt this may be an even better dental hygiene option for</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d expect a $200 brush to be more</li>
            <li>My gums feel healthy.</li>
            <li>It feels like this motion will be easier on my receding gums, although it&#x27;s too soon to say for sure.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electrical toothbrushes by Philips&#x27; competitors for more than 20 years now.</li>
            <li>In summary, this is the best electrical toothbrush that I have been using in the last 20 years</li>
            <li>and I would think that it is the best currently on the market.  </li>
            <li>Had this toothbrush about a week now and love it.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m getting more of these for the family.</li>
            <li>but glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly satisfied with this product from the moment I saw it</li>
            <li>The case is ingenious and I love that I can charge it from my computer.</li>
            <li>Mine lasted about 10 more months and</li>

            <li>While better than a manual brush.</li>
            <li>I feel like they could be so much better.  </li>
            <li>It takes more than 12 hours to fully charge the brush when it&#x27;s depleted.  </li>
            <li>more than often.&lt;br /&gt;Combined with Flossing after eating and Arm &amp; Hammer Peroxicare toothpaste&lt;</li>
            <li>The Sonicare just felt like it was doing more by vibrating and</li>
            <li>I really think this product does a great job on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Also, some reviewers/users complain about not being able to select the mode without the toothbrush &#x27;spraying all over.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking forward to many years of satisfaction from my DiamondCare</li>
            <li>It cleans so much better than the toothbrush I was using.</li>
            <li>I am someone who has, no matter how often I brush and floss, always been burdened with many dental problems.</li>
            <li>I also love that this has a pause feature, so you can turn the brush off without it losing it&#x27;s spot in the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Lasted 1 more month than its predecessors.</li>
            <li>This is a really ingenious toothbrush.</li>
            <li>She claimed that she meant it sincerely.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love that I can just plug into my computer.  </li>
            <li>the diamondclean, the handle and tips got even better...</li>
            <li>, otherwise they won&#x27;t send them any more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i guess if you think about it that way, i&#x27;m glad that the sonicare keeps breaking...  </li>
            <li>Today, during my exam, he found ONE pocket of a &#x27;4&#x27; and most of the rest were 1&#x27;s and 2&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare brushes for many years because they have been recommended by my dental hygienist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than my 18 year olds sisters</li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush is so astonishing that I look forward to “brushing.</li>
            <li>Maybe more than you wanted to</li>
            <li>I love the traveling case:&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife and I love this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Durable&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>put the plastic tray on top of the charger then the brush in it</li>
            <li>Also, I LOVE the cup charger.</li>
            <li>I am really glad that I did.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel reinvigorated and healthy.</li>
            <li>but this one has more charging options.</li>
            <li>This model is definitely the best one yet.  </li>
            <li>in all, I love using a Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve chipped my front teeth more than once (not on plastic), and worried the vibrating clack would chip them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so glad my sister had mentioned she was going to replace her dying Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this toothbrush  : )</li>
            <li>But really this brush is great.</li>
            <li>I wish they would have included more heads with this</li>
            <li>Healthy teeth and gums because of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love the charging cup.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a sincere pleasure purchasing and using a product whose manufacture is dedicated to honoring their product warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do love Sonicare toothbrushes, but now I have to buy brush heads for this and brush head for the one my husband has.  </li>
            <li>Tuesday, 7/16/2013 - I went to the dentist for a cleaning and was told that I have to floss more because my gums bleed severely when they&#x27;re doing the cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I will try flossing more</li>
            <li>#34;Hmm, I wonder if a better toothbrush that massages my gums better would help...</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;  So I start looking at the top rated/most featured electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- many cleaning options&lt;</li>
            <li>, I just leave it on for a day to be on the safe side</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems well made - I&#x27;m glad I bought</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m brushing more...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to purchase this fr my dentist for a lower price than on this site.  </li>
            <li>you want to keep your $150+ handle for more than a couple years, consider getting an extended warranty</li>
            <li>I love the USB charging case for times on the road.</li>
            <li>Splurged on the top of the line</li>
            <li>Also, this toothbrush has an extremely elegant look.</li>
            <li>I also love the design of the travelling container/case.</li>
            <li>It allows me to take it on the aircraft with my trips :)</li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Outstanding.  </li>
            <li>love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but otherwise a lovely purchase.</li>
            <li>Braun(oral b) would be a better  choice.</li>
            <li>I love the portable charging case it comes with.</li>
            <li>My dentist and I love this.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I kept using it, not quite able to believe the toothbrush was at fault.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I can see why the dentists love them.</li>
            <li>(Why is that better than just setting it in the charger?)</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon and Phillips for helping to keep my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li>but she claims it&#x27;s better than her Oralcare.</li>
            <li>I tend to brush my teeth often and was able to buy a refill brush set with 6 on Groupon for about $12.</li>
            <li>I should have done that, but I love the way the DiamondClean Toothbrush looks.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I followed through on her recommendation.  </li>
            <li>I am glad we did.  </li>
            <li>This top of line toothbrush died in two years.</li>
            <li>And my check ups are much better.</li>
            <li>Simply the best</li>
            <li>I love, love, love my Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Worked well while the batteries were okay.  </li>
            <li>Might not be a problem for some, but there should be a more intuitive way to choose your default setting instead of hitting a combination of buttons to set it.</li>
            <li>I love the product until after 8 months</li>
            <li>Ok, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I could say that you will get a truthful answer if you ever talk to them</li>
            <li>I would say Philips was very helpful, great customer service if you have your issue escalated to their team.  </li>
            <li>I love this electric tooth brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I could have wreaked havok with it when the plane was in the air</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s here somewhere</li>
            <li>like that I can just toss the brush into a glass and it charges without plugging in, and the design is so much more than any one person needs in a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It does it all and more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO glad I was finally able to get it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>I love the design as well.  </li>
            <li>Nothing cleans teeth better.</li>
            <li>elegant design.&lt;br /&gt;-Cool</li>
            <li>for a toothbrush, it does work a lot better than the others</li>
            <li>The diamonclean is the highest end Philips has - if I was going to go with it, I was getting the top end product, but that&#x27;s me.</li>
            <li>I still love the brush and so does my dentist.</li>
            <li>but I thought given the price and the Phillips name that I could expect more, but I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle is nice and sleek the white setting brush mode is incredible</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using an electric toothbrush for ten years, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Lasting 11 years is quite impressive for anything.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more technological purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;glass&amp;#34; charger.</li>
            <li>how much better this thing is than a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Many cleaning modes</li>
            <li>love the glass charging solution.</li>
            <li>and it sort of seemed better.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush from Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Great job.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush magically charges in the case, even though nothing is plugged into the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Given the price, I hope to use this toothbrush for many years.  </li>
            <li>I truly enjoyed it while it lasted, but I can&#x27;t bring myself to ever purchase another one of these.</li>
            <li>I love the timed intervals depending on which setting you pick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that will change.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>my gum just getting better and better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda magic for me.</li>
            <li>b/c it makes sure you reach every part of your mouth and not just the front teeth.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I had read that most people didn&#x27;t notice a difference between sonic and non-sonic variety, so I opted for an Oral B electric (rotating-head) brush.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>the replacement heads just buzz off the top.</li>
            <li>Love it so much!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>Ignore most of the five star review hype that you read about this brush (\\&quot;Cleanest Teeth EVER!\\&quot;) and focus on these facts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: The longer you use a product, the better you get to know it.</li>
            <li>: The longer you use a product, the better you get to know it.</li>
            <li>The timing of this gift was awesome as it was the perfect stocking stuff for Xmas, I am just not sure if it was not a selfish gift.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>Love the tooth brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for 7 years now and DiamondClean is the latest in the family of rechargeable electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had problems with the bottom of the toothbrush yellowing from water dripping from the top after usage.</li>
            <li>I love the DiamondClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I want to quantify my 3 star review of the Sonicare by saying I love this toothbrush and the sonicare brand of toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the toothbrush, but at $175 price point, I wouldn&#x27;t call it a</li>
            <li>I sincerely couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It looks like a glass tumbler, yet through the magic of electromagnetic induction it charges the toothbrush just by putting it in the glass tumbler.  </li>
            <li>But I am not at all pleased with Sonicare reliability.  </li>
            <li>love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but i am glad i did.</li>
            <li>The unit itself is stunning.</li>
            <li>With three great-looking, streamlined ways of storing your DiamondClean (case, glass, or stand), what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself works wonderfully and has numerous settings.</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to brushing my teeth because of how wonderful my teeth feel when finished.  </li>
            <li>but really does a great job vibrating the plaque off.</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied that I want to recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the cleaning power and multiple modes</li>
            <li>So I did some aggressive research and went with the top of the line Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>And I am sure</li>
            <li>I love how well it cleans</li>
            <li>This one is even better.  </li>
            <li>I love the diff options on the brush.  </li>
            <li>Excellent toothbrush, actually does what it promises.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>However, this is simply the best toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Overall, an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums have never felt better.</li>
            <li>Consumers lose: more money for them.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li>i love it.  </li>
            <li>Love that it inclues &#x27;gum care&#x27;  </li>
            <li>If I decide that Sonicare is still the best brush for cleaning, I&#x27;ll buy a different model.</li>
            <li>At $200+ retail you should be getting a product that is better constructed and functions well.</li>
            <li>What more do you want from a toothbrush?</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I doubt that many people will be plugging this into their laptops while on the plane to recharge their toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>do love the travel case that plugs in.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was definitely the perfect purchase for me.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love the design and feel of the brush.</li>
            <li>Love the design.</li>
            <li>becasue it advertises that removes up to 5x more plaque.</li>
            <li>I have always used the \\&quot;best\\&quot; and most \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; Oral B brushes.  </li>
            <li>Love how the lights show up whenever you push the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Outstanding quality and workmanship in every detail.</li>
            <li>It is a great brush, works like it should, feels good in your hand and the indicators in the handle are terrific.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to register the replacement online just in case.</li>
            <li>dentist tells me my teeth are in better shape than before,</li>
            <li>Recommend buying if you want a fantastic toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I love the beeping feature that tells you</li>
            <li>read the reports that say sonicares are better</li>
            <li>, I read the reports saying oral b brushes are better, and the reports that say any electric brush is better than manual.</li>
            <li>A worry more than a con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m assuming most usb chargers with mini plugs.</li>
            <li>So I just had to go to a setting with more time on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 5 more seconds of your time</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m assuming most usb chargers with mini plugs.</li>
            <li>So I just had to go to a setting with more time on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 5 more seconds of your time</li>
            <li>Anyone who paid $200.00 for a brush should expect a better quality.  </li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>I have used a Philips Sonicare for years but thought I would like the newer one even better.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush  my teeth love it to my mouth</li>
            <li>they look whiter and my check will be better than the pass ones.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Love the timer.</li>
            <li>Love love love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>has the most difference to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I love this.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is outstanding.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended it and noted that my periodic checkups were better (vs. manual brushing).</li>
            <li>So stylish looking sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li>My dentist says my teeth and gums are noticeably better.</li>
            <li>Love this, so does my dentist.</li>
            <li>The handle, glass charging station, and travel case are elegant and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Not being entirely satisfied with the Braun I decided to try out the DiamondClean.</li>
            <li>so well you will be pleased you bought it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>if you do not get the answer you like, ask for a better answer.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But frankly theirs way too many of them.</li>
            <li>I love that you can charge it in the case via USB.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough, one of the best toothbrushes I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>You may be able to get it cheaper through your dentist :)</li>
            <li>well made case - with well designed texture for gripping when wet.&lt;br /&gt;Holds</li>
            <li>, just ads more cleaning work.</li>
            <li>I had also heard that Sonicare did a better job at cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>Also, you can&#x27;t turn off the toothbrush on one click most of the time.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ask for a better response than that.</li>
            <li>I am glad that the purchase was made.</li>
            <li>, my gums feel better and my teeth feel clean....and</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>The glass charger is cute, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>it(not knowing it was the top model at the time).</li>
            <li>After using oral b for over 12 years they could not believe how much better their mouths felt after using the sonicare diamond</li>
            <li>I personally love the glass.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of counter space and the ability to just set it in the cup to chargeand not have to make sure</li>
            <li>but you have a better chance of keeping the water flowing from your faucet by blocking it with your finger.</li>
            <li>Teeth are whiter, feel cleaner and look better.</li>
            <li>I have had this for more than two years and the cost of the replacement heads does add up.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>My experience (and yours may of course vary) was that this was an excellent toothbrush provided one did not expect it to last more than a year.</li>
            <li>and I love the cup charger.</li>
            <li>They were recommended by my Dentist and definitely do a better job of cleaning your teeth and reducing plaque.</li>
            <li>love the feeling of polish teeth, without too uch work or having to hurt your gums you know?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would love to see a better power cord.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It has thinner better shape.</li>
            <li>I read those reviews about the look &amp; functionality of this model, and after 4 months using this I agree with most of those who said this is an &amp;#34;apple&amp;#34; type toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s part of it.  </li>
            <li>the different modes are a plus, and the 3 week battery life is superb.</li>
            <li>SATISFIED SO FAR&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS MODEL.</li>
            <li>and I love the way oil feels in hair..</li>
            <li>I love it and so does my dentist.</li>
            <li>It you do want to switch, you need to push the power button to turn on the brush, count the number of pushed required to get to the mode you want and push that many times.</li>
            <li>All the different settings are great!</li>
            <li>Love the travel case.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>i love it...</li>
            <li>i love the charger.</li>
            <li>I have been using philips sonicare for many years now and nothing compares.  </li>
            <li>knew my teeth felt cleaner, and I thought they looked brighter, but thought perhaps it was my imagination; however, when I got home, my husband commented on how bright my smile was.  </li>
            <li>He hadn&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush for decades, and thought they were not any better than brushing by hand.  </li>
            <li>Love the travel case.</li>
            <li>Many wonder if it works on 220-240 Voltage, and yes it works (also on 110 V, USA).</li>
            <li>I have owned 4 different soniccare brushes and this one is the best</li>
            <li>and boy am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>also love the beeps that prompt you to move to another quadrant</li>
            <li>I also love all the charging options.  </li>
            <li>This is truly an amazing machine that removes plaque and leaves your teeth smooth and shining.  </li>
            <li>The brush seems stiffer too - I like it better for those reasons.  </li>
            <li>So glad I bought this</li>
            <li>I thought I would like this better than the Oral-B toothbrushes, but I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>All family use it and everybody love it.</li>
            <li>unless the toothbrush is on.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, love the glass, charger and travel charger along with 3 week charge.</li>
            <li>design look nice and feel quality and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Love love love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed, both with this product&#x27;s obvious quality as well as its operation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just learning to use it, but I love it.</li>
            <li>I like it better each day</li>
            <li>I HAVE HAD BETTER CHECKUPS, CLEANINGS AT MY DENTIST SINCE USING THIS BURSH.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for over a year now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, and plan to buy it as a gift for my mom and mother- inlaw.</li>
            <li>promise you will love it like me and</li>
            <li>I will let you know more after using it for some time.</li>
            <li>My hygenist suggested I invest in a GOOD toothbrush and get the Phillips Sonicare &amp; said it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>The Waterpic is actually a better tool than ANY toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The Travel case is awesome and looks very stylish and great size, the glass charger is also a great feature i travel a lot reason i spent a little more and got this one.</li>
            <li>The travel case is definitely a good part of the decision because it will allow for very effective recharging while on the road with the same amount of storage.</li>
            <li>It has superior cleaning power and gets between teeth, right where I need it, to tackle those pesky coffee stains.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush has a very sleek design - it looks very nice in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>When the rep came on, she was very nice and very helpful.  </li>
            <li>It gets your teeth beyond clean and removes tartar most effectively.  </li>
            <li>(I think I only used it for 4 months and it is not plugged in most of the time!!!).</li>
            <li>Very powerful, has whitened my teeth !</li>
            <li>and I am glad I didn&#x27;t - high quality and the charging in the cup or USB case work great.</li>
            <li>Amazing Clean</li>
            <li>A friend told me how amazing his was and the level of clean.  </li>
            <li>Had an older model that was great.</li>
            <li>I loving it, i never feel clean like this</li>
            <li>/&gt;she says her teeth feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li>This is the most powerful toothbrush ever...can&#x27;t wait to get back to dentist to see what they think, but my teeth and gums are happy happy</li>
            <li>Our teeth feel so much more clean now!</li>
            <li>Congrats Philips on addressing so many improvements in this great new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>A great product and this new one is even better.</li>
            <li>I love the timed brushing, I love the travel case and easy charging.</li>
            <li>--you get a better brush mechanism and the very cool charging glass as well.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean and my mouth refreshed .</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does get my teeth very clean, and I like the charging tumbler and travel case.</li>
            <li>It does make your teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean after usage and can notice they are whiter.  </li>
            <li>and I loved my first one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good brush, nut the price is pretty steep.</li>
            <li>The sleek look and the cool charging options make this Sonicare a pleasure to own and use.</li>
            <li>I picked this model after a long market research and I am very happy.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner, the hygienist doesn&#x27;t need as long for cleanings, and my dentist says my teeth are in the best shape in years.</li>
            <li>I think I brush my teeth with it best while in the shower because I am not trying to be careful to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen, so I can focus on cleaning my teeth more.</li>
            <li>I decided that was a sign to try the new Sonicare, and I&#x27;m very glad I did!</li>
            <li>The design is quite contemporary and the  unit cleans up very nicely after brushing.</li>
            <li>(I feel my teeth are completely clean after each brush), a good 3 week battery life, and cool chargeable traveling bag for the brush.</li>
            <li>Sonicare brushes, and this brush is no exception, isn&#x27;t as good at removing stains as touted, and the implication that it can clean in between teeth because it sends &amp;#34;sonic waves of cleaning&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t hold true.  </li>
            <li>the most important thing that swung me to buy this is that my dental hygienist (who I trust and respect very much) said this was the best Sonicare ever and would really improve my tooth and gum health.</li>
            <li>Since then I have been extremely pleased with it as it is easy to operate and always makes my teeth feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, the unit is more attractive than any other brush I&#x27;ve seen; it just looks good on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In just a fee weeks i saw impressive results, my teeth had never felt cleaner and they are getting even whiter, the gum option is perfect for a much necessary massage every other day.</li>
            <li>Worth EVERY... PENNY!!</li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush with new improved brushing features.  </li>
            <li>And, boy do your teeth feel great after brushing, while the vibration is not too strong like it is on some of the older Sonicare models.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I paid a bit more for this model and the fact is I am happy I did not settle for the old models like some of the reviews</li>
            <li>&amp; I was extremely pleased at how easy it was.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, until there is more conclusive evidence, everyone should use the brush that they find most comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with the whole thing and really like brushing my teeth again since the tooth brush does all of the work and the brush tells you when to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li>no frills kind of model that feels great in your hand and is built to last.</li>
            <li>, a UV Sanitizer would be perfect, and perhaps they&#x27;ll bring back the standalone sanitizer that was once available.  </li>
            <li>It looks great and the charging case is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>No, it did not meet my expectation though it works good and gives good result, but its battery life is short.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>since it is glass it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>when you do go after 8-12 months, your teeth will show up 2x cleaner than manual brushing and showing up every 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw - very easy to clean and charge.  </li>
            <li>Works great and makes his teeth feel like a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth very effectively and much better than my old Braun toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>beautifully&lt;br /&gt;-AMAZING clean!  </li>
            <li>beautifully&lt;br /&gt;-AMAZING clean!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about a month now and everytime I use this brush my mouth truly feels dentist clean!</li>
            <li>even my dentist is amazed with how clean my teeth are!</li>
            <li>Teeth feel so clean and dual voltage is a plus for traveling!</li>
            <li>Awesome toothbrush cleans 100 times better than any other power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things: easy to use, easy to clean, and the cup holder is actually attractive on a sink.  </li>
            <li>Awesome clean big improvement on the Braun option.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Internal characteristics: the sonicare diamondclean is fantastic while brushing the teeth, by the time you finish your brushing, you feel and see your teeth being so clean and nice that you cannot believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although this Diamondclean model looks very cool and appears to have a nicer brush head</li>
            <li>The teethbrush itself is very good, but I only use it abot three month, suddunly</li>
            <li>It cleans very good, my teeth are white.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use (I never had used an electric one) and so easy to clean after use.</li>
            <li>Form factor is kind of slippery, looks really cool, but need a good grip as apposed to the older models which had rubber handles.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using the Sonocare as it seems to do a better job caring for my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important aspect of the DiamondClean system is how well it works in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Love the glass charger and all the available settings.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly it makes my teeth feel cleaner</li>
            <li>I like the tooth brush and so far my experience with customer services has been great.</li>
            <li>It cleans better than any electric toothbrush available.  </li>
            <li>whole different kind of tooth brushing, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>The design is elegant and thoughtful.</li>
            <li>The $7 cheap powered toothbrushes on the market have replaceable batteries and therefore are a much better buy.</li>
            <li>So far I have been happy I ordered this product.</li>
            <li>wow great product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an annoyance for basically the most advanced consumer toothbrush in the history of the planet of Earth.</li>
            <li>But cheap plastic from top to bottom?  </li>
            <li>I also love that this brush does such a wonderful job of removing plaque, I rarely have to use my plaque scraper now.</li>
            <li>The most distinctive feature is that the brush makes a sound every thirty seconds to remind you to switch to another quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>so it is much more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>More importantly perhaps, after a week or two you can observe a noticeable difference --</li>
            <li>course, the most important thing is how it works.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s fabulous and cleans better than any toothbrush I used.  </li>
            <li>I chose to use the charging stand over the glass as it fit better in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>Good design, cleans really well.</li>
            <li>the FlexCare Plus really worked or just made me feel good.  </li>
            <li>Way too much money to spend and not get a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>I loved mine so much that I bought my husband one for Christmas this year.  </li>
            <li>Bought my wife one and loved it so much that bought myself one.</li>
            <li>If you are ready to invest in a good electric toothbrush I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li>It is also very nicely designed and the appearance is clean &amp; modern.</li>
            <li>I have been using electric toothbrushes for more than 10 years and this thing is hands down the best one on the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving my first Sonicare, it&#x27;s gorgeous looking, easy to use and leave my teeth super clean.  </li>
            <li>The glass to hold the unit is EASY to clean and it never falls off or out of it!  </li>
            <li>New charger is awesome, I&#x27;ve used sonicare for years and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is great product I purchased for my wife this past Christmas , she uses it every day and is the best electric tooth brush she has ever own , and she has used many different models for over 20 years .</li>
            <li>So far I love the toothbrush!!  </li>
            <li>The DiamondClean brush heads are also very nice and professional looking.</li>
            <li>Also, their customer service is not the most friendly and they will try to trick you into admitting fault so they can immediately deny a replacement and void your warranty.</li>
            <li>Also, their customer service is not the most friendly and they will try to trick you into admitting fault so they can immediately deny a replacement and void your warranty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than my original one.  </li>
            <li>I have used other name brand electric toothbrushes over the years but the diamondclean sonicare electric toothbrush is the best.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my best purchases of the year (the other being the Nutribullet).</li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>but I can tell even though my head is new on my older brush that this tooth brush is awesome!!!</li>
            <li>DO NOT deactivate the 14 day Easy Start feature.  </li>
            <li>I love how clean my teeth feel after,</li>
            <li>but I was now using the top of line PS Diamond Clean.  </li>
            <li>I have been wanting to try an electric toothbrush for quite sometime, and my dental hygenist does recommend the Philips Sonicare, but I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend that kind of money without really knowing how well they worked.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>After getting used to that, I found it quite easy to use</li>
            <li>Like the diamond clean I was using the top of the line</li>
            <li>I think maybe some reviewers did not deactivate the \\&quot;easy start\\&quot; feature that comes as a factory default.</li>
            <li>love the sense of clean after use.</li>
            <li>It does not appear to clean my teeth any better.</li>
            <li>Everything about the diamond clean is top notch</li>
            <li>The brushes are easy to change...just push on and pull off..no need to twist.</li>
            <li>The brush portion easily pops off for changing, or for travel use, or for disinfecting.      </li>
            <li>I have had two Sonicare diamond clean tooth brushes and I love them.  </li>
            <li>I find that the brush is easy to handle and like the feel of the material in my hands.</li>
            <li>If dropped on its head, it may break easily</li>
            <li>I have no idea if it is safe to clean your jewelry with this toothbrush, but it works.  </li>
            <li>It seems alot more powerful and my teeth feel &amp; look better.</li>
            <li>I like this product because help to mantein more clean and health my teeths and gums.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to charge via USB</li>
            <li>Better yet, they stay feeling clean for hours after using.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that easy.</li>

            <li>It is easy to hold, even when it is vibrating.  </li>
            <li>Brush heads attach and remove easily.  </li>
            <li>This brush is much more powerful and feels like a tool that the dentist would use rather than one I would be able to use at home.  </li>
            <li>The section below contains more on the pros and cons I&#x27;ve experienced since I wrote the above review after extended use of the DiamondClean:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The section below contains more on the pros and cons I&#x27;ve experienced since I wrote the above review after extended use of the DiamondClean:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is easy to handle and operate.  </li>
            <li>It does a phenomenal job and always leaves my teeth exceptionally clean.  </li>
            <li>You either have to turn it on and have water/toothpaste to splash everywhere, or put it in your mouth and cycle through while trying to look in a mirror(not easy).  </li>
            <li>Easy to rinse off after brushing.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>I love the Diamond clean brushes that come with it.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s easy to brush my teeth for two minutes.  </li>
            <li>worth the price - great options to charge and very reliable.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush,one charge will last me 10 days, my gums are in better condition so says my hygieneist.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this brush is lighter l has a square shaped handle, and is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>The programable power feature is easy to use and the battery life is excelllent.</li>
            <li>It has a matt, eggshell-like finish and is easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li>love the clean design of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Easy and convient to travel with and charge.</li>
            <li>I love the sensation of this toothbrush as I clean</li>
            <li>LOVE my sonicare toothbrush....very sleek and clean, brushes well, and notifies you when it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li>Easy to have it</li>
            <li>I must say, however, that the Oral B does seem to clean a bit better, although I didn&#x27;t often use it because it felt rather rough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe the button should be on the bottom where your hands wont hit it so easily.</li>
            <li>Love it except that you can&#x27;t see the options (clean, massage gums etc.)</li>
            <li>after getting the tooth brush I didn&#x27;t quite understand all the gripes since everything was self explanatory and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy and convient to charge and transport.</li>
            <li>The vibration was also strong.  </li>
            <li>It was fully charged on arrival and is still going strong after one week.</li>
            <li>my skin has a strong tendency towards redness and irritation.</li>
            <li>The adjustable settings allow you to choose how strong you want the vibration.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older E series that I had for a good 8 years.  </li>
            <li>I am concerned about my gums as I get older and from what I read the Sonicare is superior for preventing gum disease.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one of the older Sonicare products and loved it.</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare DiamondClean is by far the most superior brush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The one I&#x27;m replacing has been going strong for about 3 years now</li>
            <li>she strongly suggests&lt;br /&gt;adhering</li>
            <li>It took a while to get use to how strong it was</li>
            <li>and I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>If you turn this on and after about a min press the main button it will turn off... which is good.  </li>
            <li>As for the brush head, I find the DimondClean superior to the older ProResults syle.</li>
            <li>find myself brushing much more frequently , which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>, I strongly suggest it to anyone.</li>
            <li>and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Very easy to charge and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>My dentist is impressed with how much I have improved my oral health and how pink and healthy my gums are!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a surprisingly good tooth brush, i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>If you get one, be sure to thoroughly check your right away!</li>
            <li>This model is very nice and looks to be made better than the last model.  </li>
            <li>It looks amazing, very clean modern design.  </li>
            <li>: This is a pretty amazing creation.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and this works wonderfully without making my teeth feel more sensitive.</li>
            <li>Over the course of a month there has been a marked and remarkable improvement in the health of my gums and mouth, and my teeth do seem to even look whiter and healthier.</li>
            <li>I really liked this toothbrush for the first 6 months or so.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful, well-designed, relatively quiet electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I did notice that the awesome compact heads will fit other Philips toothbrushes so that may be a solution.</li>
            <li>its beautiful and still makes me feel like i have just left the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty nice brush otherwise.</li>
            <li>Exact kind of tooth brush I wanted.</li>
            <li>With online registration, they do push the warranty to 2.5 years, which is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>With online registration, they do push the warranty to 2.5 years, which is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>When the price for this item comes down about $50, I think it&#x27;ll be the best Sonicare option on the market.</li>
            <li>I love that clean smooth feeling after brushing.  </li>
            <li>well you clean your teeth is more important than how often you brush them.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months and my teeth have never felt so completely clean and smooth and my gums so healthy, with no bleeding at all, ever--and my gums sort of tingle for quite a while after brushing.  </li>
            <li>The best tooth brush hands down I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried all of the settings but the sensitive, clean, and polish settings are great.</li>
            <li>As one of a fairly significant number of folks who are susceptible to gagging when brushing their teeth, I had pretty high hopes that this toothbrush might be an ideal solution for me.</li>
            <li>Usage tests have shown that high speed brush movement is most effective for plaque control.  </li>
            <li>Diamondclean is definitely much more powerful than the Flexcare, noticeably more powerful!</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend the diamond clean for either an upgrade or first timer, you will not find better!  </li>
            <li>the tooth brush and my teeth feel incredibally clean, I get excited to brush my teeth!</li>
            <li>Easy programming, and the USB powered travel case is a huge hit.  </li>
            <li>Everywhere else it charged fine</li>
            <li>Finely engineered precision instrument.</li>
            <li>The travel case is plugged into my DVR box and it charges fine.</li>
            <li>The bottom is recessed and smooth and easily wiped</li>
            <li>as typical, Sonicare is the best mouth hygiene device,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>and my teeth are doing just fine.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re trying the competitors brush now and for less money, it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li>You know you&#x27;re paying for the design, and you&#x27;re fine with it.</li>
            <li>but after a week you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Fine, but you need to put the toothpaste on the toothbrush and put it in your mouth before you start using it.</li>
            <li>and I travel just fine with both.  </li>
            <li>That works fine</li>
            <li>It starts vibrating as soon as you push the button, and if it&#x27;s not in your mouth, you&#x27;re going to shower your face and bathroom with a fine mist of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I purchased this unit and it worked fine for 2 1/2 years</li>
            <li>Luckily, I had registered my unit and they replaced it with no questions asked!  </li>
            <li>For almost $200, a freaking toothbrush shouldn&#x27;t die so quickly from something preventable!</li>
            <li>Although I was very happy with this product, it has effectively died after two and a half years.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service says the most they can do is to offer a coupon for 10% to 15% off a  new unit.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth (and gums) clean and they FEEL clean!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;overall if you can get a good deal I would recommend but even if not its a very sharp product good job Phillips</li>
            <li>What first caught my attention is the toothbrush design, modern and very nice to look at.</li>
            <li>Update, they send me a brand new unit after I called Philips, and a prepaid waybill inside the box as well, how great is that, much better customer service than Oral B, thanks Philips</li>
            <li>Quite, great design, thought through travel case, easy charging, glass cradle, various charging options, light.</li>
            <li>after using the sonicare flex plus i ordered this for my wife and she absolutely loves it, this diamond clean is outstanding she loves it and have teeth feel like when she comes from the dentist nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Perfect, it takes a little getting accustomed to</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very satisfied and would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>It was in funny packaging, but works great, keeps my teeth happy and clean, and ended up costing about $75 less than I could find elsewhere!  </li>
            <li>Probably not, Sonicare&#x27;s own website states you get a 44% better clean using the new DiamondClean heads, so</li>
            <li>Light weight, looks great, and multiple ways to charge.</li>
            <li>so much better than oral b.  much longer battery life but even more importantly the cleaning experience is far superior.  </li>
            <li>Clean and comfortable, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li>Fantastic toothbrush with a great travel pack and recharge system, offering several ways to charge the brush.</li>
            <li>the fact thst you can charge with USB is also a huge plus.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, in terms of cleaning my teeth, I don&#x27;t think that this toothbrush is significantly better than my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I figured maybe they got them free for allowing advertising material to be placed in the office.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great only the serial number on the bottom of toothbrush is not valid when I try to register it.  </li>
            <li>The sellers buy them CHEAP and triple the price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush for my mother-in-law because she has a fantastic stank breath.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s still a great functioning sonic toothbrush --</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with the results I get.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; function is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Even though I got this for free for taking part of the Vine Program, I will never, ever be without a Sonicare again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The travel case is fantastic, but when it comes to charging it has some issues.</li>
            <li>Overall this is the sonicare quality, and a great brush.</li>
            <li>Way more powerful.</li>
            <li>This is great because now I can see I have not been taking enough time to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>From the picture, you can see the charging light is not on for the replacement brush.</li>
            <li>The 30 second interval timer is great as I like to zone out while brushing</li>
            <li>I am rarely finished at that point, so I have to take the toothbrush out of my mouth, put my glasses on to make sure I&#x27;m activating the correct brushing mode, and then start the cycle over.</li>
            <li>but mostly it&#x27;s EASY TO CLEAN.</li>
            <li>and you will enjoy the feel of it.  </li>
            <li>And, not only does this thing do a great job, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to replace this unit with another one and try it since I keep hearing such great things about them.</li>
            <li>Initially I was quite impressed with how well it cleaned, much better than my old Oral B.  </li>
            <li>and I could use it comfortably.</li>
            <li>It has the fit and finish of, say,  an eyeglass case.</li>
            <li>It has the fit and finish of, say,  an eyeglass case.</li>
            <li>the induction charger is nice, and the travel case (which is also a charger) is also very well made.</li>
            <li>The ability to recharage the shaver thru a USB port is a great plus as I&#x27;m often travelling and find myself short of electrical outlets.    </li>
            <li>I ended up buying this toothbrush after going to the dentist and finding that I had to have 2 cavities filled.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for my wife&#x27;s Sonicare Diamondclean, as she experienced the same issue.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great considering the crest 3D white is about $8 a tube.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li>multiple brushing modes are great, but the one-button interface is counter-intuitive and even after months of use</li>
            <li>I have to note that I got this one free through the Amazon VINE program.</li>
            <li>She said to me, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m happy you&#x27;re a physician.&amp;#34; In response, I said that the only reason I was mentioning I was a physician is that Philips is a healthcare company that has separate groups for physicians and consumers.</li>
            <li>Also after engaging this Sonicare my head must be over the sink as the RPM causes me to drool.</li>
            <li>I find the pulse of the timer when it&#x27;s time to switch zones is extremely useful at making sure I&#x27;m brushing evenly, also.</li>
            <li>Everything is smooth and designed well, also feels sturdy in the hand (not plastic-y).  </li>
            <li>Fortunately the travel case also functions as a charger, and I use it at home.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I think the carrying case is the most useful for me.  </li>
            <li>Overall experience was great.</li>
            <li>Cleans my teeth thoroughly and adds a lovely shine to my smile.  </li>
            <li>get it love it and smile because of it</li>
            <li>easy to use and really clean</li>
            <li>I like the smooth handle.</li>
            <li>I was advised not to buy a cheap one</li>
            <li>I use the smaller head toothbrush and is works great.</li>
            <li>Has a USB travel charger, but I pack light and leave the Sonicare at home, so no use for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>However the handle is so sleek and smooth</li>
            <li>I may not used every setting but they are available if I so choose.  </li>
            <li>Get it when there is a coupon or sale available, and that will help with the price.</li>
            <li>Light appears when charging necessary&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a cheap sort of person</li>
            <li>This Sonicare toothbrush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>i would feel comfortable brushing my teeth when my partner is asleep.  </li>
            <li>I am normally a cheap person but</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and the charger is glass so also easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>It works well for me and the brush head is secure.</li>
            <li>so I decided to give it a try when I saw this product available.</li>
            <li>These newer style look light</li>
            <li>Not to mention the UV doesn&#x27;t seem like it would have an effect in crevices where the light doesn&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li>Dental care is highly important to me, that&#x27;s why I decided to make this investment.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;Charging&amp;#34; light starts pulsating.  </li>
            <li>Design just isn&#x27;t that important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>value of great design is very much a personal decision.</li>
            <li>Design just isn&#x27;t that important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>value of great design is very much a personal decision.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush head does not attach securely.</li>
            <li>I tried with both of the toothbrush heads that come with the toothbrush and neither of them attaches securely.</li>
            <li>sleek and nice in touch, and with the power button changing modes it is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The contrast between my trusty old Oral B and my bright and shiny, streamlined Sonicare is the difference between a Model-T and  Ferrari.</li>
            <li>enjoy the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Inability to change the settings without turning it on is annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a brush, it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is a great toothbrush but it works the same as the lower models.  </li>
            <li>It is incredibly easy to use, and leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Fantastic travel package too for those who travel.  </li>
            <li>The product performs great, getting that &amp;#34;like the dentist&#x27;s cleaning&amp;#34; feel I would not have believed was possible before trying the product.  </li>
            <li>I reviewed each available and this one stood out to me.  </li>
            <li>and honestly I wasn&#x27;t putting in all that much</li>
            <li>(light massage)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great having a glass in the bathroom for that last minute drink of water before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I get that same great feeling as I do when I get a cleaning at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I really do enjoy brushing my teeth now.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>it gradually gets more powerful with each of the 1st 14 sessions that are 1+ min of the toothbrush being on.</li>
            <li>The cleaning options light up when you hit the on button, or when you take it off the charger.</li>
            <li>The thing makes a humming sound but stopped vibrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sturdy and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So to the pros, cons, and important stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Handle is relatively light in weight.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s that sound?</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve had no problems with it, and the system in total has been great.</li>
            <li>the cleaning in combination with the brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Even though it is plastic, it doesn&#x27;t feel like cheap plastic at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the light was flashing meaning it was still charging but wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  </li>
            <li>This is a great personal care item.  </li>
            <li>but this one is way more powerful.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>these things aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>During the summer I enjoy going camping.</li>
            <li>My dentist once told me that teeth are supposed to be smooth like porcelain</li>
            <li>The case with the USB charge is thoughtful design element.</li>
            <li>The updates are thoughtful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It is an absolutely fabulous toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I reported it to Amazon within the 30 day period and so am getting a refund.</li>
            <li>I had the earlier version of the sonicare brush and it was great until i broke it.</li>
            <li>the only one I am proud of having in my bathroom</li>
            <li>/&gt;This model is more aggressive / powerful than the Flexcare - I don&#x27;t know how it compares to the Flexcare+.</li>
            <li>I never used it that much, but liked having it integrated into the charger</li>
            <li>She was not amused at my offer to re-label some of the available modes to those.  </li>
            <li>I use it as my primary toothbrush and it travels quite well.</li>
            <li>If a toothbrush has to be technologically advanced, it better prove to me that it&#x27;s worth the price and the change in style.  </li>
            <li>so I returned it and got this much sleeker stylish model and couldn&#x27;t be more</li>
            <li>I had an Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush before this and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning power of this brush is superior by far.</li>
            <li>The handle is smooth but matte (not slippery), and I love love love the charging station (using either the glass cup or a more traditional stand-up attachment that comes with it).</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Essence: good basic brush, not as many strokes per minute.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was livid, and told the rep that I didn&#x27;t think it was fair to have one DOA, spend nearly $200 on a toothbrush and to wait 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I loved my old Sonicare</li>
            <li>The instrumental is wonderful in how it slowly but surely is helping my problem.</li>
            <li>love it soooooooo much and already recommend it to most of my friends and now recommend to you</li>
            <li>It is high quality, easy to clean, has a nice feel, and is easy to change heads.  </li>
            <li>The compact head seems the right size, and so far everything is holding up great.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the new model.</li>
            <li>New charger very elegant, new travel case also very elegant.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just get this out of the way right up front: this latest incarnation of the Philips Sonicare toothbrush is quite pricey.</li>
            <li>And yes, all the studies are right, you do spend more time cleaning with an electrical, which is counter intuitive, because you are systematically trying to cover every surface of every tooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The cup doesn&#x27;t always charge right, so you have to make sure that it&#x27;s charging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>out yet I have used other Sonicare toothbrushes that were very good</li>
            <li>Yes, the toothbrush itself is very effective and the travel case with the built in charger is totally clutch.....</li>
            <li>This unit can be charged three different ways, very handy for travel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes for many years, most recently with the Oral-B 3D line, which I thought was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Despite running on battery, it is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>The white design is also very nice.</li>
            <li>A well designed, very powerful toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I realized that there is a very distinct difference in how aggressive they vibrate.</li>
            <li>It is VERY powerful, so it did take some getting used to.</li>
            <li>Great product will tell all my friends how white and clean it gets your teeth.</li>
            <li>It has a lot of different modes that ensure a great clean.</li>
            <li>, I only use 2 of the settings, clean and whitening, and haven&#x27;t used the others, but who cares, these 2 settings are great.  </li>
            <li>Makes my entire mouth feel clean great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of studies available that support one type of power brush technology versus another, but nothing is clinically significant.</li>
            <li>Father-in-Law also purchased one of these after seeing how awesome it was during the first few months, and I told him he better not drop it.  </li>
            <li>I would definetly recomment this brush to everyone who wants to have healthy gums and clean teeth!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush was without a doubt worth every penny, I never thought I&#x27;d ever be this excited about brushing my teeth or find myself writing a product review for a toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Been using this for almost a year now and by dentist and dental hygienist have said it&#x27;s made a huge difference in keeping my teeth and gum clean.</li>
            <li>The first one I had worked great until it was about a year old</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>I felt like my teeth weren&#x27;t getting as clean with the manual toothbrush, but she confirmed it.</li>
            <li>is in the correct way is fantastic, besides, who doesn&#x27;t like to rinse after they clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel as smooth and clean as just having been to the dentist.</li>
            <li>nice as the bells and whistles are, the main thing is how it cleans, and at this it excels unlike any toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is a wise investment to prevent plaque build up and cavities that cost more in the long run.  </li>
            <li>The travel case and USB charger make traveling with this super convenient and easy.</li>
            <li>; when you spend a decent amount on the item, you would assume there is an honest answer of when you would receive your replacement item under warrant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was initially very pleased with this product as my first review shows; but then ... At almost exactly one year from purchase, the battery died.</li>
            <li>This is my first kind, so I cannot compare with others, but all I can say is it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>The order process via Amazon was quick, easy, and reliable as always.</li>
            <li>I own an older model of the Sonicare</li>
            <li>Also, amazon offers warranties by square trade which I believe are very good, but then after spending this much for a toothbrush, do you really want to spend more to warranty a toothbrush?</li>
            <li>Great brush to replace the old one, very powerful and it charges very fast&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful and my teeth are super clean !</li>
            <li>So, I love the way this toothbrush looks, the charging station is cool and fun, and being able to charge by USB is actually pretty darned useful.&lt;br /&gt;However, the one thing, and</li>
            <li>The glass and plastic stand that are included to hold the toothbrush in the bathroom are both high quality, and the toothbrush itself has a nice heft.</li>
            <li>easily rechargeable through either the main unit (which is no touch charging by the way) or the travel pack which can be hooked up to a laptop usb outlet!!!</li>
            <li>probably wouldn&#x27;t have upgraded from one of the regular sonicare products to this, but as a new customer for the rechargeable products, it seems like the best brush on the market.</li>
            <li>It holds the charge for the whole week easily when brushing three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;This brush has many brushing options.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple of different sonic toothbrushes and this one is the best by far!</li>
            <li>For example, the first time I used it I had to click once to turn it on, and then three more times to get to the \\&quot;Gum care\\&quot; setting.</li>
            <li>Upon unboxing, I was really impressed with the included accessories (especially the charging travel case, wow!).</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get it to consistently do what I wanted.</li>
            <li>At first it was a bit ticklish but I realized it was because I was so used to the more jarring sensation of the Oral B.</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>(Originally I gave it 3 bc</li>
            <li>Firstly you aren&#x27;t able to select the setting you want until it&#x27;s already on and spraying your bathroom with toothpaste.</li>
            <li>first of all, I love the design and how it works when it is not defective.</li>
            <li>I also have noticed a significant improvement in my gum health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I cannot begin to tell you how excited I am to have this version.</li>
            <li>significantly whiter teeth thought.</li>
            <li>Smile!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>it came with a unique travel case,  </li>
            <li>When I first tried the Sonicare DiamondClean, I thought that even the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; head was tiny, but was pretty impressed by how well this toothbrush cleans.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the investment!</li>
            <li>I love it so much and from now on will never switch to another brand!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes since the original model with the screw-on brush head.  </li>
            <li>Well let me tell you, from the first use I could tell it was much better than the Oral B.  </li>
            <li>* ORIGINAL REVIEW</li>
            <li>I was interested more in function and practical features than I was in design, or the USB charging capabilities.  </li>
            <li>first let me start by saying that i used to love sonicares.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned a sonic toothbrush before, but love my Clarisonic face cleaner so much that I thought I&#x27;d try one out!  </li>
            <li>Amazingly worth the money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare in the past, but this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li>They replace both of them for me within the year of my original purchases.  </li>
            <li>I originally had the E-series, which I bought about 7 years ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m been using them since they came out before Philips bought the original company.</li>
            <li>This is also my first Sonicare with more than two modes.</li>
            <li>Although it was pricy, it was well worth it!</li>
            <li>, this is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I have noticed my teeth significantly healthier and whiter.</li>
            <li>and it definitely does more than brushing alone, I just love this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure my teeth are whiter after using this as well.</li>
            <li>I sincerely couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.here&#x27;s a logical reason for every feature.  </li>
            <li>I also feel like my smile is whiter!  </li>
            <li>The carrying case is cool but you can fit the charger in it</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 5 months now and am still using the original brush head, I haven&#x27;t had to change it yet.  </li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for awhile now, but this was worth the money for the upgrade!</li>
            <li>If you do decide to try this brush I would brush 3 or more x/day for the first 30 days just to see how it is working for you</li>
            <li>teeth aren&#x27;t pretty, but they&#x27;re healthy and I want to keep them.</li>
            <li>success!</li>
            <li>There is an introductory setting that can be turned off if you are familiar with electric toothbrushes or kept on if your aren&#x27;t used to the \\&quot;tickle\\&quot; of the brush.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Well worth my money!</li>
            <li>The charger is pretty interesting as well.</li>
            <li>So, if you can get past the buzz in your mouth, this is the best product for the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it made a significant impact on my dental health.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+ Options backlighting done via LED, making display very bright, but also using less electricity</li>
            <li>For charging it seem really cool that you can just drop the toothbrush in glass without having to make sure it&#x27;s positioned the right way, REALLY cool.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums felt amazingly clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>Charging in the glass it comes with works great and looks a heck of a lot better than the usual charger, plus it&#x27;s not as easy to bump it and tip it over.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare Diamond Clean is definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li>new one is really nice.</li>
            <li>still want to try the Diamond Clean</li>
            <li>My mouth has never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>Once you have gotten used to using a Sonicare toothbrush your teeth never feel quite as clean from manual brushing, because they aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Well I purchased the Philips Sonic Diamond Clean in January &#x27;12.  </li>
            <li>Although I do like the cleaning performance of the Diamond Clean, I am not investing $200 in yet another handset.</li>
            <li>Teeth stay clean (like dentist clean) even after eating meals.</li>
            <li>It charges in the glass, so the handle stays clean and you can stick the glass in the dishwasher.</li>
            <li>The diamond clean makes my teeth feel cleaner than any dental visit I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Every time I use my tooth brush, my mouth and teeth feel and look so clean, just like the moment you leave the dentist chair for a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>Compared to manual and battery powered toothbrushes, this Sonicare leaves your teeth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>Changing from using (rarely) a manual toothbrush to the HealthyWhite was a huge difference, and from the HW to the DiamondClean brush heads made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>The term squeaky clean comes to mind.</li>
            <li>it leaves me with a neat and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>My tooth and gum looks clean,</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t get over how clean her teeth feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m somewhat of a neat freak with my toothbrush and the Diamond Clean</li>
            <li>This keeps my teeth so clean.</li>
            <li>I think it adds an elegant and stylish alternative to the old charging station.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my teeth have ever been so clean.</li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law is a dentist and gave me the Sonicare diamond clean toothbrush for Christmas two years ago.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush that made my mouth fell so clean.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth are after using it.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and decided to purchase the Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 Diamond Clean.  </li>
            <li>I get that clean from the dentist feel every time.</li>
            <li>The Diamond Clean was recommended by my hygienist</li>
            <li>purchased 4 Diamond Clean PHILLIPS SONICARE Electric Toothbrushes (2 in August, 2 in September 2012).  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Diamond Clean for about 6 weeks now</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not always clean how the toothbrush fits in it</li>

            <li>My teeth feel clean</li>
            <li>The brush heads get between teeth - and you can feel the clean.</li>
            <li>Far and above the best electric toothbrush we have ever used.  </li>
            <li>They clean</li>
            <li>he loves the Phillips Sonicare Diamond Clean Rechargeable Electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Bravo Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li>So, I purchased the Flexcare model, which still uses the Diamond Clean brush heads, isn&#x27;t as sleek, but has TWO buttons -- a power button, and a mode-selection button.</li>
            <li>But it leaves your teeth feeling amazingly clean (post-dentist clean even).  </li>
            <li>Easier to keep clean, too.  </li>
            <li>Teeth and mouth feel incredibly clean after using this brush.  </li>
            <li>However my teeth felt so clean, my mouth so relaxed, and</li>
            <li>This is the third Sonicare that I have owned in probabaly 10 years and by far this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean like it should.</li>
            <li>It is a really great electric tooth brush and worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>It is clean and sleek.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s powerful brushing motion, is easy to recharge by placing it in the provided glass cup, and it&#x27;s sleek design stays cleaner than the models I had before.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase the diamond clean because of the travel case and the premium look.  </li>
            <li>I will start by saying that it my Sonicare DiamondClean electric toothbrush does seem to clean well.</li>
            <li>To remedy this, I would remove the head at every charge cycle and use a q-tip to clean the inside and around the post on the toothbrush itself.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean after using this brush.</li>
            <li>of my friends has been a longtime user of the diamond clean after receiving it as a gift and raved about</li>
            <li>I get a dentist clean with every use.</li>
            <li>It still does clean just as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed how much cleaner my teeth are and more importantly, so has my hygienist.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never feel so clean.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean, soothed and refreshed that I find myself brushing after I eat to maintain that clean feeling.</li>
            <li>but if you want your mouth clean, this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li>But, after noticing how clean my teeth were, he gave it a try and was also impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The carrying case is great and the charging lasts much longer than you would ever have a need to worry about while using it at home near a charging station.</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel incredibly clean.</li>
            <li>I use the mulitple settings to clean, whiten &amp; care for my gums.</li>
            <li>I like the Sonicares and think they&#x27;re the best available, but I&#x27;m not thrilled about spending $200 every 2-3 years for an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The oral b would have been cheaper, however the cases never seem to look good to me (never tried them to be honest), and the timer/pressure/teeth cleaning sensor would be a waste of money where I wouldn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li>The design is very classy and looks nice on the counter.  </li>
            <li>But this latest model comes with a number of nice accessories that work with the brush to make you understand the higher price for the unit, and therefore, possibly make it a good choice if you are looking for a new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I looked around and saw many positive reviews for the Diamondclean from Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Overall a fantastic toothbrush that delivers everything it says in a very nifty package designed beautifully for both home and travel.</li>
            <li>So far, I love it!</li>
            <li>At first, I was very sceptical of buying a different brand since I was very happy with my Oral B product.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to upgrade from my Sonic Essence toothbrush and so far I love this one!  </li>
            <li>Everything now a days is USB charger friendly and now this is a lovely edition to the modern world of electronics.</li>
            <li>All in all, the price is not justified neither by results, nor by making brushing more comfortable or pleasant.  </li>
            <li>This time, because I was inside the 24-month warranty period, Philips customer support sent me a new (it appears to be refurbished instead of actually new) handle, which was great, but makes me worry about its longevity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>does anything special for the cleaning process.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to line it up any special way to make it work.</li>
            <li>And I just saw a Costco special that included two Sonicare power handles, two chargers, two travel cases, plus four brush heads that included two DiamondClean ones...</li>
            <li>We were going to a special needs dental clinic</li>
            <li>The defect was purely cosmetic and did not affect charging the toothbrush or placement of the glass or holder on top of it.  </li>
            <li>so got a special discount on two of these.  </li>
            <li>It even has a special mode for gum care.  </li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s not my fault if they change the size of the brushes and the way you&#x27;re supposed to brush every twenty years or so, right!</li>
            <li>I love this new toothbrush except, the handle is slippery and easy to drop since there is no rubber for traction to keep it gripped in your hand.  </li>
            <li>and I found the Diamond Clean to be superior than the regular sonicare.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to clean a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>As much as I absolutely loved this toothbrush and miss the clean feeling it left me with, my toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t charge in either charging port after just under a year of owning it.</li>
            <li>it really helps you to keep your mouth clean and healthy your gums refreshed.</li>
            <li>There is a way to preset a favorite setting, but that is very easily erased and you&#x27;re back to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hard case is awesome for traveling though.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>The charging case was fun to use on a recent vacation - it worked just fine and looked good doing it.  </li>
            <li>Having owned a soniccare for over 10 years now I was super excited to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to this one.  </li>
            <li>Replacements did not always arrive quickly, but they were always friendly on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bigger heads used to gunk up fairly rapidly, making me take special steps to keep them</li>
            <li>So far this toothbrush is amazing, comes with two heads</li>
            <li>It works great and is not too rough on the gums.  </li>
            <li>The product is great when it works but just about a year into it, the button starts getting stuck and the vibrating silver rod gets jammed.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected, am very pleased with the ease of use.</li>
            <li>working good the only problem I have when the charge gose doen it vabreate in my hand</li>
            <li>its honestly like I just got a professional cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li>After going through the full cycle (3 min)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re questioning the hefty price tag, get one of the cheaper models, however I&#x27;ve tried three of the current range and all are good toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is equipped with a carrying case and USB charger for travel use, and the two brush heads provided are of good quality and hold up well to daily use and cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I hesitated to spend that much money, I am so glad that I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>For those replacing or upgrading, the feature has a by-pass option to get the full benefits of the brush day one.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I use the Charging Travel Case all of the time because it makes the brush really mobile, so the caps became just two more items floating around inside the bathroom junk drawer.</li>
            <li>I use the Charging Travel Case all of the time because it makes the brush really mobile, so the caps became just two more items floating around inside the bathroom junk drawer.</li>
            <li>Read the instructions, it has a &amp;#34;slow speed setting&amp;#34; from the factory that you can use to get used to the vibes, or remove to use the full power from the get go.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking forward to getting a good report upon my next trip to the Hygienist.</li>
            <li>How cool is that?</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too much of a reviewer but love reading reviews before I purchase an item.</li>
            <li>It is recommended that you brush for a full two minutes, so the quadpacer splits that up into 30 seconds of brushing for each quadrant.</li>
            <li>And I love the Gum Care setting that gently massages the gums.</li>
            <li>It is very versatile and I love</li>
            <li>I love it so much I am buying one for my husband.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant on spending so much on a toothbrush, but it is MORE than &amp;#34;just a toothbrush&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>In fact, the instructions say that the unit doesn&#x27;t reach full power until after 14 days, so that your mouth can get used to it.</li>
            <li>A full charge lasts for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist has more than gently suggested over the years that I get a Sonicare to help fight plague and improve my gum health.</li>
            <li>It would be good if the manufacturer offered multiple sizes of brush heads.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s probably just because I&#x27;m coming from a full size</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s probably just because I&#x27;m coming from a full size</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cool design the way it charges in a case</li>
            <li>It looks good in my bathroom though, which is why it got a second star.</li>
            <li>Much lighter, easier to hold and seems to do a much better job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>, I floss, I get cleanings to keep my teeth in as good a shape as possible.  </li>
            <li>It is elegantly designed and very practical.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years and  the charging technology is cool</li>
            <li>This is a good toothbrush from a cleaning standpoint, but this is my second Philips toothbrush to breakdown within 2 years or so.</li>
            <li>in conclusion, cool charging technology does not take the place of convenience features.</li>
            <li>Just fabulous! cleans very well&lt;</li>
            <li>Wireless charging is so cool.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, there&#x27;s a much smaller and more elegant charging stand included that can be used instead of the glass.</li>
            <li>Having used these for years, I can say they are the best toothbrushes going, however, my one complaint is that you cant replace the battery after it dies.  </li>
            <li>.brush will run for full time of mode setting, then power off</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58 and using this product has whitened my teeth, cleaned them better and gently massaged my gums.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also cool.</li>
            <li>glass cup to store in is cool to.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li>/&gt;It runs half-speed for 2 weeks, which you can turn off (and go to full speed).  </li>
            <li>glass cup is cool, but I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I find myself the unlucky owner of a $190 toothbrush that looks good, but can no longer be properly charged because the battery has quit working.</li>
            <li>the brush looks really cool on my counter</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s if you let the cycle run its full course.</li>
            <li>How sweet is that?</li>
            <li>The way it charges is so cool</li>
            <li>is really cool.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love using the brush, as it cleans my teeth so well and really does give you that &amp;#34;just-after-the-dentist&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li>I was polite the whole time (absolute best way to deal with customer service reps) and finally got my issue resolved.  </li>
            <li>Love it my old 1 burnt in a house fire and i am so happy to have my toothbrush back</li>
            <li>but definitely does a good job.</li>
            <li>Post baby hasn&#x27;t been much better as I have been absolutely sleep deprived.  </li>
            <li>modes using the power button is only good if you never witch modes.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this toothbrush, which was recommended to me by my dentist.</li>
            <li>its just true that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Its streamlined features make it cool to look at and almost mistakable as an Apple product.</li>
            <li>Teeth are super clean.  </li>
            <li>This is so cool with the glass as the charger.</li>
            <li>Also the charging glass and charging case are so cool and convenient to use!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad device by any means</li>
            <li>Ok, I really didn&#x27;t use this often but it was cool to know I had</li>
            <li>Not only does it clean and whiten your teeth the best of any other manual or electric toothbrush, it is probably the most high-tech device that a person can stick into their face, and it even changed how I brush my teeth by promoting.</li>
            <li>Having recently traveled with the new brush, I can also say the USB charging case is incredibly practical.</li>
            <li>Ok first let me start by saying I thought I had issue with my unit and contacted Phillips and they replaced right away</li>
            <li>This is the best because I don&#x27;t have to charge it often, it is thin and easily held, and it cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li>my updates following the original review - the short of it, now two years after purchase I&#x27;m still very happy with the DiamondClean toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>In the meantime, please, please, please keep making those awesome small compact heads!</li>
            <li>I mean if you&#x27;re going to spend over $100 for a brush you may as well purchase the best one for your money.  </li>
            <li>you are too, this will fit right in to your routine.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush also comes with a micro USB charging system, which went right into my travel bag, and it hasn&#x27;t seen the light of day yet, even though I have traveled once.</li>
            <li>The vibrations are pretty strong...</li>
            <li>First off, the DiamondClean system is compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I guess this is here because some people feel that the toothbrush is too strong when they use it the first time and the sensation is somewhat ticklish, but I didn&#x27;t require that.</li>
            <li>When u boxing and setting up it was pretty easy.</li>
            <li>charging mechanism is super cool.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this toothbrush for the last two years: my teeth were minty clean, no grimy buildup throughout the day (and even prevented it overnight); my breath was fresh for the rest of the day, and charges lasted for 2 weeks at a time</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is amazing and very modern and classy looking--which, while not the primary thing</li>
            <li>I have used little pressure, great pressure, medium pressure, checked the fit of the brush on the handle, etc, etc.  </li>
            <li>The pretty, smooth surface looks great but is really not what you need in a moist bathroom environment.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is great while it works, however, it is extremely unreliable.</li>
            <li>The handle of the brush itself is made of a faux-ceramic material that feels great in the hand, and even though it doesn&#x27;t have the ridges or rubber grip of other Sonicare brushes, it will never slip or slide out of your hand.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t your smile worth it!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great.  </li>
            <li>The reviews here do a great job of highlighting the finer points of this electric brush as well as comparing it to other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Philips customer service was great and after confirming it wasn&#x27;t just a charging issue, replaced both due to the 2-year warranty.  </li>
            <li>Love my new toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I love my new Sonicare toothbrush!</li>
            <li>and she said that my teeth are in great condition with very minimal plaque.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my gums and yet whitened my teeth significantly within a week!</li>
            <li>My much older electronic brush did a good job, but this new unit seams to leave my teeth cleaner</li>
            <li>I have heard that super clean gums will lengthen your life; so, use if you want to live longer (alright, over the top.)</li>
            <li>This is amazingly powerful &amp; gets your mouth clean.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for 3 days and my teeth have never been as this clean, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The Diamond Clean definitely feels more powerful than the E series, but not too overwhelming (by the by</li>
            <li>When it first arrived 5 months ago, everything works fine and it looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Replacement Diamond clean mini heads are costly but worth getting.</li>
            <li>the diamond clean isn&#x27;t worth the almost $200 price tag.  </li>
            <li>An electric toothbrush makes your teeth &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean, and that is certainly worth the effort and money.</li>
            <li>With the DiamondClean I legitimately look forward to brushing my teeth - three times a day - because of how fresh and clean my mouth feels after use.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist says that my gums and teeth have improved tremendously over the years I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare brushes and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.p, or you could color in the lights for the program</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist says that my gums and teeth have improved tremendously over the years I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare brushes and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>Honestly makes your teeth whiter within a few weeks :) Strongly recommend to people.</li>
            <li>The DiamondClean is aesthetically pleasing and the chargeable travel case is super convenient (and</li>
            <li>If it cleans only as well as the last version I will be a very happy</li>
            <li>After such a brief time using my Philips Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush, I can already fully commit to this one statement - &#x27;THE best toothbrush I have EVER used!&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Also the fact my Father-in-Law got lucky and his replacement is still working after 20 months also shows me it could be a sporadic quality control issue.  </li>
            <li>Also the fact my Father-in-Law got lucky and his replacement is still working after 20 months also shows me it could be a sporadic quality control issue.  </li>
            <li>feel like it&#x27;s a super</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is well worth it the expense,for what it does and for the fact you might be able to avoid dentist visits completely,or limit them to very infrequent check-ups and cleaning appointments.</li>
            <li>The third thing and possibly the best, is the jewelry cleaning aspect.</li>
            <li>after a ton of years of being an incredibly loyal sonicare user, i&#x27;m just fed up.  </li>
            <li>sure you can make out with an older model,</li>
            <li>My husband asked for this particular Sonicare since he travels most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Love this my teeth are whiter now they even when I was using the older Sonicare.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush with the compact head does a super job on my implants.</li>
            <li>Could not stop running my tongue all over my ultra smooth teeth that felt better than some professional cleanings I had in my lifetime.  </li>
            <li>There are now many different models to choose from and we went with the top of the line model.  </li>
            <li>-The glass charger is more clutter, doesn&#x27;t look as neat (IMO), fragile, and not any more functional.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the most obvious fancy item on the accessories list, but it does not stop there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also an acrylic stand which can also be placed on top of the charger, in case you prefer not to use the glass cup.</li>
            <li>I like the wireless charging and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li>It has more options than the older models and does what it claims.</li>
            <li>The brush comes with a \\&quot;Quick Start\\&quot; card that is the super-short version of the instructions.  </li>
            <li>It charges fairly quick and the charges have lasted about a week (two brushings per day).</li>
            <li>I received it quickly.</li>
            <li>It makes the click sound, its secure, but its doesnt really stick there.</li>
            <li>Really does a better cleaning that you&#x27;d pay for and receive at the Dentist office, worth the price.</li>
            <li>The handle is smooth and fits so nicely into your hands that you simply want to hold it.</li>
            <li>Brushing your teeth is a two-time daily must, but now, you&#x27;ll both love and enjoy it!  </li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Sonicare toothbrush in about 8 years, and I think they are definitely the best electric brushes on the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter than the model I had before, which is nice for traveling, and feels very sleek in your hand.</li>
            <li>&quot; I appreciate the beautiful design, but I would rather have an ugly toothbrush and beautiful teeth.</li>
            <li>They fit in my mouth so much better than the old Sonicare did.  </li>
            <li>received as advertised, happy with purchase, fast delivery, I would buy from this seller if purchasing again in the future.  </li>
            <li>It seems after about a minute you can also press the button to shut it off, if you need to brush quickly for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems after about a minute you can also press the button to shut it off, if you need to brush quickly for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush head itself wears too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Cleanings are now quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sleek design of this product makes it easy to clean and the travel case is VERY</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush heads for the Diamond really do a better job on my teeth and the extra setting gives me more options.  </li>
            <li>While I think Philips has designed the nicest product out there for brushing teeth, I wish they would use components that don&#x27;t break so quickly.</li>
            <li>I had a Sonicare back in the 90&#x27;s that was my favorite toothbrush and kept my gums healthy.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was under warranty</li>
            <li>Also, the side to side vibration is vigorous, and one quickly learns to brush with one&#x27;s lips together to keep from splattering toothpaste droplets all over the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I assume since it was so much more than a double pack at Costco, that it&#x27;s better?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an electric toothbrush for many years, but never wanted to spend the extra money for one as sophisticated as the DiamondClean.  </li>
            <li>Another positive is that this brushes charger is so cool!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was blessed with very straight, white teeth, but with the whiteness came soft enamel and despite taking great care of my teeth i have had many cavities and now crowns.....  </li>
            <li>And my dental hygienist is always glad to see me because she&#x27;s starting to clean a set of almost perfectly clean teeth already!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a high-quality electric toothbrush.setting because I am a tea drinker and would love my teeth to be whiter.</li>
            <li>I can say that I highly recommend it as the better product on the market.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-Price point is high at about any given time being roughly $65 more than the oral b 5000.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Price point is high at about any given time being roughly $65 more than the oral b 5000.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this items for most of the geeks out there.</li>
            <li>Really makes your mouth feel clean!</li>
            <li>Then I settle for a normal and quick (but less perfect) toothbrushing.  </li>
            <li>On top of that Philips does not sell handles alone and therefore if I want a new handle I need to purchase the full kit.</li>
            <li>This pretty little toothbrush does the most amazing job cleaning AND whitening teeth!</li>
            <li>It certainly cleans well and leaves teeth feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The texture of the white finish (you can also purchase the toothbrush in all black, by the way) feels somewhat like unglazed ceramic: it not only looks wonderful, but it feels great in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(older style built in to apartment prob from 70&#x27;s) and the metal was preventing the induction charging!!!</li>
            <li>The design is by far the best one out of the other sonicare models.</li>
            <li>One of the features of the FlexCare Plus brush that I was very interested in was the UV sanitizing feature.  </li>
            <li>First, they don&#x27;t give you anywhere to securely place your toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and my mouth, gums, &amp; teeth feel really healthy &amp; clean after use.i use the gum care setting and am looking forward to my next checkup.</li>
            <li>I normally use the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; mode which provide two more rounds in brushing.</li>
            <li>This is my second sonicare &amp; I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work like a normal &amp;#34;hand scrub&amp;#34; toothbrush, but once you get used to it, they are so much better.</li>
            <li>If I would have known how good it was would have bought a long time ago.</li>
            <li>Even if I&#x27;d had to pay the full retail price of $210, it would have been worth it.</li>
            <li>Good, my teeth are definitely cleaner than what they used to be but battery life isn&#x27;t as good as I expected or advertised to be.</li>
            <li>Carrying case is really useful and cool.</li>
            <li>But I went ahead and purchased a replacement at full price, knowing it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>The vibration makes your mouth feel clean and fresh, and it keeps that fresh feeling throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Really makes a difference to how smooth and clean my teeth feel</li>
            <li>nice features to chose for different function to clean, polish or whiten.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, the battery technology is modern, and with luck should last significantly longer before it deteriorates to the point of replacement.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this since it is so cool looking!  </li>
            <li>It is transportable and holds a charge for a good long time (up to a week)!  </li>
            <li>To my surprise it is a much better product, not just &#x27;the new model.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>I was able to get a new one for $130 from my dentist (after rebate, and including tax).</li>
            <li>I converted from a Oral B brand brush after having it for 8+ years and love my new Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>However, i managed to live most of my life without a sanitizer</li>
            <li>I hope that they&#x27;ve figured out the kinks over time and my new one will be more reliable.    </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s re-designed so that function takes priority, and with better materials, then I&#x27;ll buy a new one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a horrible inconvenience, I can definitely live with it.  </li>
            <li>I absoluetly love my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I can be a bit too easily distracted by the latest shiny new gadget and this thing really does look the part.</li>
            <li>(I bought it right after I had to get a few cavities filled in, and I realised how important a good toothbrush is).</li>
            <li>Not having to put it on a normal charger is a big win.  </li>
            <li>In terms of normal use, it is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>Great upgrade from previous sonicate tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously used the Sonicare Flexcare for 3+ years and thought it was a great toothbrush, but the DiamondClean surpasses it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy that I spent the extra money to get the Diamond Clean model.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush strongly enough.oes so much to enhance my health.</li>
            <li>Cleans up easily, and I really like the rechargeable stand.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s just not doing as good a job unless it&#x27;s freshly been charged even though it touts a long time in between charges.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my teeth felt much more clean than they ever have from normal brushing.  </li>
            <li>We recently took a week long vacation and the charging travel case worked perfectly for us.</li>
            <li>This implies that were my gauss meter capable of measuring greater levels, closer distances would yield substantially higher measurements.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has been wonderful, it is hard to quantify whether or not this brush (or any electric toothbrush) actually &amp;#34;removes more plaque&amp;#34; but I can say I notice a clean feeling every time I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>Charging Travel Case is cool; the ability to charge the battery by connecting it to my laptop via USB is something I found very smart.</li>
            <li>its all first class!</li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used (and I researched them before I put up the big bucks for this one), but I am more than glad I did.  </li>
            <li>it was sold to me by my dentist when they first came onto the market!  </li>
            <li>After the first use I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>We finally bought the Sonicare electric toothbrush and we both in love with them!</li>
            <li>The Diamond is quite different from the first one and has more more controls than I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li>Surpassed all my expectations and I immediately noticed a difference the first week I used this product!</li>
            <li>DiamondClean toothbrush is way better than the old e-series!  </li>
            <li>This the first review I have ever written!  </li>
            <li>Thanks sonicare!!</li>
            <li>been using sonicare through their first generation models and this one has improved, as it should!</li>
            <li>I can say their Customer Service was always friendly and willing to keep trying to solve the inherent design flaws of this product.</li>
            <li>2-3 days later I had a new brush that worked great...</li>
            <li>My wife has owned previous models of the Sonicare, but this one is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;unfortunately, starting with the flexcare generation, while you gain a slimmer handle, a MUCH better removable tip that is much easier to clean or prevent gunk, and more powerful motors, what you lost is reliability.  </li>
            <li>It recharges to full battery pretty  quickly</li>
            <li>, the hidden areas that illuminate to indicate mode and battery status, the brilliance of a travel case that both closes magnetically and charges the power handle via USB cable from your computer or the included USB power adapter--the whole package has just been thought through with incredible attention to detail.</li>
            <li>The unique ultra-sonic pulses are superior to the conventional toothbrush and the rotadent, another mechanical toothbrush I have used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The design and finish are excellent and a real departure from other models and the main competitor..  </li>
            <li>It can be charged via USB (very handy for international travel because the normal Sonicare does not accept 220V).&lt;br</li>
            <li>The glass charging case is super neat and it looks right at home in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>If you find the right sale, coupon and or rebate, it&#x27;s a worthy model replacement option.</li>
            <li>Using this regularly is probably the single best thing I&#x27;ve ever done for my dental health.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone interested in keeping their teeth clean,</li>
            <li>This diamond clean was my first sonicare purchase</li>
            <li>but it no long available because It has more than one month.</li>
            <li>Wish the charge cable would fit in the case as the case feels overly large</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re gums look great!&amp;#34; After 10 years of hearing about more and more recession it was a shock to the system to hear such positive feedback from the Dentist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a super soft brushing action, ideal for sensitive gums or gum recession.&lt;br /&gt;USB</li>
            <li>If you find the right sale, coupon and or rebate, it&#x27;s a worthy model replacement option.the whitening cycle, and that gives me 8 days worth of brushing.</li>
            <li>It takes a little while to get used to but it a great product.</li>
            <li>These are easier to clean, easier to remove and attach and the whole brush and handle system is far more sanitary and easy to clean than older Sonicare models.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a little pricy, I still love it for its effective cleansing effect.</li>
            <li>having your own personal hygienist that does not talk too much!!</li>
            <li>Different brush design, teeth feel cleaner, Also, gum cleaning program does a very good job, in addition to the regular cleaning program.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an earlier model Sonicare toothbrush for several years and found it to be a very good product.</li>
            <li>This brush really gets in and does its job using just light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through 3 of the AA-powered $20 version -- they&#x27;re great for travel, but water ingress in the bottom always ends up eventually destroying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The travel case is very sleek, light</li>
            <li>even the glass tumbler is heavy glass and attractive.</li>
            <li>Sounds like a commercial, but the power is this unit is amazing.  </li>
            <li>the travel case with charger is amazing and its the only charger i ever use.</li>
            <li>Just get a cheaper product, this one is made cheap and sold for way too much.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic toothbrush and if you&#x27;ve never used a sonic toothbrush you&#x27;re in for a real treat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;b) While the DiamondClean brushes DO clean somewhat better than older Sonicare brush heads, you can use DiamondClean brushes on some of the older, cheaper Sonicare models like FlexCare.</li>
            <li>one move this negates so much of the practicality of the travel case, which was one of the primary reasons for my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then - an unusual sound and vibration performance reduction, and some brown substance oozing from around the button - yuck.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>had heard through my son that the Sonicare was an amazing electric toothbrush, so when I dropped and broke my regular electric toothbrush, I knew that I wanted to replace it with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It works smoothly and really well.  </li>
            <li>It is so worth It.</li>
            <li>Worth the price over cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>if it really is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>It was worth the price.</li>
            <li>One thing is for sure, this brush leaves my teeth feeling far cleaner</li>
            <li>What kind of art house goon comes up with such impractical designs?  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to have the larger option.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works exactly as expected and does provide a good brushing experience.</li>
            <li>But then it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every dime.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t let customers vote on their own reviews, so the voting buttons appear only when you look at reviews submitted by others.  </li>
            <li>-- it is definitely worth the investment for your oral care.</li>
            <li>The glass cup is in the closet as it really isn&#x27;t useful for me.</li>
            <li>Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>so far,  i love this baby  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money and the health benefits, even the surprise ones.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Now it just goes off on its own, just starts buzzing when it&#x27;s just sitting there, acting erratically...</li>
            <li>But this product is worth the price</li>
            <li>sooooo worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought the DiamondClean to replace my old Braun toothbrush, which lasted more than a decade.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over two years and still as powerful as before.</li>
            <li>Very, very pleased with this purchase, as long as it stands up to the test of time.</li>
            <li>it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush works better than my old model and stays cleaner.  </li>
            <li>but I will say that I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my smile</li>
            <li>This case also uses the inductive charging method, so all you have to do is place the handle into the form-fitting slot for it and it will charge when you plug it in, and plugging it in is the fun part.</li>
            <li>This means that now, whenever you use the brush even if it is the first time, it will always operate at full 100% power.</li>
            <li>its worth it...  </li>
            <li>In short, while pricey, I&#x27;m thrilled with the unit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the toothbrush is also just fun.  </li>
            <li>there is one issue I have discovered with this particular model and that is,it attracts grease off one&#x27;s hands easily.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>From this point on I was incredibly paranoid using it, gripping the handle until my fingers turned white for fear of dropping it and destroying another one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;or misuse on gum line , keep off of gum line , if not unit is so effective you&#x27;ll have no gums left.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$.</li>
            <li>My periodontist said that he didn&#x27;t believe the UV feature would make much difference, and that it would be just as good to periodically soak the brush head in Listerine or similar product.</li>
            <li>Powerful.  </li>
            <li>Use of two months, a fresh mouth feel than before</li>
            <li>(The travel case is pretty cool, too.</li>
            <li>I went from this crappy battery powered one that was ok but standard for cheap .</li>
            <li>It is a bit costly but worth every cent.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has a built in timer and that you have choices as far as cleaning, polishing, sensitivity, etc.</li>
            <li>Love the Philips Sonicare HX9332/5 DiamondClean,  so far it&#x27;s doing the job at hand.  </li>
            <li>but I just smile and nod.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>but..It would be nice if it warned you when the battery is low.</li>
            <li>so it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>am not crazy about the glass for the charging system.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and it is really worth it.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Surely worth the investmentwhen</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>i have not owned an electric toothbrush before, but this one got great reviews, and so far my teeth definitely feel cleaner than before.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>If you care for your smile.</li>
            <li>Bought one for my wife as present, she is loving it.</li>
            <li>It is a nice feature that depending on the mode of cleaning you choose the vibrations are different.  </li>
            <li>The charging case is also pretty cool</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Everything from the charging station, to the toothbrush, to the bristle head are sturdy, powerful, and well constructed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this so far.  </li>
            <li>It cleans much better than my old worn out Sonicare</li>
            <li>The travel case has come in handy several times as well.</li>
            <li>The different settings are also a nice touch.</li>
            <li>However, after I used it once it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>A nice touch is the fact that you can charge it via USB and a charge will last a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s partly a step backwards from the Flexcare+ model and is it really worth the price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the ability to have a mode with a different time is nice so that I can brush longer without the brush going off and having to turn it on again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal but would have been nice.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is, without question, the most modern and elegantly designed electric toothbrush on the market today, and I can only compare holding it to the feeling you get when you hold an Apple product.</li>
            <li>But is it worth the premium price being charged for it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I decided that the DiamondClean was worth it for me, it might not be for you, depending on your priorities.</li>
            <li>While I decided that the DiamondClean was worth it for me, it might not be for you, depending on your priorities.</li>
            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>So far, it feels great, especially the brush head.</li>
            <li>This brush is much more powerful than my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you want a powerful electric toothbrush with all the \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot;, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>then you already know the basics of how this kind of toothbrush works and the Diamondclean is no different.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money, you&#x27;ll feel the difference.</li>
            <li>I suppose you can put it in your mouth then press the button several times but then what&#x27;s the point in having the nice display.    </li>
            <li>Do the designers actually use their own creations?</li>
            <li>Both are well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Bought mine November of 2011 and in January I notice the sonic vibrations/pulsing motion was not as powerful.  </li>
            <li>My dentist has also noticed which makes the purchase worth it to me.</li>
            <li>The charging glass is pretty neat, as others have said there are some features that I do not use (usb charging) but it is cool to know</li>
            <li>Products eventually finish their useful life, and I am now using the Sonicare DiamondClean brush.</li>
            <li>So, if you are wondering whether this technology is just hi-tech hype, I can tell you that it works and it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Supposedly my dental health is worth it.</li>
            <li>I miss it but don&#x27;t think its worth replacing at that price every two years.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny if you can afford.  </li>
            <li>Do I feel the cost was worth it?</li>
            <li>Do I feel the cost was worth it?</li>
            <li>I am a dental professional with more than 20 years experience.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to try USB charging, but the case has been useful when traveling.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>feel fresh</li>
            <li>Given the success of my checkups since then I have to agree with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well  worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>All and all they seem to all break the same way... the vibration stops working effectively.</li>
            <li>I was going to replace it with the same kind but saw the DiamondClean.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice storage case with space for an extra head which does come with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth feel great and my confidence has jumped considerable after only a week of using this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it so far.</li>
            <li>i think i&#x27;ll be buying the sensitive brush heads since they&#x27;re softer and can navigate around curves better IMO.</li>
            <li>It holds the charge nicely and I have used it on short travels of 3 to 4 days without any probem.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>Is that reason enough to invest this kind of money?</li>
            <li>Also having a way to code the heads for multiple users would be nice as well.  </li>
            <li>BUT WELL WORTH IT TO ME.</li>
            <li>well worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The smaller heads are nice.  </li>
            <li>second one bought, last one wore out after many years of use, good bit of kit</li>
            <li>Has multiple settings and the charging glass is a nice accessory.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW, it is essential to read the instructions and follow the usage guidelines for these Sonicare brushes to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I had to laugh when I read the review that called this the Apple toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The vibration feels good and the darn things actually works cleaning my teeth very well.</li>
            <li>When I smile in pictures</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I really like that it comes with a traveling case, very useful, and you can charge the toothbrush through that traveling case.  </li>
            <li>I loved the product and took great care of it, but a little after the 2 year warranty expired the brush started to stutter and switch between low and high vibrations as if one of the gears rusted away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to clean my back molars without trouble and my teeth feel incredibly smooth and polished for a good while</li>
            <li>, I have been quite impressed by how long a single charge lasts (about 2 weeks).</li>
            <li>I love this better than any other sonicare product I have used before</li>
            <li>They all do a great job on teeth and gums, but until this one, it was really hard to keep the handles/stands/chargers clean.</li>
            <li>And the supplied case is much more exotic than we&#x27;ve seen before with other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I have recommended sonicare brushes for many years and will continue to do so because they are powerful and clean well, however, I cannot recommend this brush based on my personal experience.  </li>
            <li>All the different settings work great and gives you the clean feeling like you just left the dentist.</li>
            <li>Since I haven&#x27;t had a sonic toothbrush, the first experience tickled the roof of my mouth, but I quickly got adjusted to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about 6 years before it died a quick death.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly does make your mouth feel clean and</li>
            <li>mouth certainly feels clean after the 2 or 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I rarely use anything except the Clean option but the whitening and Polish setting really do work.</li>
            <li>Using the flexcare, more often than not, I would accidentally change modes during brushing-would have to stop change back to clean.</li>
            <li>The main draw of this toothbrush for me was aesthetic more than function - and it definitely is a very good-looking toothbrush</li>
            <li>If anything it&#x27;s going to start making the bottom of the handle sort of gross, how many germs collect in that cup overnight unless you clean it every</li>
            <li>I definitely think the newer brush heads clean a lot better as well.</li>
            <li>The Diamond Clean has a more slender shape and smaller brushes</li>
            <li>Afterwards my mouth felt more clean than it ever has even after prior dental cleanings and thus began my hunt for a brush that could come close to that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I brushed each day, my teeth just didn&#x27;t feel clean to me.  </li>
            <li>Since I regularly turn the brush on and run it under water after brushing to clean the brush, if I don&#x27;t wait the right number of seconds, I have to push the button 5 more times to cycle through the modes to turn the brush off.  </li>
            <li>That means that neither the Oral B nor the Sonicare is so vastly superior in bacterial plaque biofilm removal that I could recommend one over the other to my patients, based on that criterion alone.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is just as good as all my other Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The DiamondClean on the other hand is made of plastic but good quality of plastic (feels like ceramic</li>
            <li>The handle has a very nice finish and feels less slippery than previous models.&lt;br /&gt;Diamond head does a nice job but it will fit on most model handles so not a big deal here.&lt;br /&gt;Charger is cool.  </li>
            <li>All you have to do is put it into the cup after use, and it charges right there in the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush</li>
            <li>and I knew I had made the right decision once it was turned on and working on my teeth.</li>
            <li>It seems I can&#x27;t get it right</li>
            <li>you are going to have to fight for your right to brush with it...</li>
            <li>you are going to have to fight for your right to brush with it...</li>
            <li>and I used it right after packaging.</li>
            <li>It comes out of the box with a charge (helpful so you can get started right away) and immediately notice the quality of the pieces.  </li>
            <li>the service rep knew right away what the problem was and didn&#x27;t even bother to check and gave me a replacement.</li>
            <li>RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li>It comes with a sleek wireless charger (you plug in the cup to the wall and just lay your toothbrush up right to charge).  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>so I needed a replacement right away.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>yeah right.  </li>
            <li>and she was right</li>
            <li>Toothbrush heads no longer stay, they pop right off as soon as I power on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Received it right before</li>
            <li>But the $500 pricetage for &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; results just doesn&#x27;t sit right.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that the old brush heads that I knew Santa would put in my stocking would fit the new handle.</li>
            <li>What a huge improvement from the older models...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a feature I found pretty interesting: every 30 seconds, the brushing action seems to pause as a reminder to move on to another quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>so I knew it was really getting in there to clean.</li>
            <li>I have gone to the dentist and been told that there really isn&#x27;t anything for them to do as I didn&#x27;t have much to clean at all.  </li>
            <li>Use one of these and floss regularly, and you will see better teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;Hey, and the fact that it looks cool in my bathroom ...</li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth are really getting clean.</li>
            <li>Really makes your teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>Never required this much instruction to clean my teeth before, but</li>
            <li>This really gets your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>I have own&#x27;d sonicare products in the past and honestly I love them.</li>
            <li>It really gets your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>really gets your teeth clean</li>
            <li>this one is smart, it&#x27;ll warm me after I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth with a gentle vibration and a light to say it needs charging.  </li>
            <li>Overall it works really well if looking for a great cleaning action!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I really enjoy using it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>When I was initially comparing prices on numerous sites on the Internet, I finally settled on buying through Amazon because it was the best price, but also because I felt secure about the purchase knowing their history of customer service</li>
            <li>It has many settings such as clean,  whiten,  polish,  even gentle!</li>
            <li>Love this product, so glad I upgraded from my previous sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Love the black makes it look even better sitting the the cup to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s unnerving at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone that is looking at there first electric toothbrush or anyone looking for a more modern upgrade.</li>
            <li>In general I am satisfied..-)</li>
            <li>so it is suitable for international travel.</li>
            <li>This thing makes my mouth feel like I just got out of the dentist office every time I use it, looks amazingly cool and considering it cost about as much as 2 trips to the dentist</li>
            <li>This is the best (and by far the most expensive) toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>travel case is very convenient, but it does feel larger than it needs to be, I&#x27;m sure they could find a way to fit the cargo cable within the case, even if it was a shorter cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>About 8 months in, I noticed it wasn&#x27;t quite as powerful as when I first bought it -</li>
            <li>while putting your toothbrush in the cup for charging is cool, is that really practical?  </li>
            <li>but it starts off gently and gradually works up to full speed over a period of 14 brushes.  </li>
            <li>Also, its pretty powerful</li>
            <li>(I forget what it&#x27;s called), as the the DiamondClean, great as it is, seems excessive.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Sonicare supporter- normally.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty steep but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Another FABULOUS thing about this toothbrush is that it keeps a charge for 3 weeks which was like an answer to my prayers because I have 3 items on my bathroom sink (including my toothbrush) that have to stay plugged in so being able to eliminate an extra cord really made a difference in the neatness.  </li>
            <li>Nice buy, but if you don&#x27;t get expedited shipping it takes a long time to get.</li>
            <li>If you are not accustomed to a toothbrush that moves this fast, the first time you use it might be a bit of a unique experience.</li>
            <li>It delivers a deep clean feeling for your whole mouth and the multiple charging options are great and convenient.</li>
            <li>Electric toothbrushes just clean better, so I will most likely do the cheaper models as they all seem to have the same life span.</li>
            <li>Bought the basic for my kids when my dentist said their teeth weren&#x27;t getting clean enough, and eventually got this one for myself, and I couldnt be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Even though I gave up electricity for a long weekend, I was able to keep my brush charged in the case so I could still have a clean mouth and still feel civilized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my new toothbrush and feel that upgrading to their newer version worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I can happily say that after a few weeks of use, you can certainly justify the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I better get no less than that from this toothbrush, which cost me more than a new microwave.than a new microwave.</li>
            <li>The results were less than impressive, and that was my first and until now last experience with electric brushes.</li>
            <li>Also, this unit has a significant improvement over the older style brush heads that collected water, toothpase and grime.  </li>
            <li>The travel case is light and nice to have, (though a little bulky).</li>
            <li>After the first time you use it, which is creepy if you don&#x27;t already use an electric toothbrush, it quickly becomes the best thing since sliced</li>
            <li>After three weeks of using Philips&#x27; Sonicare Diamondclean, my teeth feel very clean, are more polished and need less care when flossing.</li>
            <li>, this is a very gorgeous and somewhat unusual toothbrush, and it has won at least two separate design awards.</li>
            <li>The different modes are easy to use and the product is user friendly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if other people who had brushing problems have experienced the same thing, but this has made a huge difference for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would avoid unless you&#x27;re comfortable buying a new toothbrush every 2 years.</li>
            <li>But you need to think about whether you feel comfortable spending $150 for a new one every year or two because that is the reality of ownership.  </li>
            <li>after all, I&#x27;d never spent more than $8 for a toothbrush, so this product (despite all of its bells and whistles) had a bold line to reach:  was it worth 30 times a normal toothbrush if that&#x27;s what you were going to pay for it?  </li>
            <li>With my old school Oral B toothbrushes I would sometimes go over the two minute timers as my teeth didn&#x27;t feel super clean</li>
            <li>There are several designs fixes which make me happy over my last Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Next the brush head is EASY TO CLEAN.</li>
            <li>The soft bristles are easy on the gums.  </li>
            <li>The home charger is sleek and easy to clean, unlike my last one.  </li>
            <li>My old one was much more gentle.  </li>
            <li>That said, it sure does clean your teeth really well and in a very short amount of time!</li>
            <li>but I decided to go for it since I&#x27;ve been happy with my prior Sonicare toothbrushes and since they last for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly a good looking toothbrush, too, and since it sits out in the bathroom (at least in my minuscule bathroom, it has to), that&#x27;s important to me as well.  </li>
            <li>- there&#x27;s no rubber grip and the single power button / function button is not as handy as two buttons were.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been several years since I used an electric toothbrush, probably when I was 12 (and it was a very cheap version), so going to this toothbrush after using a standard toothbrush for most of my life was like a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li>I was also attracted to the fact that it is more effective in removing plague, which should mean that it has to be in my mouth for a shorter period of time.</li>
            <li>They offered me a free pack of new heads- REALLY!</li>
            <li>Diamondclean: ok, slightly more advanced, charging glass only looks cool but is hard to keep clean with water stains etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This time around customer service from Phillips was super and quick but my original warranty will still apply and expires mid September.</li>
            <li>i bought this for my son who likes it very much.</li>
            <li>and it actually feels very comfortable in the hand.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality!</li>
            <li>First, it offers a very compact brushing head which truly is the perfect size for someone like me with a small mouth and a susceptibility to gagging when brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>It REALLY gets the whole mouth super clean and not with much effort.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel very much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush vibrates very fast and it took a couple of days to get used to the tickling sensation of the vibration , but after a couple of days, you don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.</li>
            <li>It is quiet and the grip is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The compact charging stand (if you didn&#x27;t want to use the larger glass cup) was a bit loose fitting on both top and bottom sides, but I decided I was able to live with that.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many Oral-B electric toothbrushes but nothing comes close to this, I&#x27;ve been using DiamondClean for more than a year now, it leaves my teeth super clean in less brushing time, stays charged for a very long time, beautiful design &amp; very well made plus few extra great features such as the carrying case and the USB charger..</li>
            <li>I start out with the standard power Clean mode that goes for two minutes in 4 intervals, then move on to White mode, which is higher powered than Clean mode, which goes on for two minutes in 4 intervals plus another 30 seconds of an even higher powered brushing in 2 intervals for your \\&quot;glamour\\&quot; teeth, or front teeth, top and bottom, followed by the Polish mode, which is the strongest and highest-powered mode the toothbrush offers, giving you 30 seconds each for your top front teeth and lower front teeth.</li>
            <li>I love my new DiamondClean toothbrush, partially because I love technology and gadgets, so</li>
            <li>I was thrilled because I was still using my old OralB from 8 years ago and was ready to try something new.  </li>
            <li>My husband had never even opened the box as his old Sonic was still working just fine.  </li>
            <li>The clean setting is the normal 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers noted, using it feels good -- you really feel it working to remove the stuff that shouldn&#x27;t be there.</li>
            <li>This is my second Sonicare my first didn&#x27;t make 6 months before it died, I am happy to say this one is now over a year old and still takes and holds a charge like new, I think they improved the technology</li>
            <li>It comes with a travel charger which is super nice, but really, if the battery lasts this long when would you really need it?  </li>
            <li>Also, the new brush head is a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>I only have experience with Clean because that is my primary concern when brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth feel extra clean and smooth after each time I brush.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks it got to the point where just barely touching the side of the brush head, particularly when brushing rear molars, the unit would buzz loudly and there was no vibration at the bristles.</li>
            <li>Gives your teeth a really good clean although the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as claimed.</li>
            <li>It broke while travelling but was under warranty, so Sonicare sent me a new Diamond Clean brush.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;d like to say I am a skeptic and brand loyalist.  </li>
            <li>I was tempted to stop using it on the first try even with the East Start feature on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to stop using the Sonicare after the first brushing, but reconsider after the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kinda funny</li>
            <li>Has more than enough options!</li>
            <li>The material they used (a soft, matte, plastic) just felt cheap to the touch.</li>
            <li>issome evidence that rotation oscillation brushes reduce plaque and gingivitis more than side to side brushes in the short term.</li>
            <li>and he is very picky!</li>
            <li>is the third Sonicare I&#x27;ve purchased, the first DiamondClean: to which I will avail: my favorite toothbrush of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>toothbrush comes with a host of bells and whistles, but I don&#x27;t want to focus on those - though I will add that I love the different settings.</li>
            <li>I actually think you get more bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>I was interested in this system because it claimed to do the things that I needed to have done:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>FIRSTLY</li>
            <li>+ years sonicare user and have always had the latest model, last being the flexcare with UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Which is most likely why Philips allows it.</li>
            <li>I do sometimes swtich to the white setting because I am a tea drinker and would love my teeth to be whiter.</li>
            <li>; that gradually increases the power over the first 14 brushings.</li>
            <li>a smaller, more dense head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And make sure it&#x27;s not located next to anything metallic, like a metal bathroom cabinet!</li>
            <li>When I first got this Sonicare toothbrush, I decided not to post a review immediately.</li>
            <li>I was so wowed by this toothbrush from the first use that I wanted to post a review immediately.</li>
            <li>More recently, I have been using battery-powered brushes from the supermarket and they seemed \\&quot;fine.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Lastly, being able to charge while the brush is still in the case just makes sense.</li>
            <li>I deactivated it before my first time using it.  </li>
            <li>The USB case/charger is great, but i think they should have found a way to pack the USB cable in the case at least.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever written about a product I have purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Sonicare</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and before we bough it</li>
            <li>first then wait 4-6 weeks for a refund check.  </li>
            <li>My Sonicare DiamondClean lived up to my expectations for the first 14 months -- then stopped working.  </li>
            <li>This is my first ever high-end electric toothbrush and it has lived up to all of its promises.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an old-fashioner manual tooth brusher all my life and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ventured into the realms of the power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The Smartimer and Quadpacer features make sure that you have brushed sufficiently and in every area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Yep! charged and ready to go!  </li>
            <li>any of us really do that!  </li>
            <li>Works better than the last model I had.</li>
            <li>, The way I do it is I brush the outside-upper teeth first</li>
            <li>I must admit this is my first foray into the world of electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>No kidding, I must be, because my first reaction was to throw it across the room.</li>
            <li>The charging glass has a pleasing, stout solidity to it, like a whiskey glass, and it&#x27;s an ingenious solution to the daily grind of recharging electronics.</li>
            <li>The charging glass has a pleasing, stout solidity to it, like a whiskey glass, and it&#x27;s an ingenious solution to the daily grind of recharging electronics.</li>
            <li>My first power toothbrush was a Braun Oral-B</li>
            <li>this is the first time I&#x27;ve found one that was not built in the Netherlands.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, my gums had become even stronger and healthy since the last time they saw me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It definitely provides a much better cleaning.</li>
            <li>( ; - )</li>
            <li>When they first were introduced I bought one for myself, one for my wife, and one for my parents to share.  </li>
            <li>It is also extremely stylish and looks like it is from the future.</li>
            <li>The first Sonicare Diamondclean handle broke after about 8 months, received replacement.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind, this is when the toothbrush was first released, so the thing hadn&#x27;t even been out for a year yet.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>this is his first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>definitely doesn&#x27;t have as many nooks and crannies for crust to build up in which</li>
            <li>/&gt;The latest update 4/2014 -- am currently using and testing both the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Before making my purchase, I read as many reviews as I could, I visited a local store that carried both the FlexCare Plus and the DiamondCare, and I also asked my periodontist for his recommendation.  </li>
            <li>finally decided on the DiamondClean model based on its having a better performing brush.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, the issue I was concerned about the most -- not having an On/Off switch and having to cycle through all five settings whenever one uses it -- is a non-issue.  </li>
            <li>And, speaking of sharing the brush within your family, unlike the lesser Sonicare models, they don&#x27;t make color-coded Diamond Care heads, so you&#x27;re never quite sure if you&#x27;re using your own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted here.</li>
            <li>The first one bought in 2011 was the HX6590 which stopped working after 6 months.</li>
            <li>First, is the glass charger.</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li>After the first 24-hour charge, it still has maximum charge / RPM after 30 days.</li>
            <li>first, to toggle between the function, you must press the power button until you reach the desired setting.</li>
            <li>I feel the various modes isn&#x27;t practical and more a marketing</li>
            <li>and I was concerned about it being able to be shipped to my current location</li>
            <li>It started switching to the lesser power without me even touching the power button.  </li>
            <li>This is my first SonicCare</li>
            <li>This is my first SonicCare</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny because it cleans so well that you can feel all the parts of your teeth that will get even the slightest bit of residue on them</li>
            <li>/&gt;A couple of downsides, the charger for the carrying case is mini-USB, pretty dated, should be micro</li>
            <li>I purchased this handle on June 18th 2014, and it broke after exactly 13 months of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(The rechargeable travel case is also a feature I really like!)</li>
            <li>It is reliable and cleans my teeth way better than with a regular tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>but it is a pretty penny</li>
            <li>you consider how much dental work costs!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t completely shut off after a week, but I get the warning beep and an orange light.</li>
            <li>Has several settings for those who like more pressure, and charges wirelessly in a cup.</li>
            <li>The first one I had was a Diamond type</li>
            <li>This first one lasted my two and a bit years.</li>
            <li>After my first use, I did indeed feel like I just got my teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li>Since my dentist recommends Phillips I chose this model after my first Sonicare had to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>With regular 2 minute brushing, I was able to get rid of my gum disease and the need for periodontics surgery.</li>
            <li>-I don&#x27;t notice any material improvement from my Healthy White model</li>
            <li>Buy the Healthy White (although mine did break after about 18mos)</li>
            <li>The batteries on both of them went out exactly one month after the warranty went out.</li>
            <li>First of all I never write reviews until now.</li>
            <li>They also mentioned that it will take 7-10 business days from when I first called.</li>
            <li>it started making a lot of noise, a loud buzzing sound.  </li>
            <li>From the first day I started using the toothbrush</li>
            <li>I had to replace my regular sonicare brush (because I have gingivitis, which is sexy as all get out</li>
            <li>It is exactly like the models in the US.</li>
            <li>the first was replaced under warranty, the replacement they sent me lasted until today</li>
            <li>The settings are mostly to set an internal timer for it to turn off.)&lt;br /&gt;-Slender,</li>
            <li>I am not sorry.</li>
            <li>I bought my first sonicare in 2001 and it lasted until Jan. 2013.</li>
            <li>And teeth for 2 weeks not became more white.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to getting back to the dentist office and getting a report that my teeth &amp; gums look better than ever.  </li>
            <li>At first.  </li>
            <li>And on top of it the system looks robust enough - meaning it does not look like it&#x27;s gonna break three months from now.</li>
            <li>You divide the brushing into 4 parts: front of bottom teeth, back of bottom teeth, front of top teeth, and back of top teeth.  </li>
            <li>That is about $50 more than a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Many Different Modes: The first mode is \\&quot;Clean\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>And they were whiter after the first brushing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes consistently for about 15 years.  </li>
            <li>First off.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but awesome!</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>It is reliable and cleans my teeth way better than with a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It definitely has helped make a better cleaning habit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth have become more white.  </li>
            <li>Funny, i don&#x27;t remember reading that Jonny</li>
            <li>Only the elegant, ceramic-like skin on the DiamondClean model, with</li>
            <li>I also love all of the accessories that come with it - the travel case (which has a convenient cord for charging by USB or standard outlet)</li>
            <li>Having purchased for more than 100 items through Amazon Prime, I would say that this is the only one that is not up to the standards of Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is my first Sonicare, and I decided to splurge.  </li>
            <li>Its much nicer than the Oral B, and really powerful.</li>
            <li>On board charger capability would have required a larger case, giving reviewers one more</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When put into perspective, this unit&#x27;s design was fully tested and there&#x27;s a logical reason for every feature.  </li>
            <li>handle isn&#x27;t the most helpful for a solid grip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this toothbrush I felt like I had just been to the dentist for a cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I was looking forward to trying an electric toothbrush for the first time.</li>
            <li>When you push the power button it immediately starts in the first mode.</li>
            <li>My teeth are noticeably whiter and they feel as smooth as after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>i do like the chrome on the body and the top of it as opposed to the plastic on prior models.  </li>
            <li>I tried OralB before and quit because the brush head rotates and rips your gums more  - OralB is an entirely different technology.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this toothbrush I felt like I was walking out of the dentists office.</li>
            <li>The handle is elegant and avoids the criticisms I had for my earlier model.</li>
            <li>Its the first electronic toothbrush for me</li>
            <li>This was my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>The battery is as advertised and last many weeks.</li>
            <li>I love the multiple settings.  </li>
            <li>Had my first one for more than 3 years before it finally gave up.  </li>
            <li>First the lights started to fade away</li>
            <li>months later, I&#x27;m trying to decide if I should shell out more cash for this brush, or buy another model or brand.</li>
            <li>This Sonicare has an open ring around the power button where if you get water in it will damage so you have to make sure you don&#x27;t get anything inside it.</li>
            <li>It cleans really well!</li>
            <li>You can even charge it straight from the travel case!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a smaller, more compact stand, and it definitely looks better in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I loved mine for the first few months.</li>
            <li>First off, let me say that I have never owned an electric toothbrush before this.</li>
            <li>It did take a couple of days when I first used this to get use to it.  </li>
            <li>manufacturer claims my gums will feel better after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>It comes with two brushes, pretty neat, and the travel case is pretty.</li>
            <li>My dentist said they do a better job by reaching in smaller spaces, and I agree.  </li>
            <li>Our teeth feel cleaner and they are really whiter!</li>
            <li>first Sonicare had a battery that died 13 months after I purchased it.</li>
            <li>(the first Sonicare had NiCad batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you travel the case is simple , elegant and</li>
            <li>The first wore out after years of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It saves so much time at the dentist!</li>
            <li>The glass charging cup is pretty nifty too.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product specifically because of reviews that said it was a better option for those who don&#x27;t floss religiously.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars only because it was probably better than not brushing at all.</li>
            <li>The first set lasted over 7 years.</li>
            <li>just bough a set of two of the more basic Philips Sonicare (Philips Sonicare Elite Rechargeable Premium Edition Toothbrush) for $70 at Costco for my parents.</li>
            <li>So I figured bigger must be better...</li>
            <li>Not so much!  </li>
            <li>I bought my first one on the recommendation of my dentist.</li>
            <li>Combined with regular oil pulling, there is nothing better.</li>
            <li>used it for almost three weeks, twice a day, off the first charge.</li>
            <li>My dentist encouraged me to buy my last Sonicare which I enjoyed for years.</li>
            <li>This is my third Sonicare, and they just get better and</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was quite a surprise.</li>
            <li>There is nowhere for mold/mildew stains to grow and it just feels fantastic in action.</li>
            <li>I could tell my teeth were cleaner after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I eventually lost my first DiamondClean after about a year.  </li>
            <li>It was holding up just as well as the first day I got it.  </li>
            <li>and it is very confortbal !</li>
            <li>It was the only one that said it cleaned plaque better than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off to charge it for the first time.</li>
            <li>The first use removed a lot of plaque that my manual and Rodent didn&#x27;t seem to reach.</li>
            <li>I will most likely not purchase another Sonicare Toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li>(They did not offer me a confirmation number the first time.)  </li>
            <li>first came from a higher end oral-b electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Regardless, my parents used to rave about their top model oral b until one visit I picked up some standard sonicare brush heads to they could try my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Ok so this thing is totally legit!</li>
            <li>and I know my dental hygienist is going to pleased on my next visit.</li>
            <li>Phillips replaced my first brush that I had owned just under a year when it stopped working.</li>
            <li>I really like that it holds a 3 week charge, too!</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with a sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li>I have been using Sonicare tooth brushes since they first came out, this is my 4th.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t imagine how much difference this would make over a manual brush!</li>
            <li>and I like the different options you are able to select by just pushing the button.</li>
            <li>it did tickle one area at first, but after 2 days, i got used to it.</li>
            <li>We have been using it now for several years and still really love the product.  </li>
            <li>The first day I used the brush three times.  </li>
            <li>I only wish I had known this years ago because I would be a lot better</li>
            <li>Much better than standard electric brush.</li>
            <li>So I bought the more up to date styles where there was a smaller chance of that happening.</li>
            <li>This Diamondclean brush is the REAL DEAL!</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s deal with the elephant in the room first -</li>
            <li>Your mileage may vary ;-)</li>
            <li>it would be that the travel case uses a _mini-USB port_ INSTEAD of the more universal _micro-USB</li>
            <li>bought this after being told by the dentist (first visit in a decade)</li>
            <li>Dropped my first one once and it broke.</li>
            <li>I have been using sonicare since the first generation came out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do it much sooner!</li>
            <li>Planned obsolescence best describes this expensive disposable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>While expensive, it is a perfect example of the view that &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>people have really begun to notice my smile.</li>
            <li>My first challenge is in the finish and lack of contours on the handle.</li>
            <li>Really well packaged product!</li>
            <li>I only wish the brusheads were cheaper :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make sure current users do not become overly worried by this post:  </li>
            <li>However, it seems plausible that there may be some effect through a mechanism such as the interaction of the electro-magnetic force on the iron within cells.</li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;ve been using this brush I can definitely feel it does much better job at cleaning the teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The charging systems are pretty neat too.</li>
            <li>I love it at first sight and first use!!!I used to use several model of O&#x27;s toothbrushes</li>
            <li>I have tried them all, but I mainly use the regular clean setting,and my teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li>I have used the clean and white modes so far, and both make my teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Nothing that I have acquired in a very, very long time does so much concrete good, does so much to enhance my health.</li>
            <li>Then you use it and get the clean and again WOW!</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean, just like a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li>A full charge can provide a few weeks of use, but the battery does begin to die more quickly the longer you use the brush (after 1 year).</li>
            <li>It has a very powerful cleaning and gum massaging action.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful but not harsh.  </li>
            <li>Just a pure white and very light unit, until you turn it on and status information glows through.</li>
            <li>I also use the polish after clean, for an extra clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use the polish after clean, for an extra clean feeling.     </li>
            <li>If I forget to bring my Sonicare and have to resort to a regular toothbrush, my mouth doesn&#x27;t even feel clean, not compared to the Sonicare clean I am now used to.  </li>
            <li>My previous Sonicare had rubber around most of the body and that made for a secure grip.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re the only one using the toothbrush, you&#x27;ll be storing them someplace less than ideal, and they&#x27;ll probably fall down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Diamond clean makes me feel like I just got back from the dentist clean</li>
            <li>The built in timer really helps to give all of your teeth the right amount of bruching time.  </li>
            <li>Amazon did me right again and all the reviews really helped me make up my mind on a purchase that was not inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>it gives milder cleaning than the Triumph,Philips dose not provides  floss action with their&#x60;s brush heads which I liked very much,  about 8days after first 24 hours fully charged the yellow led started flash</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how the Sonicare will perform long term, but I&#x27;m very pleased with how it is working so far!</li>
            <li>It feels comfortable and very natural in my hand, the start button is easy to push, and the overall look of the toothbrush is sleek and minimalist.  </li>
            <li>However, this amazing toothbrush makes it possible to brush your entire mouth with the same effective motion.  </li>
            <li>It is nice, but it has more settings than what I feel are necessary such as for polishing, sensitive gums, etc.  </li>
            <li>design is very appealing but only one major flaw.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for days between charges and the stand is very small but works great.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating takes a little getting used to but the sensitive setting works great to ease you into it</li>
            <li>I have been using a standard electric toothbrush for many years, and I have long wondered if the sonic toothbrushes were all that much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I can&#x27;t compare this brush to other electric toothbrushes for how effectively it cleans, I like</li>
            <li>There are plenty of cheaper options (including other Sonicares) that will be just as effective in cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wish i hadn&#x27;t spend this large amount of money on a toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t work half as good as my $20 sonicare that I bought from CVS.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, clean, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it moderately wet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a middle aged man that works with hand tools all the time and has great hand/forearm strength.</li>
            <li>I have owned four different electric toothbrushes previously, but this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Let me put it like this: after using it my teeth feel as clean as when I go to the dentist for a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>I think my mouth has never ever been this clean using the old school toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old Sonicare with this Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li>Clean, polish, sensitive, etc.  </li>
            <li>Then, it quit working - it will turn on but vibrates so softly that it doesn&#x27;t clean at all.  </li>
            <li>This unit is considerably easier to clean than those like the Elite that have a screw on head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When finished, my teeth feel just as clean as if I had had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>all of them clean and sensitive</li>
            <li>Then I realized that the cost of repeated dental visits and potential of having to wear dentures in the future overshadowed the cost of a good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The five different programs are more than adequate for everything that you might want, from a deep cleaning to a quick polish.  </li>
            <li>assembles quickly and easily, getting the brush-head on and off is as simple as pulling it off and then lightly snapping back on when you need it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, this thing pretty much scared me at first.</li>
            <li>With my old electric toothbrush, the travel case was so chintzy I immediately threw it away, but this case is nice enough that it looks like something you would buy separately for another twenty or thirty bucks.</li>
            <li>With my old electric toothbrush, the travel case was so chintzy I immediately threw it away, but this case is nice enough that it looks like something you would buy separately for another twenty or thirty bucks.</li>
            <li>I kept my E series fairly clean by unscrewing and rinsing out after every use, and I still do the same thing here - rip the brush head off and just give it a quick rinse.  </li>
            <li>You can disable this option if you&#x27;re already used to the feeling of a sonic toothbrush, but since I&#x27;ve only used manual toothbrushes, I really appreciated being able to ease my way in.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner and it seems to keep coffee and tea stains away better than my regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It replaces an 8 year old sonicare, and it definitely is better than the old one by quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Overall a nice and complete package.</li>
            <li>Its good, but doesn&#x27;t have proper instructions for using its various functions...</li>
            <li>Secondary acrylic stand if the cup is being washed (it is top dishwater safe), or is not your \\&quot;cup of tea\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>+ Secondary acrylic stand if the cup is being washed (it is top dishwater safe), or is not your \\&quot;cup of tea\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>We did have to search on the net for product info and detailed instructions but the effort was well worth it.</li>
            <li>After a few months of use I can&#x27;t be happier it cleans my teeth very well and feels good in your hand while using.  </li>
            <li>While many have complained about the one button design, I would respectfully recommend reading the manual.  </li>
            <li>First, let me talk about the design itself since this is pretty much what you will be paying for -</li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush is far better than my 10 year old Sonicare, which finality stopped</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner and love the different timer settings</li>
            <li>Not only do my teeth and gums feel super clean, but they feel healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really hope that this model will have an improved lifespan over the Healthy White model .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be updating my razor soon and will certainly shop Phillip&#x27;s products first.</li>
            <li>I already had a Sonic Toothbrush and was very pleased with it until Santa brought this little Diamond.  </li>
            <li>very pleased with it although it takes a little time getting used to the faster head rotation.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I prefer the charging stand because it is more compact and clean looking and keeps the tooth brush standing up straight, matching my other dental tools, instead of leaning against the large glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new design is sleek and clean; I love the all white look and the lit up settings, real classy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit high, but it&#x27;s totally worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment if it saves you from even just one cavity, so I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>The price is high but worth it.</li>
            <li>In spite of high price for a toothbrush, it is worth spending on this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The aesthetics are also very nice--beautiful glass charger cup, which is easy to clean, and a small, light handle.  </li>
            <li>Tell you what, the first time I brushed my teeth with this new Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean Toothbrush, I instantly fell in love!  </li>
            <li>To the contrary, I feel incredibly lucky to be 59 years young and never even had a cavity!</li>
            <li>One feature that would be great to see would be an app that tracks how often its used and how long, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see that with this particular model - maybe in the future.</li>
            <li>So far I don&#x27;t find any special acrobatic techniques needed to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>but I could buy a lot of conventional toothbrushes for that kind of money.</li>
            <li>The first week or so my gums were a bit sensitive, but that went away rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>for the toothbrush&#x27;s functions, I can tell you flossing isn&#x27;t nearly such an arduous chore, as the toothbrush is simply that effective; the &#x27;clean&#x27; setting does its job remarkably well...</li>
            <li>It definitely looks like it could have been made by Apple, it looks very cool.</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews, I chose this one.  </li>
            <li>I hesitate to mention anything positive about the oral b, but that one stuttered the brush at the two-min mark, then just kept on going.  </li>
            <li>Wrote Philips as positive before against another brand toothbrush (when mine was you know, working) but will have to recant that statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>That said, it works very well and my teeth definitely feel very clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>This was not uncomfortable -- just very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even learn how many times to press the button and just count because it depends on how long it is since it stopped</li>
            <li>your teeth feel cleaner and they are just more powerful than other brands.  </li>
            <li>love using this toothbrush, and feel that this technology will go a long way towards improving my dental health without increasing the time that I need to spend on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally called Sonicare and they told me they would replace the unit within 90 days of purchase, but couldn&#x27;t replace it with a different unit that might fit my hand and mouth better.  </li>
            <li>Well, from the first try my teeth feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I had this happen on my first brush, it slipped out of my hands (As it is a very sleek design) and fell into the sink</li>
            <li>After about 11 months she had to have hers replaced due the same thing I experienced.  </li>
            <li>I had an Oral B first, then I bought my wife a Sonicare E series that she didn&#x27;t like as much as my Oral B, so we switched.  </li>
            <li>When I explained my problem—that it was taking too long for me to get a replacement toothbrush—I explained to Lisa that I am a physician and that if it might result in better service, she could transfer me to the physician customer-support group.</li>
            <li>exactly a WEEK ago so there shouldn&#x27;t be any real build-up.  </li>
            <li>so I was really overwhelmed, at first, when using the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>As this is my first electric toothbrush, I can&#x27;t really compare.  </li>
            <li>It tickles at first, but my teeth really do feel cleaner all the time now.</li>
            <li>After trying many different electric brushes from many brands I decided to buy this Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;The price is not very accesible</li>
            <li>induction charger don&#x27;t interest you though, save the $$ and get the FlexCare as I really don&#x27;t feel much of a difference in the cleaning of the toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>After using this new brush, my teeth feel absolutely cleaner!!  </li>
            <li>The top metal shaft that holds the brush head attachment and causes the brush to vibrate became loose over time on the first two handles that I have used.</li>
            <li>So if you pack the brush head while damp--which often happens when traveling--it stays damp, in a dark, tightly enclosed space--the perfect conditions for promoting bacteria and mold growth.</li>
            <li>So if you pack the brush head while damp--which often happens when traveling--it stays damp, in a dark, tightly enclosed space--the perfect conditions for promoting bacteria and mold growth.</li>
            <li>Light appears when charging necessary  + Options backlighting done via LED, making display very bright, but also using less electricity  + Gorgeous travel case that doubles as an in-case charger when connected to the USB cable  + Handles a wide range of Philips brush heads, including the diamond clean, sensitive, deep clean, and other models  </li>
            <li>(they used to be quite yellow), they feel incredibly clean and fresh after brushing with the Sonicare Diamondclean, which no manual toothbrush can ever replicate.</li>
            <li>it does clean my clear very</li>
            <li>That said, if you&#x27;re just looking for function, my sense is that the toothbrushes that are a step or two down are equally effective.</li>
            <li>This brush really cleans; my teeth don&#x27;t feel this clean after professional cleanings.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for an older model, Sonicare Healthy White.  </li>
            <li>The other home charging option is to use the included charging glass, which also fits on top of the charging plate (you can put either the charging stand or the glass onto the charging plate), and allows you to sit your toothbrush in a glass as many people do, and charge it at the same time.</li>
            <li>Now I will have to replace it, but I think you might be pleased to know it has lasted so long!</li>
            <li>I Love the different setting on it and it has more power than the other sonics that I have had.</li>
            <li>LOVE the travel case you can plug into your computer for charging for long business trips!  </li>
            <li>Love the long charge that it holds!.  </li>
            <li>I think the little glass idea is too cute!  </li>
            <li>I did deactivate the easy start, since I have been using oral B model for the last 3 years.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s enough for me, I&#x27;m easy.  </li>
            <li>toothbrush is much more powerful than your average battery powered unit.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve owned every generation, and until the flexcare generation, each one has served me loyally for years until the batteries were just too old or the buttons would literally wear</li>
            <li>easy to get the brushes from local stores.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the charging glass really works, and the case is cool too.</li>
            <li>powerful to clean the teeth and gentle in the same time,&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>It gives a tingle on the lips which I had to get used to (easy enough) and does a thorough job.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the matte black model so that&#x27;s what I picked</li>
            <li>I just came back from my first tenting trip of the season and the charging case was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am very particular about my teeth and from now on I won&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare has a much subtler vibration mechanism than the Braun, and I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that my teeth still get Sonicare clean, there are some major design flaws with this brush.</li>
            <li>But then one day a month or so ago, part of a tooth got chipped off because of a large cavity</li>
            <li>Also, because of the one button if you want to turn it on just temporarily to get water out after rinsing it you have to wait a certain amount of time or press the button like 5 times till it turns off.</li>
            <li>I certainly intend on using the diamondClean.</li>
            <li>all the pros outweigh the cons by a large margin.</li>
            <li>The travel case with USB charger / AC adapter is a smart idea</li>
            <li>Are they making a large profit off these.</li>
            <li>certainly wouldn&#x27;t replace a functioning Sonicare with this model.</li>
            <li>certainly wouldn&#x27;t replace a functioning Sonicare with this model.</li>
            <li>, they sent me the new updated version and it has more power and the battery last for weeks and weeks.</li>
            <li>This new model has more of a uni-body shell that contains a gap only around the power button itself.</li>
            <li>If it moves SLIGHTLY the LED battery light will stop glowing and the menu options will light up.</li>
            <li>My previous electronic toothbrushes don&#x27;t even compare to this one and now I&#x27;m hooked and even the feeling afterward is different than any I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  </li>
            <li>best electric toothbrush other hands down!!</li>
            <li>The reasons are because the Oral-B spinbrush covers more surface area of the teeth as compared to Sonicare, its spinning action seems much more gentle than the excessive vibrations of the Sonicare TB.</li>
            <li>If you can afford it, I would definitely buy this product, but if not the other sonicare brushes are amazing too!</li>
            <li>which is not a full substitute for flossing but its amazing how much junk comes out when you use the water flosser.</li>
            <li>I should point out that my husband go the same tooth brush a month or two before I got mine and his is fine.  </li>
            <li>The fix was moving onto fine German engineering, Oral B 7000 model.</li>
            <li>I have been traveling for a month, and the recharger works just fine in different countries.</li>
            <li>I had an older Sonicare, but started with lowest setting first.</li>
            <li>I have used electric toothbrushes and water flossers in the past and nothing seemed to be that exceptional.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to clean though and to recharge, it takes hardly anytime to recharge it maybe an hour or two and its ready to go for another 2 weeks with repeated use.</li>
            <li>My main gripe is the handle is made out of ceramic and is SLIPPERY!</li>
            <li>Battery life is exceptional, I travel for work and usually go weeks in between charges.</li>
            <li>If you insist on Sonicare get an older version, not this POS!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush and its case have a $150 &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; to it - very high quality materials with a sleek look.</li>
            <li>It felt like I received a professional cleaning from my dentist on the first brushing!  </li>
            <li>At first I was unsure if I wanted to spend the extra money for the Diamond Clean model</li>
            <li>did i mention its high tech pretty?</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to, but really is superior to brushing the old way.  </li>
            <li>and I agree that it&#x27;s hard to improve on a product that was already so good.  </li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare products exclusively for years but this new product is by far significantly improved.</li>
            <li>I would give this new modern &amp;#34;space age&amp;#34; looking one 5 stars if it had ANY place to store more than one toothbrush besides the flat travel case.</li>
            <li>They are the green ones in the middle, which appear to be both thinner and more fine than the outside white/blue bristles and are also more densely packed.</li>
            <li>Great, hard, modern, classy, travel case, which can also be used to recharge toothbrush with USB connection.</li>
            <li>my dental hygienist says Sonicare toothbrushes are a bit better than Oral-B. Certainly more delicate and logically as or more efficacious due to the very soft bristles and the very high frequency it oscillates at.</li>
            <li>This is my second Sonicare toothbrush, and I have to say it is a huge step</li>
            <li>After just a few days my teeth were whiter &amp; it really does an amazing job of cleaning between teeth.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m perfectly happy with this Brush, I&#x27;ve had it several months now, and purchased one for my wife a few weeks after being the family guinea pig.  </li>
            <li>Definitely makes a huge difference in dental visits</li>
            <li>Very disapointing product, since then have swiched back to the advanced care and just bought a brown to test it</li>
            <li>Where I do think there is a huge improvement over the last model</li>
            <li>overall, it really does leave my teeth smooth like having come from the dentist.</li>
            <li>This is such a huge improvement over that model</li>
            <li>If the packaging hadn&#x27;t been plastered with design awards I&#x27;d have given it an extra star but Philips seem to think the design is important so it deserves to be penalized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a review for the DiamondClean version, not the whole Sonicare line.  </li>
            <li>If the packaging hadn&#x27;t been plastered with design awards I&#x27;d have given it an extra star but Philips seem to think the design is important so it deserves to be penalized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a review for the DiamondClean version, not the whole Sonicare line.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>But my real gripe?  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t dropped, or mishandled (haha) in any way.  </li>
            <li>I did enjoy how it brushed..</li>
            <li>It is however, much more grippy when wet.</li>
            <li>so she was always on me that I should floss that I wouldn&#x27;t have so much plaque</li>
            <li>Really like Sonicare</li>
            <li>The Sonicare seems much gentler than the Oral B brushes.</li>
            <li>He said he wants to die with all his teeth.</li>
            <li>The latter are freely available for about $15 on the web</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really do look forward to brushing now</li>
            <li>The travel case protects the toothbrush and charges straight from a USB port on your computer so</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>The vibration is intense, and you&#x27;ll feel a tingle or tickle while using it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>It does look very</li>
            <li>If Value for your dollar is important, this is definitely not the model for you.  </li>
            <li>I had a cheap battery operated brush before this, but it&#x27;s no match for the constant battery power of this machine!</li>
            <li>As a &amp;#34;tool guy,&amp;#34; this is a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; tool, not some gimmicky toy, while being safe and clean and easy to use with minimal practice.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it too.  </li>
            <li>This brush really did whiten as promised, and polished, and removed plaque like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The travel case and computer charger are nifty, the sensitive setting useful</li>
            <li>I can say that research really payed off.  </li>
            <li>The real problem is that teh \\&quot;smaller\\&quot; brush is not being offered anywhere, not Amazon and not even at Phillips&#x27; website ([...]).</li>
            <li>Never realized I had so much plaque in hard-to-reach areas.  </li>
            <li>I use the glass cup for my retainers, and don&#x27;t really need to charge the brush often, so just leave on the counter.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel lighter and so much fresher.  </li>
            <li>Every time I brush my teeth, they feel smooth and sparkle like I just left the dentist!</li>
            <li>It really does help your teeth.</li>
            <li>Usability leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>I was like &#x27;is this really going to charge?&#x27;</li>
            <li>The whole thing smells of flash and modern.</li>
            <li>My teeth, tongue, and the whole mouth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go into too much detail</li>
            <li>In fact, I can say with honesty that even three times a month would be giving myself too much credit.</li>
            <li>These bristles are arranged in a semi-geometrical orientation that really scrubs and cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li>Very cool!&lt;br</li>
            <li>uses to gradually and gently acclimate the user&#x27;s mouth to the sensation of using a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The vibration is far more intense, has multiple &#x27;levels&#x27; of cleaning purposes and it is sleek and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, I had no intention of spending this much for a &#x27;toothbrush&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It gives off a very determined but gentle hum that varies with the cleaning program I select.</li>
            <li>that really matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say much about the whitening feature</li>
            <li>I really dig the charging station.</li>
            <li>Real design work all around.</li>
            <li>Real design work all around.</li>
            <li>The bill cost almost as much as this toothbrush (I had been eyeing it for awhile), so I thought &amp;#34;I&#x27;m going to pay this now</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I like the whitening setting; it really makes a difference in reducing my coffee stains.</li>
            <li>NONE of those have been dropped, and I can personally vouch for mine and my wife&#x27;s being drop free.  </li>
            <li>It really makes you miss an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really makes you miss an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself I really like &amp;</li>
            <li>really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>The unit was the modern model that i wanted, it came and nodamage and worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Your teeth and gums will really feel it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t keep the unit constantly charging, but instead give it an overnight charge after the status light turns amber for a couple of days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because the case itself can charge the toothbrush with a USB cable, one need not be concerned about how much their toothbrush is charged before a trip.  </li>
            <li>The form factor is so much improved.  </li>
            <li>Someone at Philips should bring this feedback to the attention of the people I&#x27;ve named herein (assuming the names are real and not aliases), and should overhaul the management and training of the customer-support department.</li>
            <li>This brush does a lot of the work for you and is very thorough.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>2 Stars because it cleans teeth really well.</li>
            <li>are much whiter, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Charger is really convenient.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Possibly the Advanced Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sensitive might be useful</li>
            <li>2 minutes later, my teeth feel as smooth as glass.  </li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s mostly used for travel so no real</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s mostly used for travel so no real</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I really like the features of the travel case and the charger cup.</li>
            <li>Got it because I travel so much</li>
            <li>but this one goes much easier on teeth.  </li>
            <li>You can really feel the difference as you race your tongue across your teeth.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge much longer than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans teeth very well.</li>
            <li>The unit itself brushes your teeth very well.</li>
            <li>This cleans your teeth really well</li>
            <li>Their customer service is also very rude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really speechless</li>
            <li>The same situation with battery on my Philips goLITE BLU Light Therapy Device.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, and my dentist cleanings have been much easier.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would ever spend this much money for a toothbrush</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>It will hold two brush heads for travel, but you could include heads for the whole family in ziploc bags if needed.</li>
            <li>I really like the plastic it&#x27;s made of</li>
            <li>problems with the seller either - fast and efficient service</li>
            <li>Gentle on the teeth and gums, but my teeth were never cleaner.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the gentler Diamond brush and bought another one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>For the price I expected a lot more.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift &amp; it was very well received.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the charging cradle.  </li>
            <li>just remember that all the different brushing will light up when charged for you to pick...</li>
            <li>However, the ergonomics and practicality team must have not had much say.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>teeth and gums feel much cleaner and healthier.</li>
            <li>device comes with a number of very snazzy accessories.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;+ USB charging can be accomplished either by using supplied plug-in USB a/c convertor or by plugging USB cable into a computer&#x27;s USB port&lt;br</li>
            <li>Available in white and black&lt;</li>
            <li>Battery level light appears only when you need to recharge, so you can&#x27;t tell how soon that time will be coming up (i.e., no three-light power level</li>
            <li>USB charging can be accomplished either by using supplied plug-in USB a/c convertor or by plugging USB cable into a computer&#x27;s USB port  + Travel case has built-in USB port so charging can occur while brush is sitting inside travel case  + Ceramic-like finish to brush</li>
            <li>- Battery level light appears only when you need to recharge, so you can&#x27;t tell how soon that time will be coming up (i.e., no three-light power level indicator)  - Travel case</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get this much quality for a lower price.</li>
            <li>Need to be careful with the handle to avoid touching tooth.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to warn anyone that have to deal with Philips warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dentist asked what I started using haha.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: Two weeks of phone calls and lies and today they agreed to refund with no guarantee of how much I would receive.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it very often because I&#x27;m travelling a lot from home</li>
            <li>I can feel how much smoother my teeth feel and provide the sense of cleanliness.</li>
            <li>It buzzes lightly every 30 seconds to tell you to brush a different quadrant.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;which wear out too fast.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Really, the idea of spending this kind of cash on a toothbrush seemed absolutely ludicrous to me up until a few weeks ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>About a month ago it really started loosing power even though the power indicated</li>
            <li>I think the feeling comes from the gentle vibration of the toothbrush, which stimulates your gums as you are brushing.  </li>
            <li>The concept of putting your toothbrush in a glass to charge it is neat, but I haven&#x27;t seen the real advantage to this over the USB Charging/Storage Case.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has multiple modes (although I only use the basic one) but does a great job.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to give this toothbrush 5 stars, but I just couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>do you really need to upgrade to this model?  </li>
            <li>I always question if it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I missed it SO much with the oral b.</li>
            <li>The recharger is so convenient - my toothbrush is always ready to go.</li>
            <li>After two years of use, the power button on the handle had become so unresponsive to operate, that it required a very forceful two-thumb push to turn on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You never see that in photos of this toothbrush, and I was very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and on schedule.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s in your mouth and ready to use, you CANNOT look at the handle to see what mode you are in.</li>
            <li>It is a fabulous visual as well as ergonomic design which makes looking at it and using it a pleasure.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any real problems with having to change the mode while brushing.</li>
            <li>i can keep the machine  much cleaner.</li>
            <li>The sonic vibration is intense and takes a couple days to get used to</li>
            <li>I really like the design</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothbrush and bought one for my special-needs 21 year old son who hates brushing his teeth, He especially likes the gentle gum massage which is an area the dental hygenist recommended he show</li>
            <li>Also the charger cup is really convenient as well for those at home time.</li>
            <li>I got it to my wife as a Xmax gift, however it arrived a worng item with in ... very upsad and need to get a replasement asap..</li>
            <li>They both said \\&quot;very good.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend this much money on an electric toothbrush but having used it for a couple of months</li>
            <li>but I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li>My mom likes it so much.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to charge in the glass cup and box.</li>
            <li>Yes, it brushes teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>It finally broke and wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all except the bottom light in the settings on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of getting used to, but the product works really well.  </li>
            <li>Should I really have to do that with a top-of-the-line toothbrush?</li>
            <li>really?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Somebody in the Netherlands really messed up on this product.  </li>
            <li>after brushing your teeth feel &amp;#34;polished smooth&amp;#34; and really shine like they do when the dental hygienist cleans them.  </li>
            <li>Also, my teeth do not seem to build up as much staining.  </li>
            <li>I would be very hesitant to buy Philips products again.</li>
            <li>I have to say he was absolutely correct.  </li>
            <li>Amazon delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much brushing &amp;#34;crud&amp;#34; accumulate, but just keep that in mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you really feel you need to change settings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you really feel you need to change settings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so much so that I had to wrap it in a towel and stuff it under 3 pillows in my living room in order to not hear it?</li>
            <li>- how much time do -you- want to spend with your dentist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I upgraded and compared and really found no difference.</li>
            <li>They have not worked for me, and you end up with a harzardous mercury laden bulb you have to dispose of responsibly.</li>
            <li>And of course it works really well.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between</li>
            <li>Call Philips and they replace it, with several legitimate and relevant questions asked.  </li>
            <li>I really like the travel case and the timer is very helpful.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I really like the features and the glass charging glass</li>
            <li>It is a very &amp;#34;well-thought-through&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I much prefer the selection button and the on and off button to be seperate rather than having to cycle through the whole brush style to turn off the tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>After usage the power and the selection button have become very sensative and turn on and off by itself, just by shaking the unit.  </li>
            <li>The whole unit is sleek and updated in its feel and design.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it for my whole family if i could afford.</li>
            <li>the Sonicare, when you get used to the tickles in your mouth is a gentle, thorough cleaning and it leaves your mouth feeling like you just came from your dental hygienists office.</li>
            <li>issue could really be one of two things (or in this case both)...</li>
            <li>Works very well with the glass charger.  </li>
            <li>Cleans thoroughly with no fuss and charged and ready to go each time.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works really well.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush does all it&#x27;s said to do and does it very well.</li>
            <li>I am ready to switch to another brand.  </li>
            <li>I really like the toothbrush - 5 speed head.&lt;br /&gt;Recalls</li>
            <li>even my dentist noticed how much healthier my gums were</li>
            <li>There are multiple settings that change the length of brushing and based on the sound of the toothbrush, the frequency in which it moves.</li>
            <li>It really helps the gums and stuff.</li>
            <li>The many bits and pieces that came with the unit are not really needed either.</li>
            <li>It really is a fantastic toothbrush, and is a much different experience.</li>
            <li>the short term, the Sonicare has made my daily routine relaxing and fun, making me more inclined to brush.</li>
            <li>do really like the brush</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This thing is intense.  </li>
            <li>Not really bleaching your teeth, of course, but I do feel cleaner by brushing for slightly more time.</li>
            <li>The design is very sleek and modern.  </li>
            <li>but can you really overspend on hygiene?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this on the charger for six days straight</li>
            <li>The UV-sanitizer sold with some models is also a gimmick, and doesn&#x27;t really do what&#x27;s claimed according to my research.</li>
            <li>Also fast shipment.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I had to replace the last of my Ultrasonex II&#x27;s, because they are no longer available</li>
            <li>I also found the travel box to be very</li>
            <li>/&gt;The magic backlighting, the ceramic finish, the minimal conductive</li>
            <li>I really wanted to buy this</li>
            <li>As the product is only used 4 minutes per day, some users may feel comfortable with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>BETTER RESULTS THAN I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li>I have replaced it with the Sonicare Flexcare+ model since it uses the same brush heads, and am liking the rubber grip and light feel.</li>
            <li>The DiamondClean toothbrush really performs well.</li>
            <li>My mouth really does feel cleaner than with manual brushing.</li>
            <li>I would have liked 2 of the regular brush heads instead of one regular and one</li>
            <li>but it looks like it would be just as effective as the standard size, but a bit smaller.</li>
            <li>For regular use in your home bathroom, there is a charging plate that plugs into your wall with the standard 2-prong power socket, and you can put the included clear plastic charging stand on the plate which is a good looking charging option, and is what I use.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush has several settings so you can adjust the vibration to your own personal preference.      </li>
            <li>I love the different settings and programs it offers.</li>
            <li>This makes the toothbrush start softly the first couple of times you use it and ramp up in intensity over the first 14 uses.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a dying Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrush, the kind with a round head.</li>
            <li>I like the many settings it offers along with the 30 second intervals.</li>
            <li>The charge is on point after the first full day of charging (required)  2 wk&#x27;s 1/2 almost 3, but in all fairness, I didn&#x27;t wait till the 3wks was up before putting the brush back on the charger.</li>
            <li>Hope for the amount of money spent, this will be a good lasting investment.  </li>
            <li>They indicate that if I don&#x27;t change the overall health of my gums, they&#x27;ll want to do more frequent visits with some sort of gum care routine.  </li>
            <li>I liked the toothbrush enough to buy another one, but this time I sent in the 2 year warranty with an extra 6 months.</li>
            <li>Sonicare is a great brand and really stands behind their products.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>It kind of tickled my gums, but I got use to it after a few days.  </li>
            <li>when its running low you can still get about 15 more minutes of use before it completely</li>
            <li>i really dig the matte finish on the body for more of a grip when wet.</li>
            <li>It does a remarkable job keeping the buildup of tartar down and if used regularly twice a day with a whitening toothpaste, it does lighten your teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides these points, the other reviews about the product quality is very accurate.</li>
            <li>Great brushing action, but the material is very slippery unless wet (which is odd but true).</li>
            <li>Also of note, these brush heads can fit on the HealthyWhite and most likely some other Sonicare brush handles, but not the Essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a lower-power mode that you should use if your teeth or gums are sensitive and you feel discomfort using the other more powerful modes.</li>
            <li>After hours and days of research about electric toothbrushes, I found this product with high positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I first got this toothbrush at a steep discount when I was new to non-traditional toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>The cleanness you can clearly felt right away. .</li>
            <li>Not to mention, it&#x27;s easy to see considering how long the handle is?  </li>
            <li>Use this brush after a water pick nightly if you want healthy, white teeth and dentist-shockingly clean, pink gums.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite, though it cost twice as much as any other.  </li>
            <li>It has a modern look, and clean simple feel.  </li>
            <li>The vibrations are lot softer now - clean mode is like sensitive mode and with the sensitive mode almost nothing happens.  </li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t really care, I just wanted to get them as clean as possible.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even wait for the full 24-hour charge; I just brushed my teeth after four hours on the charger, and it was pure heaven.  </li>
            <li>I found that I had no problem using the system, that my gums felt better, and that my teeth did look whiter, as promised, with no other product (such as a whitener) needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first used the Diamondclean, I knew this was no ordinary electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also an adapter that lets it stand vertically, but you need to make sure you always put the handle back exactly the same without rotating, because it won&#x27;t charge if it&#x27;s not 100% aligned.  </li>
            <li>The power button and timer could be a bit more intuitive (as other reviews have already mentioned and covered in detail).</li>
            <li>The design of this toothbrush is second to none and is reminiscent of the minimal, yet beautiful, design of Apple products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth better than any other manual/electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>it cleans extremely well and the design is appealing.</li>
            <li>During that time I used two different Sonicares, the original one and the Elite.  </li>
            <li>But my first Sonicare over a decade ago was MORE expensive and in todays dollars would be even more so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands of electric toothbrushes and never been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>works 10 times better than other electric TB.</li>
            <li>Other than that--very pleased with this unit.</li>
            <li>Registering the product allowed me to get a discount on some of the replacement heads, which was a better price for those than offered at Amazon or other sites/stores.</li>
            <li>With most standard toothbrushes you just generally brush your teeth but with the timed sequences that the Sonicare uses each quadrant gets 30 seconds and makes your mouth much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush about a month ago after a trip to the dentist and have absolutely fallen in love with it - although it does tickle the first few times because I wasn&#x27;t used to the vibration sensation.  </li>
            <li>I think it depends on the individual mouth, not all are easily accessible although I believe mine is.  </li>
            <li>The other night, I had a dinner party in our smallish but adorable apartment.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well for a little more than two years.  </li>
            <li>It is a step up from our other model, quieter and more versatile for traveling and charging.</li>
            <li>As a first-time user of Philip&#x27;s Sonicare series, I&#x27;m happy with this toothbrush, but I&#x27;m not sure if I want to spend so much money again when I need to buy my next electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Not only that, it has SIGNIFICANTLY improved the health of my gums.  </li>
            <li>Some body squeaking at certain angles and pressures (caused by the high frequency vibration that these devices use, but this could be improved)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some body squeaking at certain angles and pressures (caused by the high frequency vibration that these devices use, but this could be improved)  </li>
            <li>I love that each setting as it&#x27;s own timer, so I always get the same amount of cleaning time, no more, no less.</li>
            <li>It used to take her almost an hour to clean her teeth with a regular toothbrush, but with Sonicare it literally takes seconds.</li>
            <li>Clean, white, gum care, polish.</li>
            <li>To clean the brush, I turn it back on and rinse and turn it off.</li>
            <li>If you ever brushed with Sonicare, you&#x27;ll never forget the clean</li>
            <li>I am finding I seem to prefer the Clean and White mode.</li>
            <li>The mechanism had again somehow disengaged partially, reducing the vibration by 90% and making the Sonicare more of a normal toothbrush with a vibrating handle.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s in - clean, white, polish, etc.</li>
            <li>But, I used the smaller head that comes with set to clean my engagement ring and eternity band.</li>
            <li>While I do like the diamond clean, I think my next electric toothbrush purchase will be a Oral-B spinbrush.</li>
            <li>i recently &#x27;upgraded&#x27; to this diamond clean system from the sonicare &#x27;flexcare&#x27; system.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of Eve in the Wall-E movie with its clean white finish and glowing graphics.  </li>
            <li>This is my second diamond clean.</li>
            <li>and I recently replaced it with the Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li>But let me tell you, 2 minutes is enough and your teeth will feel completely clean.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s a big difference in clean feeling across my teeth.</li>
            <li>Leaves teeth feeling extra clean.  </li>
            <li>I can tell a big difference in how clean my teeth are after using this one vs. the Oral B.  </li>
            <li>Multiple modes, and a really clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I like the various modes: Clean - Whiten - Polish - Gums.</li>
            <li>The display lights up with clean, white lights.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this, you will never feel clean going back to manual brushing.  </li>
            <li>I wonder about it&#x27;s ability to clean between teeth as the bristles seem short.  </li>
            <li>and she commented that it was obvious because my teeth were so clean.  </li>
            <li>deep clean your teeth~~best gift ever</li>
            <li>My teeth have never been so clean and white from any electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>brush is on par with my last brush, I like how sleek and clean the connection between the brush tip and the body of the brush</li>
            <li>there are five brushing modes, but i don&#x27;t use all of them (only Clean and Gum Care).</li>
            <li>At first the vibration seemed too much but after the first few days it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Good but not really better than my old one</li>
            <li>Not sure how to rate the product but as far as Phillips they were good to me.</li>
            <li>this is a good product, maybe just a tad expensive but cool productl</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying for something that is good, but this unit is just as good as my very much less expensive Elite unit.</li>
            <li>Super ergonomic features and smart buttons makes it very simple to use.  </li>
            <li>I loved it until it broke down on me last month.</li>
            <li>The single button design is a non-issue, and easy to use despite what some have said.  </li>
            <li>The main thing I realized after recieving this toothbrush is-- there are people out there leading such exciting lives that they need to recharge their toothbrushes with their laptops!</li>
            <li>What is interesting is that the CSR said other (older) models do.</li>
            <li>Using the sensitive setting on this toothbrush gives a better clean than I got in the past and doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling like they vibrating afterwards.  </li>
            <li>If they send us new ones we&#x27;ll keep using them, but for a $200 we expected more.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m yet to figure out the Whitening mode do I need a special or just regular tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I recently had oral surgery and beforehand had a special cleaning with a ultrasonic-esque pick.</li>
            <li>My teeth always feel super clean after brushing and the timers on the brush setting help me to remain diligent when brushing; even if I&#x27;m half asleep.  </li>
            <li>It reaches the back of the mollars, between the teeth and is super gentle with the gums.&lt;br /&gt;The timer helps you focus in the way you brush.&lt;br /&gt;Yo</li>
            <li>The product has a free 2 year warranty upgrade included as long as you register the product by 12/30/2015.  </li>
            <li>I have owned a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for as long as they have been available.  </li>
            <li>And even at that, I can not last the full amount of time it specifies.</li>
            <li>They give you a small plastic stand or a realyl nice glass to use as a charger.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today, so far dissappointing experience.</li>
            <li>Brush size nice and small.</li>
            <li>The extra power settings are probably overkill unless you have a medical need for more gentle brushing at times.</li>
            <li>The cool factor is definitely at work here, a portable charging station that you can also use to rinse out your mouth when you are finished.  </li>
            <li>The first brush I ordered stopped working completely after about two years.</li>
            <li>first this just seems to move far faster and leave teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li>Far and away, this one had STELLAR ratings.  </li>
            <li>The price kind of made me shutter, but the reviews made me look past that and go for what the brush can do for my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why Philips has dropped the accompanying UV cleaner, as I know a lot of people liked having that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see if this is true when I go back in 3 weeks for a cleaning.</li>
            <li>about the product: it was my first electronic toothbrush, so I was really surprised about the feel of it.</li>
            <li>First, I purchased the brush at a professional discount</li>
            <li>I did have to send in the original unit to Philips as it quit working after about 1 year for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li>Has several settings and recharges by sitting in a cup which is cool.</li>
            <li>of the special features this brush offers is the gentle-on feature, which, for new Sonicare users, starts the brush on first use on a low-power mode, gently increasing the power over the next 14</li>
            <li>The travel case is a high quality plastic on the inside and really unique on the outside, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s made from a highly durable nylon.</li>
            <li>Clean adds another minute for a total of two and White adds thirty more seconds for a total of 2 minutes, 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>My last Sonicare brush had to be constantly charged, so it wasn&#x27;t easy to travel with - luckily that is fixed in this model.</li>
            <li>If you are not hard on it, and just use it gently while you brush, you can get a lot of mileage out of it.  </li>
            <li>on top of that it broke down in one year.</li>
            <li>First, the cleaning ability of this brush far surpasses the older unit it replaced.  </li>
            <li>My only concern with my brush (and in full disclosure this particular model hasn&#x27;t given us any issues)</li>
            <li>it pulses a little more gently.</li>
            <li>This new toothbrush removed all of the plaque and tartar from my teeth!  </li>
            <li>This new model is the bomb!</li>
            <li>really like this toothbrush, its my first professional electric (had a cheap Oral-B battery operated one for under $10 but not very good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that I do recommend if you want to have a toothbrush that really works and easy to transport.</li>
            <li>It has greatly improved my gum loss particularly in the hard to reach back teeth.</li>
            <li>Further trials of good quality are required to assess the superiority of other modes of action for powered toothbrushes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to spend so much money on a new toothbrush, but after reading reviews decided to take the plunge.  </li>
            <li>I had never used an electric toothbrush before so the whole experience was new to me.</li>
            <li>If you are new to the whole electric toothbrush scene as I was, give this a try</li>
            <li>This is 10 times better than the previous model solely in performance.</li>
            <li>In terms of style, the brush is more streamlined and minimalist than my previous toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so less food is able to build up.</li>
            <li>I prefer the charging stand because its more compact and takes up less counter space.  </li>
            <li>They keep changing these things and this one is better than the previous versions but there are still some issues.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush but it just died over the weekend - two and a half years after purchase so it is is now out of warranty.</li>
            <li>Love the styling of it (black) .</li>
            <li>The best way for me was to use the case to recharge as it took up less space on the sink counter and was less likely to be knocked over .  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price was the most competitive price I could find, much less then at retail stores.</li>
            <li>Lovely glass cup holder adds a touch of class (and functionality) to a mundane device</li>
            <li>Lovely glass cup holder adds a touch of class (and functionality) to a mundane device  </li>
            <li>To me, it takes up less space and fits into a corner better.</li>
            <li>It seems I spend less time cleaning, but my teeth get 10 times more brushing coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m debating on whether to just downgrade to the model just below this one, as the extra cost doesn&#x27;t really seem to be worth it.</li>
            <li>I simply can&#x27;t get over what a tremendous toothbrush this is.</li>
            <li>I always would turn it on for a quick second after I rinsed the brush off.</li>
            <li>And since the pause only works after it&#x27;s been in the same setting for like 10 seconds, the alternative is selecting the setting before you put toothpaste on, standing there and holding it for 10 seconds running just to be able to pause it, to then put toothpaste on it.</li>
            <li>This is a decent electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after having an older model sonicare brush for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li>then even the older Sonicare did.  </li>
            <li>In fact, about three weeks ago I had my teeth cleaned professionally, and I still had some light stains on my upper teeth.</li>
            <li>Heck my gums looks much better than my last dental visit, I can&#x27;t wait for my next dental cleaning appointment to hear what my dentist says.</li>
            <li>my teeth actually feel cleaner and look much  better and healthier, compare to a regular electric toothbrush of course</li>
            <li>Older models had separate buttons for power and mode, and I find that design preferable.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I thought the more expensive product would be more reliable.</li>
            <li>I travel internationally for busniess and carrying one more charger is a total PITA.  </li>
            <li>Decently put together.</li>
            <li>, I will probably buy one of the older models.</li>
            <li>It has lots of features and a clever charging station design.</li>
            <li>Regret that parts from older models are not compatible.  </li>
            <li>this one is super quiet.  </li>
            <li>I have my doubts as to whether a different method of brushing could actually make my teeth whiter or more polished.  </li>
            <li>For the amount of money my husband spent getting me this as a gift, I would have liked to have a longer lasting product.</li>
            <li>But not the newest, most expensive, and most featured Diamondclean.</li>
            <li>The ceramic-like power handle, which I thought might get slippery during usage when wet, actually maintains a nice grip to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ceramic-like power handle, which I thought might get slippery during usage when wet, actually maintains a nice grip to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My main issue with Sonicare toothbrushes are their batteries.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The case was designed to charge the brush, so a form fitting interior was necessary in order for the handle to make proper charging contact.  </li>
            <li>Yes it was more expensive than most of them.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it was time to retire my older e/pre-e series brush.  </li>
            <li>I have used their earlier version for years and it finally gave up the ghost after more than 5 years.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded from my classic Sonicare solely because its aging battery no longer accepted a charge--about 10 years after purchasing it.</li>
            <li>The battery issue is a known issue with this particular product - but Philips will not acknowledge the problem after the two year warranty expires.</li>
            <li>then my older sonicare.</li>
            <li>I love the &#x27;white&#x27; setting because it gives you an extra 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>I believe the triumph had something similar but this tooth brush is more sleek, smaller brush head and way cooler</li>
            <li>She had an older model and when it broke I got this for her, and LO &amp; BEHOLD, her dentist and his Dental Hygenist</li>
            <li>the different settings you can have more time or different brushing vibrations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though Phillips boasts a 3 week charge I feel better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li>Ultimately at this point in time I&#x27;m okay with the extra cost because I am using the things that came with the brush.</li>
            <li>Ultimately at this point in time I&#x27;m okay with the extra cost because I am using the things that came with the brush.</li>
            <li>It also does not access all areas of my teeth as well as their older brush head models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>quieter than older</li>
            <li>I had the older model  </li>
            <li>You would think an international company, Philips would be able to handle the exchange locally overseas.  </li>
            <li>For instance, I&#x27;m sure the defective unit I send them will be patched up &amp; sent out to replace someone else&#x27;s mis-functioning unit, only to stop working a short time thereafter.</li>
            <li>The different settings on the brush are all the same power level so none of them are better at preventing this than the others.</li>
            <li>I used this brush for 3 months prior to my most recent Dentist visit and the Dentist asked &amp;#34;Wow, what did you change?</li>
            <li>Love the feature that notifies you when you have brushed 30 seconds and it&#x27;s time to move to the next quarter of your mouth!!!</li>
            <li>When the most recent one died after 9 months, I decided to go back to Sonicare</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my older Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mainly because of how emphatic my friend&#x27;s friend, a dental hygenist, was about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The older battery/charging mechanism deteriorated to the point that the toothbrush no longer functioned at an acceptable level.  </li>
            <li>Right now I am switching back and forth between these two brushes to see if one works better than the other for me.  </li>
            <li>I had been reluctant to spend so much money just for a toothbrush, but I was very surprised to that</li>
            <li>Our dental hygienist recommended this toothbrush to my husband and I. Not only did she use and love it, but we discovered that pretty much everyone at our dentist&#x27;s office had switched from any/all other electric toothbrushes to this one.</li>
            <li>I bought a Keurig  coffee maker from Bed Bath and Beyond a few weeks later and with special price and store coupon it was a better price than Amazon</li>
            <li>in all, based on the charging options alone I highly recommend this over the older FlexCare model.  </li>
            <li>It may not be the original one you bought, but Sonicare will ensure you get a replacement as long as you are within the warranty period.  </li>
            <li>It may not be the original one you bought, but Sonicare will ensure you get a replacement as long as you are within the warranty period.  </li>
            <li>And I mean that in the most complimentary way.</li>
            <li>Even if I&#x27;d had to pay the full retail price of $210, it would have been worth it.malist than my previous toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Originally, I thought the USB charger was a silly idea, but USB wall outlets are becoming much more comercially viable, and I even have a few USB outlets on most of my surge protectors, so I could actually see myself using this feature eventually.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this toothbrush after reading all of the reviews and seeing photographs of it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They do sell replacements, though, and they are not too high priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>There is one model which I believe has a separate button for this task, and if you prefer to change options frequently, I highly suggest you opt for that model.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would \\&quot;highly recommend\\&quot; to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone that travels for a living like me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>My sister highly recommended this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>While they both have essentially the same engine in them (31,000 strokes per minute), the newly designed brushes seem to do a slightly better job.  </li>
            <li>Has a few new features that my old one didn&#x27;t have which was nice.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are noticeably whiter, and they just *feel* clean, all day long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strange experience to wake up in the morning with your teeth still feeling completely clean.</li>
            <li>The two brushes I now own were still less than half the price of the DiamondClean, and my teeth get just as clean.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for a really long time and gets your teeth really clean.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums, and this toothbrush seems more gentle than the Oral B I previously used.  </li>
            <li>Sensitive mode runs for 2 minutes at less power to be more gentle on teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes with a standard bathroom glass and a flat glass hockey-puck piece, either of which have fitted bases to sit on top of the charging unit.  </li>
            <li>It may be rather expensive, but honestly,  this toothbrush is well worth it!</li>
            <li>For the price differential, I think this offers a lot in the way of cosmetics and gimmicks, but nothing that merits such a significant increase in price.</li>
            <li>DO NOT buy the Dental Professional Model!!</li>
            <li>However just today, the replacement after a little more than a year again, the battery becomes defective.</li>
            <li>Going to the local college of dentistry for my dental work and my student dentist recommended I get one of these because after brushing my teeth for almost 60 years evidently I still wasn&#x27;t getting how to do it!</li>
            <li>This one - wow!!  </li>
            <li>I also briefed my wife on it as well as my parents, telling them that they better not drop it as it would void the warranty and even a little drop would break</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe it does look a little bit like an Apple design.  </li>
            <li>Sure UV can kill the little grubbies but over time they can also mutate and become stronger.</li>
            <li>&quot; then that would make a little more sense.</li>
            <li>To me the diamond clean is a bit too much, I have to use the sensitive setting and still it can be a little powerful for me.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and some crowns, so I was worried about starting out immediately with the clean setting.  </li>
            <li>I like the various settings that run through cleaning, whitening, gum care, sensitive and I can use it to clean my tongue with my problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The toothbrush has several brushing speeds, including: clean, polish, whiten, and settings for gum care and sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>The DiamondClean is compact, lightweight, quiet, the brush bristles are soft, and it leaves your teeth feeling extremely clean after use.</li>
            <li>I am totally surprised at how clean, white, and shiny my teeth are after about two weeks of using this brush.</li>
            <li>My teeth have the same squeaky clean feel they do when I&#x27;ve had them professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are 5 modes; clean, white, polish, gum care, and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I find the handle extremely well balanced and easy to hold and manuever.  </li>
            <li>If you are so inclined, the brush head is small enough to clean the top of your tongue, which some hygienists recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Naturally, this toothbrush works extremely well and cleanses teeth easily and expertly.</li>
            <li>Hard to bring myself to say that a toothbrush warrants this kind of praise</li>
            <li>Also worth noting that large red letters across the front of the box read \\&quot;Dental Professional Trial - NOT FOR RESALE\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I personally think the price is worth it and HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li>And if you do take your chances and buy this thing and then almost certainly wind up with a shattered charging cup like me and many others, then be prepared to call the awesome folks at Sonicare to try and buy a replacement cup, only to be told that the cup is the ONLY componentof this stupid toothbrush set that you can&#x27;t buy replacements for AND even if they do find a replacement cup for you, it isn&#x27;t covered by the warranty....</li>
            <li>My new toothbrush is a replacement for an older model Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I kept my old sanitizer which works very well with this.  </li>
            <li>This is where the real cleaning action happens.</li>
            <li>Now my pearly whites are really pearly white and people are astounded and don&#x27;t believe that a toothbrush could make such a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Even though it is expensive this has been a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit that I was concerned with two things about this model: no On/Off switch, and a smooth surface which I wondered if it would be slippery when wet.  </li>
            <li>One thing I really appreciated about this model was the \\&quot;Soft Start\\&quot; feature.</li>
            <li>But I did not spend this much money to be completely out of a tooth brush in 25 months.</li>
            <li>and so far, I really do like it.</li>
            <li>But all in all - I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone and everyone I know who is in the market for a great (albeit expensive) toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I went to a store to compare both the 5000 and this one and the 5000 seemed to weigh far to much for me to</li>
            <li>It is a bit intense until you get used to it, but in just 4 weeks my gums are far healthier and no longer bleeding when I floss.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great but expensive.</li>
            <li>Still so,e brushing capacity but reduced to begin with , but hardly worth it with the cost of the possible hearing loss.  </li>
            <li>and she said this was normal.  </li>
            <li>she said it was just for marketing purpose photograph and that the gap is normal.  </li>
            <li>To switch from the Normal mode to the Gum Care mode, I have to put toothpaste on the brush, put it in my mouth, and then hit the button 4 times.  </li>
            <li>This brush gives me that fresh mouth feeling I could only get from the dentist before...</li>
            <li>2 minutes of brushing your teeth normally then 30 seconds of polishing your front teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit is worth the expense, dental work is overpriced, as you know; this solves that headache in the future by fighting it in the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would have liked 2 of the regular brush heads instead of one regular and one smaller.</li>
            <li>- I just thought the feeling I had after brushing was normal.  </li>
            <li>But this toothbrush is absolutely worth it: after I brushed with the Diamondclean, I felt like I&#x27;d had my teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never using a normal toothbrush again.</li>
            <li>We are purchasing a few more for Holiday gifts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure some of it is redundant</li>
            <li>B009PIJV1W Crest 3d White Arctic Fresh Rinse 32 Fl Oz]</li>
            <li>Had it for a few years now... Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the small head on this brush, it makes cleaning your molars much easier.</li>
            <li>but you get what you pay for, and to keep the battery in its tip top shape always charge it everyday.</li>
            <li>a normal charge lasts about a week.</li>
            <li>I have used the ORAL-B units for at least 15 years and was pretty satisfied with them (each lasted about 5 years), though I did find that sometimes there was still some food at my gum line when finished.  </li>
            <li>Overall, worth the money.</li>
            <li>was able to feel the difference within few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery is listed as a three week duration, assuming normal use.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I would much prefer to have the mode switch as a separate button from the on/off as it can make things a bit messy!</li>
            <li>It is not cheap but it works better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use normal toothbrush anymore</li>
            <li>so perhaps it&#x27;s worth the occasional mishap.  </li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Electric toothbrushes have come a long way and this toothbrush actually looks sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li>I normally stay between \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;White\\&quot;, anyways.</li>
            <li>If you have extra cash go head and pick this up, it&#x27;s worth it, but it&#x27;s not an impulse buy.</li>
            <li>I was so worried about regretting this purchase but after a few years, I still feel confident about this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it dries just as quickly as a normal toothbrush...  </li>
            <li>- it comes with a USB charger (as well as the USB adapter to plug into a normal outlet).  </li>
            <li>you open the box the first impression is how sleek and modern it is .</li>
            <li>Only downside is it&#x27;s pricy, but if it lasts, then it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice to at least have a place to store the cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would have been nice to at least have a place to store the cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are different settings, and if you are sensitive, there is an option to ease into the full power for two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I do not think it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>now it basically a normal toothbrush for me now....</li>
            <li>I got it to help do a better job of brushing my developmentally disabled daughter&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>When you figure the costs if you use generic brush heads it is not much more than it would cost to buy a good toothbrush every three months.</li>
            <li>This is very expensive, but I have to honestly say I love it.  </li>
            <li>I brush with the Sonicare twice daily on the whitening cycle, and that gives me 8 days worth of brushing.</li>
            <li>When I put normal pressure on it to brush, it has no power.</li>
            <li>After much research online I decided this would be the best toothbrush for me and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li>And the charging method is also fancy enough for people who like pretty, modern design.</li>
            <li>I just thought that it was normal.  </li>
            <li>well after my last Oral b triumph stopped working after I dropped it, I decided try someting else, there are not many options -- Oral B or Philips, after few days of search I bought a HX9332-- the retail vision not the one in the white box, however after I opened the box I found on the brush handel it says HX9340(a Canadian vision？） after first few days of  use, I really liked it, the handel feels good even better than my old Triumph,  </li>
            <li>Minor aggravations include the tiny brush head, which is OK for cleaning around one&#x27;s teeth but makes &amp;</li>
            <li>I must say, from the vert first use, my teeth felt much cleaner than with regular brushing or with any old-fashioned electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>used many different electric brushes and this by far wins hands down.  </li>
            <li>anti bacterial construction, after 3 years of daily use it still looks new, the battery is great too it lasts for weeks and even after the low battery warning you can still go a few days</li>
            <li>This model has multiple charging options which I first thought was kind of unnecessary, however, I decided I like it; especially the option to charge using a computer - so easy when travelling.  </li>
            <li>My sister-in-law has the Sonicare and described it as giving your teeth \\&quot;a whole other level of clean...</li>
            <li>The very small brushhead manages to get around my 4 wisdom theeth very easily and cleans very well in between teeth.</li>
            <li>I expected problems adjusting to the vibrations such as I had experienced before with other purchases, but to my amazement, the brushing was smooth as silk and quieter than expected.  </li>
            <li>If I manually push it the other way it is fine.</li>
            <li>My old one used to have a setting for that, but not the new modern one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased a new one myself after the first one died, because it was just barely out of warranty.</li>
            <li>Power button has a deeply curved design that is easy to use (no fumbling with finding and properly pressing a button to get the brush to turn off)&lt;br /&gt;+ Three-week use period before charging is needed</li>
            <li>Power button has a deeply curved design that is easy to use (no fumbling with finding and properly pressing a button to get the brush to turn off)  + Three-week use period before charging is needed  +</li>
            <li>Has a much more vigorous brushing action than previous models I have used.</li>
            <li>Several things that I like about this brush are that it is quiet and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are easy to find at various local stores.</li>
            <li>Smooth n powerful, i find myself brushing longer than with any other brush incl standard Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is single issue or not, but Philips service is excellent that I got a new one when I reported to the Philips service center.</li>
            <li>The only solution is to count the number of times you press the button while the toothbrush is in your mouth and hope that you guessed right.</li>
            <li>The inductive charging system within the rinsing glass is very effective, although the cord is a bit bulky and may be difficult to leave plugged in at all times.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it it so much that I look forward to brushing my teeth everyday!!!</li>
            <li>Feel clean and refreshed all day long, like a professional cleaning (xcept u r not going to gag becuz</li>
            <li>When the second shipping arrived and showed the same problem, I put it away from the metal cabinet and it charged fine.  </li>
            <li>the outer body has cracked from the small rectangular hole in the threads at the top of the main body, so of course the vibration noise has increased.  </li>
            <li>the overall clean feeling is roughly the same, although the new diamond clean system has a much cleaner design.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how all the different settings brush differently, but the brush looks great and does its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The small head makes it easy to clean teeth in the back of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Other than the snafu with the travel case, it does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my first electronic toothbrush, and I have to admit that it&#x27;s far much better than common plastic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush a little over two weeks ago and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not much different from my old model (flexcare), but the battery pretty much died so I needed to make a new purchase.     </li>
            <li>, I had two, one died and I needed to buy a new one</li>
            <li>But, to my surprise, I was connected immediately to a live rep without having to navigate through 10 minutes of prompts and press this and press that.  </li>
            <li>The charger is that new type where you just drop it in the provided charging glass and it charges by electrical conductance or something.</li>
            <li>so I replaced it at home with the new DiamondClean model.  </li>
            <li>I now know that even when new the Oral-B was infinitely inferior to the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was the charging unit and we were sent a new one at no cost immediately.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s something I can live with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found with this new design</li>
            <li>Whoever designed it must have one bathroom per family member - or live alone.</li>
            <li>it was time for a new one</li>
            <li>My hope now is that my gums will get happier now that I have my new Diamond</li>
            <li>All that was offered was 15% off new unit.</li>
            <li>I think Philips engineers their toothbrushes to breakdown in around 2 years when the warranty expires, which forces the user to upgrade and/or buy a brand new</li>
            <li>Amazon is sending a new unit now....</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I did not rate this five stars is the price of new heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m concerned w/ this new model the handle case would crack if it were dropped.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the new one lasts as it does not get</li>
            <li>(The new one is noisy too.)</li>
            <li>There is nothing that you can do except to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of the new design for the DiamondClean, I don&#x27;t like the cup charger, because it collects water after using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>After using an electric brush for years the experience of the new Phillips Sonicare was a revelation.</li>
            <li>If customer delight is what you seek, and you need a new electric toothbrush.....</li>
            <li>What was neat was it came with a new brush head also.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are contacting Philips to see if they will send us new brushes, so we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li>You can visibly feeling the change when you select a new setting.  </li>
            <li>Like the fact that it has the strip on the brush head to indicate when it is time to change to a new head.</li>
            <li>, They also advised I try a new brush head (additional expense) which I have done and it did not resolve the problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A friend told me about the new version, and noted that the travel case was also a charger, powered  through a mini-USB port.</li>
            <li>, Philips customer support refused to fix it or send me a new one.</li>
            <li>Ordered a new handle from Phillips-</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m using my new product without issue</li>
            <li>I have purchased new brush heads to no avail.  </li>
            <li>I went to buy a new Sonicare.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Somewhere along the line, I read that this new model will hold a charge for two weeks.</li>
            <li>I called to get a replacement and after a 20 minute wait and conversation, they agreed to send me a new handle.  </li>
            <li>No way to disassemble and fix means I have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>This new model has a change in design.</li>
            <li>Also the new brushes while giving an excetional cleaning do wear out a bit quicker.</li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a new toothbrush</li>
            <li>The regular type is so good, it is hard to improve on.</li>
            <li>The representative was fantastic, walked through several possible fixes and in the end they are sending us a new handle.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a huge deal especially if you use the same setting every time (though that kinda defeats the purpose of the selection).</li>
            <li>After brushing with this DiamondClean, my teeth feel as clean as they do after a polishing at the dentist&#x27;s office minus the grit from the paste they use.</li>
            <li>I purchased a cheap imitation once</li>
            <li>Whiter teeth in a week, less gum problems, easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really explored the multiple modes, but hey.. it looks sleek and modern on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>There is room for two extra brush heads that fit snugly into their designated areas and space for the toothbrush handle next to that.</li>
            <li>Overall I really enjoy the toothbrush, and I am expecting my next dental appointment to support this feeling.</li>
            <li>It works much better than I expected and actually saves me time brushing.  </li>
            <li>the supervisor gave me no tracking number which was suppose to be given to me 7-8 business days back and mentioned to follow back on Monday when the updated shipping detail will be available.</li>
            <li>When I called Phillips, they had a smart-mouth call me back and tried to make me think he was doing me a big favor by returning the product in the 30 day free return policy.</li>
            <li>I would have probably been better off buying a less expensive model as it would have done just as good of a job.</li>
            <li>The charging glass is simple enough to fit into any bathroom setting.</li>
            <li>The glass charger seems kind of silly; it&#x27;s just as easy to put the brush on a plastic stand, and I&#x27;m worried about knocking the glass (which will definitely break) over on the granite counter in bathroom.</li>
            <li>I liked having a few extra seconds to swipe around my mouth just in case.</li>
            <li>I liked having a few extra seconds to swipe around my mouth just in case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the charge last for about 4-5 days with regular use before you get the blinking orange light which means</li>
            <li>This model offers an upgrade over older models in that it does not let any liquids (water, toothpaste, spit) into the handle or under the brush head attachment.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and thanks to those of you leaving feed back</li>
            <li>I knew I had deep pockets and while pregnant I could barely tolerate keeping up with my normal regimen of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>love the little heads!  </li>
            <li>Not only it is better than other toothbrushes, but it teaches you to actually dedicate the right time to brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li>The reason for this is that my gums have a tendency to bleed, and I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>As a result, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the brush action that does such a great job or the sheer speed.  </li>
            <li>To put it simply, my mouth has never in my life felt this clean, and I will never, ever go back to normal tooth brushes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I just personally wanted something a little more powerfull, less bulky, and more</li>
            <li>When i pointed out that they had an obligation to take back faulty products that they have sold within the first 12 months, they relented and sent me a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>But this is their second new dental product in a row--the first being the AirFloss--that might lead you to think that Sonicare design was now being done by Apple.</li>
            <li>The center bristles are the special part of this brush head.</li>
            <li>We have resorted to using a normal manual toothbrush while we figure out what to buy to replace the broken DiamondClean handles, especially since our finances are not in the best place due to medical bills, and lets be honest, the Sonicare Toothbrushes are not cheap.</li>

            <li>Just like the professional cleaning or a little better as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>particular model has multiple settings: Clean; White; Polish; Gum Care and Sensitive.</li>
            <li>I made a huge mess while brushing my teeth when I don&#x27;t normally.  </li>
            <li>The exact same thing happened to me that happened to \\&quot;Organic</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>My first ten years of power brushing was with Oral B products (I&#x27;ve owned two of their models).</li>
            <li>In fact, I sent the first Diamondclean back to Amazon, thinking the battery was defective.</li>
            <li>I have only had the toothbrush for a few days now, but have been enjoying it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No excessive button pressing.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I used the smaller one first</li>
            <li>is my first and clearly my last Phillips brush purchase.</li>
            <li>, as soon as I was finished - wow!</li>
            <li>This is my first sonicare that I bought after my Oral B died after about ten years.</li>
            <li>If you happen to want to turn the brush off in the first 5-10 seconds after you start brushing, you run into the same problem.  </li>
            <li>I admit to being a complete gadget freak!</li>
            <li>much improvement and no regrets</li>
            <li>the very same day- before I even returned the first one.</li>
            <li>My first Sonicare lasted for over 5 years and was only replaced because the rubber was worn.  </li>
            <li>The one button design to switch between different brushing techniques would not be my first choice, but I dealt with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is nearly gone!  </li>
            <li>Small thing but cute.  </li>
            <li>You can feel the difference after the first use, especially coming from a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The cost for this specific unit is higher than I might have considered if I had not been using this brand and style of toothbrush for almost 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>normally so if I could have found my old one still, I would have reordered that.</li>
            <li>I generally avoid rechargeable appliances for this very reason</li>
            <li>Aside from Bill Murray, I&#x27;m not sure many of us do.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Brushes very well, all the setting are different and useful, if I had a choice I would make the head a bit bigger.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that I have been using sonicares for the past 9 years, and my teeth have never been in better shape.</li>
            <li>The 2nd button would select the mode and the first button would turn it on.</li>
            <li>After only the first use, I understood why they had all switched.</li>
            <li>My first Sonicare toothbrush, bought years ago, was designed to last, with rubber on the housing to absorb the shock of a fall.  </li>
            <li>first issue is that the USB recharging case doesn&#x27;t actually recharge the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Last night, I was awoken from a peaceful slumber by the dang toothbrush vibrating by itself in the bathroom...</li>
            <li>purchased this higher priced model for the travel case, I think some of the models below this one would do about the same with brushing.&lt;br /&gt;livefree</li>
            <li>this is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever used that actually leaves food between my teeth when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed an extreme difference in the health of my gums and my teeth appear more white.</li>
            <li>I just had my first check up after 6 months of using this device and my teeth have improved immensely.</li>
            <li>Either way Philips should know better/have a higher standard.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I do like all the settings (wow, it can do everything)!</li>
            <li>(Also UPS has better tracking options) but other than that I have no problems with this supplier and will be continuously doing business with this supplier in the future.</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d look forward to brushing my teeth, but WOW!</li>
            <li>At the exact same time (about 1 year)</li>
            <li>Having bought Philips Sonicare electric toothbrushes in the past,  I was confident in the product line.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve only been using it for just under two weeks), but there was a noticeable difference in the first week.  </li>
            <li>Speaking of, my last two (top of the line when purchased) brushes both came with UV sanitizers but that &amp;#34;option&amp;#34; seems to be left to lesser brushes at this</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is several inches taller than the cup, making the whole thing wobbly and top heavy.  </li>
            <li>, the improvement over using a manual toothbrush is minimal if you set a timer and do a full two minutes with the manual.  </li>
            <li>The new diamond care bristles on the brush seem to genuinely make a difference over previous models.  </li>
            <li>- The battery life has not yet made it to 3 weeks for me, simply only 1.5 weeks (on standard clean twice a day)    </li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush a few weeks ago and even upgrading from my older Sonicare, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.      </li>
            <li>but with several options: clean, white, polish.</li>
            <li>On Clean, it brushes for 2 minutes (30 seconds front and back, upper and lower).  </li>
            <li>B0086VIA3O Diamond Clean Standard Replacement]] and the InterCare Standard Replacement Brushes.  </li>
            <li>short, I simply can&#x27;t believe how clean my mouth feels after each use.</li>
            <li>I only use the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; setting, so if you just want to clean your teeth, you can buy a cheaper Sonicare brush that doesn&#x27;t have the extra settings.</li>
            <li>I have never felt a clean feeling such as this one, besides a regular dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>Because it has only one button and a relatively unbroken, uniform surface, it is easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li>look forward to trying some additional whitening strips as I now feel my brush can finally keep my teeth clean and white.</li>
            <li>Much easier to keep clean, not as heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that my toothbrush isn&#x27;t working one year and ten days after I bought it, but I chatted with Aaron at Philips Sonicare last night and he&#x27;s going to send me a new one.</li>
            <li>Once you turn the brush on and let it run for 5-10 seconds (which is about the amount of time it takes me to clean off after using it), the singular button WILL in fact turn off the brush rather than having to cycle through the other modes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other electric tooth brushes and none made my teeth feel this clean.  </li>
            <li>I grew up without dental care and thankfully the military has been able to provide me with some much needed maintenance over the years, but I&#x27;ve still struggled with an occasional cavity here and there no matter how often I brushed or flossed.  </li>
            <li>Use this daily along with the wife and we both love how well of a job this cleans our teeth compared to a conventional tooth brush.</li>
            <li>My old unit, one of the original larger heavier ones, finally stopped holding a charge at all.  </li>
            <li>naturally I got the new one since it can be charged on 110v-220v through a wall or usb in the case or out of the case.</li>
            <li>and I knew I would replace the old SoniCare with a new one from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No problems so far, working just as new.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sending me a new one by FedEx and are including a label to send the old one back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money - if I could get a refund, I would buy a new OralB.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t be fooled by little, good to nothing ads on, the same glass could be bought from other stores at much cheaper price and the support doesn&#x27;t keep your sink cleaner</li>
            <li>After tens of thousands spent on fillings, re-fillings, around 15 root canals and crowns, several re-canals and re-caps, and a couple of extractions, my new dentist strongly suggested I switch from manual brushing to a Sonicare and gave me a $10 store coupon.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing toothbrush to use-I&#x27;ve only used it for the past 3 days, but I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li>it also comes with a small clear disc which has a diameter of 2.75 inches which is much more streamlined.</li>
            <li>He could not tell me why Philips doesn&#x27;t provide a stand for the black model, he just confirmed that they don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I debated on brands and did all the normal research, which merely indicated they were almost the same, but finally I decided, why switch, the first one worked for a decade, if this one just works 5-6 years I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>the highest model!This is less nosier than O and feel so comfortable.</li>
            <li>If you are a heavy brusher this will help you go easy on your gums.</li>
            <li>I switched because although my first Oral B took many years before the battery stopped recharging, the second one I bought only lasted less than 3 years, which made me want to switch.  </li>
            <li>Not a huge deal, but I probably will not use the small one and for the price it would be great to have 2 heads.</li>
            <li>Not a huge deal, but I probably will not use the small one and for the price it would be great to have 2 heads.</li>
            <li>The small brush is not as effective as the larger one that I have been using.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the Phillips, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is almost equal in cleaning power to my dentist&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I used my first Sonicare toothbrush for nearly a decade before it finally stopped working.</li>
            <li>But, not bad enough for me to send it back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a fairly expensive option compared to many of the other electric toothbrushes available, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The pressets are easy to understand and the whole product has a quality that is hard to beat.</li>
            <li>the new handle is very cool, slick design, even slicker charging options, but did Sonicare have to remove features to do this?  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>charging system is very simple and designed for convenience; it fits easily on my bathroom vanity (in a bathroom the size of a tiny walk-in closet, mind you), and the travel unit is great, despite the fact that I travel very little - I like the compact for storing pieces I want to keep out of the way, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also of note; for people with small mouths (like me): this compact head truly is compact!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re much cheaper just w/o the glass, otherwise exactly the same and same warranty.</li>
            <li>All I need to bring is an appropriate USB cable (I use only that is only 6\\&quot; long instead of the supplied one).  </li>
            <li>So far, my teeth feel so slick and glassy, and my breath minty fresh, that two minutes is worth it.  </li>
            <li>like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-It comes with two heads, one is the compact diamond brush and the other is the full size.</li>
            <li>A whole new brushing experiance and leaves your mouth feeling amazinly different than using a manual brush.  </li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t order a new Sonicare fast enough!  </li>
            <li>Was worried because of some negative reviews regarding switching brushing modes, but found it to be rather straight forward and easy.</li>
            <li>I was following the instructions in the paperwork included with the brush, but I found something online that said also to tilt the tip of the brush toward the teeth slightly, if you encountered this, to enable the bristles to reach between teeth better.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the FlexCare, it has a slightly thicker diameter but is overall a bit more ergonomic.</li>
            <li>The pink one I purchased as a gift did not have the plastic stand, which is nice because it takes up less counter space.</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to my next dentist appointment to see if they agree at what an extraordinary job this toothbrush does cleaning my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily the stuff is simple enough...</li>
            <li>particular product arrived just in time for Christmas as my older unit was on its last legs.</li>
            <li>While my teeth certainly feel clean, I&#x27;m not sure my gums are getting the coverage they had with the Braun.</li>
            <li>I understand it is a lot of money to throw down on a toothbrush, but I can assure you that it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Apparently there is no difference in charging power, so I assume the difference is mainly a matter of aesthetics.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get the DiamondClean as a gift, since my FlexCare model had died recently (prematurely--disappointed about that), but it didn&#x27;t take long to fade.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Hygienic Travel Cap&amp;#34; is a clear plastic cap engineered to fit tightly around the bristle end.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Hygienic Travel Cap&amp;#34; is a clear plastic cap engineered to fit tightly around the bristle end.</li>
            <li>Only problems though are that it does have to align a certain way</li>
            <li>so you just need to rotate it a certain way and remember that&#x27;s how you left it.</li>
            <li>To find out which of the programs you&#x27;ve selected, you have to read the little words on the handle that light up.  </li>
            <li>I do say that $220 full price for this toothbrush is a bit ridiculous, but amazon price is a little more reasonable.</li>
            <li>This makes me believe that the toothbrush is designed to last a little more than a year (warranty time), which is highly unreasonable for such a high cost.  </li>
            <li>I guess U.K. call centers are less user friendly than the USA.  </li>
            <li>Using the brush wasn&#x27;t hard it was mostly charged</li>
            <li>Hardly any need for the scaler tool at my check up and my gums are in better condition as well.</li>
            <li>This one is hard to give appropriate stars for.</li>
            <li>I expect a very high grade for brushing the next time I get a cleaning, too.  </li>
            <li>even my two years old Triumph can still gives a little more two weeks of brush after a fully charge,it gives me 7 days on the second charge,  </li>
            <li>Luckily my brush is on the other side of the sink from the outlet, but if you had it near the outlet you would have this bundle of wire in the way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+ Handles a wide range of Philips brush heads, including the diamond clean, sensitive, deep clean, and other models</li>
            <li>The brush head is small and easy to maneuver in tight places (I do not know why they make so many toothbrushes as big as push brooms!)</li>
            <li>even though this is CLEARLY their design issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for nothing, Philips Sonicare...</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be clear on the *function* though: The thing works well as do the others in the Sonicare line-up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be clear on the *function* though: The thing works well as do the others in the Sonicare line-up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really eager for my next appointment in Spring 2012 to see if my anecdotal impressions are borne out by a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>I calmly explained to them that my Father-In-Law was NOT A TIME TRAVELER and he had not somehow traveled into the future, bought their Sonicare DiamondClean, and then traveled back in time 18 months before release of the DiamondClean.  </li>
            <li>The way it works is like this: after one choses the mode one wants to use -- by pushing the button to cycle among the various modes (i.e., Sensitive, Whitening, Cleaning, Gum Care) -- the DiamondCare operates in that mode for the completion of the cycle.  </li>
            <li>This cleans you teeth very well, but I did not notice it DOES NOT take the same brush heads as my old one.  </li>
            <li>The charger is a clear glass with a plug.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel exceptionally clean and polished in comparison to my previous Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Each of them performed great and lasted about 7-8 years before the battery finally started to fail.    </li>
            <li>Toothpaste and water always managed to get in over time and it was an annoyance to clear.</li>
            <li>The manual clearly states that the brushing cycles are divided into four parts (one for each quarter of your mouth).</li>
            <li>The manual clearly states that the brushing cycles are divided into four parts (one for each quarter of your mouth).</li>
            <li>From the beginning, I have felt that this toothbrush didn&#x27;t clean as well as previous models; however, I second-guessed myself thinking &amp;</li>
            <li>Like the options to hold the brush and the fact you can charge from the clear stand, glass, or in compact carrying</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s far too much to pay for a toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t last, and that has a built-in battery</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had problems with old electric toothbrushes not lasting the whole trip and</li>
            <li>but the charging / storage system for use with the toothbrush in the bathroom is COMPLETELY WACK.  </li>
            <li>If you think you might have a cavity, start of gum disease, or sensitive teeth, start out by using the sensitive setting.  </li>
            <li>review applies to the Dental Professional Model - NOT this</li>
            <li>They said because I bought the Dental Professional</li>
            <li>The old one lasted  5+ years.</li>
            <li>Naturally, the handset is completely sealed with no non.destructive way to change the battery.</li>
            <li>so it has a natural tendency to escape your grip.</li>
            <li>When I read on the box that the toothbrush could be charged by placing it in the glass (which also functions very well as a glass to hold water to rinse your mouth out with), I stepped back for a moment, thinking I had entered the twilight zone!</li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t make direct contact with the charger.</li>
            <li>Again, the brush is not in direct contact with the charger.</li>
            <li>Except for Sensitive mode, the difference is the amount of time the brush stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery lasts, well, not quite forever, but nearly.</li>
            <li>The brushing action created an immediate sensation throughout my mouth</li>
            <li>And my teeth felt cleaner than if I had just been in for a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>So far no complaints.</li>
            <li>I like the product so far.  </li>
            <li>my teeth feel like they have had a professional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;had to learn the controls,  </li>
            <li>The design of the charger is inelegant (it looks ready to tip over any second) but serviceable.</li>
            <li>did that for a while until the battery finally completely died in it.</li>
            <li>gum care and sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been nearly a month</li>
            <li>old daughter</li>
            <li>It is very sleek and the handle is all white.  </li>
            <li>Quite aggravating after spending nearly 200 dollars.</li>
            <li>so I went to the dentist to get it fixed and afterwards, resolved to try a hardcore toothbrush to see if that would make a difference.</li>
            <li>There are also two additional modes that the toothbrush offers.</li>
            <li>In changing the design from two-buttons to one, they went too far.  </li>
            <li>For years I have debated whether or not to get an electric toothbrush, but I was pleasantly surprised with this one.    </li>
            <li>&#x27;just had a professional dental cleaning&#x27; feel in my mouth.</li>
            <li>this toothbrush successfully complete it&#x27;s intended duties?</li>
            <li>I had to start on the &#x27;training wheels&#x27; setting otherwise known as sensitive.</li>
            <li>This really is the total package.</li>
            <li>The timer helps you ensure that you are spending enough time brushing in each area of your moyth, and the fast movements feel like you are giving your mouth a massage.  </li>
            <li>The vibration of the toothbrush gave my mouth a strange feeling at first that I wasn&#x27;t used to, almost like a tickling but after a handful of times I got used to it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for nearly $200 and it worked well for around 12 months.  </li>
            <li>the difference between these two models is pretty minor</li>
            <li>I value design a lot, as far as functionality goes</li>
            <li>Even so, they refused to give him a replacement without the receipt/proof of purchase and it took me escalating it to darn near the CEO to get his replaced.  </li>
            <li>You can use the heads from the Pro Results line as well as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an upgrade from my old Sonicare model.</li>
            <li>No complaints at all so far.</li>
            <li>Storing it in a glass with an inductive charging system is brilliant...easy access, and frankly i don&#x27;t really know if the big cleaning device for</li>
            <li>She noted that they were brighter, and said they looked to be much cleaner than our last visit.</li>
            <li>Everything was packed as it should in a soft box case and everything in separate plastic bags.</li>
            <li>, else I wouldn&#x27;t have these old mercury filling these days.</li>
            <li>(this happens about once a week so far).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost completely stopped the plaque build-up</li>
            <li>I miss my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Marked improvement over the cheaper models.</li>
            <li>My smile was noticeably brighter/whiter after only 1-2 weeks of daily use and it feels like I got a professional cleaning after each use.</li>
            <li>My husband and I share this one, and we only need to charge it every 1.5 wks or so, which is very convenient.</li>
            <li>But I ended up giving it to my sister and reordering one like my old one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that she knows she loves, and I have one like my old BraunOral-B on its way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but then how would they be able to overcharge you for the replacements, duh.</li>
            <li>After years of various Sonic electric toothbrushes that lasted much longer (we kept upgrading for lighter models), he&#x27;s just ordered Oral Bs for both of us through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The function is really the same</li>
            <li>There are many hi-tech ways to recharge it, including this one way of putting it in this glass cup they provide, but it is a bit confusing to master.</li>
            <li>The vibration in my mouth was almost too intense and you can&#x27;t brush with you mouth partially open</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to work with the manufacturer to get it fixed, and its been about a month</li>
            <li>The only gentle setting is the &amp;#34;sanitize&amp;#34; setting.</li>
            <li>but there is a sensitive setting to help you get used to it.</li>
            <li>This product cleans, polishes, and whitens your teeth with additional cycles for gum care and sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>In fact it is quieter than the old model that we replaced.  </li>
            <li>It minimize professional cleaning by your dentist to once every two years instead of once every 6 month.</li>
            <li>is that it&#x27;s not intuitive to switch between functions (cleaning, polishing, sensitive, etc.).</li>
            <li>I called the warranty personnel, she was really fast and gave me a reference number for my replacement handle and instruct me to call back within 2-3 business days to receive my tracking number.</li>
            <li>Works reasonably well, but my dental hygienist tells me that my teeth aren&#x27;t any cleaner than when I was using a standard manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I share one and burned out one that was 5 years old.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for my existing Sonicare tooth brush, my old one after 5 years it wouldn&#x27;t hold charge.</li>
            <li>But the real proof will be if the office notices on my next visit.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel like they are professionally cleaned with every use.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t always make the complete 2 minute mark though.</li>
            <li>Wow, this product is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this happened unexpectedly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that they really have a different brushing style but</li>
            <li>Before purchasing Diamondclean, I thought the performance for both of the models  should be quite similar and didn&#x27;t expect much an \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>As a dental professional I have been using Sonicare for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t use them because they are hogwash (except maybe the sensitive mode).</li>
            <li>The brush-head was tiny, it was loud, the battery didn&#x27;t last more than 3-4 days, and I never really felt that ultra-clean like I did with the Flexcare.  </li>
            <li>My old one (A $60 dollar DazzlePro) burned out after about a year or so.  </li>
            <li>If you ask me almost $100 a year for a toothbrush is a complete scam.</li>
            <li>In early 2014 the shaft for the brush didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare died after 5 years</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the product is for Dental Professional Trial</li>
            <li>So, it isn&#x27;t possible to set it correctly to the brushing mode that you want when you are ready to start brushing.</li>
            <li>Another complete design failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are far cleaner and whiter</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would have appreciated a visual context to the comments</li>
            <li>I travel a lot for a living and it occurred to me that much of the time I was using a regular toothbrush, while my trusty electric stayed at home, not being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 5 year old Oral B electric brush died and for 6 months I used the hand brush.</li>
            <li>As days went by the pulsing action got weaker and weaker.  </li>
            <li>When my mouth is a bit irritated from the braces, I have the option of using sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It is heard to explain the technology - but in action, you just position the brush along the gum line and the bristles insert themselves between teeth.</li>
            <li>Plus, the charge lasts at least a week - perhaps more.</li>
            <li>All of that to say, this is a considerable upgrade.</li>
            <li>The product offers a two year warranty.</li>
            <li>old sonicare brush lasted for years.</li>
            <li>then my old sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li>I used a manual brush for a couple of days (disassembled the oral b early without thinking) and my teeth felt &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>However I picked it, I like it thus far,</li>
            <li>However I picked it, I like it thus far,</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s just my toothbrush vibrating extremely loudly on the porcelain counter in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>you already know how much cleaner you feel than when you wash your face without; if you don&#x27;t, I can only tell you that the difference is worlds apart.</li>
            <li>I had a periodontist&#x27;s nightmare as far as my teeth were concerned.</li>
            <li>I have only tried one or two of the settings, but the ones I have work very well.</li>
            <li>That, for a $220 unit, 5 months old.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have my first Sonicare electric toothbrush, I don&#x27;t know why it has taken so long to acquire a Sonicare electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I went from Sonicare to Oral as my old one broke, and Oral care brand just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me, so I found this beauty, and again , you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s prices</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li>After a number of years, the old Sonicare was showing signs of wear, although it was still working well.</li>
            <li>I also suffered from teeth sensitivity which has gone away completely since switching to this brush.</li>
            <li>I have been a user of the Oral-B Professional Care by BRAUN Rechargeable Toothbrush SmartSeries 5000 for a while.</li>
            <li>It has replaced the old brush.  </li>
            <li>after using this, my teeth felt like i had a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I know it sounds like a commercial, but they really work.  </li>
            <li>I like it a lot so far.  </li>
            <li>But when I tried this one, it simply gets my teeth so much cleaner than I could ever get them before, and without the abrasive scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>Completely stopped working after 6 months.</li>
            <li>Purchased product via Sonicare website directly.  </li>
            <li>My old Sonicare just died after about 6 years, I think...</li>
            <li>They should last much longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Teeth feel as though professionally cleaned each time you use it.  </li>
            <li>I am a bit old school and read directions about how things works and don&#x27;t want to go online all day.</li>
            <li>Would have saved me a fortune in professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>Wow, sonic is an understatement.  </li>
            <li>I ORDERED ALSO THE ULTRA SENSITIVE BRUSH HEADS 3 IN A PACK TO GO ALONG WITH IT FOR MY NEEDS.</li>
            <li>SO FAR.</li>
            <li>the feel the built quanlity and the floss action brush head are the reasons,</li>
            <li>Feels like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned every time I use it.</li>
            <li>my work backpack already weighs nearly 30 lbs</li>
            <li>The old one must have been 20-years old so I upgrade to the DiamondClean.  </li>
            <li>Set Came complete and on time.</li>
            <li>so I finally decided to take the plunge and figured if I was going to invest that much in a toothbrush</li>
            <li>- now I have to keep the old charger setup as well since it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip issue and power button are why I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars</li>
            <li>I threw my old oralb immediately.......</li>
            <li>The charge is supposed to be for 3 weeks, but so far has lasted me a month.</li>
            <li>Before using it I was never a believer that an electric tooth brush makes much difference as oppose to a regular one.</li>
            <li>I heard that proper gum massage can really improve the issue, which is why I got this brush.</li>
            <li>it is too early to tell and</li>
            <li>I have actually gotten compliments and am greeted with surprise every time I smile because my teeth were noticeably yellow before</li>
            <li>I think I initially received a lemon since the charge never lasted more than a few days.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this item it was not available in most local oulets.  </li>
            <li>Simple enough-- turn the brush on again for a fresh two minutes.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most expensive toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever bought, but I think it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>In addition to being beneficial and useful to the user, the toothbrush offered features that will no doubt be standard on future models.</li>
            <li>If you care anything about your smile or if you have spent a fortune on your dental care like I have, this item is a must.  </li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t want to waste money on a product that wasn&#x27;t truly worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Are those two features worth paying double for a basic Sonicare?</li>
            <li>Good produck but so expensive...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t always charge, and the brush base has to be in the perfect position for it to charge.</li>
            <li>the base was flawless in the thailand brush.</li>
            <li>Although it was expensive, I think this toothbrush was a good buy.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is expensive but does a good job.  </li>
            <li>When I actually received the product, I was really delighted by what was promoted as a feature to &amp;#34;ease in&amp;#34; to the vibration by starting at a lower level and then slowly increasing over the course of 14 days.</li>
            <li>is that most of my sonicare updates have been forced.  </li>
            <li>It is a good toothbrush, but for the money, it is quite expensive.  </li>
            <li>I have never had good luck with the \\&quot;refurbished\\&quot; product sent after a product fails.</li>
            <li>me just break something down for anyone who is trying to decide between this and a comparable Oral B brush: They will both remove plaque if you use them correctly, for the full two minutes twice per day.</li>
            <li>Years ago my Mom bought electric toothbrushes for my entire family on the theory that jaw-rattling fire hazards must be better for your teeth than plain old .99 cent drugstore brushes.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re not done brushing, just press the start button again, and it picks right back up where it left off.  </li>
            <li>I explained I have been a lifelong Philips customer, and my family still has 4 old Sonicare models that have lasted me 8+ years without issues, and that a sub 3yr shelf life for their &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; almost $200 toothbrush doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>I looked carefully at all the Sonicare models, which I think are confusing as to which is best to pick, and in the end chose the DiamondClean due to the nicer looking charging cradle and the smaller size</li>
            <li>I tended to get harder bristled standard toothbrushes and really scour my teeth to try to get them as clean as possible,</li>
            <li>I was barely covered by the warranty, and will receive a new handle.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the battery does last a week without a charge, so the inability to recharge on the road wasn&#x27;t a huge issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quick review of the &#x27;clean&#x27; setting:Thirty second intervals update you on what side of your mouth needs to be glorified, after a two minute adventure you are left with a feel that only a doctor&#x27;s office can attain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; However, after reading all the specifications and asking around about other products and checking out what was available in local stores, I took the plunge and ordered one.</li>
            <li>Not true, as long as it runs for more than 5 seconds.</li>
            <li>As for the price, yes it&#x27;s a little bit high but worth</li>
            <li>Her&#x27;s will turn on and vibrate a little, but it doesn&#x27;t clean teeth.</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time trying to figure out whether to get the diamond clean or stay with my &#x27;regular&#x27; Sonicare.</li>
            <li>brush has a few settings depending on your mouth clean , polish , whitening , sensitive and gum</li>
            <li>/&gt;This seems to be a vast improvement of the older Sonicare Elite that I have used for years, It is noisier than my old one</li>
            <li>A quick shake of the head should make it dry enough</li>
            <li>I don’t know that any of the other modes are even worth having.</li>
            <li>My first Sonicare was getting old and the battery would not hold a charge for more than a couple of uses which made it difficult on a trip.  </li>
            <li>A few weeks ago, my original Sonicare toothbrush died.  </li>
            <li>The tumbler glass is very thick, it&#x27;s very easy to charge, and the interval alerts are helpful.</li>
            <li>A nice touch is the default initial setting that, over the course of the first 14 operations, slowly ramps up the power to acclimate those who have never used this type of brush in developing a comfort with the high frequency vibration feeling (this ramp-up in vibration power can be disabled, as well; check the manual for the two-step process to do so).</li>
            <li>Either is probably a great toothbrush and even the less expensive models are very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I owned a Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean before this one that lasted for a few years.</li>
            <li>My teeth are dentist clean everyday.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works as promised, is packaged wonderfully, and actually makes brushing somewhat less tedious.</li>
            <li>Would rather have been able to simply order a toothbrush equal to previous models.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that my teeth have never been as clean since I began using this brush a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>I cannot imagine being without some form of Sonicare for the dentist clean teeth feeling everyday.</li>
            <li>At the highest setting the brushing action is vigorous, just short of being unpleasant, and as a result it seems to be nearly as effective as the Ultrasonex in getting one&#x27;s teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Quite different from older style &amp;#34;electric toothbrushes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I had an older model of the sonicare toothbrush and desired something similar.  </li>
            <li>This particular model puts the modes and the power on the same button.  </li>
            <li>Bottom is different from their older models.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I purchased this toothbrush is the fact that it has only 1 button for on/off and mode changes-</li>
            <li>Have used the older, larger versions of the Sonicare for years.</li>
            <li>but they were clever enough to foil my plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would say like the older models, you should keep constant contact with your teeth and the brush while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>But I think its the same as the older model with the 2 stage button.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not exactly sure why it seems to perform so much better than my prior Sonicare</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s even an alternative to the one feature I didn&#x27;t like, which was the charging glass--it looked too big and clunky in photos, which is exactly how it looks when you actually see it.</li>
            <li>My parents started going with electric back when brookstone and sharper image mainly carried them.</li>
            <li>My last brush was an oral b 8000 series (older model) and lasted me for about 5 years.</li>
            <li>Usually you have to go through all the settings to be able to get it to shut off because the shut off button is the same button for the settings.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a charger stand or a cool little glass</li>
            <li>The only downside is the high price.</li>
            <li>At such a high price,  it should not be defectuous that fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s pretty durable, overall, and certainly my mouth is healthier now than it was 3 years ago, with less stains than with the old sonicare.</li>
            <li>And, a supplied USB adapter that plugs into the AC socket (the adapter is also universal voltage, so it works both in North America and Europe, and is much smaller and lighter than the main charger) can also be used to charge the toothbrush while it is in the case (and the USB adapter is supplied, along with a USB cable, in addition to a normal a/c charger.</li>
            <li>The brush handle is light in weight, grips well, and of course if you are new to electric brushes or have a tendency to push to hard, kind of hard for the brush head to move if it is jammed up against your teeth (head still vibrates but bristles don&#x27;t) where as with my oral b I could near brush away my gums if it came to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when my trusty old Sonicare finally broke, I purchased this new one.</li>
            <li>I do like the new one, the case is just flashy but the design is nice.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend attempting to get it replaced before the 2 years is up, as that way you can at least get almost 3 years of use from the original purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend attempting to get it replaced before the 2 years is up, as that way you can at least get almost 3 years of use from the original purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Operation is quite similar to all the previous Philips models, with available \\&quot;cleaning,\\&quot; \\&quot;gum health,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>+ Available in white and black  </li>
            <li>No down side.  </li>
            <li>nice sleek design, and improved over previous version because it doesn&#x27;t allow water to enter and get trapped into the assembly.</li>
            <li>is heavy and well made - 4 sided - with proper lip for easy of rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The plug could&#x27;ve been a little smaller than it is but its fine.</li>
            <li>As of now we have been two weeks without recharging this thing - we are trying to see how long it will really go.  </li>
            <li>barely two months, my teeth look markedly whiter.</li>
            <li>There is considerable splatter during brushing if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>My last Sonicare did a great job until the internal charging circuit finally failed.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the advanced care for the past year and it was one of the toothbrushes i have used for the longest time.  </li>
            <li>really like the carrying case although I&#x27;m not quite sold on the value of USB (a minor point though as you can still use a wall</li>
            <li>For that, the expensive price suddenly becomes much more worth it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I figured they were full of what it takes to make the grass grow green.  </li>
            <li>She had to do very little picking and scraping as was very complimentary on the condition of my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If there was a prize for the most useless industrial design, the person who came up the Diamondhead mode selector would certainly deserve it.  </li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t seem to offer any other significant features over the FlexCare, other than a nifty USB charging case, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth the extra money for extra frustration.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, there&#x27;s no apparent way to color code your brushhead like the older</li>
            <li>We were able to stomach the initial price and the the holding us hostage for the price of replacement heads, but, the last straw came when we fell victim to a loose screw in the mechanism.  </li>
            <li>I have owned many of the other electric toothbrushes on the market, to include the previous models by this name brand.</li>
            <li>super quiet compared with other electric brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Five minutes later they were sending me a new one and an email confirmation was in my inbox before I even got off the phone with her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After my DiamondClean quit, I claimed the second, brand new unit.  </li>
            <li>All said, next time I need a new toothbrush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only bought new units when Philips had made some substantial changes.</li>
            <li>And when I went in for my cleaning last week, a new hygienist (who had never worked on my teeth) poked around for about 10 seconds and asked, &amp;#34;Do</li>
            <li>I have had an electric toothbrush for years, but this item exceeded my expectations taking a daily chore to a new level.</li>
            <li>One can look through my reviews and I am often a fan of this or that, though I also am not afraid to be honest about a bad product.</li>
            <li>that i have advanced periodontal disease and really need to up my game in home dental care.</li>
            <li>Plus, do we really need to mimic the old, unsanitary practice of standing wet toothbrushes up in a glass to store them?</li>
            <li>My last cleaning took less than 20 minutes because there was nothing to clean.</li>
            <li>After using it for three weeks, I think I could have easily purchased the less expensive model and have been equally satisfied.</li>
            <li>If you want only one program, buy the (much cheaper) brush with only one program; you can still use the &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; heads if you want to.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I recommend this efficient tooth brush to anyone who wants quality with multiple ways to recharge, when necessary.  </li>
            <li>Its powerful enough to keep plaque away, making checkups at the dentist drama-free with minimal effort on my part.</li>
            <li>There is no beep: the brush just pauses briefly which is very confusing--it seems as if you&#x27;ve accidentally turned off the brush for a second.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this one will last at least 10 years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a careless person -- but sometimes a toothbrush falls, especially when I&#x27;ve got to do minor gymnastics every morning just to use it.</li>
            <li>I likley spent too much on this but in the quest to replace my old sonicare this seemed to be the likley successor.</li>
            <li>the charge lasts us 15-20 at least with me and my wife using it (different tips of course :) )</li>
            <li>This is really the top tier toothbrush, as silly as it sounds.  </li>
            <li>The convenience it offers when charging is also incredible as all you do is plop it into the base or put it into the cup and it charges without plugging anything into it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is absolutely the most expensive toothbrush in my life, so is the maintenance of it.</li>
            <li>Sadly the aesthetics is the only the good thing about this device...</li>
            <li>Honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t give a company that has such poor customer service my money again.</li>
            <li>Seems much better than my old HealthyWhite (as far as brushes per minute), but I definitely think the included cup is weird and could get gross very fast.</li>
            <li>And without the hassle of getting a cleaning by someone who might not be very gentle and all the rest of it,like not caring if your jaw is getting tired from holding your mouth open or if the light is shining in your eyes</li>
            <li>I received one as a gift for Christmas and about a year later it got very loud and something rattles inside.  </li>
            <li>in all, I highly recommend the Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush to anyone serious about keeping their teeth and gums in tip-top shape.</li>
            <li>the Diamond Clean cost over the other models would be minor when spread out over the 7-8 year lifespan of the product.  </li>
            <li>Your teeth, gums and mouth in general will rejoice!</li>
            <li>Even though it is possible to maintain a healthy mouth with a manual brush, it is more difficult and, for some people, not possible (due to coordination issues, arthritis, etc.).</li>
            <li>Brushing is such a pleasurable experience with this Sonicare that I actually want to brush more than usual.</li>
            <li>Just in case anybody was wondering, I use [[ASIN:B004VGSVHS Crest 3d White Vivid Anticavity Teeth</li>
            <li>Although this is the most expensive personal dental hygiene item that I have ever purchased, I felt the difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li>gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;- the button is barely working now!</li>
            <li>I have used it daily for all these years (I&#x27;m 83 years old!)</li>
            <li>the reason I got another was my dentist told me he saw a major change with me using it for just 3 weeks in tooth and gum health.</li>
            <li>Consider no other toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>cleans like no other tooth brush</li>
            <li>find my self brushing way longer than usual as the experience is more enjoyable as weird as that may be</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works the same basically except it does have a sensitive setting which helps you get used to it, whitening setting is the BOMB!  </li>
            <li>Unlike the previous \\&quot;Flexcare\\&quot; and \\&quot;Elite\\&quot; models, the \\&quot;Diamondclean\\&quot; model has been designed by clueless people who maybe produce art for modern museums, but certainly have never used the toothbrush for actually brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li>However the glass that holds it looks kind of cheap: thick and heavy (so not very enjoyable to use).</li>
            <li>The vibrations of the brush mechanism are not hard to get used to or unpleasant, but it is important to brush for 2 full minutes--it beeps every 30 seconds so you can keep track of the time.  </li>
            <li>The diamond brush head is small and so gets to the back teeth and backs of teeth easily.</li>
            <li>BTW, I use an older FlexCare for travel (better battery life) and it failed about the same way, but at least not until many years after the warranty expired.</li>
            <li>Overall, since it is marked down, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>My older brush had a plastic grip on the back of the handle which made it hard to clean.</li>
            <li>i was hesitant to use an electric toothbrush, remembering the old one my dad used to use, so loud and messy (and ugly on the countertop), but after using the DiamondClean for about a month, I&#x27;m very happy with its results.</li>
            <li>very carefully read the directions before I used this toothbrush for the first time.</li>
            <li>There are several types of Sonicare brushes and this one is the most expensive, but this model is well worth the extra cost</li>
            <li>Studies do not reveal exactly what the effect, either positive or negative, of EMF radiation is on humans.</li>
            <li>You know that feeling of slick clean teeth after leaving the dentists office?</li>
            <li>The toothbrush also holds a decent charge, and can go for a long time without having to recharge the tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In other words, he said he didn&#x27;t think it was &#x27;worth paying extra for&#x27; the UV sanitizing feature.  </li>
            <li>Little pricy, but worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Sonicare -- but this particular model ceased operating properly (no head vibration) after a couple of months --</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt this clean in my life and it is reasonable to think that this will lead to decreased cavities and dental work in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The travel case and charger are very small, easy to pack for travel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was because I bought it from an outside provider other than Sonicare, but the toothbrush does not work right.  </li>
            <li>feel very hopeful about at least stemming the tide of any damage my mouth has experienced, I have a dramatic decrease in pain after only two days.  </li>
            <li>I was debating between this Diamond Clean or possibly the next stop down or maybe even an Oral B again (</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still enjoy using the brush and it provides exceptional performance over manual toothbrushes, but I am disappointed that the handles do not last for very long in my experience.</li>
            <li>I generally like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The battery is long lasting the storage options are modern and functional.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I will ever use all the features the toothbrush and charging system offer but have immense respect for a product that has been this thoughtfully designed, both functionally and aesthetically.</li>
            <li>Clearly there are already numerous reviews.  </li>
            <li>Also, the directions do not make it clear what the difference is between the different operating modes.</li>
            <li>Then a couple of days ago, it just stopped vibrating barely at all.  </li>
            <li>I recently upgraded from my old sonicare toothbrush to this one.</li>
            <li>With this brush you can&#x27;t, whenever you hit the on/off button it will go directly to the next speed.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks, I&#x27;m still trying out all the modes, but the whitening mode, I believe, has made some difference so far.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Diamondclean\\&quot; model offers five different modes: \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, \\&quot;white\\&quot;, \\&quot;polish\\&quot;, \\&quot;gum care\\&quot;, and \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>You can barely see that the brush is moving, but it is.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to scroll through different options to turn the brush off early.</li>
            <li>It was such an unexpected benefit I wanted to mention it.  </li>
            <li>My 6 year old Sonicare finally crapped out on me and chose this one as a replacement.</li>
            <li>There is also a battery/charge indicator on the front near the bottom that lets you know when you&#x27;re running low on battery, when the brush is in use, and when it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li>After Polish is Gum Care, which massages your gums and stimulates the blood flow there and helps to reverse and prevent gingivitis, and after Gum Care, the final mode is Sensitive, which speaks for itself.</li>
            <li>Personally it took me a day or two to adjust to the vibration of the toothbrush, this may primarily be because I am not accustomed to an electric toothbrush, but after a few days I am definitely hooked.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t going to keep the toothbrush, so I didn&#x27;t make it as far as actually brushing and testing the cycle durations.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things went well for a while, until about 14 months after the replacement, the same issue that occurred after dropping it, was happening again, but I had NEVER dropped it and have actually handled it with such care due to the trauma of my original experience with Sonicare Customer Service.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Sonicare, and after adamantly denying that I dropped it, they finally authorized a replacement, thank goodness for the 2 year warranty.  </li>
            <li>I left the old one in a hotel</li>
            <li>we have no regrets with this product.</li>
            <li>so I just gave up and reached for my old electric brush to do the back side of my teeth.</li>
            <li>and they were adamant that they had no such brush.</li>
            <li>You simply cover it with a soft cloth (pictured in instructions), whack it with a hammer, remove the rechargeable battery, and then throw the smashed toothbrush in the trash.  </li>
            <li>The glass cup should have had a slimmer cable to hide to achieve the overall seamless look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, too; just a low hum that can&#x27;t really be heard outside of 10 feet.</li>
            <li>but the reviews finally won me over (and my old Sonic was dying....).  </li>
            <li>While I still have quite a bit of cynicism about such toothbrushes, this brush seems to have been satisfactory so far.</li>
            <li>at nearly $200 I would not expect a need to scrimp on quality of the internal components.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare died, and for 3 weeks (before I got this one), I went back to a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Apparently there is a well documented issue wherein the shaft which vibrates the tooth brush head breaks.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the travel charger yet, but hope to in the near future.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, to be completely fairI need to also tell you that two co-workers bought theirs at the same time I bought mine</li>
            <li>The contrast I found between my old electric toothbrush and the Sonicare DiamondClean is the same - HUGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>brush three times daily and use two complete cycles each time</li>
            <li>I purchased another one and after 11 months of use the metal shaft started to wiggle and the brush head barely vibrated or moved at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only charged it once so far.  </li>
            <li>I recently got this to replace my Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush which was getting old.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised it was the only model that said that!</li>
            <li>This is a one day improvement over my old unit, which also had the same whitening cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a one day improvement over my old unit, which also had the same whitening cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon doesn&#x27;t take back these type of items with it being 45 days old (their policy 30 days).  </li>
            <li>The battery barely lasted a year.  </li>
            <li>BUT IT HAD ONLY ONE SETTING THAT WAS TOO HARSE ON MY SENSITIVE TEETH.</li>
            <li>THIS ONE HAS A SENSITIVE SETTING WHICH I ONLY USE EACH TIME I BRUSH.</li>
            <li>the noise was so distracting that I couldn&#x27;t even pay attention or could barely hear what they were saying</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase this toothbrush because of the price, but after glowing recommendations from friends, I had to do it, and I have absolutely no regrets.</li>
            <li>But...the first thing I noticed is that I had a harder time reaching my back teeth.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;other\\&quot; modes are barely ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons of diamondclean: The travel case is very unintuitive when it comes to storing wet brushes.</li>
            <li>Philips continues to have the most poorly trained support group.</li>
            <li>, the carrying case USB charger is unbelievably convenient (not to mention cool).</li>
            <li>In addition, I get tartar buildup behind my front teeth, both on the top and bottom.  </li>
            <li>They should take better care of their customers and stand behind their product.</li>
            <li>Though I bought this product w/ a professional discount, I agree with other reviewers who said this new model isn&#x27;t worth the jump in price from previous ones.</li>
            <li>So powerful that if the plastic back side of the brush touches a tooth while brushing, it sends chills down my spine.</li>
            <li>What really helped was the function of the product that ensures that the first few brushing sessions are less intense than the regular ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the price although it would be nice if replacement brushed were a bit less expensive.  </li>
            <li>The life ranged from 5-10 days, but was usually 6 days--that&#x27;s only 12 uses!--nowhere near the 21 days they boldly advertise.</li>
            <li>The new charging dock is pretty slick look</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new and even more expensive diamondclean brush head does seem to be an improvement on both the E-type and</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, stays charged for a long time, and looks slick on the shelf.</li>
            <li>Travel case, while lovely, doesn&#x27;t appear that it will stand up well to cleaning, due to its heavily textured outer case (but will only know this over</li>
            <li>, while lovely, doesn&#x27;t appear that it will stand up well to cleaning, due to its heavily textured outer case (but will only know this over time)    </li>
            <li>Interestingly, it has been working fine since then, going on close to 20 months now, but I suspect it will fail within the next few months, and he is already out of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; it started right at the \\&quot;gum care\\&quot; setting, and it has for the few weeks that I&#x27;ve had the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Now, I tried the plastic one first, because I thought it would take up less room.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt this clean in my life and it is reasonable to think that this will lead to decreased cavities and dental work in the future.     </li>
            <li>When I got the Philips Sonicare, I was particularly interested in the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; setting, because I drink a lot of green tea and have stains that are tough remove, mostly because I never stop drinking tea.</li>
            <li>Drives me nuts as I barely put the brush to my teeth and it sputters and loses the ability to clean.</li>
            <li>Particularly appreciate how long it will last on a charge.</li>
            <li>Very pleasing aesthetic look to it, like comparing a Ferrari to, well, any other vehicle.</li>
            <li>I am also very pleased with the battery life on it - a charge can last me at least a few weeks.</li>
            <li>He just likes the little round brush head and, for whatever reason, likes the more jarring sensation from that brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comes with travel kit and a few charging options which work a little bit like magic.</li>
            <li>I upgraded from a sonicate I&#x27;d had for about 10 years, which finally the battery was dead and wouldn&#x27;t hold enough charge to get through a full brushing.  </li>
            <li>I like the QuadPacer feature (also available on some other Sonicare models), because it lets me think less while</li>
            <li>Teeth have honestly never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>dentist thinks it has improve my cleaning routine based on my last appointment.&lt;br /&gt;Having the timer making conscious about spending enough time cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>It seems possible that it may indeed last the nearly 3 weeks as advertised.</li>
            <li>Before the Flexcare, I used the cheap models from the grocery store and those failed so quickly I could have paid for a Flexcare with what I spent on them -</li>
            <li>and I can say there is at least 50% less plaque deposition near my front teeths (performs better in front of those teeths than rear).</li>
            <li>The product has a nice look with the glass to be used for charging the product - but essentially the product design is flawed.</li>
            <li>only deduction, a star, is for the design flaw that many others have complained about: the single button that switches modes *</li>
            <li>This unit is pretty much the same as any other previous sonic care model.  </li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the best rechargeable electric toothbrush on the market - and regardless of which model you choose, I doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  </li>
            <li>It tickled my mouth a little bit at first, but after about a week I was used to it</li>
            <li>Only occasionally, mind you, but with every other toothbrush in my life, that has happened exactly NEVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve replaced the head, the body was fully charge but the pulsing action was so weak that it couldn&#x27;t clean</li>
            <li>in all, I highly recommend the Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush to anyone serious about keeping their teeth and gums in tip-top shape.g the cord around the Case with a loose knot.</li>
            <li>With the new HX9332, you can use the included case to charge your toothbrush if you&#x27;re away from home on a longer vacation which is a very nice touch as you don&#x27;t need to bring an extra charging base with you.  </li>
            <li>My second one lasted less than 2 months until it started making funny sounds.</li>
            <li>but makes it difficult to keep the thing from slipping through your hand while brushing - I may get some sort of grip tape for it.&lt;br /&gt;- single button control for power and functions; makes quick on/off difficult as it will cycle through the settings rather than power off - not the best design</li>
            <li>Again, this has been mentioned before, but unlike ALL of the photographs of the product, there is a 1-2mm gap that (in my opinion), ruins the refined and polished look of the unit as a whole.</li>
            <li>It would seem to be especially beneficial for anyone not already using Sonicare brushes, or electric brushes in general.</li>
            <li>When I asked how much they would refund me, the rep said she didn&#x27;t know, but it would be the average retail price.  </li>
            <li>do wish they would make it clear that the different brushes feel different and act differently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After letting the device charge, usability is much like any other Sonicare, multiple button pushes change the brushing mode.</li>
            <li>while i&#x27;ve never done either of those (t-rexes are more scared of manual toothbrushes), i suspect that what is actually causing the issue (other than overly brittle metal shafts, obviously) is having a relatively small jaw.  </li>
            <li>As you know, dentist visits are expensive and I have NO plans in going there any more frequently than the standard every six months.  </li>
            <li>something which i need, but have not spent enough time on.</li>
            <li>So I went online, and I wasn&#x27;t the only one who had encountered this, apparently.</li>
            <li>I loved the sleek, minimal look of the entire kit and decided to order one, despite the expensive price tag.</li>
            <li>its claims to whiten teeth after 1 week was true in my case (but i also cut out common staining consumables like teas and coffee).</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is worth the price difference in the Flexcare+</li>
            <li>The cup system takes more space than the original base as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but the case does loose some of its cool factor with the cord dangling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but the case does loose some of its cool factor with the cord dangling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you need to dremel the handset in half, unsolder the old battery and solder the new battery in place.    </li>
            <li>I read other reviews about their teeth becoming more white after a few weeks of use and was skeptical.  </li>
            <li>love everything about this model, except that I find it to be a little slick to hold well.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads on the other hand due seem more expensive compared to their other models which contain more parts/plastic.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mainly on the design and additional features that come with it compared to other Philips and Oral-B options.  </li>
            <li>The redesigned power handle is quite effective too, yielding a sleek-looking object which appears to be less prone to becoming a \\&quot;crud-magnet\\&quot; around its base.  </li>
            <li>Sure, paying nearly $200 for a toothbrush seems a little ridiculous, and maybe it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the actual vibration changes or not (I didn&#x27;t pay it particular attention), but it definitely has different timing associated with each type of cleaning,  which I find very helpful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not loose contact from one quadrant to the next.</li>
            <li>Lots of gimicks with the various vibration modes, but doubt they really do anything different from one mode to the other.</li>
            <li>material is finer than other Sonicare heads; it feels like it might clean a little</li>
            <li>I would still highly recommend this to friends,family, and other Amazon members.</li>
            <li>I just take the pieces apart after I brush my teeth to let them dry, and in the past I&#x27;ve used some rubbing alcohol/soap to try and get the parts clean.</li>
            <li>They perform very well and are good/better than the previous Oral-B models.    </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really doing it for significantly less time.</li>
            <li>Low the glass less messy easy charging.</li>
            <li>My one complaint is that the brush heads will quickly vibrate off the body if I&#x27;m not brushing while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>There is no easy way to get an exchange (I did not keep the box not the warranty) and even via Amazon there is no exchange, so that is pretty</li>
            <li>I like the inductive charging base and the beautiful white casing.</li>
            <li>I felt a strong ticklish sensation along the gums...especially behind the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Last but not least, the single button interface means that if you press the button once the brush turns on, the second press (if within 5 seconds) cycles through various brushing modes.</li>
            <li>, here is what I can tell you: as a person who has used a manual toothbrush for most of my life, I felt a little silly the first time I used this.</li>
            <li>I personally think the price is worth it and HIGHLY recommend you consider this.osed to replace the heads approximately every 3 months.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s actually the normal time frame for a Sonicare (diamondclean) to last because it has a motor attached to a batter inside the handle connected to other electrical components.&amp;#34; Effectively they admitted that its normal for these expensive toothbrushes to begin to break down just after the warranty period, and just hope their customers keep replacing them.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that replacement heads are VERY spendy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The travel case and the charging stand are really neat features but the lack of a charge level and the two buttons is a very big trade down.  </li>
            <li>The case is slick and can charge with an outlet or usb, very smart.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few electric toothbrushes and this is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;Feels strange to begin with as the brush vibrates very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My gums are noticeably less swollen in the morning and the tea stains are definitely improved, but the real surprise was my skin.</li>
            <li>The battery seems to last much longer than those used in my previous brushes.  </li>
            <li>My primary complaint with the old brush was where the brush head slid down onto the post getting moldy with the toothpaste buildup.</li>
            <li>After a year and half, it&#x27;s kind of broken.</li>
            <li>Very disappointing since the operation is great.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Sonicare Essential electric brush for the past 10 years and while this one is more expensive, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>We were very careful with them and used them normally.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However it turns out that the head doesn&#x27;t last 3 months (they are pretty expensive too), maybe around 2 months, and it gives me an annoyingly loud and harsh sound every time I turn it</li>
            <li>but it was still easy to find gross murky, germy water left behind after brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works fine, but not great.</li>
            <li>Little hard to figure out how the charging works, but was able to set it up and get it working.</li>
            <li>(My husband complained that it rattled his teeth at first, I didn&#x27;t have that sensation, only a slight tickling of the gums for the first couple of days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but when you figure how much whitening at your dentist&#x27;s office would cost....</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the blinking green charging light is very dim.</li>
            <li>Now she has a new one (pink!)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m guessing its primarily due to new brush head design.    </li>
            <li>I usually gate brushing my teeth because my teeth never really feel all that clean after.</li>
            <li>Miss the sonic cleaning feature of past models very much.  </li>
            <li>Was a little discouraged by reading the negative feedback before purchasing but am glad I ordered this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the toothbrush base is smooth, it&#x27;s not slipped out of my hands, but I would have liked a little grip for reassurance.</li>
            <li>Seriously this toothbrush has opened a whole new world of oral care for me and I will never go back.  </li>
            <li>Mine was getting kind of old and had a bad habit of accumulating \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; under the brush head.  </li>
            <li>For the price I paid this was a huge letdown, really not happy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the DiamondClean heads or the mechanism or both, but it seriously works better than any toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried, including a previous Sonicare.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Update: March 27, 2014&lt;br /&gt;After doing my research, I had to (somewhat reluctantly) admit to myself that Sonicare still seems like the best way to take care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Amazon was the best price that I could find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, it works, and it cleans!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li> It was the best toothbrush I have ever used in my life.</li>
            <li> It stoppped working twice, but the warranty is awesome, so it got replaced</li>
            <li> It is GREAT!!</li>
            <li> but this is the best!</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed that I can brush twice a day for 2 months just on one charge.</li>
            <li> And all the settings it has is awesome.</li>
            <li> this $185 might turn out to be a wonderful investment!</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of removing plaque from my teeth and makes them feel like glass once I am through.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working flawlessly ever since I purchased it: I think it&#x27;s been about two years.  </li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of cleaning...</li>
            <li> I think this must be the best electric toothbrush out there.  </li>
            <li> It is the best oral care brush ever made.  </li>
            <li> I am the type of person that likes to have the BEST of everything with all of my electronics!</li>
            <li> All in all we are very happy we purchased it!</li>

            <li> /&gt;Ok, so this toothbrush has a great tendency to splatter/spray toothpaste out of my mouth to surrounding areas like my arm, hair, mirror, countertop, everywhere!</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful device!  </li>
            <li> it was supposedly the best of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Great product and</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush when it is in working order.  </li>
            <li> Instead of putting it in a plastic bag you can throw it in the case and charge it on your computer, through the case if needed, now that&#x27;s a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>

            <li> especially love the travelling case and charging glass - quite amazing.</li>

            <li> , it looks great too.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush until it stopped working after 2 years, with no support offered by Philips.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy if you like spending $90/year on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> great job, sonicare, for your continued improvements .</li>
            <li> Sonic always makes great products.</li>

            <li> Diamondclean comes with two heads and a great travel set.</li>
            <li> The built-in timer that tells you when to brush another area of your mouth is GREAT.  </li>
            <li> They design is great, handle is slim and you have to get use to it though.</li>
            <li> Great job on the design.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li> So all in all, great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> if you have questions, please comment, i will be happy to answer.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Everything sounded great about this one.</li>
            <li> The five modes sounded like a great idea.</li>
            <li> . feels great in your hand and the vibrations on your teeth,&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li> It does a great job too, once I figured out how to use it without looking into the mirror.</li>
            <li> I called in sonicare and they were happy to give me a replacement body.  </li>
            <li> I travel for a living so the travel case that charges the toothbrush is great if you are on the go a lot.</li>
            <li> charging, great for car camping, travelling, charge with your laptop etc..</li>
            <li> Works great and</li>
            <li> (I had to take off 1 star for being overpriced, but it&#x27;s a great product.)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 100% happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It helped me a lot when I found that my hand dexterity was not that great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for kids and teens.  </li>
            <li> options for cleaning are just amazing, and the way the head of the brush is design is perfect.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great to go packaging as well.  </li>
            <li> If everything goes well great, if not, immediately (within the 30 days) contact sonicare and return&lt;br</li>
            <li> This should be the best toothbrush ever purchased with this price tag!&amp;#34; Now, after owning it for six months, my toothbrush has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> great battery,</li>
            <li> great charging solutions with the travel case and the cup.  </li>
            <li> Really great looking brush.</li>
            <li> Functionally, it works great</li>
            <li> Though it looks, sounds, and feels great, within one month</li>
            <li> Worked great at the beginning.  </li>
            <li> greatly improving the brushing effectiveness</li>
            <li> So happy to have this device.</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing a great product.</li>
            <li> better!&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job cleaning teeth with</li>
            <li> All I can say is this is a GREAT toothbrush that cleans</li>
            <li> A great investment in your oral healthcare.</li>
            <li> The design is well thought out, and for travelling it works great.  </li>
            <li> My dentist hygienist cannot believe how great my teeth look since I purchased this brush.  </li>
            <li> so that was all great.</li>
            <li> I have owned a couple of Sonicare&#x27;s and have been happy with them all.</li>
            <li> Its a great toothbrush when it works.</li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> This brush was great for about 1 year.  </li>
            <li> So five stars for being a great power brush.</li>
            <li> Great for home and travel use.</li>
            <li> For the one year they both worked, they were great.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is great</li>
            <li> and phillips has a great process to repair</li>
            <li> Its great.</li>
            <li> great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> you know you have received a great product.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of stimulating your gums.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> it works great.  </li>
            <li> So happy with this investment</li>
            <li> really..so gross..destroys the great look of the brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.  </li>
            <li> Totally happy with how it performs.  </li>
            <li> Then the amount of hardware on bathroom sink did not make me happy.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and just works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> But I love it!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> you have money to burn and like Apple like styling, this is a very nice looking update to the Sonicare line</li>
            <li> Has a very nice feel to it, in the hand and in use.</li>
            <li> so it is very nice having the carrying case that doubles as a charger.  </li>
            <li> The two chargers are very handy.</li>
            <li> The glass is very handy, as is the travel case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Phillips customer service is very nice and offered a replacement immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charging glass is very nice and WELL built.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is very nice with a magnetic close, it also acts like a dock by having the option to charge the toothbrush while it sits inside the case.  </li>
            <li> very nice philips sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The travel case is very nice, but it doesn&#x27;t include storage space for the charger.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice travel case and combination charger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nicely made and runs a couple weeks on a charge.  </li>
            <li> But if you can handle the cost, it is a very nice brush.</li>
            <li> A very nice product, but replacing it once a year means the cost, not including replacement heads, is around $15-$16/mo.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality product.</li>
            <li> While not a match for an Ultrasonex in working order, this Sonicare is a very good toothbrush --- probably the best of those now available.  </li>
            <li> The DiamondClean is amazing!</li>
            <li> The glass charger is amazing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just simply Amazing!</li>
            <li> This leaves my mouth feeling amazing!  </li>
            <li> I can say is that it is amazing!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> also remarkable improvements in gum health.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and find they are the best on the market.  </li>
            <li> of the things I appreciate the most about this product is that it&#x27;s perfectly suited for traveling.</li>
            <li> I really love it and it cleans the teeth just perfect, leaving my mouth feeling fresher and cleaner longer.</li>
            <li> the product arrived, I immediately opened it to find a very attractive toothbrush and many accessories.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to say that I am still very happy with my SoniCare brush.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is also impeccable, and lasts for well over a week of twice a day 2 - 5 minute brushing sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have heard many of my patients tell me that they like the Oral-B spinbrush the best as comopared to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The minimalism design and impeccable build quality reminds you of Apple products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I love the product until it breaks which makes perfect sense to anyone that loves their product.</li>
            <li> This is as sexy as toothbrushes for people with gingivitis get. :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> The case itself it also excellent quality, well built, and stylish.  </li>
            <li> I always thought Flexcare did an awesome job on cleaning my teeth, but I think Diamondclean does a better job.</li>
            <li> good look and great performance</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own 1-year warranty!</li>
            <li> Product is excellent &amp; enjoyed using it...</li>
            <li> Being able to just set the toothbrush in the glass rather than fuss with getting it on a peg is the greatest!</li>
            <li> Good food, great company and...</li>
            <li> The best word I can think of is elegant.</li>
            <li> Love it, buy it, it&#x27;s the best !!</li>
            <li> Everyone should own one of these!</li>
            <li> excellent product - hope battery life is more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush, make sure you utilize the diamond brushing heads.  </li>
            <li> the best tooth brush ever made #LOVE</li>
            <li> And this perfect Ida with the glass :-)</li>
            <li> The charging glass is very nice and looks good on my bathroom counter.....</li>
            <li> Again LOVE LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> sonicare Diamondclean looks awesome in appearance, really, the best looking toothbrush out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly astounded.</li>
            <li> Customer service was pleasant (and located in Oklahoma).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very stylish and works great.</li>
            <li> it looks nice - beautifully designed (</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and has excellent grip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a clean at the dentist every day!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush and much more!</li>
            <li> excellent product, quick shipping!</li>
            <li> top of how great it makes my teeth feel, it is it also is a great motivator for me to floss</li>
            <li> and I loved mine</li>
            <li> Quality wise, it&#x27;s a piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea-)</li>
            <li> It might be a good toothbrush, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a killer, in a good way.</li>
            <li> The fit and finish of this product is absolutely excellent.</li>
            <li> Removing the reservoir was really good for this upgrade.</li>
            <li> good job sonicare.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the best product available in the market.</li>
            <li> It seems like it might indeed be a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy that I made the purchase using coupons and discounts that were available at the time.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to have.</li>
            <li> Yes, this brush is that good.</li>
            <li> In my case anything that let&#x27;s me avoid appointments is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I have found it to be a superior product to brushes offered by Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> RPM is incredible; dramatically more than the Oral-</li>
            <li> I used a competitor&#x27;s product for 6+ years and loved it.</li>
            <li> Make no mistake, this is the best toothbrush available and a work of art.  </li>
            <li> I really loved this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The one I got for my wife and myself is still good.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved it for 1 1/2 year</li>
            <li> it is that good.</li>
            <li> AS GOOD AS A PRICE AS AMAZON</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> My dentist loved it too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think it is a good investment</li>
            <li> My dental  hygienist recommended Sonicare as the best electric toothbrush available.</li>
            <li> it is good ,I don&#x27;t see a difference with the cheapest one .It</li>
            <li> And, yes, you are probably paying a fair percentage of that price towards the unit&#x27;s stylistic design.</li>
            <li> toothbrush itself is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous travel case that doubles as an in-case charger when connected to the USB cable</li>
            <li> , there were just none in stock, which I found fascinating.</li>
            <li> This one is so good words can&#x27;t describe it.</li>
            <li> It feels really good on the teeth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item June 8, 2012 and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> so I gave it a good scrub and replaced the head unit (I do this faithfully every 3 months anyways)</li>
            <li> this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> (direction wise)</li>
            <li> I therefore was expectng this one to be good</li>
            <li> but I did not expect it to be as good as it has been.  </li>
            <li> product, good design.</li>
            <li> it again when good price.</li>
            <li> It might be good to check whether the product that you purchase will be under warranty.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> The case is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> But since the toothbrush uses a Lithium Ion battery (good for three weeks)</li>
            <li> it is a good investment towards your oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I thought my worn out elite was good until I received my diamondclean.</li>
            <li> I loved that toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I just contacted Philips and they are sending two replacement handles after a fairly painless 10 minute online chat with a representative.</li>
            <li> The sonicare feels good.</li>
            <li> And that was me, so I thought it might be a good investment for my long-term dental health.  </li>
            <li> Good for all ages.  </li>
            <li> Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for 3 years and loved it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li> The fact that you can get this with FREE shipping and another rebate in the box at the time I purchased leaves me very happy</li>
            <li> it is surprising how well</li>
            <li> They laughed and said that they recommended Oral B to their clients.</li>
            <li> in all, it was a good decision and purchase.</li>
            <li> so minimizing what I need to carry when traveling is always a good thing.  </li>
            <li> and it was a good value.  </li>
            <li> it is good and works as stated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Invest in yourself - and good oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li> and they are not as good as advertised</li>
            <li> This is an investment in my book, teeth feel as good as walking out of the dentist just having your teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> Good brush, good price, good all around.</li>
            <li> excellent product, very useful for my teeth</li>
            <li> It has nice features and very nice design.</li>
            <li> I already had an Oral B electric toothbrush, but while it did a very nice job of cleaning my teeth, it was not even as remotely effective as this Philips Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it helped me make a good decision once again! :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> kids think I&#x27;m corny for being excited about a toothbrush, but why wouldn&#x27;t I be. :D</li>
            <li> Best of all is that I can make them feel that clean each time I brush again.  </li>
            <li> She now plans to buy herself one since she was so impressed by how clean her teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> I have a number of crowns and permanent bridges and he said that the Sonicare would be best at keeping the margins clean.  </li>
            <li> Great item, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I also love the beautiful carrying case that is included; it doubles as a USB charger and makes me feel fancy every time I travel.</li>
            <li> my teeth feel cleaner, some of the tartar or tooth film is gone and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with the cleaning capability.</li>
            <li> Just for the record, I also use the Sonciare Airfloss since I got this, which is a great device to use before brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using this brush for just over a month and my teeth are more than 5 shades whiter.</li>
            <li> However, many of my friends and relatives already had bought the Philips Sonicare Toothbrush and told me how happy they were with this product.  </li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s when I decided to purchase it after so many great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Now, after over a month of use, I can report that I am very, very pleased with my decision.  </li>
            <li> Flexcare was great, this is better.</li>
            <li> After owning a Sonicare for years, I decided to upgrade to the Diamond Care based on the great reviews and stunning design.</li>
            <li> The travel case it comes with is also awesome and useful.  </li>
            <li> very pleased with it.</li>

            <li> i was so happy with my purchase that i bought 3 more for family members.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to just drop the brush in the glass and know it&#x27;ll be charging perfectly.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Easy to use, many settings, and great teeth and gum care!</li>
            <li> Being able to charge it from a USB port is very nice since i dont have to carry an additional charger with me.  </li>
            <li> but in my opinion worth it as the quality is very good and feels good to use</li>
            <li> new advanced head wonderful Polish mode wonderful  </li>
            <li> Great for travel and does a great job, worth the price.</li>

            <li> So first, the compact brush head is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> It is perfect - exactly the size for those of us with a sensitivity to gagging.</li>
            <li> This is pretty pricey at monthly cost for equipment of $9.50 for the twenty months it functioned perfectly.</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>

            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> toothbrush has the most wonderful feeling in the mouth and the teeth get REALLY clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy to assemble, easy to use... and you can even charge the toothbrush via the USB port on your computer (brilliant!).</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use and get used to.</li>
            <li> If you have toothpaste on your brush, and you want to toggle to your preferred setting, the toothpaste will fly off as you find your preferred setting--and when the brush is in your mouth, you can&#x27;t easily see what setting you&#x27;re on.</li>
            <li> And pleasant to the touch &#x3D;))</li>
            <li> I still loved it till it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to buy a new one as a replacement as it gave me the best feel.</li>
            <li> and they are all very high quality, excellent build quality/construction/design</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on some reviews I saw (not on Amazon) that rated it very highly AND lauded the Amazon price, which was the best I found.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great brush and does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li> Thankfully Philips customer service was amazing and they sent out a replacement.</li>
            <li> Switching from a manual toothbrush, the results I see with this brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> And it was definitely amazing.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush produced amazing results.  </li>
            <li> It does an amazing job of removing plaque and stains.</li>
            <li> The case is amazing...</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing tool.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews before mine and decided to pull the trigger on this amazing tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>

            <li> Amazing...</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li> AMAZING TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li> It is nice at the beginning</li>
            <li> Nice case; sleek design.</li>
            <li> It might be worth the incredible price difference for these features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both commented how nice my teeth were.  </li>
            <li> If for some reason you do need to charge it it comes with the handy charging glass to keep in your hotel room.    </li>
            <li> This is a superior dental system that gets my teeth cleaner and whiter and gets me more motivated to brush.</li>
            <li> The noise of this one is also kind of grating</li>
            <li> The DiamondClean also comes with a nice travel case.</li>
            <li> Nice design.</li>
            <li> The travel case/charger is nice.     </li>
            <li> but if I do it could be handy.  </li>
            <li> Phillips impressed me so much that I felt compelled to do so.  </li>
            <li> Travel case is really nice too.  </li>
            <li> My dentist is loving me.</li>
            <li> I liked the look and feel of this unit as well as the fact</li>
            <li> It also comes with a travel case which has its own cords to charge from the wall outlet or a usb port on your computer.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend this based on my own use.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of concave and stands on the included chargers, which surround the bottom portion of the handle, preventing it from falling over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The travel case is nice too.</li>
            <li> The travel case is nice too.</li>
            <li> I am used to a manual toothbrush and never tried any kind of electric ons in my life until my dentist recommend it to me.</li>
            <li> The travel case is really nice and works well.</li>
            <li> Comes with a nice case and accessories.</li>
            <li> I have never used the USB charging feature, but I do like the nice case for travel.  </li>
            <li> This is nice because it helps protect your brush from beingknocked off the counter or shelf in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> i loved it, and this one is even better.  </li>
            <li> Nice piece.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how this toothbrush could receive anything but 5 stars.</li>
            <li> But if you really have to have the best on the market, this is it.</li>
            <li> liked the packaging on this.</li>
            <li> is handy</li>
            <li> is handy</li>
            <li> Charging with the USb option is also handy sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The battery life is great, and the multiple options for charging are great!</li>
            <li> Could have gotten a better price by going to Bed Bath and Beyond that offered a good price, a mail in refund and 20% off on a store coupon.  </li>
            <li> Two ways to charge with the stand and the handy USB travel case.  </li>
            <li> Looks nice on my bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for in a toothbrush, is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Looks nice on shelf.</li>
            <li> Nice touch.</li>
            <li> also think that the way this brush splits up the timer is nice.</li>
            <li> I feel like having a really nice toothbrush and going off brand</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it works effectively.  </li>
            <li> well that&#x27;s just a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Comes with a really nice travel case as well.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this toothbrush, and my dentist seems to think it was a good choice.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a nice dual featured option.</li>
            <li> It also would have been nice if the charging cradle was glass</li>
            <li> The 30-second interval timer is really handy</li>
            <li> But once I tried the Philips Sonicare I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> The travel pouch is a nice accessory .  </li>
            <li> We are thrilled with the design.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, it would be nice to have the ability to place the cap over the brush head, however, doing so in the form would prevent ample air circulation, causing bacteria growth.  </li>
            <li> the toothbrush and holder are both nicely designed.</li>
            <li> if you are an &amp;#34;Executive summary&amp;#34; kind of person:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Honestly they should just have 2 modes;</li>
            <li> I have always used the sonicare line, but this one is gives the most superior cleaning I have ever had at home.</li>
            <li> It comes with a handy travel case.  </li>
            <li> it is worth the money, best i ever used..nice design and material is top notch..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this toothbrush to anyone in search of the absolute best.</li>
            <li> Well built and extremely effective.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It could be handy to charge on your computer</li>
            <li> charger on it&#x27;s own (without the cup) make me feel like the brush will topple over...</li>
            <li> I got adept at putting the brush in my mouth, angling it so that I could see the lights in the mirror, and pressing the button until I reached the cleaning mode I wanted.</li>
            <li> Awesome Toothbrush, my mouth feels so much cleaner</li>
            <li> It would be nice if you could select the setting you want before you turn it on.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li> my gums day after day stronger, that I kept using it and started loving it.</li>
            <li> Is it worth a penny to have an incredible brushing expierence everytime</li>
            <li> Nice sleek design.</li>
            <li> But I really liked the way the Sonicare cleaned my teeth, so I bought a the DiamondClean because it had a Lithium Ion battery and Lithium Ion batteries don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; problems of NiCad batteries</li>
            <li> I really liked this toothbrush but after two years it stopped charging.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it, they suck to put it nicely.  </li>
            <li> This brush was nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li> The item has a nice feel to the handle.</li>
            <li> What a great product..always works with ease, changing the heads is simple and it is the best thing we as a family could have ever purchased !</li>
            <li> I do think Phillips was trying to make a trendy toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I do think Phillips was trying to make a trendy toothbrush.</li>
            <li> you own a product like one of the Clarisonic brushes</li>
            <li> Cleaning effect is great and the design of the whole brush is great too</li>
            <li> Although quite pricey , the product cleans very well and the battery life is excellent.</li>
            <li> I liked the 3 lights for your charge</li>
            <li> , I got it and loving it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li> I do not know how to treat with this kind of issue.</li>
            <li> They had a nice Chat feature</li>
            <li> It is a good thing that this comes with the travel charger, so was able to charge and use the brush.  </li>
            <li> Nice charging options.</li>
            <li> If you can afford it, this is as nice a brush as you can buy it today.  </li>
            <li> Thrilled with this purchase.</li>
            <li> , it is like having your mouth lovingly massaged.  </li>
            <li> Feels nice in the hand.</li>
            <li> integrated timer is really nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a full row of beautiful teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You should be able to get a good deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> great tooth brush, really like mine!!!</li>
            <li> : Good advanced brush, with lift most stains with pro results brush, give an awesome clean</li>
            <li> get one of the original models - they work great.  </li>
            <li> Great product, so worth the money!</li>
            <li> and she wouldn&#x27;t suggest a particular brand but said to get the best I could afford.</li>
            <li> Our older Sonicare had been working flawlessly for 6 years when I decided to step up to the Diamond Care model.</li>
            <li> Great Toothbrush my Teeth have never been so clean.</li>
            <li> This diamond clean model is great.</li>
            <li> The clean feeling I get with this toothbrush is like nothing I&#x27;ve ever experienced with a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> She has been extremely happy and feels that her teeth and gums have never been so clean.</li>
            <li> Polish feature is great, makes your teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> I have used Phillips sonicare brooshes for a number of years but this particular one is the best.</li>
            <li> this works great to clean my aligners.</li>
            <li> Great for kids too, when they have difficulty getting their teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> this afternoon because 3 years is still a great run for something that gets dunked in water every morning and evening to clean, vibrates over 39k times/minute, for about 6 minutes per day, over about 985 days.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied and love using it.  </li>
            <li> Great design, using the glass to hold the toothbrush and charge it is cool and functional.  </li>
            <li> this toothbrush is very appealing to the eye and the glass cup was and inventive way of charging it</li>
            <li> good things about this is the stylish design the power button screams of another stylish electronic that&#x27;s quite popular</li>
            <li> Everytime I brush my teeth, they feel dentist clean!!</li>
            <li> It works beautifully, adjusting from one speed to the next easily if needed with a perfect timer.</li>
            <li> If you need a new Sonicare, this is a great choice!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Contacted Philips, they said the best they can do is give me a code for 15% off a new one from their site (which lists for $220 there, instead of 180 here) since mine is &#x27;out of warranty&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Love the Sonicare, as I believe it does a great job with the dental hygiene that is so important to me.  </li>
            <li> The elegant one-button design really isn&#x27;t the best user interface</li>
            <li> I have had many electric brushes, but this one is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> I also love the convenience of the charging glass which is a really neat idea that works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> My dentist noticed a substantial reduction in mineral deposits, and my gums got a good deal more healthy.</li>
            <li> It makes the cleaning process very easy, but it broke after 9 months.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use &amp; recharge.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very easy review...</li>
            <li> Very easy.</li>
            <li> It also travels very easy with you</li>
            <li> The best part is once I complete the brushing, my mouth feels like it has just been overhauled!</li>
            <li> but wow!  That is an awesome toothbrush!</li>
            <li> First let me say that the ordering and shipping were handled flawlessly, I received the Philips Sonicare very quickly.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the concept of an electric toothbrush and this one is hands down the best one she has ever owned - result a beautiful smile on a beautiful girl; what more can I ask.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I bought this product and my teeth are sparkling clean and so much more whiter and brighter than they were before.  </li>
            <li> The main features which sold me are the induction charging cup and the USB travel charger and case -- they looked great in the review, and in person, are just as good as I</li>
            <li> ...and i can see why...cannot say my wallet was happy but well worth the expense...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled and will keep using this until PS comes out with something better than this.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely impressed by how they handled it and that the process was completely painless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is clearly supposed to resembled an Apple Iproduct, for reasons known best to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I tried to be a good tooth brusher and take it lightly but still got a lecture from the guy.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best tooth brushes that I have used so far.</li>
            <li> So far I am impressed with the toothbrush but the proof will be when I go for my dental check up and see if it made a difference in my tarter buildup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually attractive while also being useful.</li>
            <li> I liked the E series way better than the Oral B.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It really is the best in this category, and infinitely better and cleaning your teeth and better oral care than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of Sonicare toothbrush models and this model is BY FAR the best yet!</li>
            <li> Wireless charging was a smart/cool idea that honestly attracted me the most.  </li>
            <li> But it would be nice to have better directions on the alternative ways I&#x27;ve paid for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All around it&#x27;s the best electronic toothbrush I&#x27;ve had so far.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric toothbrushes you can buy.</li>
            <li> The Best, by far.  </li>
            <li> They are also some of the most popular and recommended professionaltype home toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> now I can happily say it&#x27;s been a worth while</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have then moved onto a competitors brand which doesn&#x27;t look as nice but feels and brushes a lot better.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush does an excellent job of cleaning, whiting, gum massage and keeping the tartar build up nearly non existant.</li>
            <li> So far I am very impressed!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have used.</li>
            <li> Although a bit pricey, I am happy to say that it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Amazon consistently gives me the best prices, with no shipping costs, in a secure format.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can feel a pleasant sensation in my gums, too, which is very good for blood flow and overall gum health.</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> How easy was that?!</li>
            <li> best investment we&#x27;ve ever made, love to use it and have that fresh from the dentist clean feeling.</li>
            <li> At first this product was amazing, but like many others have experienced, my tooth brush broke about 1 year after I bought it and</li>
            <li> The vibration feels good on the gums and leaves teeth feeling really clean.  </li>
            <li> great toothbrush that really polishes your teeth up to a nice gleam.  </li>
            <li> More importantly my teeth loved it.</li>
            <li> I would love to be able to update on my own terms rather than water damage or planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li> Excellent upgrade from my many years old Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li> I totally loved it, my teeth are so clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it, and still happy a year later, as I update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes your teeth feel so good and clean, they feel like you have just come from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> kept on with sonicare brushes when my dentist was telling me how good of a job I was doing keeping my braces clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very attractive toothbrush and works just as well or better than my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Happily the program I use first has two words in it</li>
            <li> Forget going to the dentist and wondering if your teeth are perfect, or barely passing the exam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The whole product is beautifully engineered.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric tooth brush and it works great.</li>
            <li> First, the charging cup is great and that&#x27;s my go to way of charging it.</li>
            <li> Great device but costs too much!</li>
            <li> Result are in sync with the claims happy with the product also with amazons delivery as this was my first online import to India Mumbai.</li>
            <li> All in all this toothbrush is pretty great</li>
            <li> Feels great in my hand (that&#x27;s what she said), brushes well, and is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I was happy with flexicare.  </li>
            <li> The Diamondclean has a very smooth body and it seems to slip and slide around in my hand.</li>
            <li> This brush scrubs your teeth way better and leaves you feeling like you did when you first experienced Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Nicely designed, variable speeds makes brushing easy rather than a chore.  </li>
            <li> the brush itself is nice and sleek and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED QUICKLY AND IN GOOD CONDITION.</li>
            <li> you need a reliable brush that can be charged easily from computer or wall while looking nice, this is your way to go.</li>
            <li> Easy to Handle: The brush has a nice feel in your hand.  </li>
            <li> like the storage box, it&#x27;s easy to change the heads and nice to have a place to put them when you but them.&lt;br /&gt;It does suck to pay 200 bucks for something you&#x27;ll still be paying for b/c of the replacement heads - something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The carrying case is super nice and comes in handy for overnight trips.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Sonicare, read good reviews of this one and it was time to change my old one because after 4 years it stopped working, so I decided to go ahead and buy this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
            <li> I am now pleased to say that my Hygentist is very pleased with my clean teeth for once.  </li>
            <li> You have money to splurge a bit and value great design very highly.</li>
            <li> new Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush is the best electric toothbrush I have ever used</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a happy sound and makes me smile &amp; now my teeth sparkle</li>
            <li> It just rests on top of it.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are not in the best of condition and I have several fillings and crowns.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll save yourself over $100 and have a better tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for awhile now and it cleans like most brushes do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE has been fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> To be able to charge my toothbrush from my laptop, while its in its carrying case...</li>
            <li> more-</li>
            <li> When I opened the travel case to reveal the actual toothbrush, I wasn&#x27;t nearly as impressed.</li>
            <li> I was just expecting a bit more for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> but it sure isn&#x27;t hurting</li>
            <li> Love Phillips Sonicare!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Top notch.</li>
            <li> If you use the brushes correctly you can keep your mouth perfectly healthy</li>
            <li> He said it was the best present ever</li>
            <li> It has a visually sexy design, but ergonomics could be improved by adding a ridge or contour to grip the handle better.</li>
            <li> they last well and Philips have excellent customer service</li>
            <li> And I also love the travel case, which has a USB connector so that you can recharge your toothbrush via USB</li>
            <li> The $200 is the better bargain.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best product that I have acquired in 2011.</li>
            <li> * Remove plaque better than a manual toothbrush&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most stable.     </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting that much difference in performace over the flexcare which is already great.</li>
            <li> I opened 4 more brushes and most of the shiny chromed bases are scuffed.</li>
            <li> In all honesty I don&#x27;t think these things will bother or even be apparant to most people.</li>
            <li> I know that this technology works, but I&#x27;m a software engineer, so this is magic to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to practically review this product...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to Sonicare products, this is the top of the line.  </li>
            <li> and I love the high-quality look of it.</li>
            <li> and this makes sure I move from each section of my mouth when needed.  </li>
            <li> My wife also uses and love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I have owned more than a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The most glaring omission is not being able to store the USB cord inside the case when not in use.</li>
            <li> So, I bought the top of the line, which is this brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to find words for this toothbrush, but \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; and \\&quot;more</li>
            <li> Also if there was an industry award for throwing a product on the market without any consumer testing, the Diamondhead would be a top candidate.</li>
            <li> I gave it a week to be sure.</li>
            <li> Hoping I would be able to work it out</li>
            <li> It is way better than either the Oral-B or the Elite.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many times I have had to have this replaced.</li>
            <li> I am already in love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there will be tweaks to improve the case, the brush, the charger, etc...</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using: I am still in love.  </li>
            <li> I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> Seems like the mode should be able to be set.</li>
            <li> The brush head size is much better than any Oral B product my wife and I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this model, it turns on ok but the electric motor cuts out</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I think this is because the brush is cleaning my teeth so much better and allergens are being removed quicker.</li>
            <li> The longer you use it, the better it feels.  </li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> , I love the timer, and it&#x27;s packaged in almost apple like design.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough of how impressed I am to this version.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter top space.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied, it delivers more than promised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed not only with  Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean</li>
            <li> but with quality of service Amazon provided.&lt;br /&gt;Being an overseas buyer I can say confidently I&#x27;m protected with Amazon&#x27;s policy and Philips Sonicare HX9332/05</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The head design is better and the unit looks sleek.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I may have jumped the gun.</li>
            <li> and I love this newest edition.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> It was nice to be able to get the perks with the store card for 6 months interest free financing at time of purchase.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li> I did some research and after trying out the Sonciare HealthyWhite, which is also a great toothbrush for people who don&#x27;t want to spend so much, I decided to purchase the Sonicare DiamondClean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Most of the modes work this way</li>
            <li> but I find I like this even more.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun electric toothbrush for many years, with no complaints.</li>
            <li> We just felt this may be an even better dental hygiene option for</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d expect a $200 brush to be more</li>
            <li> My gums feel healthy.</li>
            <li> It feels like this motion will be easier on my receding gums, although it&#x27;s too soon to say for sure.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electrical toothbrushes by Philips&#x27; competitors for more than 20 years now.</li>
            <li> In summary, this is the best electrical toothbrush that I have been using in the last 20 years</li>
            <li> and I would think that it is the best currently on the market.  </li>
            <li> Had this toothbrush about a week now and love it.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m getting more of these for the family.</li>
            <li> but glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly satisfied with this product from the moment I saw it</li>
            <li> The case is ingenious and I love that I can charge it from my computer.</li>
            <li> Mine lasted about 10 more months and</li>
            <li> do hope this review has helped you guys out and helps you make a more informed decision.  </li>
            <li> do hope this review has helped you guys out and helps you make a more informed decision.  </li>
            <li> While better than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I feel like they could be so much better.  </li>
            <li> It takes more than 12 hours to fully charge the brush when it&#x27;s depleted.  </li>
            <li> more than often.&lt;br /&gt;Combined with Flossing after eating and Arm &amp; Hammer Peroxicare toothpaste&lt;</li>
            <li> The Sonicare just felt like it was doing more by vibrating and</li>
            <li> I really think this product does a great job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Also, some reviewers/users complain about not being able to select the mode without the toothbrush &#x27;spraying all over.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking forward to many years of satisfaction from my DiamondCare</li>
            <li> It cleans so much better than the toothbrush I was using.</li>
            <li> I am someone who has, no matter how often I brush and floss, always been burdened with many dental problems.</li>
            <li> I also love that this has a pause feature, so you can turn the brush off without it losing it&#x27;s spot in the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Lasted 1 more month than its predecessors.</li>
            <li> This is a really ingenious toothbrush.</li>
            <li> She claimed that she meant it sincerely.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love that I can just plug into my computer.  </li>
            <li> the diamondclean, the handle and tips got even better...</li>
            <li> , otherwise they won&#x27;t send them any more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i guess if you think about it that way, i&#x27;m glad that the sonicare keeps breaking...  </li>
            <li> Today, during my exam, he found ONE pocket of a &#x27;4&#x27; and most of the rest were 1&#x27;s and 2&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare brushes for many years because they have been recommended by my dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than my 18 year olds sisters</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is so astonishing that I look forward to “brushing.</li>
            <li> Maybe more than you wanted to</li>
            <li> I love the traveling case:&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Durable&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> put the plastic tray on top of the charger then the brush in it</li>
            <li> Also, I LOVE the cup charger.</li>
            <li> I am really glad that I did.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel reinvigorated and healthy.</li>
            <li> but this one has more charging options.</li>
            <li> This model is definitely the best one yet.  </li>
            <li> in all, I love using a Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve chipped my front teeth more than once (not on plastic), and worried the vibrating clack would chip them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so glad my sister had mentioned she was going to replace her dying Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this toothbrush  : )</li>
            <li> But really this brush is great.</li>
            <li> I wish they would have included more heads with this</li>
            <li> Healthy teeth and gums because of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love the charging cup.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a sincere pleasure purchasing and using a product whose manufacture is dedicated to honoring their product warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do love Sonicare toothbrushes, but now I have to buy brush heads for this and brush head for the one my husband has.  </li>
            <li> Tuesday, 7/16/2013 - I went to the dentist for a cleaning and was told that I have to floss more because my gums bleed severely when they&#x27;re doing the cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I will try flossing more</li>
            <li> #34;Hmm, I wonder if a better toothbrush that massages my gums better would help...</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;  So I start looking at the top rated/most featured electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- many cleaning options&lt;</li>
            <li> , I just leave it on for a day to be on the safe side</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems well made - I&#x27;m glad I bought</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m brushing more...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to purchase this fr my dentist for a lower price than on this site.  </li>
            <li> you want to keep your $150+ handle for more than a couple years, consider getting an extended warranty</li>
            <li> I love the USB charging case for times on the road.</li>
            <li> Splurged on the top of the line</li>
            <li> Also, this toothbrush has an extremely elegant look.</li>
            <li> I also love the design of the travelling container/case.</li>
            <li> It allows me to take it on the aircraft with my trips :)</li>
            <li> I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Outstanding.  </li>
            <li> love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but otherwise a lovely purchase.</li>
            <li> Braun(oral b) would be a better  choice.</li>
            <li> I love the portable charging case it comes with.</li>
            <li> My dentist and I love this.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I kept using it, not quite able to believe the toothbrush was at fault.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I can see why the dentists love them.</li>
            <li> (Why is that better than just setting it in the charger?)</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon and Phillips for helping to keep my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> but she claims it&#x27;s better than her Oralcare.</li>
            <li> I tend to brush my teeth often and was able to buy a refill brush set with 6 on Groupon for about $12.</li>
            <li> I should have done that, but I love the way the DiamondClean Toothbrush looks.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I followed through on her recommendation.  </li>
            <li> I am glad we did.  </li>
            <li> This top of line toothbrush died in two years.</li>
            <li> And my check ups are much better.</li>
            <li> Simply the best</li>
            <li> I love, love, love my Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Worked well while the batteries were okay.  </li>
            <li> Might not be a problem for some, but there should be a more intuitive way to choose your default setting instead of hitting a combination of buttons to set it.</li>
            <li> I love the product until after 8 months</li>
            <li> Ok, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I could say that you will get a truthful answer if you ever talk to them</li>
            <li> I would say Philips was very helpful, great customer service if you have your issue escalated to their team.  </li>
            <li> I love this electric tooth brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I could have wreaked havok with it when the plane was in the air</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s here somewhere</li>
            <li> like that I can just toss the brush into a glass and it charges without plugging in, and the design is so much more than any one person needs in a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It does it all and more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO glad I was finally able to get it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> I love the design as well.  </li>
            <li> Nothing cleans teeth better.</li>
            <li> elegant design.&lt;br /&gt;-Cool</li>
            <li> for a toothbrush, it does work a lot better than the others</li>
            <li> The diamonclean is the highest end Philips has - if I was going to go with it, I was getting the top end product, but that&#x27;s me.</li>
            <li> I still love the brush and so does my dentist.</li>
            <li> but I thought given the price and the Phillips name that I could expect more, but I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle is nice and sleek the white setting brush mode is incredible</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric toothbrush for ten years, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Lasting 11 years is quite impressive for anything.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more technological purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;glass&amp;#34; charger.</li>
            <li> how much better this thing is than a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Many cleaning modes</li>
            <li> love the glass charging solution.</li>
            <li> and it sort of seemed better.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Great job.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush magically charges in the case, even though nothing is plugged into the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Given the price, I hope to use this toothbrush for many years.  </li>
            <li> I truly enjoyed it while it lasted, but I can&#x27;t bring myself to ever purchase another one of these.</li>
            <li> I love the timed intervals depending on which setting you pick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that will change.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> my gum just getting better and better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda magic for me.</li>
            <li> b/c it makes sure you reach every part of your mouth and not just the front teeth.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I had read that most people didn&#x27;t notice a difference between sonic and non-sonic variety, so I opted for an Oral B electric (rotating-head) brush.  </li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the replacement heads just buzz off the top.</li>
            <li> Love it so much!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> Ignore most of the five star review hype that you read about this brush (\\&quot;Cleanest Teeth EVER!\\&quot;) and focus on these facts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : The longer you use a product, the better you get to know it.</li>
            <li> : The longer you use a product, the better you get to know it.</li>
            <li> The timing of this gift was awesome as it was the perfect stocking stuff for Xmas, I am just not sure if it was not a selfish gift.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> Love the tooth brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for 7 years now and DiamondClean is the latest in the family of rechargeable electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with the bottom of the toothbrush yellowing from water dripping from the top after usage.</li>
            <li> I love the DiamondClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I want to quantify my 3 star review of the Sonicare by saying I love this toothbrush and the sonicare brand of toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the toothbrush, but at $175 price point, I wouldn&#x27;t call it a</li>
            <li> I sincerely couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It looks like a glass tumbler, yet through the magic of electromagnetic induction it charges the toothbrush just by putting it in the glass tumbler.  </li>
            <li> But I am not at all pleased with Sonicare reliability.  </li>
            <li> love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but i am glad i did.</li>
            <li> The unit itself is stunning.</li>
            <li> With three great-looking, streamlined ways of storing your DiamondClean (case, glass, or stand), what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself works wonderfully and has numerous settings.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to brushing my teeth because of how wonderful my teeth feel when finished.  </li>
            <li> but really does a great job vibrating the plaque off.</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied that I want to recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the cleaning power and multiple modes</li>
            <li> So I did some aggressive research and went with the top of the line Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> And I am sure</li>
            <li> I love how well it cleans</li>
            <li> This one is even better.  </li>
            <li> I love the diff options on the brush.  </li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush, actually does what it promises.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> However, this is simply the best toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums have never felt better.</li>
            <li> Consumers lose: more money for them.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li> i love it.  </li>
            <li> Love that it inclues &#x27;gum care&#x27;  </li>
            <li> If I decide that Sonicare is still the best brush for cleaning, I&#x27;ll buy a different model.</li>
            <li> At $200+ retail you should be getting a product that is better constructed and functions well.</li>
            <li> What more do you want from a toothbrush?</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I doubt that many people will be plugging this into their laptops while on the plane to recharge their toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> do love the travel case that plugs in.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was definitely the perfect purchase for me.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love the design and feel of the brush.</li>
            <li> Love the design.</li>
            <li> becasue it advertises that removes up to 5x more plaque.</li>
            <li> I have always used the \\&quot;best\\&quot; and most \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; Oral B brushes.  </li>
            <li> Love how the lights show up whenever you push the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Outstanding quality and workmanship in every detail.</li>
            <li> It is a great brush, works like it should, feels good in your hand and the indicators in the handle are terrific.</li>
            <li> I will be sure to register the replacement online just in case.</li>
            <li> dentist tells me my teeth are in better shape than before,</li>
            <li> Recommend buying if you want a fantastic toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I love the beeping feature that tells you</li>
            <li> read the reports that say sonicares are better</li>
            <li> , I read the reports saying oral b brushes are better, and the reports that say any electric brush is better than manual.</li>
            <li> A worry more than a con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m assuming most usb chargers with mini plugs.</li>
            <li> So I just had to go to a setting with more time on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 5 more seconds of your time</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m assuming most usb chargers with mini plugs.</li>
            <li> So I just had to go to a setting with more time on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 5 more seconds of your time</li>
            <li> Anyone who paid $200.00 for a brush should expect a better quality.  </li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> I have used a Philips Sonicare for years but thought I would like the newer one even better.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush  my teeth love it to my mouth</li>
            <li> they look whiter and my check will be better than the pass ones.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Love the timer.</li>
            <li> Love love love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> has the most difference to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I love this.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is outstanding.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it and noted that my periodic checkups were better (vs. manual brushing).</li>
            <li> So stylish looking sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li> My dentist says my teeth and gums are noticeably better.</li>
            <li> Love this, so does my dentist.</li>
            <li> The handle, glass charging station, and travel case are elegant and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Not being entirely satisfied with the Braun I decided to try out the DiamondClean.</li>
            <li> so well you will be pleased you bought it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> if you do not get the answer you like, ask for a better answer.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But frankly theirs way too many of them.</li>
            <li> I love that you can charge it in the case via USB.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough, one of the best toothbrushes I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> You may be able to get it cheaper through your dentist :)</li>
            <li> well made case - with well designed texture for gripping when wet.&lt;br /&gt;Holds</li>
            <li> , just ads more cleaning work.</li>
            <li> I had also heard that Sonicare did a better job at cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> Also, you can&#x27;t turn off the toothbrush on one click most of the time.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ask for a better response than that.</li>
            <li> I am glad that the purchase was made.</li>
            <li> , my gums feel better and my teeth feel clean....and</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> The glass charger is cute, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> it(not knowing it was the top model at the time).</li>
            <li> After using oral b for over 12 years they could not believe how much better their mouths felt after using the sonicare diamond</li>
            <li> I personally love the glass.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of counter space and the ability to just set it in the cup to chargeand not have to make sure</li>
            <li> but you have a better chance of keeping the water flowing from your faucet by blocking it with your finger.</li>
            <li> Teeth are whiter, feel cleaner and look better.</li>
            <li> I have had this for more than two years and the cost of the replacement heads does add up.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> My experience (and yours may of course vary) was that this was an excellent toothbrush provided one did not expect it to last more than a year.</li>
            <li> and I love the cup charger.</li>
            <li> They were recommended by my Dentist and definitely do a better job of cleaning your teeth and reducing plaque.</li>
            <li> love the feeling of polish teeth, without too uch work or having to hurt your gums you know?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would love to see a better power cord.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It has thinner better shape.</li>
            <li> I read those reviews about the look &amp; functionality of this model, and after 4 months using this I agree with most of those who said this is an &amp;#34;apple&amp;#34; type toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s part of it.  </li>
            <li> the different modes are a plus, and the 3 week battery life is superb.</li>
            <li> SATISFIED SO FAR&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS MODEL.</li>
            <li> and I love the way oil feels in hair..</li>
            <li> I love it and so does my dentist.</li>
            <li> It you do want to switch, you need to push the power button to turn on the brush, count the number of pushed required to get to the mode you want and push that many times.</li>
            <li> All the different settings are great!</li>
            <li> Love the travel case.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> i love it...</li>
            <li> i love the charger.</li>
            <li> I have been using philips sonicare for many years now and nothing compares.  </li>
            <li> knew my teeth felt cleaner, and I thought they looked brighter, but thought perhaps it was my imagination; however, when I got home, my husband commented on how bright my smile was.  </li>
            <li> He hadn&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush for decades, and thought they were not any better than brushing by hand.  </li>
            <li> Love the travel case.</li>
            <li> Many wonder if it works on 220-240 Voltage, and yes it works (also on 110 V, USA).</li>
            <li> I have owned 4 different soniccare brushes and this one is the best</li>
            <li> and boy am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> also love the beeps that prompt you to move to another quadrant</li>
            <li> I also love all the charging options.  </li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing machine that removes plaque and leaves your teeth smooth and shining.  </li>
            <li> The brush seems stiffer too - I like it better for those reasons.  </li>
            <li> So glad I bought this</li>
            <li> I thought I would like this better than the Oral-B toothbrushes, but I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li> All family use it and everybody love it.</li>
            <li> unless the toothbrush is on.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, love the glass, charger and travel charger along with 3 week charge.</li>
            <li> design look nice and feel quality and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Love love love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed, both with this product&#x27;s obvious quality as well as its operation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just learning to use it, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I like it better each day</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD BETTER CHECKUPS, CLEANINGS AT MY DENTIST SINCE USING THIS BURSH.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for over a year now and love it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, and plan to buy it as a gift for my mom and mother- inlaw.</li>
            <li> promise you will love it like me and</li>
            <li> I will let you know more after using it for some time.</li>
            <li> My hygenist suggested I invest in a GOOD toothbrush and get the Phillips Sonicare &amp; said it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> The Waterpic is actually a better tool than ANY toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Travel case is awesome and looks very stylish and great size, the glass charger is also a great feature i travel a lot reason i spent a little more and got this one.</li>
            <li> The travel case is definitely a good part of the decision because it will allow for very effective recharging while on the road with the same amount of storage.</li>
            <li> It has superior cleaning power and gets between teeth, right where I need it, to tackle those pesky coffee stains.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush has a very sleek design - it looks very nice in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> When the rep came on, she was very nice and very helpful.  </li>
            <li> It gets your teeth beyond clean and removes tartar most effectively.  </li>
            <li> (I think I only used it for 4 months and it is not plugged in most of the time!!!).</li>
            <li> Very powerful, has whitened my teeth !</li>
            <li> and I am glad I didn&#x27;t - high quality and the charging in the cup or USB case work great.</li>
            <li> Amazing Clean</li>
            <li> A friend told me how amazing his was and the level of clean.  </li>
            <li> Had an older model that was great.</li>
            <li> I loving it, i never feel clean like this</li>
            <li> /&gt;she says her teeth feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li> This is the most powerful toothbrush ever...can&#x27;t wait to get back to dentist to see what they think, but my teeth and gums are happy happy</li>
            <li> Our teeth feel so much more clean now!</li>
            <li> Congrats Philips on addressing so many improvements in this great new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> A great product and this new one is even better.</li>
            <li> I love the timed brushing, I love the travel case and easy charging.</li>
            <li> --you get a better brush mechanism and the very cool charging glass as well.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean and my mouth refreshed .</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does get my teeth very clean, and I like the charging tumbler and travel case.</li>
            <li> It does make your teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel very clean after usage and can notice they are whiter.  </li>
            <li> and I loved my first one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good brush, nut the price is pretty steep.</li>
            <li> The sleek look and the cool charging options make this Sonicare a pleasure to own and use.</li>
            <li> I picked this model after a long market research and I am very happy.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner, the hygienist doesn&#x27;t need as long for cleanings, and my dentist says my teeth are in the best shape in years.</li>
            <li> I think I brush my teeth with it best while in the shower because I am not trying to be careful to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen, so I can focus on cleaning my teeth more.</li>
            <li> I decided that was a sign to try the new Sonicare, and I&#x27;m very glad I did!</li>
            <li> The design is quite contemporary and the  unit cleans up very nicely after brushing.</li>
            <li> (I feel my teeth are completely clean after each brush), a good 3 week battery life, and cool chargeable traveling bag for the brush.</li>
            <li> Sonicare brushes, and this brush is no exception, isn&#x27;t as good at removing stains as touted, and the implication that it can clean in between teeth because it sends &amp;#34;sonic waves of cleaning&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t hold true.  </li>
            <li> the most important thing that swung me to buy this is that my dental hygienist (who I trust and respect very much) said this was the best Sonicare ever and would really improve my tooth and gum health.</li>
            <li> Since then I have been extremely pleased with it as it is easy to operate and always makes my teeth feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, the unit is more attractive than any other brush I&#x27;ve seen; it just looks good on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In just a fee weeks i saw impressive results, my teeth had never felt cleaner and they are getting even whiter, the gum option is perfect for a much necessary massage every other day.</li>
            <li> Worth EVERY... PENNY!!</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush with new improved brushing features.  </li>
            <li> And, boy do your teeth feel great after brushing, while the vibration is not too strong like it is on some of the older Sonicare models.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I paid a bit more for this model and the fact is I am happy I did not settle for the old models like some of the reviews</li>
            <li> &amp; I was extremely pleased at how easy it was.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, until there is more conclusive evidence, everyone should use the brush that they find most comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the whole thing and really like brushing my teeth again since the tooth brush does all of the work and the brush tells you when to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> no frills kind of model that feels great in your hand and is built to last.</li>
            <li> , a UV Sanitizer would be perfect, and perhaps they&#x27;ll bring back the standalone sanitizer that was once available.  </li>
            <li> It looks great and the charging case is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> No, it did not meet my expectation though it works good and gives good result, but its battery life is short.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> since it is glass it is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> when you do go after 8-12 months, your teeth will show up 2x cleaner than manual brushing and showing up every 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw - very easy to clean and charge.  </li>
            <li> Works great and makes his teeth feel like a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth very effectively and much better than my old Braun toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> beautifully&lt;br /&gt;-AMAZING clean!  </li>
            <li> beautifully&lt;br /&gt;-AMAZING clean!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month now and everytime I use this brush my mouth truly feels dentist clean!</li>
            <li> even my dentist is amazed with how clean my teeth are!</li>
            <li> Teeth feel so clean and dual voltage is a plus for traveling!</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush cleans 100 times better than any other power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things: easy to use, easy to clean, and the cup holder is actually attractive on a sink.  </li>
            <li> Awesome clean big improvement on the Braun option.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Internal characteristics: the sonicare diamondclean is fantastic while brushing the teeth, by the time you finish your brushing, you feel and see your teeth being so clean and nice that you cannot believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this Diamondclean model looks very cool and appears to have a nicer brush head</li>
            <li> The teethbrush itself is very good, but I only use it abot three month, suddunly</li>
            <li> It cleans very good, my teeth are white.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use (I never had used an electric one) and so easy to clean after use.</li>
            <li> Form factor is kind of slippery, looks really cool, but need a good grip as apposed to the older models which had rubber handles.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using the Sonocare as it seems to do a better job caring for my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important aspect of the DiamondClean system is how well it works in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Love the glass charger and all the available settings.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly it makes my teeth feel cleaner</li>
            <li> I like the tooth brush and so far my experience with customer services has been great.</li>
            <li> It cleans better than any electric toothbrush available.  </li>
            <li> whole different kind of tooth brushing, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> The design is elegant and thoughtful.</li>
            <li> The $7 cheap powered toothbrushes on the market have replaceable batteries and therefore are a much better buy.</li>
            <li> So far I have been happy I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> wow great product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an annoyance for basically the most advanced consumer toothbrush in the history of the planet of Earth.</li>
            <li> But cheap plastic from top to bottom?  </li>
            <li> I also love that this brush does such a wonderful job of removing plaque, I rarely have to use my plaque scraper now.</li>
            <li> The most distinctive feature is that the brush makes a sound every thirty seconds to remind you to switch to another quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> so it is much more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> More importantly perhaps, after a week or two you can observe a noticeable difference --</li>
            <li> course, the most important thing is how it works.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s fabulous and cleans better than any toothbrush I used.  </li>
            <li> I chose to use the charging stand over the glass as it fit better in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Good design, cleans really well.</li>
            <li> the FlexCare Plus really worked or just made me feel good.  </li>
            <li> Way too much money to spend and not get a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> I loved mine so much that I bought my husband one for Christmas this year.  </li>
            <li> Bought my wife one and loved it so much that bought myself one.</li>
            <li> If you are ready to invest in a good electric toothbrush I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> It is also very nicely designed and the appearance is clean &amp; modern.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric toothbrushes for more than 10 years and this thing is hands down the best one on the market.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my first Sonicare, it&#x27;s gorgeous looking, easy to use and leave my teeth super clean.  </li>
            <li> The glass to hold the unit is EASY to clean and it never falls off or out of it!  </li>
            <li> New charger is awesome, I&#x27;ve used sonicare for years and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is great product I purchased for my wife this past Christmas , she uses it every day and is the best electric tooth brush she has ever own , and she has used many different models for over 20 years .</li>
            <li> So far I love the toothbrush!!  </li>
            <li> The DiamondClean brush heads are also very nice and professional looking.</li>
            <li> Also, their customer service is not the most friendly and they will try to trick you into admitting fault so they can immediately deny a replacement and void your warranty.</li>
            <li> Also, their customer service is not the most friendly and they will try to trick you into admitting fault so they can immediately deny a replacement and void your warranty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better than my original one.  </li>
            <li> I have used other name brand electric toothbrushes over the years but the diamondclean sonicare electric toothbrush is the best.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my best purchases of the year (the other being the Nutribullet).</li>
            <li> Not bad!</li>
            <li> but I can tell even though my head is new on my older brush that this tooth brush is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT deactivate the 14 day Easy Start feature.  </li>
            <li> I love how clean my teeth feel after,</li>
            <li> but I was now using the top of line PS Diamond Clean.  </li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try an electric toothbrush for quite sometime, and my dental hygenist does recommend the Philips Sonicare, but I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend that kind of money without really knowing how well they worked.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> After getting used to that, I found it quite easy to use</li>
            <li> Like the diamond clean I was using the top of the line</li>
            <li> I think maybe some reviewers did not deactivate the \\&quot;easy start\\&quot; feature that comes as a factory default.</li>
            <li> love the sense of clean after use.</li>
            <li> It does not appear to clean my teeth any better.</li>
            <li> Everything about the diamond clean is top notch</li>
            <li> The brushes are easy to change...just push on and pull off..no need to twist.</li>
            <li> The brush portion easily pops off for changing, or for travel use, or for disinfecting.      </li>
            <li> I have had two Sonicare diamond clean tooth brushes and I love them.  </li>
            <li> I find that the brush is easy to handle and like the feel of the material in my hands.</li>
            <li> If dropped on its head, it may break easily</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it is safe to clean your jewelry with this toothbrush, but it works.  </li>
            <li> It seems alot more powerful and my teeth feel &amp; look better.</li>
            <li> I like this product because help to mantein more clean and health my teeths and gums.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that the blush head comes up easily and there is no pocket to build up all that gunk.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to charge via USB</li>
            <li> Better yet, they stay feeling clean for hours after using.</li>
            <li> I use the glass drinking glass option at home; it is just so easy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that easy.</li>
            <li> It protects the toothbrush and is an easy way to charge it on the go, of you even need to.</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold, even when it is vibrating.  </li>
            <li> Brush heads attach and remove easily.  </li>
            <li> This brush is much more powerful and feels like a tool that the dentist would use rather than one I would be able to use at home.  </li>
            <li> The section below contains more on the pros and cons I&#x27;ve experienced since I wrote the above review after extended use of the DiamondClean:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The section below contains more on the pros and cons I&#x27;ve experienced since I wrote the above review after extended use of the DiamondClean:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is easy to handle and operate.  </li>
            <li> It does a phenomenal job and always leaves my teeth exceptionally clean.  </li>
            <li> You either have to turn it on and have water/toothpaste to splash everywhere, or put it in your mouth and cycle through while trying to look in a mirror(not easy).  </li>
            <li> Easy to rinse off after brushing.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use,</li>
            <li> I love the Diamond clean brushes that come with it.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s easy to brush my teeth for two minutes.  </li>
            <li> worth the price - great options to charge and very reliable.  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush,one charge will last me 10 days, my gums are in better condition so says my hygieneist.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this brush is lighter l has a square shaped handle, and is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> The programable power feature is easy to use and the battery life is excelllent.</li>
            <li> It has a matt, eggshell-like finish and is easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li> love the clean design of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Easy and convient to travel with and charge.</li>
            <li> I love the sensation of this toothbrush as I clean</li>
            <li> LOVE my sonicare toothbrush....very sleek and clean, brushes well, and notifies you when it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> Easy to have it</li>
            <li> I must say, however, that the Oral B does seem to clean a bit better, although I didn&#x27;t often use it because it felt rather rough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe the button should be on the bottom where your hands wont hit it so easily.</li>
            <li> Love it except that you can&#x27;t see the options (clean, massage gums etc.)</li>
            <li> after getting the tooth brush I didn&#x27;t quite understand all the gripes since everything was self explanatory and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy and convient to charge and transport.</li>
            <li> The vibration was also strong.  </li>
            <li> It was fully charged on arrival and is still going strong after one week.</li>
            <li> my skin has a strong tendency towards redness and irritation.</li>
            <li> The adjustable settings allow you to choose how strong you want the vibration.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older E series that I had for a good 8 years.  </li>
            <li> I am concerned about my gums as I get older and from what I read the Sonicare is superior for preventing gum disease.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one of the older Sonicare products and loved it.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare DiamondClean is by far the most superior brush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The one I&#x27;m replacing has been going strong for about 3 years now</li>
            <li> she strongly suggests&lt;br /&gt;adhering</li>
            <li> It took a while to get use to how strong it was</li>
            <li> and I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you turn this on and after about a min press the main button it will turn off... which is good.  </li>
            <li> As for the brush head, I find the DimondClean superior to the older ProResults syle.</li>
            <li> find myself brushing much more frequently , which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> , I strongly suggest it to anyone.</li>
            <li> and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Very easy to charge and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> My dentist is impressed with how much I have improved my oral health and how pink and healthy my gums are!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a surprisingly good tooth brush, i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you get one, be sure to thoroughly check your right away!</li>
            <li> This model is very nice and looks to be made better than the last model.  </li>
            <li> It looks amazing, very clean modern design.  </li>
            <li> : This is a pretty amazing creation.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and this works wonderfully without making my teeth feel more sensitive.</li>
            <li> Over the course of a month there has been a marked and remarkable improvement in the health of my gums and mouth, and my teeth do seem to even look whiter and healthier.</li>
            <li> I really liked this toothbrush for the first 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, well-designed, relatively quiet electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I did notice that the awesome compact heads will fit other Philips toothbrushes so that may be a solution.</li>
            <li> its beautiful and still makes me feel like i have just left the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty nice brush otherwise.</li>
            <li> Exact kind of tooth brush I wanted.</li>
            <li> With online registration, they do push the warranty to 2.5 years, which is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> With online registration, they do push the warranty to 2.5 years, which is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> When the price for this item comes down about $50, I think it&#x27;ll be the best Sonicare option on the market.</li>
            <li> I love that clean smooth feeling after brushing.  </li>
            <li> well you clean your teeth is more important than how often you brush them.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months and my teeth have never felt so completely clean and smooth and my gums so healthy, with no bleeding at all, ever--and my gums sort of tingle for quite a while after brushing.  </li>
            <li> The best tooth brush hands down I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all of the settings but the sensitive, clean, and polish settings are great.</li>
            <li> As one of a fairly significant number of folks who are susceptible to gagging when brushing their teeth, I had pretty high hopes that this toothbrush might be an ideal solution for me.</li>
            <li> Usage tests have shown that high speed brush movement is most effective for plaque control.  </li>
            <li> Diamondclean is definitely much more powerful than the Flexcare, noticeably more powerful!</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend the diamond clean for either an upgrade or first timer, you will not find better!  </li>
            <li> the tooth brush and my teeth feel incredibally clean, I get excited to brush my teeth!</li>
            <li> Easy programming, and the USB powered travel case is a huge hit.  </li>
            <li> Everywhere else it charged fine</li>
            <li> Finely engineered precision instrument.</li>
            <li> The travel case is plugged into my DVR box and it charges fine.</li>
            <li> The bottom is recessed and smooth and easily wiped</li>
            <li> as typical, Sonicare is the best mouth hygiene device,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> and my teeth are doing just fine.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re trying the competitors brush now and for less money, it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> You know you&#x27;re paying for the design, and you&#x27;re fine with it.</li>
            <li> but after a week you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Fine, but you need to put the toothpaste on the toothbrush and put it in your mouth before you start using it.</li>
            <li> and I travel just fine with both.  </li>
            <li> That works fine</li>
            <li> It starts vibrating as soon as you push the button, and if it&#x27;s not in your mouth, you&#x27;re going to shower your face and bathroom with a fine mist of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit and it worked fine for 2 1/2 years</li>
            <li> Luckily, I had registered my unit and they replaced it with no questions asked!  </li>
            <li> For almost $200, a freaking toothbrush shouldn&#x27;t die so quickly from something preventable!</li>
            <li> Although I was very happy with this product, it has effectively died after two and a half years.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service says the most they can do is to offer a coupon for 10% to 15% off a  new unit.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth (and gums) clean and they FEEL clean!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;overall if you can get a good deal I would recommend but even if not its a very sharp product good job Phillips</li>
            <li> What first caught my attention is the toothbrush design, modern and very nice to look at.</li>
            <li> Update, they send me a brand new unit after I called Philips, and a prepaid waybill inside the box as well, how great is that, much better customer service than Oral B, thanks Philips</li>
            <li> Quite, great design, thought through travel case, easy charging, glass cradle, various charging options, light.</li>
            <li> after using the sonicare flex plus i ordered this for my wife and she absolutely loves it, this diamond clean is outstanding she loves it and have teeth feel like when she comes from the dentist nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Perfect, it takes a little getting accustomed to</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied and would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It was in funny packaging, but works great, keeps my teeth happy and clean, and ended up costing about $75 less than I could find elsewhere!  </li>
            <li> Probably not, Sonicare&#x27;s own website states you get a 44% better clean using the new DiamondClean heads, so</li>
            <li> Light weight, looks great, and multiple ways to charge.</li>
            <li> so much better than oral b.  much longer battery life but even more importantly the cleaning experience is far superior.  </li>
            <li> Clean and comfortable, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush with a great travel pack and recharge system, offering several ways to charge the brush.</li>
            <li> the fact thst you can charge with USB is also a huge plus.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, in terms of cleaning my teeth, I don&#x27;t think that this toothbrush is significantly better than my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I figured maybe they got them free for allowing advertising material to be placed in the office.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great only the serial number on the bottom of toothbrush is not valid when I try to register it.  </li>
            <li> The sellers buy them CHEAP and triple the price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my mother-in-law because she has a fantastic stank breath.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s still a great functioning sonic toothbrush --</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with the results I get.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; function is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Even though I got this for free for taking part of the Vine Program, I will never, ever be without a Sonicare again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The travel case is fantastic, but when it comes to charging it has some issues.</li>
            <li> Overall this is the sonicare quality, and a great brush.</li>
            <li> Way more powerful.</li>
            <li> This is great because now I can see I have not been taking enough time to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> From the picture, you can see the charging light is not on for the replacement brush.</li>
            <li> The 30 second interval timer is great as I like to zone out while brushing</li>
            <li> I am rarely finished at that point, so I have to take the toothbrush out of my mouth, put my glasses on to make sure I&#x27;m activating the correct brushing mode, and then start the cycle over.</li>
            <li> but mostly it&#x27;s EASY TO CLEAN.</li>
            <li> and you will enjoy the feel of it.  </li>
            <li> And, not only does this thing do a great job, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to replace this unit with another one and try it since I keep hearing such great things about them.</li>
            <li> Initially I was quite impressed with how well it cleaned, much better than my old Oral B.  </li>
            <li> and I could use it comfortably.</li>
            <li> It has the fit and finish of, say,  an eyeglass case.</li>
            <li> It has the fit and finish of, say,  an eyeglass case.</li>
            <li> the induction charger is nice, and the travel case (which is also a charger) is also very well made.</li>
            <li> The ability to recharage the shaver thru a USB port is a great plus as I&#x27;m often travelling and find myself short of electrical outlets.    </li>
            <li> I ended up buying this toothbrush after going to the dentist and finding that I had to have 2 cavities filled.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for my wife&#x27;s Sonicare Diamondclean, as she experienced the same issue.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great considering the crest 3D white is about $8 a tube.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li> multiple brushing modes are great, but the one-button interface is counter-intuitive and even after months of use</li>
            <li> I have to note that I got this one free through the Amazon VINE program.</li>
            <li> She said to me, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m happy you&#x27;re a physician.&amp;#34; In response, I said that the only reason I was mentioning I was a physician is that Philips is a healthcare company that has separate groups for physicians and consumers.</li>
            <li> Also after engaging this Sonicare my head must be over the sink as the RPM causes me to drool.</li>
            <li> I find the pulse of the timer when it&#x27;s time to switch zones is extremely useful at making sure I&#x27;m brushing evenly, also.</li>
            <li> Everything is smooth and designed well, also feels sturdy in the hand (not plastic-y).  </li>
            <li> Fortunately the travel case also functions as a charger, and I use it at home.  </li>
            <li> easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I think the carrying case is the most useful for me.  </li>
            <li> Overall experience was great.</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth thoroughly and adds a lovely shine to my smile.  </li>
            <li> get it love it and smile because of it</li>
            <li> easy to use and really clean</li>
            <li> I like the smooth handle.</li>
            <li> I was advised not to buy a cheap one</li>
            <li> I use the smaller head toothbrush and is works great.</li>
            <li> Has a USB travel charger, but I pack light and leave the Sonicare at home, so no use for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> However the handle is so sleek and smooth</li>
            <li> I may not used every setting but they are available if I so choose.  </li>
            <li> Get it when there is a coupon or sale available, and that will help with the price.</li>
            <li> Light appears when charging necessary&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cheap sort of person</li>
            <li> This Sonicare toothbrush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> i would feel comfortable brushing my teeth when my partner is asleep.  </li>
            <li> I am normally a cheap person but</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and the charger is glass so also easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> It works well for me and the brush head is secure.</li>
            <li> so I decided to give it a try when I saw this product available.</li>
            <li> These newer style look light</li>
            <li> Not to mention the UV doesn&#x27;t seem like it would have an effect in crevices where the light doesn&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> Dental care is highly important to me, that&#x27;s why I decided to make this investment.</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;Charging&amp;#34; light starts pulsating.  </li>
            <li> Design just isn&#x27;t that important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> value of great design is very much a personal decision.</li>
            <li> Design just isn&#x27;t that important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> value of great design is very much a personal decision.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head does not attach securely.</li>
            <li> I tried with both of the toothbrush heads that come with the toothbrush and neither of them attaches securely.</li>
            <li> sleek and nice in touch, and with the power button changing modes it is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The contrast between my trusty old Oral B and my bright and shiny, streamlined Sonicare is the difference between a Model-T and  Ferrari.</li>
            <li> enjoy the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Inability to change the settings without turning it on is annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a brush, it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush but it works the same as the lower models.  </li>
            <li> It is incredibly easy to use, and leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic travel package too for those who travel.  </li>
            <li> The product performs great, getting that &amp;#34;like the dentist&#x27;s cleaning&amp;#34; feel I would not have believed was possible before trying the product.  </li>
            <li> I reviewed each available and this one stood out to me.  </li>
            <li> and honestly I wasn&#x27;t putting in all that much</li>
            <li> (light massage)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great having a glass in the bathroom for that last minute drink of water before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I get that same great feeling as I do when I get a cleaning at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I really do enjoy brushing my teeth now.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> it gradually gets more powerful with each of the 1st 14 sessions that are 1+ min of the toothbrush being on.</li>
            <li> The cleaning options light up when you hit the on button, or when you take it off the charger.</li>
            <li> The thing makes a humming sound but stopped vibrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sturdy and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So to the pros, cons, and important stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Handle is relatively light in weight.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s that sound?</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve had no problems with it, and the system in total has been great.</li>
            <li> the cleaning in combination with the brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Even though it is plastic, it doesn&#x27;t feel like cheap plastic at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the light was flashing meaning it was still charging but wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  </li>
            <li> This is a great personal care item.  </li>
            <li> but this one is way more powerful.  </li>
            <li> It is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> these things aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> During the summer I enjoy going camping.</li>
            <li> My dentist once told me that teeth are supposed to be smooth like porcelain</li>
            <li> The case with the USB charge is thoughtful design element.</li>
            <li> The updates are thoughtful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It is an absolutely fabulous toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I reported it to Amazon within the 30 day period and so am getting a refund.</li>
            <li> I had the earlier version of the sonicare brush and it was great until i broke it.</li>
            <li> the only one I am proud of having in my bathroom</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model is more aggressive / powerful than the Flexcare - I don&#x27;t know how it compares to the Flexcare+.</li>
            <li> I never used it that much, but liked having it integrated into the charger</li>
            <li> She was not amused at my offer to re-label some of the available modes to those.  </li>
            <li> I use it as my primary toothbrush and it travels quite well.</li>
            <li> If a toothbrush has to be technologically advanced, it better prove to me that it&#x27;s worth the price and the change in style.  </li>
            <li> so I returned it and got this much sleeker stylish model and couldn&#x27;t be more</li>
            <li> I had an Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush before this and loved it.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning power of this brush is superior by far.</li>
            <li> The handle is smooth but matte (not slippery), and I love love love the charging station (using either the glass cup or a more traditional stand-up attachment that comes with it).</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Essence: good basic brush, not as many strokes per minute.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was livid, and told the rep that I didn&#x27;t think it was fair to have one DOA, spend nearly $200 on a toothbrush and to wait 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I loved my old Sonicare</li>
            <li> The instrumental is wonderful in how it slowly but surely is helping my problem.</li>
            <li> love it soooooooo much and already recommend it to most of my friends and now recommend to you</li>
            <li> It is high quality, easy to clean, has a nice feel, and is easy to change heads.  </li>
            <li> The compact head seems the right size, and so far everything is holding up great.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the new model.</li>
            <li> New charger very elegant, new travel case also very elegant.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just get this out of the way right up front: this latest incarnation of the Philips Sonicare toothbrush is quite pricey.</li>
            <li> And yes, all the studies are right, you do spend more time cleaning with an electrical, which is counter intuitive, because you are systematically trying to cover every surface of every tooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The cup doesn&#x27;t always charge right, so you have to make sure that it&#x27;s charging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> out yet I have used other Sonicare toothbrushes that were very good</li>
            <li> Yes, the toothbrush itself is very effective and the travel case with the built in charger is totally clutch.....</li>
            <li> This unit can be charged three different ways, very handy for travel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes for many years, most recently with the Oral-B 3D line, which I thought was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Despite running on battery, it is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> The white design is also very nice.</li>
            <li> A well designed, very powerful toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I realized that there is a very distinct difference in how aggressive they vibrate.</li>
            <li> It is VERY powerful, so it did take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Great product will tell all my friends how white and clean it gets your teeth.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of different modes that ensure a great clean.</li>
            <li> , I only use 2 of the settings, clean and whitening, and haven&#x27;t used the others, but who cares, these 2 settings are great.  </li>
            <li> Makes my entire mouth feel clean great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of studies available that support one type of power brush technology versus another, but nothing is clinically significant.</li>
            <li> Father-in-Law also purchased one of these after seeing how awesome it was during the first few months, and I told him he better not drop it.  </li>
            <li> I would definetly recomment this brush to everyone who wants to have healthy gums and clean teeth!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was without a doubt worth every penny, I never thought I&#x27;d ever be this excited about brushing my teeth or find myself writing a product review for a toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost a year now and by dentist and dental hygienist have said it&#x27;s made a huge difference in keeping my teeth and gum clean.</li>
            <li> The first one I had worked great until it was about a year old</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> I felt like my teeth weren&#x27;t getting as clean with the manual toothbrush, but she confirmed it.</li>
            <li> is in the correct way is fantastic, besides, who doesn&#x27;t like to rinse after they clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel as smooth and clean as just having been to the dentist.</li>
            <li> nice as the bells and whistles are, the main thing is how it cleans, and at this it excels unlike any toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is a wise investment to prevent plaque build up and cavities that cost more in the long run.  </li>
            <li> The travel case and USB charger make traveling with this super convenient and easy.</li>
            <li> ; when you spend a decent amount on the item, you would assume there is an honest answer of when you would receive your replacement item under warrant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was initially very pleased with this product as my first review shows; but then ... At almost exactly one year from purchase, the battery died.</li>
            <li> This is my first kind, so I cannot compare with others, but all I can say is it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> The order process via Amazon was quick, easy, and reliable as always.</li>
            <li> I own an older model of the Sonicare</li>
            <li> Also, amazon offers warranties by square trade which I believe are very good, but then after spending this much for a toothbrush, do you really want to spend more to warranty a toothbrush?</li>
            <li> Great brush to replace the old one, very powerful and it charges very fast&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful and my teeth are super clean !</li>
            <li> So, I love the way this toothbrush looks, the charging station is cool and fun, and being able to charge by USB is actually pretty darned useful.&lt;br /&gt;However, the one thing, and</li>
            <li> The glass and plastic stand that are included to hold the toothbrush in the bathroom are both high quality, and the toothbrush itself has a nice heft.</li>
            <li> easily rechargeable through either the main unit (which is no touch charging by the way) or the travel pack which can be hooked up to a laptop usb outlet!!!</li>
            <li> probably wouldn&#x27;t have upgraded from one of the regular sonicare products to this, but as a new customer for the rechargeable products, it seems like the best brush on the market.</li>
            <li> It holds the charge for the whole week easily when brushing three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;This brush has many brushing options.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of different sonic toothbrushes and this one is the best by far!</li>
            <li> For example, the first time I used it I had to click once to turn it on, and then three more times to get to the \\&quot;Gum care\\&quot; setting.</li>
            <li> Upon unboxing, I was really impressed with the included accessories (especially the charging travel case, wow!).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to get it to consistently do what I wanted.</li>
            <li> At first it was a bit ticklish but I realized it was because I was so used to the more jarring sensation of the Oral B.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> (Originally I gave it 3 bc</li>
            <li> Firstly you aren&#x27;t able to select the setting you want until it&#x27;s already on and spraying your bathroom with toothpaste.</li>
            <li> first of all, I love the design and how it works when it is not defective.</li>
            <li> I also have noticed a significant improvement in my gum health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I cannot begin to tell you how excited I am to have this version.</li>
            <li> significantly whiter teeth thought.</li>
            <li> Smile!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> it came with a unique travel case,  </li>
            <li> When I first tried the Sonicare DiamondClean, I thought that even the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; head was tiny, but was pretty impressed by how well this toothbrush cleans.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I love it so much and from now on will never switch to another brand!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes since the original model with the screw-on brush head.  </li>
            <li> Well let me tell you, from the first use I could tell it was much better than the Oral B.  </li>
            <li> * ORIGINAL REVIEW</li>
            <li> I was interested more in function and practical features than I was in design, or the USB charging capabilities.  </li>
            <li> first let me start by saying that i used to love sonicares.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a sonic toothbrush before, but love my Clarisonic face cleaner so much that I thought I&#x27;d try one out!  </li>
            <li> Amazingly worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare in the past, but this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li> They replace both of them for me within the year of my original purchases.  </li>
            <li> I originally had the E-series, which I bought about 7 years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been using them since they came out before Philips bought the original company.</li>
            <li> This is also my first Sonicare with more than two modes.</li>
            <li> Although it was pricy, it was well worth it!</li>
            <li> , this is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have noticed my teeth significantly healthier and whiter.</li>
            <li> and it definitely does more than brushing alone, I just love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure my teeth are whiter after using this as well.</li>
            <li> I sincerely couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.here&#x27;s a logical reason for every feature.  </li>
            <li> I also feel like my smile is whiter!  </li>
            <li> The carrying case is cool but you can fit the charger in it</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 5 months now and am still using the original brush head, I haven&#x27;t had to change it yet.  </li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for awhile now, but this was worth the money for the upgrade!</li>
            <li> If you do decide to try this brush I would brush 3 or more x/day for the first 30 days just to see how it is working for you</li>
            <li> teeth aren&#x27;t pretty, but they&#x27;re healthy and I want to keep them.</li>
            <li> success!</li>
            <li> There is an introductory setting that can be turned off if you are familiar with electric toothbrushes or kept on if your aren&#x27;t used to the \\&quot;tickle\\&quot; of the brush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Well worth my money!</li>
            <li> The charger is pretty interesting as well.</li>
            <li> So, if you can get past the buzz in your mouth, this is the best product for the job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it made a significant impact on my dental health.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Options backlighting done via LED, making display very bright, but also using less electricity</li>
            <li> For charging it seem really cool that you can just drop the toothbrush in glass without having to make sure it&#x27;s positioned the right way, REALLY cool.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums felt amazingly clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Charging in the glass it comes with works great and looks a heck of a lot better than the usual charger, plus it&#x27;s not as easy to bump it and tip it over.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Diamond Clean is definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li> new one is really nice.</li>
            <li> still want to try the Diamond Clean</li>
            <li> My mouth has never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> Once you have gotten used to using a Sonicare toothbrush your teeth never feel quite as clean from manual brushing, because they aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Well I purchased the Philips Sonic Diamond Clean in January &#x27;12.  </li>
            <li> Although I do like the cleaning performance of the Diamond Clean, I am not investing $200 in yet another handset.</li>
            <li> Teeth stay clean (like dentist clean) even after eating meals.</li>
            <li> It charges in the glass, so the handle stays clean and you can stick the glass in the dishwasher.</li>
            <li> The diamond clean makes my teeth feel cleaner than any dental visit I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Every time I use my tooth brush, my mouth and teeth feel and look so clean, just like the moment you leave the dentist chair for a dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> Compared to manual and battery powered toothbrushes, this Sonicare leaves your teeth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> Changing from using (rarely) a manual toothbrush to the HealthyWhite was a huge difference, and from the HW to the DiamondClean brush heads made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The term squeaky clean comes to mind.</li>
            <li> it leaves me with a neat and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> My tooth and gum looks clean,</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t get over how clean her teeth feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat of a neat freak with my toothbrush and the Diamond Clean</li>
            <li> This keeps my teeth so clean.</li>
            <li> I think it adds an elegant and stylish alternative to the old charging station.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my teeth have ever been so clean.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law is a dentist and gave me the Sonicare diamond clean toothbrush for Christmas two years ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush that made my mouth fell so clean.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth are after using it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to purchase the Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 Diamond Clean.  </li>
            <li> I get that clean from the dentist feel every time.</li>
            <li> The Diamond Clean was recommended by my hygienist</li>
            <li> purchased 4 Diamond Clean PHILLIPS SONICARE Electric Toothbrushes (2 in August, 2 in September 2012).  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt SK clean.</li>
            <li> like how teeth feel noticably clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li> clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Diamond Clean for about 6 weeks now</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not always clean how the toothbrush fits in it</li>
            <li> Teeth have never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li> Teeth feels really clean after use.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Diamond Clean toothbrush through Amazon prime.</li>
            <li> my teeth will never feel as clean with manual brushes.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s your teeth clean tho.</li>
            <li> Besides clean teeth and breath</li>
            <li> clean and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paying</li>
            <li> featured  on the Diamond Clean toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt so clean.</li>
            <li> Much clean.</li>
            <li> you can feel the clean, as if you went to the doctor for cleaning session.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean</li>
            <li> The brush heads get between teeth - and you can feel the clean.</li>
            <li> Far and above the best electric toothbrush we have ever used.  </li>
            <li> They clean</li>
            <li> he loves the Phillips Sonicare Diamond Clean Rechargeable Electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Bravo Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li> So, I purchased the Flexcare model, which still uses the Diamond Clean brush heads, isn&#x27;t as sleek, but has TWO buttons -- a power button, and a mode-selection button.</li>
            <li> But it leaves your teeth feeling amazingly clean (post-dentist clean even).  </li>
            <li> Easier to keep clean, too.  </li>
            <li> Teeth and mouth feel incredibly clean after using this brush.  </li>
            <li> However my teeth felt so clean, my mouth so relaxed, and</li>
            <li> This is the third Sonicare that I have owned in probabaly 10 years and by far this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean like it should.</li>
            <li> It is a really great electric tooth brush and worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> It is clean and sleek.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s powerful brushing motion, is easy to recharge by placing it in the provided glass cup, and it&#x27;s sleek design stays cleaner than the models I had before.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the diamond clean because of the travel case and the premium look.  </li>
            <li> I will start by saying that it my Sonicare DiamondClean electric toothbrush does seem to clean well.</li>
            <li> To remedy this, I would remove the head at every charge cycle and use a q-tip to clean the inside and around the post on the toothbrush itself.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean after using this brush.</li>
            <li> of my friends has been a longtime user of the diamond clean after receiving it as a gift and raved about</li>
            <li> I get a dentist clean with every use.</li>
            <li> It still does clean just as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed how much cleaner my teeth are and more importantly, so has my hygienist.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never feel so clean.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean, soothed and refreshed that I find myself brushing after I eat to maintain that clean feeling.</li>
            <li> but if you want your mouth clean, this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> But, after noticing how clean my teeth were, he gave it a try and was also impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The carrying case is great and the charging lasts much longer than you would ever have a need to worry about while using it at home near a charging station.</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel incredibly clean.</li>
            <li> I use the mulitple settings to clean, whiten &amp; care for my gums.</li>
            <li> I like the Sonicares and think they&#x27;re the best available, but I&#x27;m not thrilled about spending $200 every 2-3 years for an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The oral b would have been cheaper, however the cases never seem to look good to me (never tried them to be honest), and the timer/pressure/teeth cleaning sensor would be a waste of money where I wouldn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> The design is very classy and looks nice on the counter.  </li>
            <li> But this latest model comes with a number of nice accessories that work with the brush to make you understand the higher price for the unit, and therefore, possibly make it a good choice if you are looking for a new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked around and saw many positive reviews for the Diamondclean from Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Overall a fantastic toothbrush that delivers everything it says in a very nifty package designed beautifully for both home and travel.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it!</li>
            <li> At first, I was very sceptical of buying a different brand since I was very happy with my Oral B product.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to upgrade from my Sonic Essence toothbrush and so far I love this one!  </li>
            <li> Everything now a days is USB charger friendly and now this is a lovely edition to the modern world of electronics.</li>
            <li> All in all, the price is not justified neither by results, nor by making brushing more comfortable or pleasant.  </li>
            <li> This time, because I was inside the 24-month warranty period, Philips customer support sent me a new (it appears to be refurbished instead of actually new) handle, which was great, but makes me worry about its longevity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> does anything special for the cleaning process.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to line it up any special way to make it work.</li>
            <li> And I just saw a Costco special that included two Sonicare power handles, two chargers, two travel cases, plus four brush heads that included two DiamondClean ones...</li>
            <li> We were going to a special needs dental clinic</li>
            <li> The defect was purely cosmetic and did not affect charging the toothbrush or placement of the glass or holder on top of it.  </li>
            <li> so got a special discount on two of these.  </li>
            <li> It even has a special mode for gum care.  </li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not my fault if they change the size of the brushes and the way you&#x27;re supposed to brush every twenty years or so, right!</li>
            <li> I love this new toothbrush except, the handle is slippery and easy to drop since there is no rubber for traction to keep it gripped in your hand.  </li>
            <li> and I found the Diamond Clean to be superior than the regular sonicare.  </li>
            <li> but it seems to clean a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> As much as I absolutely loved this toothbrush and miss the clean feeling it left me with, my toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t charge in either charging port after just under a year of owning it.</li>
            <li> it really helps you to keep your mouth clean and healthy your gums refreshed.</li>
            <li> There is a way to preset a favorite setting, but that is very easily erased and you&#x27;re back to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hard case is awesome for traveling though.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> The charging case was fun to use on a recent vacation - it worked just fine and looked good doing it.  </li>
            <li> Having owned a soniccare for over 10 years now I was super excited to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to this one.  </li>
            <li> Replacements did not always arrive quickly, but they were always friendly on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bigger heads used to gunk up fairly rapidly, making me take special steps to keep them</li>
            <li> So far this toothbrush is amazing, comes with two heads</li>
            <li> It works great and is not too rough on the gums.  </li>
            <li> The product is great when it works but just about a year into it, the button starts getting stuck and the vibrating silver rod gets jammed.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected, am very pleased with the ease of use.</li>
            <li> working good the only problem I have when the charge gose doen it vabreate in my hand</li>
            <li> its honestly like I just got a professional cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li> After going through the full cycle (3 min)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re questioning the hefty price tag, get one of the cheaper models, however I&#x27;ve tried three of the current range and all are good toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is equipped with a carrying case and USB charger for travel use, and the two brush heads provided are of good quality and hold up well to daily use and cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I hesitated to spend that much money, I am so glad that I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> For those replacing or upgrading, the feature has a by-pass option to get the full benefits of the brush day one.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I use the Charging Travel Case all of the time because it makes the brush really mobile, so the caps became just two more items floating around inside the bathroom junk drawer.</li>
            <li> I use the Charging Travel Case all of the time because it makes the brush really mobile, so the caps became just two more items floating around inside the bathroom junk drawer.</li>
            <li> Read the instructions, it has a &amp;#34;slow speed setting&amp;#34; from the factory that you can use to get used to the vibes, or remove to use the full power from the get go.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking forward to getting a good report upon my next trip to the Hygienist.</li>
            <li> How cool is that?</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too much of a reviewer but love reading reviews before I purchase an item.</li>
            <li> It is recommended that you brush for a full two minutes, so the quadpacer splits that up into 30 seconds of brushing for each quadrant.</li>
            <li> And I love the Gum Care setting that gently massages the gums.</li>
            <li> It is very versatile and I love</li>
            <li> I love it so much I am buying one for my husband.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on spending so much on a toothbrush, but it is MORE than &amp;#34;just a toothbrush&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> In fact, the instructions say that the unit doesn&#x27;t reach full power until after 14 days, so that your mouth can get used to it.</li>
            <li> A full charge lasts for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist has more than gently suggested over the years that I get a Sonicare to help fight plague and improve my gum health.</li>
            <li> It would be good if the manufacturer offered multiple sizes of brush heads.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably just because I&#x27;m coming from a full size</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably just because I&#x27;m coming from a full size</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cool design the way it charges in a case</li>
            <li> It looks good in my bathroom though, which is why it got a second star.</li>
            <li> Much lighter, easier to hold and seems to do a much better job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> , I floss, I get cleanings to keep my teeth in as good a shape as possible.  </li>
            <li> It is elegantly designed and very practical.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years and  the charging technology is cool</li>
            <li> This is a good toothbrush from a cleaning standpoint, but this is my second Philips toothbrush to breakdown within 2 years or so.</li>
            <li> in conclusion, cool charging technology does not take the place of convenience features.</li>
            <li> Just fabulous! cleans very well&lt;</li>
            <li> Wireless charging is so cool.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, there&#x27;s a much smaller and more elegant charging stand included that can be used instead of the glass.</li>
            <li> Having used these for years, I can say they are the best toothbrushes going, however, my one complaint is that you cant replace the battery after it dies.  </li>
            <li> .brush will run for full time of mode setting, then power off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 and using this product has whitened my teeth, cleaned them better and gently massaged my gums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also cool.</li>
            <li> glass cup to store in is cool to.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li> /&gt;It runs half-speed for 2 weeks, which you can turn off (and go to full speed).  </li>
            <li> glass cup is cool, but I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I find myself the unlucky owner of a $190 toothbrush that looks good, but can no longer be properly charged because the battery has quit working.</li>
            <li> the brush looks really cool on my counter</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s if you let the cycle run its full course.</li>
            <li> How sweet is that?</li>
            <li> The way it charges is so cool</li>
            <li> is really cool.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love using the brush, as it cleans my teeth so well and really does give you that &amp;#34;just-after-the-dentist&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> I was polite the whole time (absolute best way to deal with customer service reps) and finally got my issue resolved.  </li>
            <li> Love it my old 1 burnt in a house fire and i am so happy to have my toothbrush back</li>
            <li> but definitely does a good job.</li>
            <li> Post baby hasn&#x27;t been much better as I have been absolutely sleep deprived.  </li>
            <li> modes using the power button is only good if you never witch modes.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this toothbrush, which was recommended to me by my dentist.</li>
            <li> its just true that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Its streamlined features make it cool to look at and almost mistakable as an Apple product.</li>
            <li> Teeth are super clean.  </li>
            <li> This is so cool with the glass as the charger.</li>
            <li> Also the charging glass and charging case are so cool and convenient to use!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad device by any means</li>
            <li> Ok, I really didn&#x27;t use this often but it was cool to know I had</li>
            <li> Not only does it clean and whiten your teeth the best of any other manual or electric toothbrush, it is probably the most high-tech device that a person can stick into their face, and it even changed how I brush my teeth by promoting.</li>
            <li> Having recently traveled with the new brush, I can also say the USB charging case is incredibly practical.</li>
            <li> Ok first let me start by saying I thought I had issue with my unit and contacted Phillips and they replaced right away</li>
            <li> This is the best because I don&#x27;t have to charge it often, it is thin and easily held, and it cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li> my updates following the original review - the short of it, now two years after purchase I&#x27;m still very happy with the DiamondClean toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> In the meantime, please, please, please keep making those awesome small compact heads!</li>
            <li> I mean if you&#x27;re going to spend over $100 for a brush you may as well purchase the best one for your money.  </li>
            <li> you are too, this will fit right in to your routine.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush also comes with a micro USB charging system, which went right into my travel bag, and it hasn&#x27;t seen the light of day yet, even though I have traveled once.</li>
            <li> The vibrations are pretty strong...</li>
            <li> First off, the DiamondClean system is compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I guess this is here because some people feel that the toothbrush is too strong when they use it the first time and the sensation is somewhat ticklish, but I didn&#x27;t require that.</li>
            <li> When u boxing and setting up it was pretty easy.</li>
            <li> charging mechanism is super cool.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this toothbrush for the last two years: my teeth were minty clean, no grimy buildup throughout the day (and even prevented it overnight); my breath was fresh for the rest of the day, and charges lasted for 2 weeks at a time</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is amazing and very modern and classy looking--which, while not the primary thing</li>
            <li> I have used little pressure, great pressure, medium pressure, checked the fit of the brush on the handle, etc, etc.  </li>
            <li> The pretty, smooth surface looks great but is really not what you need in a moist bathroom environment.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great while it works, however, it is extremely unreliable.</li>
            <li> The handle of the brush itself is made of a faux-ceramic material that feels great in the hand, and even though it doesn&#x27;t have the ridges or rubber grip of other Sonicare brushes, it will never slip or slide out of your hand.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t your smile worth it!</li>
            <li> Other than that it is great.  </li>
            <li> The reviews here do a great job of highlighting the finer points of this electric brush as well as comparing it to other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Philips customer service was great and after confirming it wasn&#x27;t just a charging issue, replaced both due to the 2-year warranty.  </li>
            <li> Love my new toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I love my new Sonicare toothbrush!</li>
            <li> and she said that my teeth are in great condition with very minimal plaque.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my gums and yet whitened my teeth significantly within a week!</li>
            <li> My much older electronic brush did a good job, but this new unit seams to leave my teeth cleaner</li>
            <li> I have heard that super clean gums will lengthen your life; so, use if you want to live longer (alright, over the top.)</li>
            <li> This is amazingly powerful &amp; gets your mouth clean.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for 3 days and my teeth have never been as this clean, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The Diamond Clean definitely feels more powerful than the E series, but not too overwhelming (by the by</li>
            <li> When it first arrived 5 months ago, everything works fine and it looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Replacement Diamond clean mini heads are costly but worth getting.</li>
            <li> the diamond clean isn&#x27;t worth the almost $200 price tag.  </li>
            <li> An electric toothbrush makes your teeth &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean, and that is certainly worth the effort and money.</li>
            <li> With the DiamondClean I legitimately look forward to brushing my teeth - three times a day - because of how fresh and clean my mouth feels after use.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist says that my gums and teeth have improved tremendously over the years I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare brushes and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.p, or you could color in the lights for the program</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist says that my gums and teeth have improved tremendously over the years I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare brushes and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Honestly makes your teeth whiter within a few weeks :) Strongly recommend to people.</li>
            <li> The DiamondClean is aesthetically pleasing and the chargeable travel case is super convenient (and</li>
            <li> If it cleans only as well as the last version I will be a very happy</li>
            <li> After such a brief time using my Philips Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush, I can already fully commit to this one statement - &#x27;THE best toothbrush I have EVER used!&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Also the fact my Father-in-Law got lucky and his replacement is still working after 20 months also shows me it could be a sporadic quality control issue.  </li>
            <li> Also the fact my Father-in-Law got lucky and his replacement is still working after 20 months also shows me it could be a sporadic quality control issue.  </li>
            <li> feel like it&#x27;s a super</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is well worth it the expense,for what it does and for the fact you might be able to avoid dentist visits completely,or limit them to very infrequent check-ups and cleaning appointments.</li>
            <li> The third thing and possibly the best, is the jewelry cleaning aspect.</li>
            <li> after a ton of years of being an incredibly loyal sonicare user, i&#x27;m just fed up.  </li>
            <li> sure you can make out with an older model,</li>
            <li> My husband asked for this particular Sonicare since he travels most of the time.  </li>
            <li> Love this my teeth are whiter now they even when I was using the older Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush with the compact head does a super job on my implants.</li>
            <li> Could not stop running my tongue all over my ultra smooth teeth that felt better than some professional cleanings I had in my lifetime.  </li>
            <li> There are now many different models to choose from and we went with the top of the line model.  </li>
            <li> -The glass charger is more clutter, doesn&#x27;t look as neat (IMO), fragile, and not any more functional.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the most obvious fancy item on the accessories list, but it does not stop there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also an acrylic stand which can also be placed on top of the charger, in case you prefer not to use the glass cup.</li>
            <li> I like the wireless charging and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li> It has more options than the older models and does what it claims.</li>
            <li> The brush comes with a \\&quot;Quick Start\\&quot; card that is the super-short version of the instructions.  </li>
            <li> It charges fairly quick and the charges have lasted about a week (two brushings per day).</li>
            <li> I received it quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes the click sound, its secure, but its doesnt really stick there.</li>
            <li> Really does a better cleaning that you&#x27;d pay for and receive at the Dentist office, worth the price.</li>
            <li> The handle is smooth and fits so nicely into your hands that you simply want to hold it.</li>
            <li> Brushing your teeth is a two-time daily must, but now, you&#x27;ll both love and enjoy it!  </li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare toothbrush in about 8 years, and I think they are definitely the best electric brushes on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter than the model I had before, which is nice for traveling, and feels very sleek in your hand.</li>
            <li> &quot; I appreciate the beautiful design, but I would rather have an ugly toothbrush and beautiful teeth.</li>
            <li> They fit in my mouth so much better than the old Sonicare did.  </li>
            <li> received as advertised, happy with purchase, fast delivery, I would buy from this seller if purchasing again in the future.  </li>
            <li> It seems after about a minute you can also press the button to shut it off, if you need to brush quickly for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems after about a minute you can also press the button to shut it off, if you need to brush quickly for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush head itself wears too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Cleanings are now quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sleek design of this product makes it easy to clean and the travel case is VERY</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush heads for the Diamond really do a better job on my teeth and the extra setting gives me more options.  </li>
            <li> While I think Philips has designed the nicest product out there for brushing teeth, I wish they would use components that don&#x27;t break so quickly.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare back in the 90&#x27;s that was my favorite toothbrush and kept my gums healthy.</li>
            <li> Luckily it was under warranty</li>
            <li> Also, the side to side vibration is vigorous, and one quickly learns to brush with one&#x27;s lips together to keep from splattering toothpaste droplets all over the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I assume since it was so much more than a double pack at Costco, that it&#x27;s better?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an electric toothbrush for many years, but never wanted to spend the extra money for one as sophisticated as the DiamondClean.  </li>
            <li> Another positive is that this brushes charger is so cool!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was blessed with very straight, white teeth, but with the whiteness came soft enamel and despite taking great care of my teeth i have had many cavities and now crowns.....  </li>
            <li> And my dental hygienist is always glad to see me because she&#x27;s starting to clean a set of almost perfectly clean teeth already!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a high-quality electric toothbrush.setting because I am a tea drinker and would love my teeth to be whiter.</li>
            <li> I can say that I highly recommend it as the better product on the market.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Price point is high at about any given time being roughly $65 more than the oral b 5000.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Price point is high at about any given time being roughly $65 more than the oral b 5000.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this items for most of the geeks out there.</li>
            <li> Really makes your mouth feel clean!</li>
            <li> Then I settle for a normal and quick (but less perfect) toothbrushing.  </li>
            <li> On top of that Philips does not sell handles alone and therefore if I want a new handle I need to purchase the full kit.</li>
            <li> This pretty little toothbrush does the most amazing job cleaning AND whitening teeth!</li>
            <li> It certainly cleans well and leaves teeth feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the white finish (you can also purchase the toothbrush in all black, by the way) feels somewhat like unglazed ceramic: it not only looks wonderful, but it feels great in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (older style built in to apartment prob from 70&#x27;s) and the metal was preventing the induction charging!!!</li>
            <li> The design is by far the best one out of the other sonicare models.</li>
            <li> One of the features of the FlexCare Plus brush that I was very interested in was the UV sanitizing feature.  </li>
            <li> First, they don&#x27;t give you anywhere to securely place your toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and my mouth, gums, &amp; teeth feel really healthy &amp; clean after use.i use the gum care setting and am looking forward to my next checkup.</li>
            <li> I normally use the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; mode which provide two more rounds in brushing.</li>
            <li> This is my second sonicare &amp; I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work like a normal &amp;#34;hand scrub&amp;#34; toothbrush, but once you get used to it, they are so much better.</li>
            <li> If I would have known how good it was would have bought a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Even if I&#x27;d had to pay the full retail price of $210, it would have been worth it.</li>
            <li> Good, my teeth are definitely cleaner than what they used to be but battery life isn&#x27;t as good as I expected or advertised to be.</li>
            <li> Carrying case is really useful and cool.</li>
            <li> But I went ahead and purchased a replacement at full price, knowing it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> The vibration makes your mouth feel clean and fresh, and it keeps that fresh feeling throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Really makes a difference to how smooth and clean my teeth feel</li>
            <li> nice features to chose for different function to clean, polish or whiten.</li>
            <li> On the bright side, the battery technology is modern, and with luck should last significantly longer before it deteriorates to the point of replacement.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this since it is so cool looking!  </li>
            <li> It is transportable and holds a charge for a good long time (up to a week)!  </li>
            <li> To my surprise it is a much better product, not just &#x27;the new model.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> I was able to get a new one for $130 from my dentist (after rebate, and including tax).</li>
            <li> I converted from a Oral B brand brush after having it for 8+ years and love my new Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> However, i managed to live most of my life without a sanitizer</li>
            <li> I hope that they&#x27;ve figured out the kinks over time and my new one will be more reliable.    </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s re-designed so that function takes priority, and with better materials, then I&#x27;ll buy a new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a horrible inconvenience, I can definitely live with it.  </li>
            <li> I absoluetly love my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I can be a bit too easily distracted by the latest shiny new gadget and this thing really does look the part.</li>
            <li> (I bought it right after I had to get a few cavities filled in, and I realised how important a good toothbrush is).</li>
            <li> Not having to put it on a normal charger is a big win.  </li>
            <li> In terms of normal use, it is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> Great upgrade from previous sonicate tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used the Sonicare Flexcare for 3+ years and thought it was a great toothbrush, but the DiamondClean surpasses it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy that I spent the extra money to get the Diamond Clean model.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush strongly enough.oes so much to enhance my health.</li>
            <li> Cleans up easily, and I really like the rechargeable stand.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s just not doing as good a job unless it&#x27;s freshly been charged even though it touts a long time in between charges.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my teeth felt much more clean than they ever have from normal brushing.  </li>
            <li> We recently took a week long vacation and the charging travel case worked perfectly for us.</li>
            <li> This implies that were my gauss meter capable of measuring greater levels, closer distances would yield substantially higher measurements.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has been wonderful, it is hard to quantify whether or not this brush (or any electric toothbrush) actually &amp;#34;removes more plaque&amp;#34; but I can say I notice a clean feeling every time I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> Charging Travel Case is cool; the ability to charge the battery by connecting it to my laptop via USB is something I found very smart.</li>
            <li> its all first class!</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used (and I researched them before I put up the big bucks for this one), but I am more than glad I did.  </li>
            <li> it was sold to me by my dentist when they first came onto the market!  </li>
            <li> After the first use I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> We finally bought the Sonicare electric toothbrush and we both in love with them!</li>
            <li> The Diamond is quite different from the first one and has more more controls than I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li> Surpassed all my expectations and I immediately noticed a difference the first week I used this product!</li>
            <li> DiamondClean toothbrush is way better than the old e-series!  </li>
            <li> This the first review I have ever written!  </li>
            <li> Thanks sonicare!!</li>
            <li> been using sonicare through their first generation models and this one has improved, as it should!</li>
            <li> I can say their Customer Service was always friendly and willing to keep trying to solve the inherent design flaws of this product.</li>
            <li> 2-3 days later I had a new brush that worked great...</li>
            <li> My wife has owned previous models of the Sonicare, but this one is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;unfortunately, starting with the flexcare generation, while you gain a slimmer handle, a MUCH better removable tip that is much easier to clean or prevent gunk, and more powerful motors, what you lost is reliability.  </li>
            <li> It recharges to full battery pretty  quickly</li>
            <li> , the hidden areas that illuminate to indicate mode and battery status, the brilliance of a travel case that both closes magnetically and charges the power handle via USB cable from your computer or the included USB power adapter--the whole package has just been thought through with incredible attention to detail.</li>
            <li> The unique ultra-sonic pulses are superior to the conventional toothbrush and the rotadent, another mechanical toothbrush I have used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The design and finish are excellent and a real departure from other models and the main competitor..  </li>
            <li> It can be charged via USB (very handy for international travel because the normal Sonicare does not accept 220V).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The glass charging case is super neat and it looks right at home in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> If you find the right sale, coupon and or rebate, it&#x27;s a worthy model replacement option.</li>
            <li> Using this regularly is probably the single best thing I&#x27;ve ever done for my dental health.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone interested in keeping their teeth clean,</li>
            <li> This diamond clean was my first sonicare purchase</li>
            <li> but it no long available because It has more than one month.</li>
            <li> Wish the charge cable would fit in the case as the case feels overly large</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re gums look great!&amp;#34; After 10 years of hearing about more and more recession it was a shock to the system to hear such positive feedback from the Dentist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a super soft brushing action, ideal for sensitive gums or gum recession.&lt;br /&gt;USB</li>
            <li> If you find the right sale, coupon and or rebate, it&#x27;s a worthy model replacement option.the whitening cycle, and that gives me 8 days worth of brushing.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to get used to but it a great product.</li>
            <li> These are easier to clean, easier to remove and attach and the whole brush and handle system is far more sanitary and easy to clean than older Sonicare models.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a little pricy, I still love it for its effective cleansing effect.</li>
            <li> having your own personal hygienist that does not talk too much!!</li>
            <li> Different brush design, teeth feel cleaner, Also, gum cleaning program does a very good job, in addition to the regular cleaning program.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an earlier model Sonicare toothbrush for several years and found it to be a very good product.</li>
            <li> This brush really gets in and does its job using just light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 3 of the AA-powered $20 version -- they&#x27;re great for travel, but water ingress in the bottom always ends up eventually destroying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The travel case is very sleek, light</li>
            <li> even the glass tumbler is heavy glass and attractive.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a commercial, but the power is this unit is amazing.  </li>
            <li> the travel case with charger is amazing and its the only charger i ever use.</li>
            <li> Just get a cheaper product, this one is made cheap and sold for way too much.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush and if you&#x27;ve never used a sonic toothbrush you&#x27;re in for a real treat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;b) While the DiamondClean brushes DO clean somewhat better than older Sonicare brush heads, you can use DiamondClean brushes on some of the older, cheaper Sonicare models like FlexCare.</li>
            <li> one move this negates so much of the practicality of the travel case, which was one of the primary reasons for my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then - an unusual sound and vibration performance reduction, and some brown substance oozing from around the button - yuck.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> had heard through my son that the Sonicare was an amazing electric toothbrush, so when I dropped and broke my regular electric toothbrush, I knew that I wanted to replace it with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It works smoothly and really well.  </li>
            <li> It is so worth It.</li>
            <li> Worth the price over cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> if it really is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It was worth the price.</li>
            <li> One thing is for sure, this brush leaves my teeth feeling far cleaner</li>
            <li> What kind of art house goon comes up with such impractical designs?  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to have the larger option.</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works exactly as expected and does provide a good brushing experience.</li>
            <li> But then it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth every dime.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t let customers vote on their own reviews, so the voting buttons appear only when you look at reviews submitted by others.  </li>
            <li> -- it is definitely worth the investment for your oral care.</li>
            <li> The glass cup is in the closet as it really isn&#x27;t useful for me.</li>
            <li> Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> so far,  i love this baby  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money and the health benefits, even the surprise ones.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Now it just goes off on its own, just starts buzzing when it&#x27;s just sitting there, acting erratically...</li>
            <li> But this product is worth the price</li>
            <li> sooooo worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought the DiamondClean to replace my old Braun toothbrush, which lasted more than a decade.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over two years and still as powerful as before.</li>
            <li> Very, very pleased with this purchase, as long as it stands up to the test of time.</li>
            <li> it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush works better than my old model and stays cleaner.  </li>
            <li> but I will say that I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my smile</li>
            <li> This case also uses the inductive charging method, so all you have to do is place the handle into the form-fitting slot for it and it will charge when you plug it in, and plugging it in is the fun part.</li>
            <li> This means that now, whenever you use the brush even if it is the first time, it will always operate at full 100% power.</li>
            <li> its worth it...  </li>
            <li> In short, while pricey, I&#x27;m thrilled with the unit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the toothbrush is also just fun.  </li>
            <li> there is one issue I have discovered with this particular model and that is,it attracts grease off one&#x27;s hands easily.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> From this point on I was incredibly paranoid using it, gripping the handle until my fingers turned white for fear of dropping it and destroying another one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;or misuse on gum line , keep off of gum line , if not unit is so effective you&#x27;ll have no gums left.</li>
            <li> Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> My periodontist said that he didn&#x27;t believe the UV feature would make much difference, and that it would be just as good to periodically soak the brush head in Listerine or similar product.</li>
            <li> Powerful.  </li>
            <li> Use of two months, a fresh mouth feel than before</li>
            <li> (The travel case is pretty cool, too.</li>
            <li> I went from this crappy battery powered one that was ok but standard for cheap .</li>
            <li> It is a bit costly but worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has a built in timer and that you have choices as far as cleaning, polishing, sensitivity, etc.</li>
            <li> Love the Philips Sonicare HX9332/5 DiamondClean,  so far it&#x27;s doing the job at hand.  </li>
            <li> but I just smile and nod.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> but..It would be nice if it warned you when the battery is low.</li>
            <li> so it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> am not crazy about the glass for the charging system.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and it is really worth it.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Surely worth the investmentwhen</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> i have not owned an electric toothbrush before, but this one got great reviews, and so far my teeth definitely feel cleaner than before.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> If you care for your smile.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my wife as present, she is loving it.</li>
            <li> It is a nice feature that depending on the mode of cleaning you choose the vibrations are different.  </li>
            <li> The charging case is also pretty cool</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Everything from the charging station, to the toothbrush, to the bristle head are sturdy, powerful, and well constructed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this so far.  </li>
            <li> It cleans much better than my old worn out Sonicare</li>
            <li> The travel case has come in handy several times as well.</li>
            <li> The different settings are also a nice touch.</li>
            <li> However, after I used it once it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> A nice touch is the fact that you can charge it via USB and a charge will last a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s partly a step backwards from the Flexcare+ model and is it really worth the price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the ability to have a mode with a different time is nice so that I can brush longer without the brush going off and having to turn it on again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal but would have been nice.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is, without question, the most modern and elegantly designed electric toothbrush on the market today, and I can only compare holding it to the feeling you get when you hold an Apple product.</li>
            <li> But is it worth the premium price being charged for it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I decided that the DiamondClean was worth it for me, it might not be for you, depending on your priorities.</li>
            <li> While I decided that the DiamondClean was worth it for me, it might not be for you, depending on your priorities.</li>
            <li> well worth it</li>
            <li> So far, it feels great, especially the brush head.</li>
            <li> This brush is much more powerful than my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you want a powerful electric toothbrush with all the \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot;, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> then you already know the basics of how this kind of toothbrush works and the Diamondclean is no different.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money, you&#x27;ll feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I suppose you can put it in your mouth then press the button several times but then what&#x27;s the point in having the nice display.    </li>
            <li> Do the designers actually use their own creations?</li>
            <li> Both are well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bought mine November of 2011 and in January I notice the sonic vibrations/pulsing motion was not as powerful.  </li>
            <li> My dentist has also noticed which makes the purchase worth it to me.</li>
            <li> The charging glass is pretty neat, as others have said there are some features that I do not use (usb charging) but it is cool to know</li>
            <li> Products eventually finish their useful life, and I am now using the Sonicare DiamondClean brush.</li>
            <li> So, if you are wondering whether this technology is just hi-tech hype, I can tell you that it works and it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Supposedly my dental health is worth it.</li>
            <li> I miss it but don&#x27;t think its worth replacing at that price every two years.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny if you can afford.  </li>
            <li> Do I feel the cost was worth it?</li>
            <li> Do I feel the cost was worth it?</li>
            <li> I am a dental professional with more than 20 years experience.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to try USB charging, but the case has been useful when traveling.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> feel fresh</li>
            <li> Given the success of my checkups since then I have to agree with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well  worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> All and all they seem to all break the same way... the vibration stops working effectively.</li>
            <li> I was going to replace it with the same kind but saw the DiamondClean.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice storage case with space for an extra head which does come with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth feel great and my confidence has jumped considerable after only a week of using this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it so far.</li>
            <li> i think i&#x27;ll be buying the sensitive brush heads since they&#x27;re softer and can navigate around curves better IMO.</li>
            <li> It holds the charge nicely and I have used it on short travels of 3 to 4 days without any probem.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Is that reason enough to invest this kind of money?</li>
            <li> Also having a way to code the heads for multiple users would be nice as well.  </li>
            <li> BUT WELL WORTH IT TO ME.</li>
            <li> well worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The smaller heads are nice.  </li>
            <li> second one bought, last one wore out after many years of use, good bit of kit</li>
            <li> Has multiple settings and the charging glass is a nice accessory.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, it is essential to read the instructions and follow the usage guidelines for these Sonicare brushes to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I had to laugh when I read the review that called this the Apple toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The vibration feels good and the darn things actually works cleaning my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> When I smile in pictures</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I really like that it comes with a traveling case, very useful, and you can charge the toothbrush through that traveling case.  </li>
            <li> I loved the product and took great care of it, but a little after the 2 year warranty expired the brush started to stutter and switch between low and high vibrations as if one of the gears rusted away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to clean my back molars without trouble and my teeth feel incredibly smooth and polished for a good while</li>
            <li> , I have been quite impressed by how long a single charge lasts (about 2 weeks).</li>
            <li> I love this better than any other sonicare product I have used before</li>
            <li> They all do a great job on teeth and gums, but until this one, it was really hard to keep the handles/stands/chargers clean.</li>
            <li> And the supplied case is much more exotic than we&#x27;ve seen before with other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I have recommended sonicare brushes for many years and will continue to do so because they are powerful and clean well, however, I cannot recommend this brush based on my personal experience.  </li>
            <li> All the different settings work great and gives you the clean feeling like you just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> Since I haven&#x27;t had a sonic toothbrush, the first experience tickled the roof of my mouth, but I quickly got adjusted to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about 6 years before it died a quick death.  </li>
            <li> but it certainly does make your mouth feel clean and</li>
            <li> mouth certainly feels clean after the 2 or 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I rarely use anything except the Clean option but the whitening and Polish setting really do work.</li>
            <li> Using the flexcare, more often than not, I would accidentally change modes during brushing-would have to stop change back to clean.</li>
            <li> The main draw of this toothbrush for me was aesthetic more than function - and it definitely is a very good-looking toothbrush</li>
            <li> If anything it&#x27;s going to start making the bottom of the handle sort of gross, how many germs collect in that cup overnight unless you clean it every</li>
            <li> I definitely think the newer brush heads clean a lot better as well.</li>
            <li> The Diamond Clean has a more slender shape and smaller brushes</li>
            <li> Afterwards my mouth felt more clean than it ever has even after prior dental cleanings and thus began my hunt for a brush that could come close to that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I brushed each day, my teeth just didn&#x27;t feel clean to me.  </li>
            <li> Since I regularly turn the brush on and run it under water after brushing to clean the brush, if I don&#x27;t wait the right number of seconds, I have to push the button 5 more times to cycle through the modes to turn the brush off.  </li>
            <li> That means that neither the Oral B nor the Sonicare is so vastly superior in bacterial plaque biofilm removal that I could recommend one over the other to my patients, based on that criterion alone.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is just as good as all my other Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The DiamondClean on the other hand is made of plastic but good quality of plastic (feels like ceramic</li>
            <li> The handle has a very nice finish and feels less slippery than previous models.&lt;br /&gt;Diamond head does a nice job but it will fit on most model handles so not a big deal here.&lt;br /&gt;Charger is cool.  </li>
            <li> All you have to do is put it into the cup after use, and it charges right there in the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush</li>
            <li> and I knew I had made the right decision once it was turned on and working on my teeth.</li>
            <li> It seems I can&#x27;t get it right</li>
            <li> you are going to have to fight for your right to brush with it...</li>
            <li> you are going to have to fight for your right to brush with it...</li>
            <li> and I used it right after packaging.</li>
            <li> It comes out of the box with a charge (helpful so you can get started right away) and immediately notice the quality of the pieces.  </li>
            <li> the service rep knew right away what the problem was and didn&#x27;t even bother to check and gave me a replacement.</li>
            <li> RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li> It comes with a sleek wireless charger (you plug in the cup to the wall and just lay your toothbrush up right to charge).  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li> so I needed a replacement right away.  </li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> yeah right.  </li>
            <li> and she was right</li>
            <li> Toothbrush heads no longer stay, they pop right off as soon as I power on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Received it right before</li>
            <li> But the $500 pricetage for &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; results just doesn&#x27;t sit right.</li>
            <li> I was pleased that the old brush heads that I knew Santa would put in my stocking would fit the new handle.</li>
            <li> What a huge improvement from the older models...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a feature I found pretty interesting: every 30 seconds, the brushing action seems to pause as a reminder to move on to another quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> so I knew it was really getting in there to clean.</li>
            <li> I have gone to the dentist and been told that there really isn&#x27;t anything for them to do as I didn&#x27;t have much to clean at all.  </li>
            <li> Use one of these and floss regularly, and you will see better teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;Hey, and the fact that it looks cool in my bathroom ...</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth are really getting clean.</li>
            <li> Really makes your teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Never required this much instruction to clean my teeth before, but</li>
            <li> This really gets your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I have own&#x27;d sonicare products in the past and honestly I love them.</li>
            <li> It really gets your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> really gets your teeth clean</li>
            <li> this one is smart, it&#x27;ll warm me after I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth with a gentle vibration and a light to say it needs charging.  </li>
            <li> Overall it works really well if looking for a great cleaning action!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I really enjoy using it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I was initially comparing prices on numerous sites on the Internet, I finally settled on buying through Amazon because it was the best price, but also because I felt secure about the purchase knowing their history of customer service</li>
            <li> It has many settings such as clean,  whiten,  polish,  even gentle!</li>
            <li> Love this product, so glad I upgraded from my previous sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Love the black makes it look even better sitting the the cup to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s unnerving at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone that is looking at there first electric toothbrush or anyone looking for a more modern upgrade.</li>
            <li> In general I am satisfied..-)</li>
            <li> so it is suitable for international travel.</li>
            <li> This thing makes my mouth feel like I just got out of the dentist office every time I use it, looks amazingly cool and considering it cost about as much as 2 trips to the dentist</li>
            <li> This is the best (and by far the most expensive) toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> travel case is very convenient, but it does feel larger than it needs to be, I&#x27;m sure they could find a way to fit the cargo cable within the case, even if it was a shorter cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> About 8 months in, I noticed it wasn&#x27;t quite as powerful as when I first bought it -</li>
            <li> while putting your toothbrush in the cup for charging is cool, is that really practical?  </li>
            <li> but it starts off gently and gradually works up to full speed over a period of 14 brushes.  </li>
            <li> Also, its pretty powerful</li>
            <li> (I forget what it&#x27;s called), as the the DiamondClean, great as it is, seems excessive.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Sonicare supporter- normally.</li>
            <li> The price is pretty steep but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Another FABULOUS thing about this toothbrush is that it keeps a charge for 3 weeks which was like an answer to my prayers because I have 3 items on my bathroom sink (including my toothbrush) that have to stay plugged in so being able to eliminate an extra cord really made a difference in the neatness.  </li>
            <li> Nice buy, but if you don&#x27;t get expedited shipping it takes a long time to get.</li>
            <li> If you are not accustomed to a toothbrush that moves this fast, the first time you use it might be a bit of a unique experience.</li>
            <li> It delivers a deep clean feeling for your whole mouth and the multiple charging options are great and convenient.</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes just clean better, so I will most likely do the cheaper models as they all seem to have the same life span.</li>
            <li> Bought the basic for my kids when my dentist said their teeth weren&#x27;t getting clean enough, and eventually got this one for myself, and I couldnt be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Even though I gave up electricity for a long weekend, I was able to keep my brush charged in the case so I could still have a clean mouth and still feel civilized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new toothbrush and feel that upgrading to their newer version worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> I can happily say that after a few weeks of use, you can certainly justify the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I better get no less than that from this toothbrush, which cost me more than a new microwave.than a new microwave.</li>
            <li> The results were less than impressive, and that was my first and until now last experience with electric brushes.</li>
            <li> Also, this unit has a significant improvement over the older style brush heads that collected water, toothpase and grime.  </li>
            <li> The travel case is light and nice to have, (though a little bulky).</li>
            <li> After the first time you use it, which is creepy if you don&#x27;t already use an electric toothbrush, it quickly becomes the best thing since sliced</li>
            <li> After three weeks of using Philips&#x27; Sonicare Diamondclean, my teeth feel very clean, are more polished and need less care when flossing.</li>
            <li> , this is a very gorgeous and somewhat unusual toothbrush, and it has won at least two separate design awards.</li>
            <li> The different modes are easy to use and the product is user friendly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other people who had brushing problems have experienced the same thing, but this has made a huge difference for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would avoid unless you&#x27;re comfortable buying a new toothbrush every 2 years.</li>
            <li> But you need to think about whether you feel comfortable spending $150 for a new one every year or two because that is the reality of ownership.  </li>
            <li> after all, I&#x27;d never spent more than $8 for a toothbrush, so this product (despite all of its bells and whistles) had a bold line to reach:  was it worth 30 times a normal toothbrush if that&#x27;s what you were going to pay for it?  </li>
            <li> With my old school Oral B toothbrushes I would sometimes go over the two minute timers as my teeth didn&#x27;t feel super clean</li>
            <li> There are several designs fixes which make me happy over my last Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Next the brush head is EASY TO CLEAN.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles are easy on the gums.  </li>
            <li> The home charger is sleek and easy to clean, unlike my last one.  </li>
            <li> My old one was much more gentle.  </li>
            <li> That said, it sure does clean your teeth really well and in a very short amount of time!</li>
            <li> but I decided to go for it since I&#x27;ve been happy with my prior Sonicare toothbrushes and since they last for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly a good looking toothbrush, too, and since it sits out in the bathroom (at least in my minuscule bathroom, it has to), that&#x27;s important to me as well.  </li>
            <li> - there&#x27;s no rubber grip and the single power button / function button is not as handy as two buttons were.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been several years since I used an electric toothbrush, probably when I was 12 (and it was a very cheap version), so going to this toothbrush after using a standard toothbrush for most of my life was like a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li> I was also attracted to the fact that it is more effective in removing plague, which should mean that it has to be in my mouth for a shorter period of time.</li>
            <li> They offered me a free pack of new heads- REALLY!</li>
            <li> Diamondclean: ok, slightly more advanced, charging glass only looks cool but is hard to keep clean with water stains etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This time around customer service from Phillips was super and quick but my original warranty will still apply and expires mid September.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my son who likes it very much.</li>
            <li> and it actually feels very comfortable in the hand.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality!</li>
            <li> First, it offers a very compact brushing head which truly is the perfect size for someone like me with a small mouth and a susceptibility to gagging when brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> It REALLY gets the whole mouth super clean and not with much effort.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel very much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush vibrates very fast and it took a couple of days to get used to the tickling sensation of the vibration , but after a couple of days, you don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.</li>
            <li> It is quiet and the grip is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The compact charging stand (if you didn&#x27;t want to use the larger glass cup) was a bit loose fitting on both top and bottom sides, but I decided I was able to live with that.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Oral-B electric toothbrushes but nothing comes close to this, I&#x27;ve been using DiamondClean for more than a year now, it leaves my teeth super clean in less brushing time, stays charged for a very long time, beautiful design &amp; very well made plus few extra great features such as the carrying case and the USB charger..</li>
            <li> I start out with the standard power Clean mode that goes for two minutes in 4 intervals, then move on to White mode, which is higher powered than Clean mode, which goes on for two minutes in 4 intervals plus another 30 seconds of an even higher powered brushing in 2 intervals for your \\&quot;glamour\\&quot; teeth, or front teeth, top and bottom, followed by the Polish mode, which is the strongest and highest-powered mode the toothbrush offers, giving you 30 seconds each for your top front teeth and lower front teeth.</li>
            <li> I love my new DiamondClean toothbrush, partially because I love technology and gadgets, so</li>
            <li> I was thrilled because I was still using my old OralB from 8 years ago and was ready to try something new.  </li>
            <li> My husband had never even opened the box as his old Sonic was still working just fine.  </li>
            <li> The clean setting is the normal 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers noted, using it feels good -- you really feel it working to remove the stuff that shouldn&#x27;t be there.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare my first didn&#x27;t make 6 months before it died, I am happy to say this one is now over a year old and still takes and holds a charge like new, I think they improved the technology</li>
            <li> It comes with a travel charger which is super nice, but really, if the battery lasts this long when would you really need it?  </li>
            <li> Also, the new brush head is a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> I only have experience with Clean because that is my primary concern when brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth feel extra clean and smooth after each time I brush.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks it got to the point where just barely touching the side of the brush head, particularly when brushing rear molars, the unit would buzz loudly and there was no vibration at the bristles.</li>
            <li> Gives your teeth a really good clean although the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as claimed.</li>
            <li> It broke while travelling but was under warranty, so Sonicare sent me a new Diamond Clean brush.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say I am a skeptic and brand loyalist.  </li>
            <li> I was tempted to stop using it on the first try even with the East Start feature on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to stop using the Sonicare after the first brushing, but reconsider after the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kinda funny</li>
            <li> Has more than enough options!</li>
            <li> The material they used (a soft, matte, plastic) just felt cheap to the touch.</li>
            <li> issome evidence that rotation oscillation brushes reduce plaque and gingivitis more than side to side brushes in the short term.</li>
            <li> and he is very picky!</li>
            <li> is the third Sonicare I&#x27;ve purchased, the first DiamondClean: to which I will avail: my favorite toothbrush of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> toothbrush comes with a host of bells and whistles, but I don&#x27;t want to focus on those - though I will add that I love the different settings.</li>
            <li> I actually think you get more bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> I was interested in this system because it claimed to do the things that I needed to have done:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> FIRSTLY</li>
            <li> + years sonicare user and have always had the latest model, last being the flexcare with UV sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Which is most likely why Philips allows it.</li>
            <li> I do sometimes swtich to the white setting because I am a tea drinker and would love my teeth to be whiter.</li>
            <li> ; that gradually increases the power over the first 14 brushings.</li>
            <li> a smaller, more dense head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And make sure it&#x27;s not located next to anything metallic, like a metal bathroom cabinet!</li>
            <li> When I first got this Sonicare toothbrush, I decided not to post a review immediately.</li>
            <li> I was so wowed by this toothbrush from the first use that I wanted to post a review immediately.</li>
            <li> More recently, I have been using battery-powered brushes from the supermarket and they seemed \\&quot;fine.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Lastly, being able to charge while the brush is still in the case just makes sense.</li>
            <li> I deactivated it before my first time using it.  </li>
            <li> The USB case/charger is great, but i think they should have found a way to pack the USB cable in the case at least.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever written about a product I have purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and before we bough it</li>
            <li> first then wait 4-6 weeks for a refund check.  </li>
            <li> My Sonicare DiamondClean lived up to my expectations for the first 14 months -- then stopped working.  </li>
            <li> This is my first ever high-end electric toothbrush and it has lived up to all of its promises.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an old-fashioner manual tooth brusher all my life and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ventured into the realms of the power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Smartimer and Quadpacer features make sure that you have brushed sufficiently and in every area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Yep! charged and ready to go!  </li>
            <li> any of us really do that!  </li>
            <li> Works better than the last model I had.</li>
            <li> , The way I do it is I brush the outside-upper teeth first</li>
            <li> I must admit this is my first foray into the world of electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> No kidding, I must be, because my first reaction was to throw it across the room.</li>
            <li> The charging glass has a pleasing, stout solidity to it, like a whiskey glass, and it&#x27;s an ingenious solution to the daily grind of recharging electronics.</li>
            <li> The charging glass has a pleasing, stout solidity to it, like a whiskey glass, and it&#x27;s an ingenious solution to the daily grind of recharging electronics.</li>
            <li> My first power toothbrush was a Braun Oral-B</li>
            <li> this is the first time I&#x27;ve found one that was not built in the Netherlands.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, my gums had become even stronger and healthy since the last time they saw me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It definitely provides a much better cleaning.</li>
            <li> ( ; - )</li>
            <li> When they first were introduced I bought one for myself, one for my wife, and one for my parents to share.  </li>
            <li> It is also extremely stylish and looks like it is from the future.</li>
            <li> The first Sonicare Diamondclean handle broke after about 8 months, received replacement.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind, this is when the toothbrush was first released, so the thing hadn&#x27;t even been out for a year yet.  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> this is his first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> definitely doesn&#x27;t have as many nooks and crannies for crust to build up in which</li>
            <li> /&gt;The latest update 4/2014 -- am currently using and testing both the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Before making my purchase, I read as many reviews as I could, I visited a local store that carried both the FlexCare Plus and the DiamondCare, and I also asked my periodontist for his recommendation.  </li>
            <li> finally decided on the DiamondClean model based on its having a better performing brush.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, the issue I was concerned about the most -- not having an On/Off switch and having to cycle through all five settings whenever one uses it -- is a non-issue.  </li>
            <li> And, speaking of sharing the brush within your family, unlike the lesser Sonicare models, they don&#x27;t make color-coded Diamond Care heads, so you&#x27;re never quite sure if you&#x27;re using your own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted here.</li>
            <li> The first one bought in 2011 was the HX6590 which stopped working after 6 months.</li>
            <li> First, is the glass charger.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> After the first 24-hour charge, it still has maximum charge / RPM after 30 days.</li>
            <li> first, to toggle between the function, you must press the power button until you reach the desired setting.</li>
            <li> I feel the various modes isn&#x27;t practical and more a marketing</li>
            <li> and I was concerned about it being able to be shipped to my current location</li>
            <li> It started switching to the lesser power without me even touching the power button.  </li>
            <li> This is my first SonicCare</li>
            <li> This is my first SonicCare</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny because it cleans so well that you can feel all the parts of your teeth that will get even the slightest bit of residue on them</li>
            <li> /&gt;A couple of downsides, the charger for the carrying case is mini-USB, pretty dated, should be micro</li>
            <li> I purchased this handle on June 18th 2014, and it broke after exactly 13 months of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (The rechargeable travel case is also a feature I really like!)</li>
            <li> It is reliable and cleans my teeth way better than with a regular tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> but it is a pretty penny</li>
            <li> you consider how much dental work costs!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t completely shut off after a week, but I get the warning beep and an orange light.</li>
            <li> Has several settings for those who like more pressure, and charges wirelessly in a cup.</li>
            <li> The first one I had was a Diamond type</li>
            <li> This first one lasted my two and a bit years.</li>
            <li> After my first use, I did indeed feel like I just got my teeth cleaned.  </li>
            <li> Since my dentist recommends Phillips I chose this model after my first Sonicare had to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> With regular 2 minute brushing, I was able to get rid of my gum disease and the need for periodontics surgery.</li>
            <li> -I don&#x27;t notice any material improvement from my Healthy White model</li>
            <li> Buy the Healthy White (although mine did break after about 18mos)</li>
            <li> The batteries on both of them went out exactly one month after the warranty went out.</li>
            <li> First of all I never write reviews until now.</li>
            <li> They also mentioned that it will take 7-10 business days from when I first called.</li>
            <li> it started making a lot of noise, a loud buzzing sound.  </li>
            <li> From the first day I started using the toothbrush</li>
            <li> I had to replace my regular sonicare brush (because I have gingivitis, which is sexy as all get out</li>
            <li> It is exactly like the models in the US.</li>
            <li> the first was replaced under warranty, the replacement they sent me lasted until today</li>
            <li> The settings are mostly to set an internal timer for it to turn off.)&lt;br /&gt;-Slender,</li>
            <li> I am not sorry.</li>
            <li> I bought my first sonicare in 2001 and it lasted until Jan. 2013.</li>
            <li> And teeth for 2 weeks not became more white.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to getting back to the dentist office and getting a report that my teeth &amp; gums look better than ever.  </li>
            <li> At first.  </li>
            <li> And on top of it the system looks robust enough - meaning it does not look like it&#x27;s gonna break three months from now.</li>
            <li> You divide the brushing into 4 parts: front of bottom teeth, back of bottom teeth, front of top teeth, and back of top teeth.  </li>
            <li> That is about $50 more than a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Many Different Modes: The first mode is \\&quot;Clean\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> And they were whiter after the first brushing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes consistently for about 15 years.  </li>
            <li> First off.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but awesome!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> It is reliable and cleans my teeth way better than with a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It definitely has helped make a better cleaning habit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth have become more white.  </li>
            <li> Funny, i don&#x27;t remember reading that Jonny</li>
            <li> Only the elegant, ceramic-like skin on the DiamondClean model, with</li>
            <li> I also love all of the accessories that come with it - the travel case (which has a convenient cord for charging by USB or standard outlet)</li>
            <li> Having purchased for more than 100 items through Amazon Prime, I would say that this is the only one that is not up to the standards of Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is my first Sonicare, and I decided to splurge.  </li>
            <li> Its much nicer than the Oral B, and really powerful.</li>
            <li> On board charger capability would have required a larger case, giving reviewers one more</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When put into perspective, this unit&#x27;s design was fully tested and there&#x27;s a logical reason for every feature.  </li>
            <li> handle isn&#x27;t the most helpful for a solid grip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this toothbrush I felt like I had just been to the dentist for a cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying an electric toothbrush for the first time.</li>
            <li> When you push the power button it immediately starts in the first mode.</li>
            <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter and they feel as smooth as after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> i do like the chrome on the body and the top of it as opposed to the plastic on prior models.  </li>
            <li> I tried OralB before and quit because the brush head rotates and rips your gums more  - OralB is an entirely different technology.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this toothbrush I felt like I was walking out of the dentists office.</li>
            <li> The handle is elegant and avoids the criticisms I had for my earlier model.</li>
            <li> Its the first electronic toothbrush for me</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> The battery is as advertised and last many weeks.</li>
            <li> I love the multiple settings.  </li>
            <li> Had my first one for more than 3 years before it finally gave up.  </li>
            <li> First the lights started to fade away</li>
            <li> months later, I&#x27;m trying to decide if I should shell out more cash for this brush, or buy another model or brand.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare has an open ring around the power button where if you get water in it will damage so you have to make sure you don&#x27;t get anything inside it.</li>
            <li> It cleans really well!</li>
            <li> You can even charge it straight from the travel case!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a smaller, more compact stand, and it definitely looks better in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I loved mine for the first few months.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I have never owned an electric toothbrush before this.</li>
            <li> It did take a couple of days when I first used this to get use to it.  </li>
            <li> manufacturer claims my gums will feel better after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> It comes with two brushes, pretty neat, and the travel case is pretty.</li>
            <li> My dentist said they do a better job by reaching in smaller spaces, and I agree.  </li>
            <li> Our teeth feel cleaner and they are really whiter!</li>
            <li> first Sonicare had a battery that died 13 months after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> (the first Sonicare had NiCad batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you travel the case is simple , elegant and</li>
            <li> The first wore out after years of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It saves so much time at the dentist!</li>
            <li> The glass charging cup is pretty nifty too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product specifically because of reviews that said it was a better option for those who don&#x27;t floss religiously.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars only because it was probably better than not brushing at all.</li>
            <li> The first set lasted over 7 years.</li>
            <li> just bough a set of two of the more basic Philips Sonicare (Philips Sonicare Elite Rechargeable Premium Edition Toothbrush) for $70 at Costco for my parents.</li>
            <li> So I figured bigger must be better...</li>
            <li> Not so much!  </li>
            <li> I bought my first one on the recommendation of my dentist.</li>
            <li> Combined with regular oil pulling, there is nothing better.</li>
            <li> used it for almost three weeks, twice a day, off the first charge.</li>
            <li> My dentist encouraged me to buy my last Sonicare which I enjoyed for years.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare, and they just get better and</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was quite a surprise.</li>
            <li> There is nowhere for mold/mildew stains to grow and it just feels fantastic in action.</li>
            <li> I could tell my teeth were cleaner after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I eventually lost my first DiamondClean after about a year.  </li>
            <li> It was holding up just as well as the first day I got it.  </li>
            <li> and it is very confortbal !</li>
            <li> It was the only one that said it cleaned plaque better than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off to charge it for the first time.</li>
            <li> The first use removed a lot of plaque that my manual and Rodent didn&#x27;t seem to reach.</li>
            <li> I will most likely not purchase another Sonicare Toothbrush again.  </li>
            <li> (They did not offer me a confirmation number the first time.)  </li>
            <li> first came from a higher end oral-b electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Regardless, my parents used to rave about their top model oral b until one visit I picked up some standard sonicare brush heads to they could try my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Ok so this thing is totally legit!</li>
            <li> and I know my dental hygienist is going to pleased on my next visit.</li>
            <li> Phillips replaced my first brush that I had owned just under a year when it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I really like that it holds a 3 week charge, too!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare tooth brushes since they first came out, this is my 4th.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t imagine how much difference this would make over a manual brush!</li>
            <li> and I like the different options you are able to select by just pushing the button.</li>
            <li> it did tickle one area at first, but after 2 days, i got used to it.</li>
            <li> We have been using it now for several years and still really love the product.  </li>
            <li> The first day I used the brush three times.  </li>
            <li> I only wish I had known this years ago because I would be a lot better</li>
            <li> Much better than standard electric brush.</li>
            <li> So I bought the more up to date styles where there was a smaller chance of that happening.</li>
            <li> This Diamondclean brush is the REAL DEAL!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s deal with the elephant in the room first -</li>
            <li> Your mileage may vary ;-)</li>
            <li> it would be that the travel case uses a _mini-USB port_ INSTEAD of the more universal _micro-USB</li>
            <li> bought this after being told by the dentist (first visit in a decade)</li>
            <li> Dropped my first one once and it broke.</li>
            <li> I have been using sonicare since the first generation came out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do it much sooner!</li>
            <li> Planned obsolescence best describes this expensive disposable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> While expensive, it is a perfect example of the view that &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> people have really begun to notice my smile.</li>
            <li> My first challenge is in the finish and lack of contours on the handle.</li>
            <li> Really well packaged product!</li>
            <li> I only wish the brusheads were cheaper :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make sure current users do not become overly worried by this post:  </li>
            <li> However, it seems plausible that there may be some effect through a mechanism such as the interaction of the electro-magnetic force on the iron within cells.</li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;ve been using this brush I can definitely feel it does much better job at cleaning the teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The charging systems are pretty neat too.</li>
            <li> I love it at first sight and first use!!!I used to use several model of O&#x27;s toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I have tried them all, but I mainly use the regular clean setting,and my teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li> I have used the clean and white modes so far, and both make my teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Nothing that I have acquired in a very, very long time does so much concrete good, does so much to enhance my health.</li>
            <li> Then you use it and get the clean and again WOW!</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean, just like a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li> A full charge can provide a few weeks of use, but the battery does begin to die more quickly the longer you use the brush (after 1 year).</li>
            <li> It has a very powerful cleaning and gum massaging action.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful but not harsh.  </li>
            <li> Just a pure white and very light unit, until you turn it on and status information glows through.</li>
            <li> I also use the polish after clean, for an extra clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use the polish after clean, for an extra clean feeling.     </li>
            <li> If I forget to bring my Sonicare and have to resort to a regular toothbrush, my mouth doesn&#x27;t even feel clean, not compared to the Sonicare clean I am now used to.  </li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare had rubber around most of the body and that made for a secure grip.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re the only one using the toothbrush, you&#x27;ll be storing them someplace less than ideal, and they&#x27;ll probably fall down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Diamond clean makes me feel like I just got back from the dentist clean</li>
            <li> The built in timer really helps to give all of your teeth the right amount of bruching time.  </li>
            <li> Amazon did me right again and all the reviews really helped me make up my mind on a purchase that was not inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> it gives milder cleaning than the Triumph,Philips dose not provides  floss action with their&#x60;s brush heads which I liked very much,  about 8days after first 24 hours fully charged the yellow led started flash</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how the Sonicare will perform long term, but I&#x27;m very pleased with how it is working so far!</li>
            <li> It feels comfortable and very natural in my hand, the start button is easy to push, and the overall look of the toothbrush is sleek and minimalist.  </li>
            <li> However, this amazing toothbrush makes it possible to brush your entire mouth with the same effective motion.  </li>
            <li> It is nice, but it has more settings than what I feel are necessary such as for polishing, sensitive gums, etc.  </li>
            <li> design is very appealing but only one major flaw.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for days between charges and the stand is very small but works great.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating takes a little getting used to but the sensitive setting works great to ease you into it</li>
            <li> I have been using a standard electric toothbrush for many years, and I have long wondered if the sonic toothbrushes were all that much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I can&#x27;t compare this brush to other electric toothbrushes for how effectively it cleans, I like</li>
            <li> There are plenty of cheaper options (including other Sonicares) that will be just as effective in cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wish i hadn&#x27;t spend this large amount of money on a toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t work half as good as my $20 sonicare that I bought from CVS.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, clean, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it moderately wet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged man that works with hand tools all the time and has great hand/forearm strength.</li>
            <li> I have owned four different electric toothbrushes previously, but this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Let me put it like this: after using it my teeth feel as clean as when I go to the dentist for a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> I think my mouth has never ever been this clean using the old school toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Sonicare with this Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li> Clean, polish, sensitive, etc.  </li>
            <li> Then, it quit working - it will turn on but vibrates so softly that it doesn&#x27;t clean at all.  </li>
            <li> This unit is considerably easier to clean than those like the Elite that have a screw on head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When finished, my teeth feel just as clean as if I had had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> all of them clean and sensitive</li>
            <li> Then I realized that the cost of repeated dental visits and potential of having to wear dentures in the future overshadowed the cost of a good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The five different programs are more than adequate for everything that you might want, from a deep cleaning to a quick polish.  </li>
            <li> assembles quickly and easily, getting the brush-head on and off is as simple as pulling it off and then lightly snapping back on when you need it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, this thing pretty much scared me at first.</li>
            <li> With my old electric toothbrush, the travel case was so chintzy I immediately threw it away, but this case is nice enough that it looks like something you would buy separately for another twenty or thirty bucks.</li>
            <li> With my old electric toothbrush, the travel case was so chintzy I immediately threw it away, but this case is nice enough that it looks like something you would buy separately for another twenty or thirty bucks.</li>
            <li> I kept my E series fairly clean by unscrewing and rinsing out after every use, and I still do the same thing here - rip the brush head off and just give it a quick rinse.  </li>
            <li> You can disable this option if you&#x27;re already used to the feeling of a sonic toothbrush, but since I&#x27;ve only used manual toothbrushes, I really appreciated being able to ease my way in.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner and it seems to keep coffee and tea stains away better than my regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It replaces an 8 year old sonicare, and it definitely is better than the old one by quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Overall a nice and complete package.</li>
            <li> Its good, but doesn&#x27;t have proper instructions for using its various functions...</li>
            <li> Secondary acrylic stand if the cup is being washed (it is top dishwater safe), or is not your \\&quot;cup of tea\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> + Secondary acrylic stand if the cup is being washed (it is top dishwater safe), or is not your \\&quot;cup of tea\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> We did have to search on the net for product info and detailed instructions but the effort was well worth it.</li>
            <li> After a few months of use I can&#x27;t be happier it cleans my teeth very well and feels good in your hand while using.  </li>
            <li> While many have complained about the one button design, I would respectfully recommend reading the manual.  </li>
            <li> First, let me talk about the design itself since this is pretty much what you will be paying for -</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is far better than my 10 year old Sonicare, which finality stopped</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner and love the different timer settings</li>
            <li> Not only do my teeth and gums feel super clean, but they feel healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really hope that this model will have an improved lifespan over the Healthy White model .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be updating my razor soon and will certainly shop Phillip&#x27;s products first.</li>
            <li> I already had a Sonic Toothbrush and was very pleased with it until Santa brought this little Diamond.  </li>
            <li> very pleased with it although it takes a little time getting used to the faster head rotation.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I prefer the charging stand because it is more compact and clean looking and keeps the tooth brush standing up straight, matching my other dental tools, instead of leaning against the large glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new design is sleek and clean; I love the all white look and the lit up settings, real classy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit high, but it&#x27;s totally worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the investment if it saves you from even just one cavity, so I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> The price is high but worth it.</li>
            <li> In spite of high price for a toothbrush, it is worth spending on this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The aesthetics are also very nice--beautiful glass charger cup, which is easy to clean, and a small, light handle.  </li>
            <li> Tell you what, the first time I brushed my teeth with this new Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean Toothbrush, I instantly fell in love!  </li>
            <li> To the contrary, I feel incredibly lucky to be 59 years young and never even had a cavity!</li>
            <li> One feature that would be great to see would be an app that tracks how often its used and how long, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see that with this particular model - maybe in the future.</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t find any special acrobatic techniques needed to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> but I could buy a lot of conventional toothbrushes for that kind of money.</li>
            <li> The first week or so my gums were a bit sensitive, but that went away rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> for the toothbrush&#x27;s functions, I can tell you flossing isn&#x27;t nearly such an arduous chore, as the toothbrush is simply that effective; the &#x27;clean&#x27; setting does its job remarkably well...</li>
            <li> It definitely looks like it could have been made by Apple, it looks very cool.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I chose this one.  </li>
            <li> I hesitate to mention anything positive about the oral b, but that one stuttered the brush at the two-min mark, then just kept on going.  </li>
            <li> Wrote Philips as positive before against another brand toothbrush (when mine was you know, working) but will have to recant that statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> That said, it works very well and my teeth definitely feel very clean after using it.  </li>
            <li> This was not uncomfortable -- just very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even learn how many times to press the button and just count because it depends on how long it is since it stopped</li>
            <li> your teeth feel cleaner and they are just more powerful than other brands.  </li>
            <li> love using this toothbrush, and feel that this technology will go a long way towards improving my dental health without increasing the time that I need to spend on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally called Sonicare and they told me they would replace the unit within 90 days of purchase, but couldn&#x27;t replace it with a different unit that might fit my hand and mouth better.  </li>
            <li> Well, from the first try my teeth feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I had this happen on my first brush, it slipped out of my hands (As it is a very sleek design) and fell into the sink</li>
            <li> After about 11 months she had to have hers replaced due the same thing I experienced.  </li>
            <li> I had an Oral B first, then I bought my wife a Sonicare E series that she didn&#x27;t like as much as my Oral B, so we switched.  </li>
            <li> When I explained my problem—that it was taking too long for me to get a replacement toothbrush—I explained to Lisa that I am a physician and that if it might result in better service, she could transfer me to the physician customer-support group.</li>
            <li> exactly a WEEK ago so there shouldn&#x27;t be any real build-up.  </li>
            <li> so I was really overwhelmed, at first, when using the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> As this is my first electric toothbrush, I can&#x27;t really compare.  </li>
            <li> It tickles at first, but my teeth really do feel cleaner all the time now.</li>
            <li> After trying many different electric brushes from many brands I decided to buy this Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;The price is not very accesible</li>
            <li> induction charger don&#x27;t interest you though, save the $$ and get the FlexCare as I really don&#x27;t feel much of a difference in the cleaning of the toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> After using this new brush, my teeth feel absolutely cleaner!!  </li>
            <li> The top metal shaft that holds the brush head attachment and causes the brush to vibrate became loose over time on the first two handles that I have used.</li>
            <li> So if you pack the brush head while damp--which often happens when traveling--it stays damp, in a dark, tightly enclosed space--the perfect conditions for promoting bacteria and mold growth.</li>
            <li> So if you pack the brush head while damp--which often happens when traveling--it stays damp, in a dark, tightly enclosed space--the perfect conditions for promoting bacteria and mold growth.</li>
            <li> Light appears when charging necessary  + Options backlighting done via LED, making display very bright, but also using less electricity  + Gorgeous travel case that doubles as an in-case charger when connected to the USB cable  + Handles a wide range of Philips brush heads, including the diamond clean, sensitive, deep clean, and other models  </li>
            <li> (they used to be quite yellow), they feel incredibly clean and fresh after brushing with the Sonicare Diamondclean, which no manual toothbrush can ever replicate.</li>
            <li> it does clean my clear very</li>
            <li> That said, if you&#x27;re just looking for function, my sense is that the toothbrushes that are a step or two down are equally effective.</li>
            <li> This brush really cleans; my teeth don&#x27;t feel this clean after professional cleanings.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an older model, Sonicare Healthy White.  </li>
            <li> The other home charging option is to use the included charging glass, which also fits on top of the charging plate (you can put either the charging stand or the glass onto the charging plate), and allows you to sit your toothbrush in a glass as many people do, and charge it at the same time.</li>
            <li> Now I will have to replace it, but I think you might be pleased to know it has lasted so long!</li>
            <li> I Love the different setting on it and it has more power than the other sonics that I have had.</li>
            <li> LOVE the travel case you can plug into your computer for charging for long business trips!  </li>
            <li> Love the long charge that it holds!.  </li>
            <li> I think the little glass idea is too cute!  </li>
            <li> I did deactivate the easy start, since I have been using oral B model for the last 3 years.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s enough for me, I&#x27;m easy.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush is much more powerful than your average battery powered unit.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve owned every generation, and until the flexcare generation, each one has served me loyally for years until the batteries were just too old or the buttons would literally wear</li>
            <li> easy to get the brushes from local stores.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the charging glass really works, and the case is cool too.</li>
            <li> powerful to clean the teeth and gentle in the same time,&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It gives a tingle on the lips which I had to get used to (easy enough) and does a thorough job.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the matte black model so that&#x27;s what I picked</li>
            <li> I just came back from my first tenting trip of the season and the charging case was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am very particular about my teeth and from now on I won&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare has a much subtler vibration mechanism than the Braun, and I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that my teeth still get Sonicare clean, there are some major design flaws with this brush.</li>
            <li> But then one day a month or so ago, part of a tooth got chipped off because of a large cavity</li>
            <li> Also, because of the one button if you want to turn it on just temporarily to get water out after rinsing it you have to wait a certain amount of time or press the button like 5 times till it turns off.</li>
            <li> I certainly intend on using the diamondClean.</li>
            <li> all the pros outweigh the cons by a large margin.</li>
            <li> The travel case with USB charger / AC adapter is a smart idea</li>
            <li> Are they making a large profit off these.</li>
            <li> certainly wouldn&#x27;t replace a functioning Sonicare with this model.</li>
            <li> certainly wouldn&#x27;t replace a functioning Sonicare with this model.</li>
            <li> , they sent me the new updated version and it has more power and the battery last for weeks and weeks.</li>
            <li> This new model has more of a uni-body shell that contains a gap only around the power button itself.</li>
            <li> If it moves SLIGHTLY the LED battery light will stop glowing and the menu options will light up.</li>
            <li> My previous electronic toothbrushes don&#x27;t even compare to this one and now I&#x27;m hooked and even the feeling afterward is different than any I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  </li>
            <li> best electric toothbrush other hands down!!</li>
            <li> The reasons are because the Oral-B spinbrush covers more surface area of the teeth as compared to Sonicare, its spinning action seems much more gentle than the excessive vibrations of the Sonicare TB.</li>
            <li> If you can afford it, I would definitely buy this product, but if not the other sonicare brushes are amazing too!</li>
            <li> which is not a full substitute for flossing but its amazing how much junk comes out when you use the water flosser.</li>
            <li> I should point out that my husband go the same tooth brush a month or two before I got mine and his is fine.  </li>
            <li> The fix was moving onto fine German engineering, Oral B 7000 model.</li>
            <li> I have been traveling for a month, and the recharger works just fine in different countries.</li>
            <li> I had an older Sonicare, but started with lowest setting first.</li>
            <li> I have used electric toothbrushes and water flossers in the past and nothing seemed to be that exceptional.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to clean though and to recharge, it takes hardly anytime to recharge it maybe an hour or two and its ready to go for another 2 weeks with repeated use.</li>
            <li> My main gripe is the handle is made out of ceramic and is SLIPPERY!</li>
            <li> Battery life is exceptional, I travel for work and usually go weeks in between charges.</li>
            <li> If you insist on Sonicare get an older version, not this POS!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush and its case have a $150 &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; to it - very high quality materials with a sleek look.</li>
            <li> It felt like I received a professional cleaning from my dentist on the first brushing!  </li>
            <li> At first I was unsure if I wanted to spend the extra money for the Diamond Clean model</li>
            <li> did i mention its high tech pretty?</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to, but really is superior to brushing the old way.  </li>
            <li> and I agree that it&#x27;s hard to improve on a product that was already so good.  </li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare products exclusively for years but this new product is by far significantly improved.</li>
            <li> I would give this new modern &amp;#34;space age&amp;#34; looking one 5 stars if it had ANY place to store more than one toothbrush besides the flat travel case.</li>
            <li> They are the green ones in the middle, which appear to be both thinner and more fine than the outside white/blue bristles and are also more densely packed.</li>
            <li> Great, hard, modern, classy, travel case, which can also be used to recharge toothbrush with USB connection.</li>
            <li> my dental hygienist says Sonicare toothbrushes are a bit better than Oral-B. Certainly more delicate and logically as or more efficacious due to the very soft bristles and the very high frequency it oscillates at.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush, and I have to say it is a huge step</li>
            <li> After just a few days my teeth were whiter &amp; it really does an amazing job of cleaning between teeth.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m perfectly happy with this Brush, I&#x27;ve had it several months now, and purchased one for my wife a few weeks after being the family guinea pig.  </li>
            <li> Definitely makes a huge difference in dental visits</li>
            <li> Very disapointing product, since then have swiched back to the advanced care and just bought a brown to test it</li>
            <li> Where I do think there is a huge improvement over the last model</li>
            <li> overall, it really does leave my teeth smooth like having come from the dentist.</li>
            <li> This is such a huge improvement over that model</li>
            <li> If the packaging hadn&#x27;t been plastered with design awards I&#x27;d have given it an extra star but Philips seem to think the design is important so it deserves to be penalized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a review for the DiamondClean version, not the whole Sonicare line.  </li>
            <li> If the packaging hadn&#x27;t been plastered with design awards I&#x27;d have given it an extra star but Philips seem to think the design is important so it deserves to be penalized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a review for the DiamondClean version, not the whole Sonicare line.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> But my real gripe?  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t dropped, or mishandled (haha) in any way.  </li>
            <li> I did enjoy how it brushed..</li>
            <li> It is however, much more grippy when wet.</li>
            <li> so she was always on me that I should floss that I wouldn&#x27;t have so much plaque</li>
            <li> Really like Sonicare</li>
            <li> The Sonicare seems much gentler than the Oral B brushes.</li>
            <li> He said he wants to die with all his teeth.</li>
            <li> The latter are freely available for about $15 on the web</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really do look forward to brushing now</li>
            <li> The travel case protects the toothbrush and charges straight from a USB port on your computer so</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> The vibration is intense, and you&#x27;ll feel a tingle or tickle while using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> It does look very</li>
            <li> If Value for your dollar is important, this is definitely not the model for you.  </li>
            <li> I had a cheap battery operated brush before this, but it&#x27;s no match for the constant battery power of this machine!</li>
            <li> As a &amp;#34;tool guy,&amp;#34; this is a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; tool, not some gimmicky toy, while being safe and clean and easy to use with minimal practice.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it too.  </li>
            <li> This brush really did whiten as promised, and polished, and removed plaque like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The travel case and computer charger are nifty, the sensitive setting useful</li>
            <li> I can say that research really payed off.  </li>
            <li> The real problem is that teh \\&quot;smaller\\&quot; brush is not being offered anywhere, not Amazon and not even at Phillips&#x27; website ([...]).</li>
            <li> Never realized I had so much plaque in hard-to-reach areas.  </li>
            <li> I use the glass cup for my retainers, and don&#x27;t really need to charge the brush often, so just leave on the counter.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel lighter and so much fresher.  </li>
            <li> Every time I brush my teeth, they feel smooth and sparkle like I just left the dentist!</li>
            <li> It really does help your teeth.</li>
            <li> Usability leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> I was like &#x27;is this really going to charge?&#x27;</li>
            <li> The whole thing smells of flash and modern.</li>
            <li> My teeth, tongue, and the whole mouth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go into too much detail</li>
            <li> In fact, I can say with honesty that even three times a month would be giving myself too much credit.</li>
            <li> These bristles are arranged in a semi-geometrical orientation that really scrubs and cleans your teeth.</li>
            <li> Very cool!&lt;br</li>
            <li> uses to gradually and gently acclimate the user&#x27;s mouth to the sensation of using a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The vibration is far more intense, has multiple &#x27;levels&#x27; of cleaning purposes and it is sleek and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I had no intention of spending this much for a &#x27;toothbrush&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It gives off a very determined but gentle hum that varies with the cleaning program I select.</li>
            <li> that really matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say much about the whitening feature</li>
            <li> I really dig the charging station.</li>
            <li> Real design work all around.</li>
            <li> Real design work all around.</li>
            <li> The bill cost almost as much as this toothbrush (I had been eyeing it for awhile), so I thought &amp;#34;I&#x27;m going to pay this now</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like the whitening setting; it really makes a difference in reducing my coffee stains.</li>
            <li> NONE of those have been dropped, and I can personally vouch for mine and my wife&#x27;s being drop free.  </li>
            <li> It really makes you miss an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really makes you miss an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself I really like &amp;</li>
            <li> really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> The unit was the modern model that i wanted, it came and nodamage and worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Your teeth and gums will really feel it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t keep the unit constantly charging, but instead give it an overnight charge after the status light turns amber for a couple of days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because the case itself can charge the toothbrush with a USB cable, one need not be concerned about how much their toothbrush is charged before a trip.  </li>
            <li> The form factor is so much improved.  </li>
            <li> Someone at Philips should bring this feedback to the attention of the people I&#x27;ve named herein (assuming the names are real and not aliases), and should overhaul the management and training of the customer-support department.</li>
            <li> This brush does a lot of the work for you and is very thorough.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> 2 Stars because it cleans teeth really well.</li>
            <li> are much whiter, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Charger is really convenient.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Possibly the Advanced Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sensitive might be useful</li>
            <li> 2 minutes later, my teeth feel as smooth as glass.  </li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s mostly used for travel so no real</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s mostly used for travel so no real</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I really like the features of the travel case and the charger cup.</li>
            <li> Got it because I travel so much</li>
            <li> but this one goes much easier on teeth.  </li>
            <li> You can really feel the difference as you race your tongue across your teeth.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge much longer than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth very well.</li>
            <li> The unit itself brushes your teeth very well.</li>
            <li> This cleans your teeth really well</li>
            <li> Their customer service is also very rude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am really speechless</li>
            <li> The same situation with battery on my Philips goLITE BLU Light Therapy Device.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, and my dentist cleanings have been much easier.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would ever spend this much money for a toothbrush</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> It will hold two brush heads for travel, but you could include heads for the whole family in ziploc bags if needed.</li>
            <li> I really like the plastic it&#x27;s made of</li>
            <li> problems with the seller either - fast and efficient service</li>
            <li> Gentle on the teeth and gums, but my teeth were never cleaner.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the gentler Diamond brush and bought another one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> For the price I expected a lot more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift &amp; it was very well received.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like the charging cradle.  </li>
            <li> just remember that all the different brushing will light up when charged for you to pick...</li>
            <li> However, the ergonomics and practicality team must have not had much say.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> teeth and gums feel much cleaner and healthier.</li>
            <li> device comes with a number of very snazzy accessories.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;+ USB charging can be accomplished either by using supplied plug-in USB a/c convertor or by plugging USB cable into a computer&#x27;s USB port&lt;br</li>
            <li> Available in white and black&lt;</li>
            <li> Battery level light appears only when you need to recharge, so you can&#x27;t tell how soon that time will be coming up (i.e., no three-light power level</li>
            <li> USB charging can be accomplished either by using supplied plug-in USB a/c convertor or by plugging USB cable into a computer&#x27;s USB port  + Travel case has built-in USB port so charging can occur while brush is sitting inside travel case  + Ceramic-like finish to brush</li>
            <li> - Battery level light appears only when you need to recharge, so you can&#x27;t tell how soon that time will be coming up (i.e., no three-light power level indicator)  - Travel case</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get this much quality for a lower price.</li>
            <li> Need to be careful with the handle to avoid touching tooth.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to warn anyone that have to deal with Philips warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dentist asked what I started using haha.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: Two weeks of phone calls and lies and today they agreed to refund with no guarantee of how much I would receive.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it very often because I&#x27;m travelling a lot from home</li>
            <li> I can feel how much smoother my teeth feel and provide the sense of cleanliness.</li>
            <li> It buzzes lightly every 30 seconds to tell you to brush a different quadrant.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;which wear out too fast.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Really, the idea of spending this kind of cash on a toothbrush seemed absolutely ludicrous to me up until a few weeks ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> About a month ago it really started loosing power even though the power indicated</li>
            <li> I think the feeling comes from the gentle vibration of the toothbrush, which stimulates your gums as you are brushing.  </li>
            <li> The concept of putting your toothbrush in a glass to charge it is neat, but I haven&#x27;t seen the real advantage to this over the USB Charging/Storage Case.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has multiple modes (although I only use the basic one) but does a great job.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to give this toothbrush 5 stars, but I just couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> do you really need to upgrade to this model?  </li>
            <li> I always question if it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I missed it SO much with the oral b.</li>
            <li> The recharger is so convenient - my toothbrush is always ready to go.</li>
            <li> After two years of use, the power button on the handle had become so unresponsive to operate, that it required a very forceful two-thumb push to turn on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You never see that in photos of this toothbrush, and I was very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and on schedule.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s in your mouth and ready to use, you CANNOT look at the handle to see what mode you are in.</li>
            <li> It is a fabulous visual as well as ergonomic design which makes looking at it and using it a pleasure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any real problems with having to change the mode while brushing.</li>
            <li> i can keep the machine  much cleaner.</li>
            <li> The sonic vibration is intense and takes a couple days to get used to</li>
            <li> I really like the design</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush and bought one for my special-needs 21 year old son who hates brushing his teeth, He especially likes the gentle gum massage which is an area the dental hygenist recommended he show</li>
            <li> Also the charger cup is really convenient as well for those at home time.</li>
            <li> I got it to my wife as a Xmax gift, however it arrived a worng item with in ... very upsad and need to get a replasement asap..</li>
            <li> They both said \\&quot;very good.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend this much money on an electric toothbrush but having used it for a couple of months</li>
            <li> but I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li> My mom likes it so much.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to charge in the glass cup and box.</li>
            <li> Yes, it brushes teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> It finally broke and wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all except the bottom light in the settings on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of getting used to, but the product works really well.  </li>
            <li> Should I really have to do that with a top-of-the-line toothbrush?</li>
            <li> really?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Somebody in the Netherlands really messed up on this product.  </li>
            <li> after brushing your teeth feel &amp;#34;polished smooth&amp;#34; and really shine like they do when the dental hygienist cleans them.  </li>
            <li> Also, my teeth do not seem to build up as much staining.  </li>
            <li> I would be very hesitant to buy Philips products again.</li>
            <li> I have to say he was absolutely correct.  </li>
            <li> Amazon delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much brushing &amp;#34;crud&amp;#34; accumulate, but just keep that in mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you really feel you need to change settings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you really feel you need to change settings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so much so that I had to wrap it in a towel and stuff it under 3 pillows in my living room in order to not hear it?</li>
            <li> - how much time do -you- want to spend with your dentist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I upgraded and compared and really found no difference.</li>
            <li> They have not worked for me, and you end up with a harzardous mercury laden bulb you have to dispose of responsibly.</li>
            <li> And of course it works really well.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between</li>
            <li> Call Philips and they replace it, with several legitimate and relevant questions asked.  </li>
            <li> I really like the travel case and the timer is very helpful.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I really like the features and the glass charging glass</li>
            <li> It is a very &amp;#34;well-thought-through&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I much prefer the selection button and the on and off button to be seperate rather than having to cycle through the whole brush style to turn off the tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> After usage the power and the selection button have become very sensative and turn on and off by itself, just by shaking the unit.  </li>
            <li> The whole unit is sleek and updated in its feel and design.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it for my whole family if i could afford.</li>
            <li> the Sonicare, when you get used to the tickles in your mouth is a gentle, thorough cleaning and it leaves your mouth feeling like you just came from your dental hygienists office.</li>
            <li> issue could really be one of two things (or in this case both)...</li>
            <li> Works very well with the glass charger.  </li>
            <li> Cleans thoroughly with no fuss and charged and ready to go each time.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works really well.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush does all it&#x27;s said to do and does it very well.</li>
            <li> I am ready to switch to another brand.  </li>
            <li> I really like the toothbrush - 5 speed head.&lt;br /&gt;Recalls</li>
            <li> even my dentist noticed how much healthier my gums were</li>
            <li> There are multiple settings that change the length of brushing and based on the sound of the toothbrush, the frequency in which it moves.</li>
            <li> It really helps the gums and stuff.</li>
            <li> The many bits and pieces that came with the unit are not really needed either.</li>
            <li> It really is a fantastic toothbrush, and is a much different experience.</li>
            <li> the short term, the Sonicare has made my daily routine relaxing and fun, making me more inclined to brush.</li>
            <li> do really like the brush</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This thing is intense.  </li>
            <li> Not really bleaching your teeth, of course, but I do feel cleaner by brushing for slightly more time.</li>
            <li> The design is very sleek and modern.  </li>
            <li> but can you really overspend on hygiene?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this on the charger for six days straight</li>
            <li> The UV-sanitizer sold with some models is also a gimmick, and doesn&#x27;t really do what&#x27;s claimed according to my research.</li>
            <li> Also fast shipment.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I had to replace the last of my Ultrasonex II&#x27;s, because they are no longer available</li>
            <li> I also found the travel box to be very</li>
            <li> /&gt;The magic backlighting, the ceramic finish, the minimal conductive</li>
            <li> I really wanted to buy this</li>
            <li> As the product is only used 4 minutes per day, some users may feel comfortable with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> BETTER RESULTS THAN I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> I have replaced it with the Sonicare Flexcare+ model since it uses the same brush heads, and am liking the rubber grip and light feel.</li>
            <li> The DiamondClean toothbrush really performs well.</li>
            <li> My mouth really does feel cleaner than with manual brushing.</li>
            <li> I would have liked 2 of the regular brush heads instead of one regular and one</li>
            <li> but it looks like it would be just as effective as the standard size, but a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> For regular use in your home bathroom, there is a charging plate that plugs into your wall with the standard 2-prong power socket, and you can put the included clear plastic charging stand on the plate which is a good looking charging option, and is what I use.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has several settings so you can adjust the vibration to your own personal preference.      </li>
            <li> I love the different settings and programs it offers.</li>
            <li> This makes the toothbrush start softly the first couple of times you use it and ramp up in intensity over the first 14 uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a dying Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrush, the kind with a round head.</li>
            <li> I like the many settings it offers along with the 30 second intervals.</li>
            <li> The charge is on point after the first full day of charging (required)  2 wk&#x27;s 1/2 almost 3, but in all fairness, I didn&#x27;t wait till the 3wks was up before putting the brush back on the charger.</li>
            <li> Hope for the amount of money spent, this will be a good lasting investment.  </li>
            <li> They indicate that if I don&#x27;t change the overall health of my gums, they&#x27;ll want to do more frequent visits with some sort of gum care routine.  </li>
            <li> I liked the toothbrush enough to buy another one, but this time I sent in the 2 year warranty with an extra 6 months.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a great brand and really stands behind their products.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> It kind of tickled my gums, but I got use to it after a few days.  </li>
            <li> when its running low you can still get about 15 more minutes of use before it completely</li>
            <li> i really dig the matte finish on the body for more of a grip when wet.</li>
            <li> It does a remarkable job keeping the buildup of tartar down and if used regularly twice a day with a whitening toothpaste, it does lighten your teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides these points, the other reviews about the product quality is very accurate.</li>
            <li> Great brushing action, but the material is very slippery unless wet (which is odd but true).</li>
            <li> Also of note, these brush heads can fit on the HealthyWhite and most likely some other Sonicare brush handles, but not the Essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a lower-power mode that you should use if your teeth or gums are sensitive and you feel discomfort using the other more powerful modes.</li>
            <li> After hours and days of research about electric toothbrushes, I found this product with high positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I first got this toothbrush at a steep discount when I was new to non-traditional toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> The cleanness you can clearly felt right away. .</li>
            <li> Not to mention, it&#x27;s easy to see considering how long the handle is?  </li>
            <li> Use this brush after a water pick nightly if you want healthy, white teeth and dentist-shockingly clean, pink gums.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite, though it cost twice as much as any other.  </li>
            <li> It has a modern look, and clean simple feel.  </li>
            <li> The vibrations are lot softer now - clean mode is like sensitive mode and with the sensitive mode almost nothing happens.  </li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t really care, I just wanted to get them as clean as possible.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even wait for the full 24-hour charge; I just brushed my teeth after four hours on the charger, and it was pure heaven.  </li>
            <li> I found that I had no problem using the system, that my gums felt better, and that my teeth did look whiter, as promised, with no other product (such as a whitener) needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first used the Diamondclean, I knew this was no ordinary electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also an adapter that lets it stand vertically, but you need to make sure you always put the handle back exactly the same without rotating, because it won&#x27;t charge if it&#x27;s not 100% aligned.  </li>
            <li> The power button and timer could be a bit more intuitive (as other reviews have already mentioned and covered in detail).</li>
            <li> The design of this toothbrush is second to none and is reminiscent of the minimal, yet beautiful, design of Apple products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth better than any other manual/electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> it cleans extremely well and the design is appealing.</li>
            <li> During that time I used two different Sonicares, the original one and the Elite.  </li>
            <li> But my first Sonicare over a decade ago was MORE expensive and in todays dollars would be even more so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of electric toothbrushes and never been satisfied.  </li>
            <li> works 10 times better than other electric TB.</li>
            <li> Other than that--very pleased with this unit.</li>
            <li> Registering the product allowed me to get a discount on some of the replacement heads, which was a better price for those than offered at Amazon or other sites/stores.</li>
            <li> With most standard toothbrushes you just generally brush your teeth but with the timed sequences that the Sonicare uses each quadrant gets 30 seconds and makes your mouth much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush about a month ago after a trip to the dentist and have absolutely fallen in love with it - although it does tickle the first few times because I wasn&#x27;t used to the vibration sensation.  </li>
            <li> I think it depends on the individual mouth, not all are easily accessible although I believe mine is.  </li>
            <li> The other night, I had a dinner party in our smallish but adorable apartment.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well for a little more than two years.  </li>
            <li> It is a step up from our other model, quieter and more versatile for traveling and charging.</li>
            <li> As a first-time user of Philip&#x27;s Sonicare series, I&#x27;m happy with this toothbrush, but I&#x27;m not sure if I want to spend so much money again when I need to buy my next electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not only that, it has SIGNIFICANTLY improved the health of my gums.  </li>
            <li> Some body squeaking at certain angles and pressures (caused by the high frequency vibration that these devices use, but this could be improved)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some body squeaking at certain angles and pressures (caused by the high frequency vibration that these devices use, but this could be improved)  </li>
            <li> I love that each setting as it&#x27;s own timer, so I always get the same amount of cleaning time, no more, no less.</li>
            <li> It used to take her almost an hour to clean her teeth with a regular toothbrush, but with Sonicare it literally takes seconds.</li>
            <li> Clean, white, gum care, polish.</li>
            <li> To clean the brush, I turn it back on and rinse and turn it off.</li>
            <li> If you ever brushed with Sonicare, you&#x27;ll never forget the clean</li>
            <li> I am finding I seem to prefer the Clean and White mode.</li>
            <li> The mechanism had again somehow disengaged partially, reducing the vibration by 90% and making the Sonicare more of a normal toothbrush with a vibrating handle.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s in - clean, white, polish, etc.</li>
            <li> But, I used the smaller head that comes with set to clean my engagement ring and eternity band.</li>
            <li> While I do like the diamond clean, I think my next electric toothbrush purchase will be a Oral-B spinbrush.</li>
            <li> i recently &#x27;upgraded&#x27; to this diamond clean system from the sonicare &#x27;flexcare&#x27; system.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of Eve in the Wall-E movie with its clean white finish and glowing graphics.  </li>
            <li> This is my second diamond clean.</li>
            <li> and I recently replaced it with the Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li> But let me tell you, 2 minutes is enough and your teeth will feel completely clean.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a big difference in clean feeling across my teeth.</li>
            <li> Leaves teeth feeling extra clean.  </li>
            <li> I can tell a big difference in how clean my teeth are after using this one vs. the Oral B.  </li>
            <li> Multiple modes, and a really clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> I like the various modes: Clean - Whiten - Polish - Gums.</li>
            <li> The display lights up with clean, white lights.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this, you will never feel clean going back to manual brushing.  </li>
            <li> I wonder about it&#x27;s ability to clean between teeth as the bristles seem short.  </li>
            <li> and she commented that it was obvious because my teeth were so clean.  </li>
            <li> deep clean your teeth~~best gift ever</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been so clean and white from any electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> brush is on par with my last brush, I like how sleek and clean the connection between the brush tip and the body of the brush</li>
            <li> there are five brushing modes, but i don&#x27;t use all of them (only Clean and Gum Care).</li>
            <li> At first the vibration seemed too much but after the first few days it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Good but not really better than my old one</li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate the product but as far as Phillips they were good to me.</li>
            <li> this is a good product, maybe just a tad expensive but cool productl</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying for something that is good, but this unit is just as good as my very much less expensive Elite unit.</li>
            <li> Super ergonomic features and smart buttons makes it very simple to use.  </li>
            <li> I loved it until it broke down on me last month.</li>
            <li> The single button design is a non-issue, and easy to use despite what some have said.  </li>
            <li> The main thing I realized after recieving this toothbrush is-- there are people out there leading such exciting lives that they need to recharge their toothbrushes with their laptops!</li>
            <li> What is interesting is that the CSR said other (older) models do.</li>
            <li> Using the sensitive setting on this toothbrush gives a better clean than I got in the past and doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling like they vibrating afterwards.  </li>
            <li> If they send us new ones we&#x27;ll keep using them, but for a $200 we expected more.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m yet to figure out the Whitening mode do I need a special or just regular tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I recently had oral surgery and beforehand had a special cleaning with a ultrasonic-esque pick.</li>
            <li> My teeth always feel super clean after brushing and the timers on the brush setting help me to remain diligent when brushing; even if I&#x27;m half asleep.  </li>
            <li> It reaches the back of the mollars, between the teeth and is super gentle with the gums.&lt;br /&gt;The timer helps you focus in the way you brush.&lt;br /&gt;Yo</li>
            <li> The product has a free 2 year warranty upgrade included as long as you register the product by 12/30/2015.  </li>
            <li> I have owned a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for as long as they have been available.  </li>
            <li> And even at that, I can not last the full amount of time it specifies.</li>
            <li> They give you a small plastic stand or a realyl nice glass to use as a charger.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today, so far dissappointing experience.</li>
            <li> Brush size nice and small.</li>
            <li> The extra power settings are probably overkill unless you have a medical need for more gentle brushing at times.</li>
            <li> The cool factor is definitely at work here, a portable charging station that you can also use to rinse out your mouth when you are finished.  </li>
            <li> The first brush I ordered stopped working completely after about two years.</li>
            <li> first this just seems to move far faster and leave teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> Far and away, this one had STELLAR ratings.  </li>
            <li> The price kind of made me shutter, but the reviews made me look past that and go for what the brush can do for my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why Philips has dropped the accompanying UV cleaner, as I know a lot of people liked having that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see if this is true when I go back in 3 weeks for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> about the product: it was my first electronic toothbrush, so I was really surprised about the feel of it.</li>
            <li> First, I purchased the brush at a professional discount</li>
            <li> I did have to send in the original unit to Philips as it quit working after about 1 year for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> Has several settings and recharges by sitting in a cup which is cool.</li>
            <li> of the special features this brush offers is the gentle-on feature, which, for new Sonicare users, starts the brush on first use on a low-power mode, gently increasing the power over the next 14</li>
            <li> The travel case is a high quality plastic on the inside and really unique on the outside, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s made from a highly durable nylon.</li>
            <li> Clean adds another minute for a total of two and White adds thirty more seconds for a total of 2 minutes, 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> My last Sonicare brush had to be constantly charged, so it wasn&#x27;t easy to travel with - luckily that is fixed in this model.</li>
            <li> If you are not hard on it, and just use it gently while you brush, you can get a lot of mileage out of it.  </li>
            <li> on top of that it broke down in one year.</li>
            <li> First, the cleaning ability of this brush far surpasses the older unit it replaced.  </li>
            <li> My only concern with my brush (and in full disclosure this particular model hasn&#x27;t given us any issues)</li>
            <li> it pulses a little more gently.</li>
            <li> This new toothbrush removed all of the plaque and tartar from my teeth!  </li>
            <li> This new model is the bomb!</li>
            <li> really like this toothbrush, its my first professional electric (had a cheap Oral-B battery operated one for under $10 but not very good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that I do recommend if you want to have a toothbrush that really works and easy to transport.</li>
            <li> It has greatly improved my gum loss particularly in the hard to reach back teeth.</li>
            <li> Further trials of good quality are required to assess the superiority of other modes of action for powered toothbrushes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to spend so much money on a new toothbrush, but after reading reviews decided to take the plunge.  </li>
            <li> I had never used an electric toothbrush before so the whole experience was new to me.</li>
            <li> If you are new to the whole electric toothbrush scene as I was, give this a try</li>
            <li> This is 10 times better than the previous model solely in performance.</li>
            <li> In terms of style, the brush is more streamlined and minimalist than my previous toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so less food is able to build up.</li>
            <li> I prefer the charging stand because its more compact and takes up less counter space.  </li>
            <li> They keep changing these things and this one is better than the previous versions but there are still some issues.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush but it just died over the weekend - two and a half years after purchase so it is is now out of warranty.</li>
            <li> Love the styling of it (black) .</li>
            <li> The best way for me was to use the case to recharge as it took up less space on the sink counter and was less likely to be knocked over .  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price was the most competitive price I could find, much less then at retail stores.</li>
            <li> Lovely glass cup holder adds a touch of class (and functionality) to a mundane device</li>
            <li> Lovely glass cup holder adds a touch of class (and functionality) to a mundane device  </li>
            <li> To me, it takes up less space and fits into a corner better.</li>
            <li> It seems I spend less time cleaning, but my teeth get 10 times more brushing coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m debating on whether to just downgrade to the model just below this one, as the extra cost doesn&#x27;t really seem to be worth it.</li>
            <li> I simply can&#x27;t get over what a tremendous toothbrush this is.</li>
            <li> I always would turn it on for a quick second after I rinsed the brush off.</li>
            <li> And since the pause only works after it&#x27;s been in the same setting for like 10 seconds, the alternative is selecting the setting before you put toothpaste on, standing there and holding it for 10 seconds running just to be able to pause it, to then put toothpaste on it.</li>
            <li> This is a decent electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after having an older model sonicare brush for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li> then even the older Sonicare did.  </li>
            <li> In fact, about three weeks ago I had my teeth cleaned professionally, and I still had some light stains on my upper teeth.</li>
            <li> Heck my gums looks much better than my last dental visit, I can&#x27;t wait for my next dental cleaning appointment to hear what my dentist says.</li>
            <li> my teeth actually feel cleaner and look much  better and healthier, compare to a regular electric toothbrush of course</li>
            <li> Older models had separate buttons for power and mode, and I find that design preferable.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I thought the more expensive product would be more reliable.</li>
            <li> I travel internationally for busniess and carrying one more charger is a total PITA.  </li>
            <li> Decently put together.</li>
            <li> , I will probably buy one of the older models.</li>
            <li> It has lots of features and a clever charging station design.</li>
            <li> Regret that parts from older models are not compatible.  </li>
            <li> this one is super quiet.  </li>
            <li> I have my doubts as to whether a different method of brushing could actually make my teeth whiter or more polished.  </li>
            <li> For the amount of money my husband spent getting me this as a gift, I would have liked to have a longer lasting product.</li>
            <li> But not the newest, most expensive, and most featured Diamondclean.</li>
            <li> The ceramic-like power handle, which I thought might get slippery during usage when wet, actually maintains a nice grip to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ceramic-like power handle, which I thought might get slippery during usage when wet, actually maintains a nice grip to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My main issue with Sonicare toothbrushes are their batteries.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The case was designed to charge the brush, so a form fitting interior was necessary in order for the handle to make proper charging contact.  </li>
            <li> Yes it was more expensive than most of them.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it was time to retire my older e/pre-e series brush.  </li>
            <li> I have used their earlier version for years and it finally gave up the ghost after more than 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded from my classic Sonicare solely because its aging battery no longer accepted a charge--about 10 years after purchasing it.</li>
            <li> The battery issue is a known issue with this particular product - but Philips will not acknowledge the problem after the two year warranty expires.</li>
            <li> then my older sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love the &#x27;white&#x27; setting because it gives you an extra 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I believe the triumph had something similar but this tooth brush is more sleek, smaller brush head and way cooler</li>
            <li> She had an older model and when it broke I got this for her, and LO &amp; BEHOLD, her dentist and his Dental Hygenist</li>
            <li> the different settings you can have more time or different brushing vibrations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though Phillips boasts a 3 week charge I feel better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> Ultimately at this point in time I&#x27;m okay with the extra cost because I am using the things that came with the brush.</li>
            <li> Ultimately at this point in time I&#x27;m okay with the extra cost because I am using the things that came with the brush.</li>
            <li> It also does not access all areas of my teeth as well as their older brush head models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> quieter than older</li>
            <li> I had the older model  </li>
            <li> You would think an international company, Philips would be able to handle the exchange locally overseas.  </li>
            <li> For instance, I&#x27;m sure the defective unit I send them will be patched up &amp; sent out to replace someone else&#x27;s mis-functioning unit, only to stop working a short time thereafter.</li>
            <li> The different settings on the brush are all the same power level so none of them are better at preventing this than the others.</li>
            <li> I used this brush for 3 months prior to my most recent Dentist visit and the Dentist asked &amp;#34;Wow, what did you change?</li>
            <li> Love the feature that notifies you when you have brushed 30 seconds and it&#x27;s time to move to the next quarter of your mouth!!!</li>
            <li> When the most recent one died after 9 months, I decided to go back to Sonicare</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my older Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly because of how emphatic my friend&#x27;s friend, a dental hygenist, was about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The older battery/charging mechanism deteriorated to the point that the toothbrush no longer functioned at an acceptable level.  </li>
            <li> Right now I am switching back and forth between these two brushes to see if one works better than the other for me.  </li>
            <li> I had been reluctant to spend so much money just for a toothbrush, but I was very surprised to that</li>
            <li> Our dental hygienist recommended this toothbrush to my husband and I. Not only did she use and love it, but we discovered that pretty much everyone at our dentist&#x27;s office had switched from any/all other electric toothbrushes to this one.</li>
            <li> I bought a Keurig  coffee maker from Bed Bath and Beyond a few weeks later and with special price and store coupon it was a better price than Amazon</li>
            <li> in all, based on the charging options alone I highly recommend this over the older FlexCare model.  </li>
            <li> It may not be the original one you bought, but Sonicare will ensure you get a replacement as long as you are within the warranty period.  </li>
            <li> It may not be the original one you bought, but Sonicare will ensure you get a replacement as long as you are within the warranty period.  </li>
            <li> And I mean that in the most complimentary way.</li>
            <li> Even if I&#x27;d had to pay the full retail price of $210, it would have been worth it.malist than my previous toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Originally, I thought the USB charger was a silly idea, but USB wall outlets are becoming much more comercially viable, and I even have a few USB outlets on most of my surge protectors, so I could actually see myself using this feature eventually.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this toothbrush after reading all of the reviews and seeing photographs of it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> They do sell replacements, though, and they are not too high priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> There is one model which I believe has a separate button for this task, and if you prefer to change options frequently, I highly suggest you opt for that model.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone that travels for a living like me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> My sister highly recommended this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> While they both have essentially the same engine in them (31,000 strokes per minute), the newly designed brushes seem to do a slightly better job.  </li>
            <li> Has a few new features that my old one didn&#x27;t have which was nice.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter, and they just *feel* clean, all day long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strange experience to wake up in the morning with your teeth still feeling completely clean.</li>
            <li> The two brushes I now own were still less than half the price of the DiamondClean, and my teeth get just as clean.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a really long time and gets your teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums, and this toothbrush seems more gentle than the Oral B I previously used.  </li>
            <li> Sensitive mode runs for 2 minutes at less power to be more gentle on teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes with a standard bathroom glass and a flat glass hockey-puck piece, either of which have fitted bases to sit on top of the charging unit.  </li>
            <li> It may be rather expensive, but honestly,  this toothbrush is well worth it!</li>
            <li> For the price differential, I think this offers a lot in the way of cosmetics and gimmicks, but nothing that merits such a significant increase in price.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy the Dental Professional Model!!</li>
            <li> However just today, the replacement after a little more than a year again, the battery becomes defective.</li>
            <li> Going to the local college of dentistry for my dental work and my student dentist recommended I get one of these because after brushing my teeth for almost 60 years evidently I still wasn&#x27;t getting how to do it!</li>
            <li> This one - wow!!  </li>
            <li> I also briefed my wife on it as well as my parents, telling them that they better not drop it as it would void the warranty and even a little drop would break</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe it does look a little bit like an Apple design.  </li>
            <li> Sure UV can kill the little grubbies but over time they can also mutate and become stronger.</li>
            <li> &quot; then that would make a little more sense.</li>
            <li> To me the diamond clean is a bit too much, I have to use the sensitive setting and still it can be a little powerful for me.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and some crowns, so I was worried about starting out immediately with the clean setting.  </li>
            <li> I like the various settings that run through cleaning, whitening, gum care, sensitive and I can use it to clean my tongue with my problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The toothbrush has several brushing speeds, including: clean, polish, whiten, and settings for gum care and sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> The DiamondClean is compact, lightweight, quiet, the brush bristles are soft, and it leaves your teeth feeling extremely clean after use.</li>
            <li> I am totally surprised at how clean, white, and shiny my teeth are after about two weeks of using this brush.</li>
            <li> My teeth have the same squeaky clean feel they do when I&#x27;ve had them professionally cleaned.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 5 modes; clean, white, polish, gum care, and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I find the handle extremely well balanced and easy to hold and manuever.  </li>
            <li> If you are so inclined, the brush head is small enough to clean the top of your tongue, which some hygienists recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Naturally, this toothbrush works extremely well and cleanses teeth easily and expertly.</li>
            <li> Hard to bring myself to say that a toothbrush warrants this kind of praise</li>
            <li> Also worth noting that large red letters across the front of the box read \\&quot;Dental Professional Trial - NOT FOR RESALE\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I personally think the price is worth it and HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li> And if you do take your chances and buy this thing and then almost certainly wind up with a shattered charging cup like me and many others, then be prepared to call the awesome folks at Sonicare to try and buy a replacement cup, only to be told that the cup is the ONLY componentof this stupid toothbrush set that you can&#x27;t buy replacements for AND even if they do find a replacement cup for you, it isn&#x27;t covered by the warranty....</li>
            <li> My new toothbrush is a replacement for an older model Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I kept my old sanitizer which works very well with this.  </li>
            <li> This is where the real cleaning action happens.</li>
            <li> Now my pearly whites are really pearly white and people are astounded and don&#x27;t believe that a toothbrush could make such a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Even though it is expensive this has been a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was concerned with two things about this model: no On/Off switch, and a smooth surface which I wondered if it would be slippery when wet.  </li>
            <li> One thing I really appreciated about this model was the \\&quot;Soft Start\\&quot; feature.</li>
            <li> But I did not spend this much money to be completely out of a tooth brush in 25 months.</li>
            <li> and so far, I really do like it.</li>
            <li> But all in all - I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone and everyone I know who is in the market for a great (albeit expensive) toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I went to a store to compare both the 5000 and this one and the 5000 seemed to weigh far to much for me to</li>
            <li> It is a bit intense until you get used to it, but in just 4 weeks my gums are far healthier and no longer bleeding when I floss.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great but expensive.</li>
            <li> Still so,e brushing capacity but reduced to begin with , but hardly worth it with the cost of the possible hearing loss.  </li>
            <li> and she said this was normal.  </li>
            <li> she said it was just for marketing purpose photograph and that the gap is normal.  </li>
            <li> To switch from the Normal mode to the Gum Care mode, I have to put toothpaste on the brush, put it in my mouth, and then hit the button 4 times.  </li>
            <li> This brush gives me that fresh mouth feeling I could only get from the dentist before...</li>
            <li> 2 minutes of brushing your teeth normally then 30 seconds of polishing your front teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit is worth the expense, dental work is overpriced, as you know; this solves that headache in the future by fighting it in the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would have liked 2 of the regular brush heads instead of one regular and one smaller.</li>
            <li> - I just thought the feeling I had after brushing was normal.  </li>
            <li> But this toothbrush is absolutely worth it: after I brushed with the Diamondclean, I felt like I&#x27;d had my teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never using a normal toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> We are purchasing a few more for Holiday gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure some of it is redundant</li>
            <li> B009PIJV1W Crest 3d White Arctic Fresh Rinse 32 Fl Oz]</li>
            <li> Had it for a few years now... Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the small head on this brush, it makes cleaning your molars much easier.</li>
            <li> but you get what you pay for, and to keep the battery in its tip top shape always charge it everyday.</li>
            <li> a normal charge lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> I have used the ORAL-B units for at least 15 years and was pretty satisfied with them (each lasted about 5 years), though I did find that sometimes there was still some food at my gum line when finished.  </li>
            <li> Overall, worth the money.</li>
            <li> was able to feel the difference within few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery is listed as a three week duration, assuming normal use.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I would much prefer to have the mode switch as a separate button from the on/off as it can make things a bit messy!</li>
            <li> It is not cheap but it works better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use normal toothbrush anymore</li>
            <li> so perhaps it&#x27;s worth the occasional mishap.  </li>
            <li> Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes have come a long way and this toothbrush actually looks sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li> I normally stay between \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;White\\&quot;, anyways.</li>
            <li> If you have extra cash go head and pick this up, it&#x27;s worth it, but it&#x27;s not an impulse buy.</li>
            <li> I was so worried about regretting this purchase but after a few years, I still feel confident about this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it dries just as quickly as a normal toothbrush...  </li>
            <li> - it comes with a USB charger (as well as the USB adapter to plug into a normal outlet).  </li>
            <li> you open the box the first impression is how sleek and modern it is .</li>
            <li> Only downside is it&#x27;s pricy, but if it lasts, then it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Would have been nice to at least have a place to store the cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would have been nice to at least have a place to store the cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are different settings, and if you are sensitive, there is an option to ease into the full power for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I do not think it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> now it basically a normal toothbrush for me now....</li>
            <li> I got it to help do a better job of brushing my developmentally disabled daughter&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> When you figure the costs if you use generic brush heads it is not much more than it would cost to buy a good toothbrush every three months.</li>
            <li> This is very expensive, but I have to honestly say I love it.  </li>
            <li> I brush with the Sonicare twice daily on the whitening cycle, and that gives me 8 days worth of brushing.</li>
            <li> When I put normal pressure on it to brush, it has no power.</li>
            <li> After much research online I decided this would be the best toothbrush for me and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> And the charging method is also fancy enough for people who like pretty, modern design.</li>
            <li> I just thought that it was normal.  </li>
            <li> well after my last Oral b triumph stopped working after I dropped it, I decided try someting else, there are not many options -- Oral B or Philips, after few days of search I bought a HX9332-- the retail vision not the one in the white box, however after I opened the box I found on the brush handel it says HX9340(a Canadian vision？） after first few days of  use, I really liked it, the handel feels good even better than my old Triumph,  </li>
            <li> Minor aggravations include the tiny brush head, which is OK for cleaning around one&#x27;s teeth but makes &amp;</li>
            <li> I must say, from the vert first use, my teeth felt much cleaner than with regular brushing or with any old-fashioned electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> used many different electric brushes and this by far wins hands down.  </li>
            <li> anti bacterial construction, after 3 years of daily use it still looks new, the battery is great too it lasts for weeks and even after the low battery warning you can still go a few days</li>
            <li> This model has multiple charging options which I first thought was kind of unnecessary, however, I decided I like it; especially the option to charge using a computer - so easy when travelling.  </li>
            <li> My sister-in-law has the Sonicare and described it as giving your teeth \\&quot;a whole other level of clean...</li>
            <li> The very small brushhead manages to get around my 4 wisdom theeth very easily and cleans very well in between teeth.</li>
            <li> I expected problems adjusting to the vibrations such as I had experienced before with other purchases, but to my amazement, the brushing was smooth as silk and quieter than expected.  </li>
            <li> If I manually push it the other way it is fine.</li>
            <li> My old one used to have a setting for that, but not the new modern one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased a new one myself after the first one died, because it was just barely out of warranty.</li>
            <li> Power button has a deeply curved design that is easy to use (no fumbling with finding and properly pressing a button to get the brush to turn off)&lt;br /&gt;+ Three-week use period before charging is needed</li>
            <li> Power button has a deeply curved design that is easy to use (no fumbling with finding and properly pressing a button to get the brush to turn off)  + Three-week use period before charging is needed  +</li>
            <li> Has a much more vigorous brushing action than previous models I have used.</li>
            <li> Several things that I like about this brush are that it is quiet and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are easy to find at various local stores.</li>
            <li> Smooth n powerful, i find myself brushing longer than with any other brush incl standard Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is single issue or not, but Philips service is excellent that I got a new one when I reported to the Philips service center.</li>
            <li> The only solution is to count the number of times you press the button while the toothbrush is in your mouth and hope that you guessed right.</li>
            <li> The inductive charging system within the rinsing glass is very effective, although the cord is a bit bulky and may be difficult to leave plugged in at all times.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it it so much that I look forward to brushing my teeth everyday!!!</li>
            <li> Feel clean and refreshed all day long, like a professional cleaning (xcept u r not going to gag becuz</li>
            <li> When the second shipping arrived and showed the same problem, I put it away from the metal cabinet and it charged fine.  </li>
            <li> the outer body has cracked from the small rectangular hole in the threads at the top of the main body, so of course the vibration noise has increased.  </li>
            <li> the overall clean feeling is roughly the same, although the new diamond clean system has a much cleaner design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how all the different settings brush differently, but the brush looks great and does its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small head makes it easy to clean teeth in the back of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Other than the snafu with the travel case, it does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my first electronic toothbrush, and I have to admit that it&#x27;s far much better than common plastic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush a little over two weeks ago and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much different from my old model (flexcare), but the battery pretty much died so I needed to make a new purchase.     </li>
            <li> , I had two, one died and I needed to buy a new one</li>
            <li> But, to my surprise, I was connected immediately to a live rep without having to navigate through 10 minutes of prompts and press this and press that.  </li>
            <li> The charger is that new type where you just drop it in the provided charging glass and it charges by electrical conductance or something.</li>
            <li> so I replaced it at home with the new DiamondClean model.  </li>
            <li> I now know that even when new the Oral-B was infinitely inferior to the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was the charging unit and we were sent a new one at no cost immediately.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s something I can live with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found with this new design</li>
            <li> Whoever designed it must have one bathroom per family member - or live alone.</li>
            <li> it was time for a new one</li>
            <li> My hope now is that my gums will get happier now that I have my new Diamond</li>
            <li> All that was offered was 15% off new unit.</li>
            <li> I think Philips engineers their toothbrushes to breakdown in around 2 years when the warranty expires, which forces the user to upgrade and/or buy a brand new</li>
            <li> Amazon is sending a new unit now....</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I did not rate this five stars is the price of new heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m concerned w/ this new model the handle case would crack if it were dropped.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the new one lasts as it does not get</li>
            <li> (The new one is noisy too.)</li>
            <li> There is nothing that you can do except to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of the new design for the DiamondClean, I don&#x27;t like the cup charger, because it collects water after using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> After using an electric brush for years the experience of the new Phillips Sonicare was a revelation.</li>
            <li> If customer delight is what you seek, and you need a new electric toothbrush.....</li>
            <li> What was neat was it came with a new brush head also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are contacting Philips to see if they will send us new brushes, so we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> You can visibly feeling the change when you select a new setting.  </li>
            <li> Like the fact that it has the strip on the brush head to indicate when it is time to change to a new head.</li>
            <li> , They also advised I try a new brush head (additional expense) which I have done and it did not resolve the problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A friend told me about the new version, and noted that the travel case was also a charger, powered  through a mini-USB port.</li>
            <li> , Philips customer support refused to fix it or send me a new one.</li>
            <li> Ordered a new handle from Phillips-</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m using my new product without issue</li>
            <li> I have purchased new brush heads to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I went to buy a new Sonicare.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Somewhere along the line, I read that this new model will hold a charge for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I called to get a replacement and after a 20 minute wait and conversation, they agreed to send me a new handle.  </li>
            <li> No way to disassemble and fix means I have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> This new model has a change in design.</li>
            <li> Also the new brushes while giving an excetional cleaning do wear out a bit quicker.</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a new toothbrush</li>
            <li> The regular type is so good, it is hard to improve on.</li>
            <li> The representative was fantastic, walked through several possible fixes and in the end they are sending us a new handle.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a huge deal especially if you use the same setting every time (though that kinda defeats the purpose of the selection).</li>
            <li> After brushing with this DiamondClean, my teeth feel as clean as they do after a polishing at the dentist&#x27;s office minus the grit from the paste they use.</li>
            <li> I purchased a cheap imitation once</li>
            <li> Whiter teeth in a week, less gum problems, easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really explored the multiple modes, but hey.. it looks sleek and modern on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> There is room for two extra brush heads that fit snugly into their designated areas and space for the toothbrush handle next to that.</li>
            <li> Overall I really enjoy the toothbrush, and I am expecting my next dental appointment to support this feeling.</li>
            <li> It works much better than I expected and actually saves me time brushing.  </li>
            <li> the supervisor gave me no tracking number which was suppose to be given to me 7-8 business days back and mentioned to follow back on Monday when the updated shipping detail will be available.</li>
            <li> When I called Phillips, they had a smart-mouth call me back and tried to make me think he was doing me a big favor by returning the product in the 30 day free return policy.</li>
            <li> I would have probably been better off buying a less expensive model as it would have done just as good of a job.</li>
            <li> The charging glass is simple enough to fit into any bathroom setting.</li>
            <li> The glass charger seems kind of silly; it&#x27;s just as easy to put the brush on a plastic stand, and I&#x27;m worried about knocking the glass (which will definitely break) over on the granite counter in bathroom.</li>
            <li> I liked having a few extra seconds to swipe around my mouth just in case.</li>
            <li> I liked having a few extra seconds to swipe around my mouth just in case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the charge last for about 4-5 days with regular use before you get the blinking orange light which means</li>
            <li> This model offers an upgrade over older models in that it does not let any liquids (water, toothpaste, spit) into the handle or under the brush head attachment.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon and thanks to those of you leaving feed back</li>
            <li> I knew I had deep pockets and while pregnant I could barely tolerate keeping up with my normal regimen of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> love the little heads!  </li>
            <li> Not only it is better than other toothbrushes, but it teaches you to actually dedicate the right time to brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> The reason for this is that my gums have a tendency to bleed, and I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> As a result, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the brush action that does such a great job or the sheer speed.  </li>
            <li> To put it simply, my mouth has never in my life felt this clean, and I will never, ever go back to normal tooth brushes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I just personally wanted something a little more powerfull, less bulky, and more</li>
            <li> When i pointed out that they had an obligation to take back faulty products that they have sold within the first 12 months, they relented and sent me a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> But this is their second new dental product in a row--the first being the AirFloss--that might lead you to think that Sonicare design was now being done by Apple.</li>
            <li> The center bristles are the special part of this brush head.</li>
            <li> We have resorted to using a normal manual toothbrush while we figure out what to buy to replace the broken DiamondClean handles, especially since our finances are not in the best place due to medical bills, and lets be honest, the Sonicare Toothbrushes are not cheap.</li>

            <li> Just like the professional cleaning or a little better as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> particular model has multiple settings: Clean; White; Polish; Gum Care and Sensitive.</li>
            <li> I made a huge mess while brushing my teeth when I don&#x27;t normally.  </li>
            <li> The exact same thing happened to me that happened to \\&quot;Organic</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> My first ten years of power brushing was with Oral B products (I&#x27;ve owned two of their models).</li>
            <li> In fact, I sent the first Diamondclean back to Amazon, thinking the battery was defective.</li>
            <li> I have only had the toothbrush for a few days now, but have been enjoying it very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No excessive button pressing.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I used the smaller one first</li>
            <li> is my first and clearly my last Phillips brush purchase.</li>
            <li> , as soon as I was finished - wow!</li>
            <li> This is my first sonicare that I bought after my Oral B died after about ten years.</li>
            <li> If you happen to want to turn the brush off in the first 5-10 seconds after you start brushing, you run into the same problem.  </li>
            <li> I admit to being a complete gadget freak!</li>
            <li> much improvement and no regrets</li>
            <li> the very same day- before I even returned the first one.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted for over 5 years and was only replaced because the rubber was worn.  </li>
            <li> The one button design to switch between different brushing techniques would not be my first choice, but I dealt with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is nearly gone!  </li>
            <li> Small thing but cute.  </li>
            <li> You can feel the difference after the first use, especially coming from a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The cost for this specific unit is higher than I might have considered if I had not been using this brand and style of toothbrush for almost 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> normally so if I could have found my old one still, I would have reordered that.</li>
            <li> I generally avoid rechargeable appliances for this very reason</li>
            <li> Aside from Bill Murray, I&#x27;m not sure many of us do.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Brushes very well, all the setting are different and useful, if I had a choice I would make the head a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have been using sonicares for the past 9 years, and my teeth have never been in better shape.</li>
            <li> The 2nd button would select the mode and the first button would turn it on.</li>
            <li> After only the first use, I understood why they had all switched.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare toothbrush, bought years ago, was designed to last, with rubber on the housing to absorb the shock of a fall.  </li>
            <li> first issue is that the USB recharging case doesn&#x27;t actually recharge the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Last night, I was awoken from a peaceful slumber by the dang toothbrush vibrating by itself in the bathroom...</li>
            <li> purchased this higher priced model for the travel case, I think some of the models below this one would do about the same with brushing.&lt;br /&gt;livefree</li>
            <li> this is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever used that actually leaves food between my teeth when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed an extreme difference in the health of my gums and my teeth appear more white.</li>
            <li> I just had my first check up after 6 months of using this device and my teeth have improved immensely.</li>
            <li> Either way Philips should know better/have a higher standard.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I do like all the settings (wow, it can do everything)!</li>
            <li> (Also UPS has better tracking options) but other than that I have no problems with this supplier and will be continuously doing business with this supplier in the future.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d look forward to brushing my teeth, but WOW!</li>
            <li> At the exact same time (about 1 year)</li>
            <li> Having bought Philips Sonicare electric toothbrushes in the past,  I was confident in the product line.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve only been using it for just under two weeks), but there was a noticeable difference in the first week.  </li>
            <li> Speaking of, my last two (top of the line when purchased) brushes both came with UV sanitizers but that &amp;#34;option&amp;#34; seems to be left to lesser brushes at this</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is several inches taller than the cup, making the whole thing wobbly and top heavy.  </li>
            <li> , the improvement over using a manual toothbrush is minimal if you set a timer and do a full two minutes with the manual.  </li>
            <li> The new diamond care bristles on the brush seem to genuinely make a difference over previous models.  </li>
            <li> - The battery life has not yet made it to 3 weeks for me, simply only 1.5 weeks (on standard clean twice a day)    </li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush a few weeks ago and even upgrading from my older Sonicare, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.      </li>
            <li> but with several options: clean, white, polish.</li>
            <li> On Clean, it brushes for 2 minutes (30 seconds front and back, upper and lower).  </li>
            <li> B0086VIA3O Diamond Clean Standard Replacement]] and the InterCare Standard Replacement Brushes.  </li>
            <li> short, I simply can&#x27;t believe how clean my mouth feels after each use.</li>
            <li> I only use the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; setting, so if you just want to clean your teeth, you can buy a cheaper Sonicare brush that doesn&#x27;t have the extra settings.</li>
            <li> I have never felt a clean feeling such as this one, besides a regular dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> Because it has only one button and a relatively unbroken, uniform surface, it is easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li> look forward to trying some additional whitening strips as I now feel my brush can finally keep my teeth clean and white.</li>
            <li> Much easier to keep clean, not as heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that my toothbrush isn&#x27;t working one year and ten days after I bought it, but I chatted with Aaron at Philips Sonicare last night and he&#x27;s going to send me a new one.</li>
            <li> Once you turn the brush on and let it run for 5-10 seconds (which is about the amount of time it takes me to clean off after using it), the singular button WILL in fact turn off the brush rather than having to cycle through the other modes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other electric tooth brushes and none made my teeth feel this clean.  </li>
            <li> I grew up without dental care and thankfully the military has been able to provide me with some much needed maintenance over the years, but I&#x27;ve still struggled with an occasional cavity here and there no matter how often I brushed or flossed.  </li>
            <li> Use this daily along with the wife and we both love how well of a job this cleans our teeth compared to a conventional tooth brush.</li>
            <li> My old unit, one of the original larger heavier ones, finally stopped holding a charge at all.  </li>
            <li> naturally I got the new one since it can be charged on 110v-220v through a wall or usb in the case or out of the case.</li>
            <li> and I knew I would replace the old SoniCare with a new one from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No problems so far, working just as new.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sending me a new one by FedEx and are including a label to send the old one back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money - if I could get a refund, I would buy a new OralB.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be fooled by little, good to nothing ads on, the same glass could be bought from other stores at much cheaper price and the support doesn&#x27;t keep your sink cleaner</li>
            <li> After tens of thousands spent on fillings, re-fillings, around 15 root canals and crowns, several re-canals and re-caps, and a couple of extractions, my new dentist strongly suggested I switch from manual brushing to a Sonicare and gave me a $10 store coupon.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing toothbrush to use-I&#x27;ve only used it for the past 3 days, but I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> it also comes with a small clear disc which has a diameter of 2.75 inches which is much more streamlined.</li>
            <li> He could not tell me why Philips doesn&#x27;t provide a stand for the black model, he just confirmed that they don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I debated on brands and did all the normal research, which merely indicated they were almost the same, but finally I decided, why switch, the first one worked for a decade, if this one just works 5-6 years I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> the highest model!This is less nosier than O and feel so comfortable.</li>
            <li> If you are a heavy brusher this will help you go easy on your gums.</li>
            <li> I switched because although my first Oral B took many years before the battery stopped recharging, the second one I bought only lasted less than 3 years, which made me want to switch.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but I probably will not use the small one and for the price it would be great to have 2 heads.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but I probably will not use the small one and for the price it would be great to have 2 heads.</li>
            <li> The small brush is not as effective as the larger one that I have been using.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Phillips, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is almost equal in cleaning power to my dentist&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I used my first Sonicare toothbrush for nearly a decade before it finally stopped working.</li>
            <li> But, not bad enough for me to send it back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a fairly expensive option compared to many of the other electric toothbrushes available, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The pressets are easy to understand and the whole product has a quality that is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> the new handle is very cool, slick design, even slicker charging options, but did Sonicare have to remove features to do this?  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> charging system is very simple and designed for convenience; it fits easily on my bathroom vanity (in a bathroom the size of a tiny walk-in closet, mind you), and the travel unit is great, despite the fact that I travel very little - I like the compact for storing pieces I want to keep out of the way, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also of note; for people with small mouths (like me): this compact head truly is compact!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re much cheaper just w/o the glass, otherwise exactly the same and same warranty.</li>
            <li> All I need to bring is an appropriate USB cable (I use only that is only 6\\&quot; long instead of the supplied one).  </li>
            <li> So far, my teeth feel so slick and glassy, and my breath minty fresh, that two minutes is worth it.  </li>
            <li> like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-It comes with two heads, one is the compact diamond brush and the other is the full size.</li>
            <li> A whole new brushing experiance and leaves your mouth feeling amazinly different than using a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t order a new Sonicare fast enough!  </li>
            <li> Was worried because of some negative reviews regarding switching brushing modes, but found it to be rather straight forward and easy.</li>
            <li> I was following the instructions in the paperwork included with the brush, but I found something online that said also to tilt the tip of the brush toward the teeth slightly, if you encountered this, to enable the bristles to reach between teeth better.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the FlexCare, it has a slightly thicker diameter but is overall a bit more ergonomic.</li>
            <li> The pink one I purchased as a gift did not have the plastic stand, which is nice because it takes up less counter space.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to my next dentist appointment to see if they agree at what an extraordinary job this toothbrush does cleaning my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily the stuff is simple enough...</li>
            <li> particular product arrived just in time for Christmas as my older unit was on its last legs.</li>
            <li> While my teeth certainly feel clean, I&#x27;m not sure my gums are getting the coverage they had with the Braun.</li>
            <li> I understand it is a lot of money to throw down on a toothbrush, but I can assure you that it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Apparently there is no difference in charging power, so I assume the difference is mainly a matter of aesthetics.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get the DiamondClean as a gift, since my FlexCare model had died recently (prematurely--disappointed about that), but it didn&#x27;t take long to fade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Hygienic Travel Cap&amp;#34; is a clear plastic cap engineered to fit tightly around the bristle end.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Hygienic Travel Cap&amp;#34; is a clear plastic cap engineered to fit tightly around the bristle end.</li>
            <li> Only problems though are that it does have to align a certain way</li>
            <li> so you just need to rotate it a certain way and remember that&#x27;s how you left it.</li>
            <li> To find out which of the programs you&#x27;ve selected, you have to read the little words on the handle that light up.  </li>
            <li> I do say that $220 full price for this toothbrush is a bit ridiculous, but amazon price is a little more reasonable.</li>
            <li> This makes me believe that the toothbrush is designed to last a little more than a year (warranty time), which is highly unreasonable for such a high cost.  </li>
            <li> I guess U.K. call centers are less user friendly than the USA.  </li>
            <li> Using the brush wasn&#x27;t hard it was mostly charged</li>
            <li> Hardly any need for the scaler tool at my check up and my gums are in better condition as well.</li>
            <li> This one is hard to give appropriate stars for.</li>
            <li> I expect a very high grade for brushing the next time I get a cleaning, too.  </li>
            <li> even my two years old Triumph can still gives a little more two weeks of brush after a fully charge,it gives me 7 days on the second charge,  </li>
            <li> Luckily my brush is on the other side of the sink from the outlet, but if you had it near the outlet you would have this bundle of wire in the way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Handles a wide range of Philips brush heads, including the diamond clean, sensitive, deep clean, and other models</li>
            <li> The brush head is small and easy to maneuver in tight places (I do not know why they make so many toothbrushes as big as push brooms!)</li>
            <li> even though this is CLEARLY their design issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for nothing, Philips Sonicare...</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be clear on the *function* though: The thing works well as do the others in the Sonicare line-up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be clear on the *function* though: The thing works well as do the others in the Sonicare line-up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really eager for my next appointment in Spring 2012 to see if my anecdotal impressions are borne out by a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> I calmly explained to them that my Father-In-Law was NOT A TIME TRAVELER and he had not somehow traveled into the future, bought their Sonicare DiamondClean, and then traveled back in time 18 months before release of the DiamondClean.  </li>
            <li> The way it works is like this: after one choses the mode one wants to use -- by pushing the button to cycle among the various modes (i.e., Sensitive, Whitening, Cleaning, Gum Care) -- the DiamondCare operates in that mode for the completion of the cycle.  </li>
            <li> This cleans you teeth very well, but I did not notice it DOES NOT take the same brush heads as my old one.  </li>
            <li> The charger is a clear glass with a plug.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel exceptionally clean and polished in comparison to my previous Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Each of them performed great and lasted about 7-8 years before the battery finally started to fail.    </li>
            <li> Toothpaste and water always managed to get in over time and it was an annoyance to clear.</li>
            <li> The manual clearly states that the brushing cycles are divided into four parts (one for each quarter of your mouth).</li>
            <li> The manual clearly states that the brushing cycles are divided into four parts (one for each quarter of your mouth).</li>
            <li> From the beginning, I have felt that this toothbrush didn&#x27;t clean as well as previous models; however, I second-guessed myself thinking &amp;</li>
            <li> Like the options to hold the brush and the fact you can charge from the clear stand, glass, or in compact carrying</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s far too much to pay for a toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t last, and that has a built-in battery</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had problems with old electric toothbrushes not lasting the whole trip and</li>
            <li> but the charging / storage system for use with the toothbrush in the bathroom is COMPLETELY WACK.  </li>
            <li> If you think you might have a cavity, start of gum disease, or sensitive teeth, start out by using the sensitive setting.  </li>
            <li> review applies to the Dental Professional Model - NOT this</li>
            <li> They said because I bought the Dental Professional</li>
            <li> The old one lasted  5+ years.</li>
            <li> Naturally, the handset is completely sealed with no non.destructive way to change the battery.</li>
            <li> so it has a natural tendency to escape your grip.</li>
            <li> When I read on the box that the toothbrush could be charged by placing it in the glass (which also functions very well as a glass to hold water to rinse your mouth out with), I stepped back for a moment, thinking I had entered the twilight zone!</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t make direct contact with the charger.</li>
            <li> Again, the brush is not in direct contact with the charger.</li>
            <li> Except for Sensitive mode, the difference is the amount of time the brush stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery lasts, well, not quite forever, but nearly.</li>
            <li> The brushing action created an immediate sensation throughout my mouth</li>
            <li> And my teeth felt cleaner than if I had just been in for a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> So far no complaints.</li>
            <li> I like the product so far.  </li>
            <li> my teeth feel like they have had a professional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;had to learn the controls,  </li>
            <li> The design of the charger is inelegant (it looks ready to tip over any second) but serviceable.</li>
            <li> did that for a while until the battery finally completely died in it.</li>
            <li> gum care and sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been nearly a month</li>
            <li> old daughter</li>
            <li> It is very sleek and the handle is all white.  </li>
            <li> Quite aggravating after spending nearly 200 dollars.</li>
            <li> so I went to the dentist to get it fixed and afterwards, resolved to try a hardcore toothbrush to see if that would make a difference.</li>
            <li> There are also two additional modes that the toothbrush offers.</li>
            <li> In changing the design from two-buttons to one, they went too far.  </li>
            <li> For years I have debated whether or not to get an electric toothbrush, but I was pleasantly surprised with this one.    </li>
            <li> &#x27;just had a professional dental cleaning&#x27; feel in my mouth.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush successfully complete it&#x27;s intended duties?</li>
            <li> I had to start on the &#x27;training wheels&#x27; setting otherwise known as sensitive.</li>
            <li> This really is the total package.</li>
            <li> The timer helps you ensure that you are spending enough time brushing in each area of your moyth, and the fast movements feel like you are giving your mouth a massage.  </li>
            <li> The vibration of the toothbrush gave my mouth a strange feeling at first that I wasn&#x27;t used to, almost like a tickling but after a handful of times I got used to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for nearly $200 and it worked well for around 12 months.  </li>
            <li> the difference between these two models is pretty minor</li>
            <li> I value design a lot, as far as functionality goes</li>
            <li> Even so, they refused to give him a replacement without the receipt/proof of purchase and it took me escalating it to darn near the CEO to get his replaced.  </li>
            <li> You can use the heads from the Pro Results line as well as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an upgrade from my old Sonicare model.</li>
            <li> No complaints at all so far.</li>
            <li> Storing it in a glass with an inductive charging system is brilliant...easy access, and frankly i don&#x27;t really know if the big cleaning device for</li>
            <li> She noted that they were brighter, and said they looked to be much cleaner than our last visit.</li>
            <li> Everything was packed as it should in a soft box case and everything in separate plastic bags.</li>
            <li> , else I wouldn&#x27;t have these old mercury filling these days.</li>
            <li> (this happens about once a week so far).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost completely stopped the plaque build-up</li>
            <li> I miss my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Marked improvement over the cheaper models.</li>
            <li> My smile was noticeably brighter/whiter after only 1-2 weeks of daily use and it feels like I got a professional cleaning after each use.</li>
            <li> My husband and I share this one, and we only need to charge it every 1.5 wks or so, which is very convenient.</li>
            <li> But I ended up giving it to my sister and reordering one like my old one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that she knows she loves, and I have one like my old BraunOral-B on its way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but then how would they be able to overcharge you for the replacements, duh.</li>
            <li> After years of various Sonic electric toothbrushes that lasted much longer (we kept upgrading for lighter models), he&#x27;s just ordered Oral Bs for both of us through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The function is really the same</li>
            <li> There are many hi-tech ways to recharge it, including this one way of putting it in this glass cup they provide, but it is a bit confusing to master.</li>
            <li> The vibration in my mouth was almost too intense and you can&#x27;t brush with you mouth partially open</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to work with the manufacturer to get it fixed, and its been about a month</li>
            <li> The only gentle setting is the &amp;#34;sanitize&amp;#34; setting.</li>
            <li> but there is a sensitive setting to help you get used to it.</li>
            <li> This product cleans, polishes, and whitens your teeth with additional cycles for gum care and sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> In fact it is quieter than the old model that we replaced.  </li>
            <li> It minimize professional cleaning by your dentist to once every two years instead of once every 6 month.</li>
            <li> is that it&#x27;s not intuitive to switch between functions (cleaning, polishing, sensitive, etc.).</li>
            <li> I called the warranty personnel, she was really fast and gave me a reference number for my replacement handle and instruct me to call back within 2-3 business days to receive my tracking number.</li>
            <li> Works reasonably well, but my dental hygienist tells me that my teeth aren&#x27;t any cleaner than when I was using a standard manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I share one and burned out one that was 5 years old.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my existing Sonicare tooth brush, my old one after 5 years it wouldn&#x27;t hold charge.</li>
            <li> But the real proof will be if the office notices on my next visit.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like they are professionally cleaned with every use.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t always make the complete 2 minute mark though.</li>
            <li> Wow, this product is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this happened unexpectedly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that they really have a different brushing style but</li>
            <li> Before purchasing Diamondclean, I thought the performance for both of the models  should be quite similar and didn&#x27;t expect much an \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> As a dental professional I have been using Sonicare for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t use them because they are hogwash (except maybe the sensitive mode).</li>
            <li> The brush-head was tiny, it was loud, the battery didn&#x27;t last more than 3-4 days, and I never really felt that ultra-clean like I did with the Flexcare.  </li>
            <li> My old one (A $60 dollar DazzlePro) burned out after about a year or so.  </li>
            <li> If you ask me almost $100 a year for a toothbrush is a complete scam.</li>
            <li> In early 2014 the shaft for the brush didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare died after 5 years</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the product is for Dental Professional Trial</li>
            <li> So, it isn&#x27;t possible to set it correctly to the brushing mode that you want when you are ready to start brushing.</li>
            <li> Another complete design failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are far cleaner and whiter</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would have appreciated a visual context to the comments</li>
            <li> I travel a lot for a living and it occurred to me that much of the time I was using a regular toothbrush, while my trusty electric stayed at home, not being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 5 year old Oral B electric brush died and for 6 months I used the hand brush.</li>
            <li> As days went by the pulsing action got weaker and weaker.  </li>
            <li> When my mouth is a bit irritated from the braces, I have the option of using sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It is heard to explain the technology - but in action, you just position the brush along the gum line and the bristles insert themselves between teeth.</li>
            <li> Plus, the charge lasts at least a week - perhaps more.</li>
            <li> All of that to say, this is a considerable upgrade.</li>
            <li> The product offers a two year warranty.</li>
            <li> old sonicare brush lasted for years.</li>
            <li> then my old sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li> I used a manual brush for a couple of days (disassembled the oral b early without thinking) and my teeth felt &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> However I picked it, I like it thus far,</li>
            <li> However I picked it, I like it thus far,</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s just my toothbrush vibrating extremely loudly on the porcelain counter in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> you already know how much cleaner you feel than when you wash your face without; if you don&#x27;t, I can only tell you that the difference is worlds apart.</li>
            <li> I had a periodontist&#x27;s nightmare as far as my teeth were concerned.</li>
            <li> I have only tried one or two of the settings, but the ones I have work very well.</li>
            <li> That, for a $220 unit, 5 months old.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have my first Sonicare electric toothbrush, I don&#x27;t know why it has taken so long to acquire a Sonicare electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I went from Sonicare to Oral as my old one broke, and Oral care brand just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me, so I found this beauty, and again , you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s prices</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> After a number of years, the old Sonicare was showing signs of wear, although it was still working well.</li>
            <li> I also suffered from teeth sensitivity which has gone away completely since switching to this brush.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of the Oral-B Professional Care by BRAUN Rechargeable Toothbrush SmartSeries 5000 for a while.</li>
            <li> It has replaced the old brush.  </li>
            <li> after using this, my teeth felt like i had a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I know it sounds like a commercial, but they really work.  </li>
            <li> I like it a lot so far.  </li>
            <li> But when I tried this one, it simply gets my teeth so much cleaner than I could ever get them before, and without the abrasive scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> Completely stopped working after 6 months.</li>
            <li> Purchased product via Sonicare website directly.  </li>
            <li> My old Sonicare just died after about 6 years, I think...</li>
            <li> They should last much longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Teeth feel as though professionally cleaned each time you use it.  </li>
            <li> I am a bit old school and read directions about how things works and don&#x27;t want to go online all day.</li>
            <li> Would have saved me a fortune in professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> Wow, sonic is an understatement.  </li>
            <li> I ORDERED ALSO THE ULTRA SENSITIVE BRUSH HEADS 3 IN A PACK TO GO ALONG WITH IT FOR MY NEEDS.</li>
            <li> SO FAR.</li>
            <li> the feel the built quanlity and the floss action brush head are the reasons,</li>
            <li> Feels like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned every time I use it.</li>
            <li> my work backpack already weighs nearly 30 lbs</li>
            <li> The old one must have been 20-years old so I upgrade to the DiamondClean.  </li>
            <li> Set Came complete and on time.</li>
            <li> so I finally decided to take the plunge and figured if I was going to invest that much in a toothbrush</li>
            <li> - now I have to keep the old charger setup as well since it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip issue and power button are why I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars</li>
            <li> I threw my old oralb immediately.......</li>
            <li> The charge is supposed to be for 3 weeks, but so far has lasted me a month.</li>
            <li> Before using it I was never a believer that an electric tooth brush makes much difference as oppose to a regular one.</li>
            <li> I heard that proper gum massage can really improve the issue, which is why I got this brush.</li>
            <li> it is too early to tell and</li>
            <li> I have actually gotten compliments and am greeted with surprise every time I smile because my teeth were noticeably yellow before</li>
            <li> I think I initially received a lemon since the charge never lasted more than a few days.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this item it was not available in most local oulets.  </li>
            <li> Simple enough-- turn the brush on again for a fresh two minutes.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most expensive toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever bought, but I think it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li> In addition to being beneficial and useful to the user, the toothbrush offered features that will no doubt be standard on future models.</li>
            <li> If you care anything about your smile or if you have spent a fortune on your dental care like I have, this item is a must.  </li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t want to waste money on a product that wasn&#x27;t truly worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Are those two features worth paying double for a basic Sonicare?</li>
            <li> Good produck but so expensive...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t always charge, and the brush base has to be in the perfect position for it to charge.</li>
            <li> the base was flawless in the thailand brush.</li>
            <li> Although it was expensive, I think this toothbrush was a good buy.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is expensive but does a good job.  </li>
            <li> When I actually received the product, I was really delighted by what was promoted as a feature to &amp;#34;ease in&amp;#34; to the vibration by starting at a lower level and then slowly increasing over the course of 14 days.</li>
            <li> is that most of my sonicare updates have been forced.  </li>
            <li> It is a good toothbrush, but for the money, it is quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have never had good luck with the \\&quot;refurbished\\&quot; product sent after a product fails.</li>
            <li> me just break something down for anyone who is trying to decide between this and a comparable Oral B brush: They will both remove plaque if you use them correctly, for the full two minutes twice per day.</li>
            <li> Years ago my Mom bought electric toothbrushes for my entire family on the theory that jaw-rattling fire hazards must be better for your teeth than plain old .99 cent drugstore brushes.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re not done brushing, just press the start button again, and it picks right back up where it left off.  </li>
            <li> I explained I have been a lifelong Philips customer, and my family still has 4 old Sonicare models that have lasted me 8+ years without issues, and that a sub 3yr shelf life for their &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; almost $200 toothbrush doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li> I looked carefully at all the Sonicare models, which I think are confusing as to which is best to pick, and in the end chose the DiamondClean due to the nicer looking charging cradle and the smaller size</li>
            <li> I tended to get harder bristled standard toothbrushes and really scour my teeth to try to get them as clean as possible,</li>
            <li> I was barely covered by the warranty, and will receive a new handle.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the battery does last a week without a charge, so the inability to recharge on the road wasn&#x27;t a huge issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quick review of the &#x27;clean&#x27; setting:Thirty second intervals update you on what side of your mouth needs to be glorified, after a two minute adventure you are left with a feel that only a doctor&#x27;s office can attain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; However, after reading all the specifications and asking around about other products and checking out what was available in local stores, I took the plunge and ordered one.</li>
            <li> Not true, as long as it runs for more than 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> As for the price, yes it&#x27;s a little bit high but worth</li>
            <li> Her&#x27;s will turn on and vibrate a little, but it doesn&#x27;t clean teeth.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time trying to figure out whether to get the diamond clean or stay with my &#x27;regular&#x27; Sonicare.</li>
            <li> brush has a few settings depending on your mouth clean , polish , whitening , sensitive and gum</li>
            <li> /&gt;This seems to be a vast improvement of the older Sonicare Elite that I have used for years, It is noisier than my old one</li>
            <li> A quick shake of the head should make it dry enough</li>
            <li> I don’t know that any of the other modes are even worth having.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare was getting old and the battery would not hold a charge for more than a couple of uses which made it difficult on a trip.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, my original Sonicare toothbrush died.  </li>
            <li> The tumbler glass is very thick, it&#x27;s very easy to charge, and the interval alerts are helpful.</li>
            <li> A nice touch is the default initial setting that, over the course of the first 14 operations, slowly ramps up the power to acclimate those who have never used this type of brush in developing a comfort with the high frequency vibration feeling (this ramp-up in vibration power can be disabled, as well; check the manual for the two-step process to do so).</li>
            <li> Either is probably a great toothbrush and even the less expensive models are very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I owned a Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean before this one that lasted for a few years.</li>
            <li> My teeth are dentist clean everyday.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works as promised, is packaged wonderfully, and actually makes brushing somewhat less tedious.</li>
            <li> Would rather have been able to simply order a toothbrush equal to previous models.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that my teeth have never been as clean since I began using this brush a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I cannot imagine being without some form of Sonicare for the dentist clean teeth feeling everyday.</li>
            <li> At the highest setting the brushing action is vigorous, just short of being unpleasant, and as a result it seems to be nearly as effective as the Ultrasonex in getting one&#x27;s teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> Quite different from older style &amp;#34;electric toothbrushes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I had an older model of the sonicare toothbrush and desired something similar.  </li>
            <li> This particular model puts the modes and the power on the same button.  </li>
            <li> Bottom is different from their older models.  </li>
            <li> The main reason I purchased this toothbrush is the fact that it has only 1 button for on/off and mode changes-</li>
            <li> Have used the older, larger versions of the Sonicare for years.</li>
            <li> but they were clever enough to foil my plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would say like the older models, you should keep constant contact with your teeth and the brush while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> But I think its the same as the older model with the 2 stage button.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure why it seems to perform so much better than my prior Sonicare</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s even an alternative to the one feature I didn&#x27;t like, which was the charging glass--it looked too big and clunky in photos, which is exactly how it looks when you actually see it.</li>
            <li> My parents started going with electric back when brookstone and sharper image mainly carried them.</li>
            <li> My last brush was an oral b 8000 series (older model) and lasted me for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> Usually you have to go through all the settings to be able to get it to shut off because the shut off button is the same button for the settings.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a charger stand or a cool little glass</li>
            <li> The only downside is the high price.</li>
            <li> At such a high price,  it should not be defectuous that fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s pretty durable, overall, and certainly my mouth is healthier now than it was 3 years ago, with less stains than with the old sonicare.</li>
            <li> And, a supplied USB adapter that plugs into the AC socket (the adapter is also universal voltage, so it works both in North America and Europe, and is much smaller and lighter than the main charger) can also be used to charge the toothbrush while it is in the case (and the USB adapter is supplied, along with a USB cable, in addition to a normal a/c charger.</li>
            <li> The brush handle is light in weight, grips well, and of course if you are new to electric brushes or have a tendency to push to hard, kind of hard for the brush head to move if it is jammed up against your teeth (head still vibrates but bristles don&#x27;t) where as with my oral b I could near brush away my gums if it came to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when my trusty old Sonicare finally broke, I purchased this new one.</li>
            <li> I do like the new one, the case is just flashy but the design is nice.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend attempting to get it replaced before the 2 years is up, as that way you can at least get almost 3 years of use from the original purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend attempting to get it replaced before the 2 years is up, as that way you can at least get almost 3 years of use from the original purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Operation is quite similar to all the previous Philips models, with available \\&quot;cleaning,\\&quot; \\&quot;gum health,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> + Available in white and black  </li>
            <li> No down side.  </li>
            <li> nice sleek design, and improved over previous version because it doesn&#x27;t allow water to enter and get trapped into the assembly.</li>
            <li> is heavy and well made - 4 sided - with proper lip for easy of rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plug could&#x27;ve been a little smaller than it is but its fine.</li>
            <li> As of now we have been two weeks without recharging this thing - we are trying to see how long it will really go.  </li>
            <li> barely two months, my teeth look markedly whiter.</li>
            <li> There is considerable splatter during brushing if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> My last Sonicare did a great job until the internal charging circuit finally failed.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the advanced care for the past year and it was one of the toothbrushes i have used for the longest time.  </li>
            <li> really like the carrying case although I&#x27;m not quite sold on the value of USB (a minor point though as you can still use a wall</li>
            <li> For that, the expensive price suddenly becomes much more worth it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I figured they were full of what it takes to make the grass grow green.  </li>
            <li> She had to do very little picking and scraping as was very complimentary on the condition of my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If there was a prize for the most useless industrial design, the person who came up the Diamondhead mode selector would certainly deserve it.  </li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t seem to offer any other significant features over the FlexCare, other than a nifty USB charging case, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth the extra money for extra frustration.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, there&#x27;s no apparent way to color code your brushhead like the older</li>
            <li> We were able to stomach the initial price and the the holding us hostage for the price of replacement heads, but, the last straw came when we fell victim to a loose screw in the mechanism.  </li>
            <li> I have owned many of the other electric toothbrushes on the market, to include the previous models by this name brand.</li>
            <li> super quiet compared with other electric brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Five minutes later they were sending me a new one and an email confirmation was in my inbox before I even got off the phone with her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After my DiamondClean quit, I claimed the second, brand new unit.  </li>
            <li> All said, next time I need a new toothbrush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only bought new units when Philips had made some substantial changes.</li>
            <li> And when I went in for my cleaning last week, a new hygienist (who had never worked on my teeth) poked around for about 10 seconds and asked, &amp;#34;Do</li>
            <li> I have had an electric toothbrush for years, but this item exceeded my expectations taking a daily chore to a new level.</li>
            <li> One can look through my reviews and I am often a fan of this or that, though I also am not afraid to be honest about a bad product.</li>
            <li> that i have advanced periodontal disease and really need to up my game in home dental care.</li>
            <li> Plus, do we really need to mimic the old, unsanitary practice of standing wet toothbrushes up in a glass to store them?</li>
            <li> My last cleaning took less than 20 minutes because there was nothing to clean.</li>
            <li> After using it for three weeks, I think I could have easily purchased the less expensive model and have been equally satisfied.</li>
            <li> If you want only one program, buy the (much cheaper) brush with only one program; you can still use the &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; heads if you want to.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I recommend this efficient tooth brush to anyone who wants quality with multiple ways to recharge, when necessary.  </li>
            <li> Its powerful enough to keep plaque away, making checkups at the dentist drama-free with minimal effort on my part.</li>
            <li> There is no beep: the brush just pauses briefly which is very confusing--it seems as if you&#x27;ve accidentally turned off the brush for a second.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure this one will last at least 10 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a careless person -- but sometimes a toothbrush falls, especially when I&#x27;ve got to do minor gymnastics every morning just to use it.</li>
            <li> I likley spent too much on this but in the quest to replace my old sonicare this seemed to be the likley successor.</li>
            <li> the charge lasts us 15-20 at least with me and my wife using it (different tips of course :) )</li>
            <li> This is really the top tier toothbrush, as silly as it sounds.  </li>
            <li> The convenience it offers when charging is also incredible as all you do is plop it into the base or put it into the cup and it charges without plugging anything into it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is absolutely the most expensive toothbrush in my life, so is the maintenance of it.</li>
            <li> Sadly the aesthetics is the only the good thing about this device...</li>
            <li> Honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t give a company that has such poor customer service my money again.</li>
            <li> Seems much better than my old HealthyWhite (as far as brushes per minute), but I definitely think the included cup is weird and could get gross very fast.</li>
            <li> And without the hassle of getting a cleaning by someone who might not be very gentle and all the rest of it,like not caring if your jaw is getting tired from holding your mouth open or if the light is shining in your eyes</li>
            <li> I received one as a gift for Christmas and about a year later it got very loud and something rattles inside.  </li>
            <li> in all, I highly recommend the Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush to anyone serious about keeping their teeth and gums in tip-top shape.</li>
            <li> the Diamond Clean cost over the other models would be minor when spread out over the 7-8 year lifespan of the product.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth, gums and mouth in general will rejoice!</li>
            <li> Even though it is possible to maintain a healthy mouth with a manual brush, it is more difficult and, for some people, not possible (due to coordination issues, arthritis, etc.).</li>
            <li> Brushing is such a pleasurable experience with this Sonicare that I actually want to brush more than usual.</li>
            <li> Just in case anybody was wondering, I use [[ASIN:B004VGSVHS Crest 3d White Vivid Anticavity Teeth</li>
            <li> Although this is the most expensive personal dental hygiene item that I have ever purchased, I felt the difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li> gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;- the button is barely working now!</li>
            <li> I have used it daily for all these years (I&#x27;m 83 years old!)</li>
            <li> the reason I got another was my dentist told me he saw a major change with me using it for just 3 weeks in tooth and gum health.</li>
            <li> Consider no other toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> cleans like no other tooth brush</li>
            <li> find my self brushing way longer than usual as the experience is more enjoyable as weird as that may be</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works the same basically except it does have a sensitive setting which helps you get used to it, whitening setting is the BOMB!  </li>
            <li> Unlike the previous \\&quot;Flexcare\\&quot; and \\&quot;Elite\\&quot; models, the \\&quot;Diamondclean\\&quot; model has been designed by clueless people who maybe produce art for modern museums, but certainly have never used the toothbrush for actually brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li> However the glass that holds it looks kind of cheap: thick and heavy (so not very enjoyable to use).</li>
            <li> The vibrations of the brush mechanism are not hard to get used to or unpleasant, but it is important to brush for 2 full minutes--it beeps every 30 seconds so you can keep track of the time.  </li>
            <li> The diamond brush head is small and so gets to the back teeth and backs of teeth easily.</li>
            <li> BTW, I use an older FlexCare for travel (better battery life) and it failed about the same way, but at least not until many years after the warranty expired.</li>
            <li> Overall, since it is marked down, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> My older brush had a plastic grip on the back of the handle which made it hard to clean.</li>
            <li> i was hesitant to use an electric toothbrush, remembering the old one my dad used to use, so loud and messy (and ugly on the countertop), but after using the DiamondClean for about a month, I&#x27;m very happy with its results.</li>
            <li> very carefully read the directions before I used this toothbrush for the first time.</li>
            <li> There are several types of Sonicare brushes and this one is the most expensive, but this model is well worth the extra cost</li>
            <li> Studies do not reveal exactly what the effect, either positive or negative, of EMF radiation is on humans.</li>
            <li> You know that feeling of slick clean teeth after leaving the dentists office?</li>
            <li> The toothbrush also holds a decent charge, and can go for a long time without having to recharge the tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In other words, he said he didn&#x27;t think it was &#x27;worth paying extra for&#x27; the UV sanitizing feature.  </li>
            <li> Little pricy, but worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Sonicare -- but this particular model ceased operating properly (no head vibration) after a couple of months --</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt this clean in my life and it is reasonable to think that this will lead to decreased cavities and dental work in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The travel case and charger are very small, easy to pack for travel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was because I bought it from an outside provider other than Sonicare, but the toothbrush does not work right.  </li>
            <li> feel very hopeful about at least stemming the tide of any damage my mouth has experienced, I have a dramatic decrease in pain after only two days.  </li>
            <li> I was debating between this Diamond Clean or possibly the next stop down or maybe even an Oral B again (</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still enjoy using the brush and it provides exceptional performance over manual toothbrushes, but I am disappointed that the handles do not last for very long in my experience.</li>
            <li> I generally like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The battery is long lasting the storage options are modern and functional.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will ever use all the features the toothbrush and charging system offer but have immense respect for a product that has been this thoughtfully designed, both functionally and aesthetically.</li>
            <li> Clearly there are already numerous reviews.  </li>
            <li> Also, the directions do not make it clear what the difference is between the different operating modes.</li>
            <li> Then a couple of days ago, it just stopped vibrating barely at all.  </li>
            <li> I recently upgraded from my old sonicare toothbrush to this one.</li>
            <li> With this brush you can&#x27;t, whenever you hit the on/off button it will go directly to the next speed.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks, I&#x27;m still trying out all the modes, but the whitening mode, I believe, has made some difference so far.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Diamondclean\\&quot; model offers five different modes: \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, \\&quot;white\\&quot;, \\&quot;polish\\&quot;, \\&quot;gum care\\&quot;, and \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> You can barely see that the brush is moving, but it is.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to scroll through different options to turn the brush off early.</li>
            <li> It was such an unexpected benefit I wanted to mention it.  </li>
            <li> My 6 year old Sonicare finally crapped out on me and chose this one as a replacement.</li>
            <li> There is also a battery/charge indicator on the front near the bottom that lets you know when you&#x27;re running low on battery, when the brush is in use, and when it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> After Polish is Gum Care, which massages your gums and stimulates the blood flow there and helps to reverse and prevent gingivitis, and after Gum Care, the final mode is Sensitive, which speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> Personally it took me a day or two to adjust to the vibration of the toothbrush, this may primarily be because I am not accustomed to an electric toothbrush, but after a few days I am definitely hooked.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to keep the toothbrush, so I didn&#x27;t make it as far as actually brushing and testing the cycle durations.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things went well for a while, until about 14 months after the replacement, the same issue that occurred after dropping it, was happening again, but I had NEVER dropped it and have actually handled it with such care due to the trauma of my original experience with Sonicare Customer Service.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Sonicare, and after adamantly denying that I dropped it, they finally authorized a replacement, thank goodness for the 2 year warranty.  </li>
            <li> I left the old one in a hotel</li>
            <li> we have no regrets with this product.</li>
            <li> so I just gave up and reached for my old electric brush to do the back side of my teeth.</li>
            <li> and they were adamant that they had no such brush.</li>
            <li> You simply cover it with a soft cloth (pictured in instructions), whack it with a hammer, remove the rechargeable battery, and then throw the smashed toothbrush in the trash.  </li>
            <li> The glass cup should have had a slimmer cable to hide to achieve the overall seamless look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, too; just a low hum that can&#x27;t really be heard outside of 10 feet.</li>
            <li> but the reviews finally won me over (and my old Sonic was dying....).  </li>
            <li> While I still have quite a bit of cynicism about such toothbrushes, this brush seems to have been satisfactory so far.</li>
            <li> at nearly $200 I would not expect a need to scrimp on quality of the internal components.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare died, and for 3 weeks (before I got this one), I went back to a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Apparently there is a well documented issue wherein the shaft which vibrates the tooth brush head breaks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the travel charger yet, but hope to in the near future.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, to be completely fairI need to also tell you that two co-workers bought theirs at the same time I bought mine</li>
            <li> The contrast I found between my old electric toothbrush and the Sonicare DiamondClean is the same - HUGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> brush three times daily and use two complete cycles each time</li>
            <li> I purchased another one and after 11 months of use the metal shaft started to wiggle and the brush head barely vibrated or moved at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only charged it once so far.  </li>
            <li> I recently got this to replace my Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush which was getting old.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised it was the only model that said that!</li>
            <li> This is a one day improvement over my old unit, which also had the same whitening cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a one day improvement over my old unit, which also had the same whitening cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon doesn&#x27;t take back these type of items with it being 45 days old (their policy 30 days).  </li>
            <li> The battery barely lasted a year.  </li>
            <li> BUT IT HAD ONLY ONE SETTING THAT WAS TOO HARSE ON MY SENSITIVE TEETH.</li>
            <li> THIS ONE HAS A SENSITIVE SETTING WHICH I ONLY USE EACH TIME I BRUSH.</li>
            <li> the noise was so distracting that I couldn&#x27;t even pay attention or could barely hear what they were saying</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this toothbrush because of the price, but after glowing recommendations from friends, I had to do it, and I have absolutely no regrets.</li>
            <li> But...the first thing I noticed is that I had a harder time reaching my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;other\\&quot; modes are barely ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons of diamondclean: The travel case is very unintuitive when it comes to storing wet brushes.</li>
            <li> Philips continues to have the most poorly trained support group.</li>
            <li> , the carrying case USB charger is unbelievably convenient (not to mention cool).</li>
            <li> In addition, I get tartar buildup behind my front teeth, both on the top and bottom.  </li>
            <li> They should take better care of their customers and stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> Though I bought this product w/ a professional discount, I agree with other reviewers who said this new model isn&#x27;t worth the jump in price from previous ones.</li>
            <li> So powerful that if the plastic back side of the brush touches a tooth while brushing, it sends chills down my spine.</li>
            <li> What really helped was the function of the product that ensures that the first few brushing sessions are less intense than the regular ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the price although it would be nice if replacement brushed were a bit less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The life ranged from 5-10 days, but was usually 6 days--that&#x27;s only 12 uses!--nowhere near the 21 days they boldly advertise.</li>
            <li> The new charging dock is pretty slick look</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new and even more expensive diamondclean brush head does seem to be an improvement on both the E-type and</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, stays charged for a long time, and looks slick on the shelf.</li>
            <li> Travel case, while lovely, doesn&#x27;t appear that it will stand up well to cleaning, due to its heavily textured outer case (but will only know this over</li>
            <li> , while lovely, doesn&#x27;t appear that it will stand up well to cleaning, due to its heavily textured outer case (but will only know this over time)    </li>
            <li> Interestingly, it has been working fine since then, going on close to 20 months now, but I suspect it will fail within the next few months, and he is already out of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; it started right at the \\&quot;gum care\\&quot; setting, and it has for the few weeks that I&#x27;ve had the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Now, I tried the plastic one first, because I thought it would take up less room.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt this clean in my life and it is reasonable to think that this will lead to decreased cavities and dental work in the future.     </li>
            <li> When I got the Philips Sonicare, I was particularly interested in the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; setting, because I drink a lot of green tea and have stains that are tough remove, mostly because I never stop drinking tea.</li>
            <li> Drives me nuts as I barely put the brush to my teeth and it sputters and loses the ability to clean.</li>
            <li> Particularly appreciate how long it will last on a charge.</li>
            <li> Very pleasing aesthetic look to it, like comparing a Ferrari to, well, any other vehicle.</li>
            <li> I am also very pleased with the battery life on it - a charge can last me at least a few weeks.</li>
            <li> He just likes the little round brush head and, for whatever reason, likes the more jarring sensation from that brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comes with travel kit and a few charging options which work a little bit like magic.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from a sonicate I&#x27;d had for about 10 years, which finally the battery was dead and wouldn&#x27;t hold enough charge to get through a full brushing.  </li>
            <li> I like the QuadPacer feature (also available on some other Sonicare models), because it lets me think less while</li>
            <li> Teeth have honestly never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> dentist thinks it has improve my cleaning routine based on my last appointment.&lt;br /&gt;Having the timer making conscious about spending enough time cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> It seems possible that it may indeed last the nearly 3 weeks as advertised.</li>
            <li> Before the Flexcare, I used the cheap models from the grocery store and those failed so quickly I could have paid for a Flexcare with what I spent on them -</li>
            <li> and I can say there is at least 50% less plaque deposition near my front teeths (performs better in front of those teeths than rear).</li>
            <li> The product has a nice look with the glass to be used for charging the product - but essentially the product design is flawed.</li>
            <li> only deduction, a star, is for the design flaw that many others have complained about: the single button that switches modes *</li>
            <li> This unit is pretty much the same as any other previous sonic care model.  </li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best rechargeable electric toothbrush on the market - and regardless of which model you choose, I doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It tickled my mouth a little bit at first, but after about a week I was used to it</li>
            <li> Only occasionally, mind you, but with every other toothbrush in my life, that has happened exactly NEVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced the head, the body was fully charge but the pulsing action was so weak that it couldn&#x27;t clean</li>
            <li> in all, I highly recommend the Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush to anyone serious about keeping their teeth and gums in tip-top shape.g the cord around the Case with a loose knot.</li>
            <li> With the new HX9332, you can use the included case to charge your toothbrush if you&#x27;re away from home on a longer vacation which is a very nice touch as you don&#x27;t need to bring an extra charging base with you.  </li>
            <li> My second one lasted less than 2 months until it started making funny sounds.</li>
            <li> but makes it difficult to keep the thing from slipping through your hand while brushing - I may get some sort of grip tape for it.&lt;br /&gt;- single button control for power and functions; makes quick on/off difficult as it will cycle through the settings rather than power off - not the best design</li>
            <li> Again, this has been mentioned before, but unlike ALL of the photographs of the product, there is a 1-2mm gap that (in my opinion), ruins the refined and polished look of the unit as a whole.</li>
            <li> It would seem to be especially beneficial for anyone not already using Sonicare brushes, or electric brushes in general.</li>
            <li> When I asked how much they would refund me, the rep said she didn&#x27;t know, but it would be the average retail price.  </li>
            <li> do wish they would make it clear that the different brushes feel different and act differently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After letting the device charge, usability is much like any other Sonicare, multiple button pushes change the brushing mode.</li>
            <li> while i&#x27;ve never done either of those (t-rexes are more scared of manual toothbrushes), i suspect that what is actually causing the issue (other than overly brittle metal shafts, obviously) is having a relatively small jaw.  </li>
            <li> As you know, dentist visits are expensive and I have NO plans in going there any more frequently than the standard every six months.  </li>
            <li> something which i need, but have not spent enough time on.</li>
            <li> So I went online, and I wasn&#x27;t the only one who had encountered this, apparently.</li>
            <li> I loved the sleek, minimal look of the entire kit and decided to order one, despite the expensive price tag.</li>
            <li> its claims to whiten teeth after 1 week was true in my case (but i also cut out common staining consumables like teas and coffee).</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is worth the price difference in the Flexcare+</li>
            <li> The cup system takes more space than the original base as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but the case does loose some of its cool factor with the cord dangling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but the case does loose some of its cool factor with the cord dangling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you need to dremel the handset in half, unsolder the old battery and solder the new battery in place.    </li>
            <li> I read other reviews about their teeth becoming more white after a few weeks of use and was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> love everything about this model, except that I find it to be a little slick to hold well.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads on the other hand due seem more expensive compared to their other models which contain more parts/plastic.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly on the design and additional features that come with it compared to other Philips and Oral-B options.  </li>
            <li> The redesigned power handle is quite effective too, yielding a sleek-looking object which appears to be less prone to becoming a \\&quot;crud-magnet\\&quot; around its base.  </li>
            <li> Sure, paying nearly $200 for a toothbrush seems a little ridiculous, and maybe it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the actual vibration changes or not (I didn&#x27;t pay it particular attention), but it definitely has different timing associated with each type of cleaning,  which I find very helpful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not loose contact from one quadrant to the next.</li>
            <li> Lots of gimicks with the various vibration modes, but doubt they really do anything different from one mode to the other.</li>
            <li> material is finer than other Sonicare heads; it feels like it might clean a little</li>
            <li> I would still highly recommend this to friends,family, and other Amazon members.</li>
            <li> I just take the pieces apart after I brush my teeth to let them dry, and in the past I&#x27;ve used some rubbing alcohol/soap to try and get the parts clean.</li>
            <li> They perform very well and are good/better than the previous Oral-B models.    </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really doing it for significantly less time.</li>
            <li> Low the glass less messy easy charging.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the brush heads will quickly vibrate off the body if I&#x27;m not brushing while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> There is no easy way to get an exchange (I did not keep the box not the warranty) and even via Amazon there is no exchange, so that is pretty</li>
            <li> I like the inductive charging base and the beautiful white casing.</li>
            <li> I felt a strong ticklish sensation along the gums...especially behind the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Last but not least, the single button interface means that if you press the button once the brush turns on, the second press (if within 5 seconds) cycles through various brushing modes.</li>
            <li> , here is what I can tell you: as a person who has used a manual toothbrush for most of my life, I felt a little silly the first time I used this.</li>
            <li> I personally think the price is worth it and HIGHLY recommend you consider this.osed to replace the heads approximately every 3 months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s actually the normal time frame for a Sonicare (diamondclean) to last because it has a motor attached to a batter inside the handle connected to other electrical components.&amp;#34; Effectively they admitted that its normal for these expensive toothbrushes to begin to break down just after the warranty period, and just hope their customers keep replacing them.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that replacement heads are VERY spendy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The travel case and the charging stand are really neat features but the lack of a charge level and the two buttons is a very big trade down.  </li>
            <li> The case is slick and can charge with an outlet or usb, very smart.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few electric toothbrushes and this is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;Feels strange to begin with as the brush vibrates very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My gums are noticeably less swollen in the morning and the tea stains are definitely improved, but the real surprise was my skin.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to last much longer than those used in my previous brushes.  </li>
            <li> My primary complaint with the old brush was where the brush head slid down onto the post getting moldy with the toothpaste buildup.</li>
            <li> After a year and half, it&#x27;s kind of broken.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing since the operation is great.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare Essential electric brush for the past 10 years and while this one is more expensive, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> We were very careful with them and used them normally.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However it turns out that the head doesn&#x27;t last 3 months (they are pretty expensive too), maybe around 2 months, and it gives me an annoyingly loud and harsh sound every time I turn it</li>
            <li> but it was still easy to find gross murky, germy water left behind after brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works fine, but not great.</li>
            <li> Little hard to figure out how the charging works, but was able to set it up and get it working.</li>
            <li> (My husband complained that it rattled his teeth at first, I didn&#x27;t have that sensation, only a slight tickling of the gums for the first couple of days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but when you figure how much whitening at your dentist&#x27;s office would cost....</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the blinking green charging light is very dim.</li>
            <li> Now she has a new one (pink!)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m guessing its primarily due to new brush head design.    </li>
            <li> I usually gate brushing my teeth because my teeth never really feel all that clean after.</li>
            <li> Miss the sonic cleaning feature of past models very much.  </li>
            <li> Was a little discouraged by reading the negative feedback before purchasing but am glad I ordered this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the toothbrush base is smooth, it&#x27;s not slipped out of my hands, but I would have liked a little grip for reassurance.</li>
            <li> Seriously this toothbrush has opened a whole new world of oral care for me and I will never go back.  </li>
            <li> Mine was getting kind of old and had a bad habit of accumulating \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; under the brush head.  </li>
            <li> For the price I paid this was a huge letdown, really not happy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the DiamondClean heads or the mechanism or both, but it seriously works better than any toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried, including a previous Sonicare.</li>
            <li> so it was hard to get it back to the right setting.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth much cleaner than normal brushing; I noticed a slight whitening effect after a few days.  </li>
            <li> You simply have to hold the toothbrush in your mouth and the vibration does all the work getting into areas that are tough to get clean with a regular toothbrush.      </li>
            <li> Bought this and in less than a week they are back to normal.</li>
            <li> The look is sleek and classy, tho, the handle is a little .. not slippery, but an odd smooth that takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> There is one power/mode button on the handle that cycles through the various modes (of which there are five), and each mode has an illuminated display that lights up a soft white color when that mode is selected and active.</li>
            <li> It does not clean my teeth as well as the older models.  </li>
            <li> I only want a new one because they didn&#x27;t have the black model when I purchased mine.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Phillips 800 number, a real person answered the phone and 5 minutes later (following some basic information), a new product is on it&#x27;s way including a prepaid lable to return the broken one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now completely spoiled for any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is not harsh and abrasive like some other toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are much whiter and feel so much cleaner after using this brush for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> Three of the seven came from Amazon, the other four came from Philips directly.</li>
            <li> Eleven months after I purchased this item, the vibrational force decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> I thought that electric toothbrushes are only good because you get to be lazy - I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> morning, as I was going through my usual routine of squinting in the mirror with the brush in my mouth, ready to hit the button several times to get into \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode, the brush slipped out of my hand and fell about three feet into the sink.</li>
            <li> other Sonicare toothbrushes that permitted gunk to accumulate in the handles - really hard to clean</li>
            <li> When it finally died, I tried Braun a couple of times, but the small head really made it feel like the cleaning power just wasn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bugs me, is that it doesn&#x27;t seem that it runs long enough before the timer shuts it off.  </li>
            <li> Wish i had bought this product long time ago, only problem is charge doesnt go 3 weeks as advertised, mine only goes like 4-5 days with  2-3 times brushing a day.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t do that while looking at the display, because the handle will turn on on the first button press, and splatter the toothpaste all over the place in \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode, while you&#x27;re progressing slowly to the mode you actually want.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t do that while looking at the display, because the handle will turn on on the first button press, and splatter the toothpaste all over the place in \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode, while you&#x27;re progressing slowly to the mode you actually want.</li>
            <li> It is slick and thin, fits in your hand nicely.</li>
            <li> Not sure we needed one this expensive, but I don&#x27;t regret it and we got a good price.  </li>
            <li> The home charger base using a drinking glass - is &amp;#34;Home &amp; Garden&amp;#34; beautiful but not very practical nor sanitary.</li>
            <li> Also, the noise with my previous toothbrush was very loud and if a family member was trying to talk to me while I was brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> The bristles on the outer edges of the brushing surface of the DiamondClean head are white and blue (blue being the indicator bristles that tell you that you should replace the head when they fade to white) and are arranged in sort of a concave almond shape around the center bristles.</li>
            <li> Then the button got really hard to press - when running hot water over it brown gunk started coming out.  </li>
            <li> There is only one button but 5 brush settings, so you have to hit it several times if, like me, you finish brushing, spit, rinse the brush under water and then pulse it to dry it out (knock the water off).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> To pay $220 dollars for a product that last less than 2 years is completely unacceptable.    </li>
            <li> Absolutely a hit with my son on Christmas morning!&lt;br /&gt;He charged that morning and after a few uses raved over how his teeth felt and looked!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; mode really leaves your teeth feeling slick</li>
            <li> box is a small medium size, very sleek like the brush itself.</li>
            <li> Light weight and small enough for small hands.</li>
            <li> This really makes your teeth feel dentist-clean - everyday!  </li>
            <li> It is pricey, but in the long run you only need to replace the brush head (and it comes with two).</li>
            <li> only minor point is lack of the timer that oral b had  instead.</li>
            <li> it is only a minor point.</li>
            <li> (my teeth are cleaner and whiter) and they also last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read complaints about the multiple modes and having to awkwardly scroll thru them while the brush-head is in your mouth; honestly, I haven&#x27;t even needed another mode other than the standard.</li>
            <li> The long term batterly life and sleek design make it terrific for travelers.</li>
            <li> Long lasting charge (I took it to travel for 10 days, brushing morning and evening</li>
            <li> I sent their tech support people an inquiry, and they said the tip should be pointed towards the gums with the flat side against the teeth.</li>
            <li> ; I don&#x27;t need a time or clock and have been using electric toothbrushes long enough to know when I am pushing to hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not had this long enough to comment on the durability of the product and battery.</li>
            <li> I like that the charge is lasting so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly putting my hand over my mouth to try and block any potential spray, or trying to keep my mouth as closed as possible.</li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to judge the reliability yet.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush also started to have problem last month just 1 year and now completely not working even though the battery indicator shows it is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> My teeth haven&#x27;t looked this white in a really long time.</li>
            <li> additional stuff is mostly a gimmick -- the glass is unnecessary, as is the carrying pack (when I travel for a few days I can use a regular toothbrush).</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was effectively cactus, and a very expensive cactus at that.  </li>
            <li> I also like the included charging base glass which I find very useful for those times I wake up at night to get a quick drink from</li>
            <li> It does a fine job of cleaning your teeth, as prior Sonicare brushes have, but if the battery is going to die in 2-3 years, anyway, why invest so much in a lousy design?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a year and it completely broke down.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, and I am not a dentist, but I believe you actually come out saving money because if you use this product, floss, and use mouth wash, at least 2 times a day, you can certainly reduce the number of times you go for &amp;#34;regular cleaning&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> if not for the ironic flaw where one of the selling features, the ceramic-feeling handle, actually makes it hard to grip sometimes when brushing.  </li>
            <li> One other thing which is different - it completely stops after the cycle is over, the braun would continue and give 30 sec beeps, so when you were done with your brushing for 2 mins you could work on the gums for another min etc.</li>
            <li> Its expensive but really cool!</li>
            <li> Having used other spin-brush type electric toothbrushes for nearly 20 years, I was shocked by how much cleaner my teeth felt with the sonic diamond clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true that the selection of five different settings can be a little hard to use.  </li>
            <li> My Sonicares don&#x27;t last me very long.  </li>
            <li> I feel that after a while (could be a very long time or short) that tears and eventually breakage of that crease could occur.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy for saving few thousands of dollars and avoiding the painful surgery.</li>
            <li> I, too, got the &#x27;Dental Professional Trial NOT FOR RESALE&#x27; packaging in a slightly dinged outer box.</li>
            <li> It easily gets into all the difficult to reach spots.  </li>
            <li> The battery stopped recharging after about 14 months of use, changing modes while brushing is the only way to avoid splatter (and then you have to guess which mode you are on because you can&#x27;t see the light), and the brush heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> and* the button doesn&#x27;t always depress properly; so I have to squint at the lights under my nose.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t like to leave my toothbrush bristles out in the bathroom, as I read when you flush the toilet</li>
            <li> , it is somewhat upsetting that a toothbrush for roughly 200.00 bucks would last only 8 months but</li>
            <li> The manual shows that toothbrush head attaching with a loud \\&quot;click\\&quot; but the manual is generic and not relevant to this model.</li>
            <li> I have never owned one and after getting used to the vibrating in my mouth and the small amount of toothpaste needed I will never go back to the normal brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the white one for about 3 years, and recently purchased the pink one that I gave as a gift.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions were not real clear.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m not that lucky, but it seems like the quality control is poor...</li>
            <li> The charging system is outstanding and very trick as is the carrying case which is also a charging base.</li>
            <li> Who wants a glass to collect crap and clutter up the counter top.</li>
            <li> You select the mode you want by pressing a *single* button multiple times.</li>
            <li> I could replace that toothbrush every single year for 9 years to equal the cost of one of these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It also comes in a multi-pack, which at a \\&quot;big box\\&quot; store was cheaper than buying a single brush.</li>
            <li> To summarize my thoughts, here are the positive and negative points about the brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After almost 2 years we are out the $150 we spent on what we thought was a solid, long lasting electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Retrospectively, I would probably try to get the same toothbrush but not with all these extra things that are not very useful.</li>
            <li> Because of the tight design on the handle and the unique charger, no more gunk everywhere!</li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare brushes generally lasted this same length, and this model has proved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After about a month and a half, it started making strange loud noises as I was brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> There are several other Amazon reviews reporting similar problems.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately now philips requires you to provide original receipt after the second replacement handle</li>
            <li> Due to warrantee, I got a free replacement and it was broken again in about one year.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my third Philips Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush in the last 5 years and I have used two other Philips Sonicare toothbrush models before the DiamondClean line of products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the replacement handle began to have the same issue, and when I re-contacted customer service, my original brush&#x27;s warranty was up</li>
            <li> I think I probably will go back to Oral B due to the short battery life.    </li>
            <li> I have used both Sonicare and Braun units in the past, but this one just seems particularly off.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth, so it took a little while to get used to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit louder than the E series too, but still not as loud as the Oral B 5000 that I bought my wife.  </li>
            <li> little loud inside mouth though.  </li>
            <li> A little after the 2-year warranty expired my DiamondClean developed a problem with the shaft.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant after reading the one star reviews but old sonic care was in need of an update.</li>
            <li> and obviously it&#x27;s not ideal to go charge it for a little while when you&#x27;re in a rush just to have some charge to be able to use it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nifty idea, but your toothbrush gets set down on the sink, where all kinds of other stuff live.</li>
            <li> As you will see in some of the other online reviews, some users complain that the DiamondCare&#x27;s lack of an On/Off switch causes as situation such as what this reviewer wrote: \\&quot;You select the mode you want by pressing a *single* button multiple times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first sonic toothbrush I ever used, and, at first, I have to say that the sensation in my teeth was unpleasant.</li>
            <li> and it started to become very noisy lately.  </li>
            <li> At least it is REAL glass and not plastic</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical that a handheld so-called \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; unit could compete with a dentist&#x27;s professional gear.  </li>
            <li> In other words, if you&#x27;re brushing in \\&quot;clean,\\&quot; and want to end early, you have to cycle through the other modes before it turns off.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by how small the actual brush was and it took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> After my dentist told me I was literally getting long in the tooth, I decided I need to upgrade my toothbrush to an electric one.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take all that long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a LONG time 10</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase a Sonicare</li>
            <li> Instead, I chose to take my time and see what the effects of using this product would be over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Kinda strange.</li>
            <li> And the auto timing function makes me brush as long as I am supposed to.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Philips Sonicare product.</li>
            <li> Another feature is the quadpacer, which tells you how long to brush each quadrant of your teeth.</li>
            <li> The brush hold a charge for a long time...maybe recharge every 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say yet anything about the long term benefits, just tha</li>
            <li> Something inside comes &amp;#34;unglued&amp;#34; and the vibration delivered to the brush head is reduced by 90%, but you can feel the mechanism inside the handle vibrating and making strange noises.  </li>
            <li> Second, the surface is not slippery when wet</li>
            <li> Minor notes: I must spread toothpaste on my teeth before I engage this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Runs a long time on a charge and makes my teeth feel</li>
            <li> The handle is sanitary and there is no soft rubber component that might discolor or accumulate grime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently deployed overseas and had this product was recommended to me by one of our military dentists.</li>
            <li> keeps a long charge</li>
            <li> the battery lasts for a long time</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t find that it took long to adjust to the vibration at all</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s minor--</li>
            <li> take too long to shut it off .</li>
            <li> First, a wide-mouthed, heavy glass cup (yes, it is actually made of glass, not plastic) sits on top of the charging base.</li>
            <li> Long two-year warranty, and</li>
            <li> Long two-year warranty, and</li>
            <li> If I go on a week long vacation I never take my charger.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been a long time</li>
            <li> Long battery life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> battery lasts so long that I&#x27;ve taken two-week trips abroad and not once found the need to plug the carrying case in to charge the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long Battery Life</li>
            <li> I have not used mine that long, but I have looked at the cost of replacement brushes--currently 3 for $38 on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> That was always just a minor inconvenience.</li>
            <li> You have to CYCLE through a long list to get to what you want each and</li>
            <li> For example:  the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; mode is 2 minutes long.  </li>
            <li> I had long had periodontitis that eventually resulted in the \\&quot;flap procedure.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I hope this lasts as long and serves me as well.</li>
            <li> Minor problem, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally buried it under pillows on my couch and closed the door to the living room.</li>
            <li> with this machine, I bought 2 via Amazon, 1 via direct from boots pharmacy London, all of them after few months  not power on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned the Sonicare Tooth Brush myself for a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product a couple of days, so I&#x27;ve only brushed with it a few times.  </li>
            <li> The shipment came earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> so i would say it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It got rid of those long standing coffee stains on the sides of my teeth and</li>
            <li> Story long, after using this brush almost two years, I&#x27;d recommend a step &amp;#34;down&amp;#34; to the &amp;#34;Flexcare +&amp;#34; model.</li>
            <li> The charge works a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always been very skeptical about shoving a battery-operated, vibrating toothbrush into my mouth and having it produce results better than what I was getting with a regular toothbrush, but I&#x27;m sold now.</li>
            <li> star for the longevity of the product (should be longer because you spend 200.00 -&amp;#62; also surprised the agent first time I called that this expensive item was deflective)&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it did not last as long as I would have expected.</li>
            <li> The hand piece sits in a second clear disk that nests on top of the base with the cord.  </li>
            <li> Since I hate and avoid going to the dentist, I thought a top-of-the-line toothbrush would be a good idea.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the handle and brush takes very little time and the cleanup gives a product that looks like it is new.  </li>
            <li> You expect a premium price to buy you better functionality and performance over less expensive models.</li>
            <li> Since using the brush my skin is much less red, and when I stop using the brush it goes back to flushed-looking.</li>
            <li> And it is smaller too, so if you are on a short, less than 5 days trip you could just drop it into your briefcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I intend to give my impression on the overall effectiveness, which is the only subject</li>
            <li> The ergonomics are slightly different than the previous versions as this model appears to be somewhat squared off in the hand as opposed to the earlier rounded power units.  </li>
            <li> It was an upgrade from an older model for the added features; there was nothing wrong with the older model either, which is still working.</li>
            <li> Within say 20 years, the false teeth people would go out of business, there would be less bacterial endocarditis, smokers would get more dates, (whitens too) and dental insurance rates would go down.</li>
            <li> I mean really Sonicare?</li>
            <li> I am not sure that I would have paid the list price on this for a new one.</li>
            <li> For the past few years I kept the big unattractive charger for my old brush in the vanity and only pulled it out when I needed a charge; I simply didn&#x27;t have the space on the counter for it.  </li>
            <li> So I have my 3rd toothbrush in a little under 2 years - wonder how long this one will last.</li>
            <li> I can confirm that both the USB charger and the charging base are multi voltage capable and work fine in Australia.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare operates and feels totally different than the other toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is lighter than other Sonicare models (about the same as the Oral-B).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The replacement head is smaller than other Sonicare models.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Expensive refills, but worth it!  </li>
            <li> In other words, I can&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush strongly enough.</li>
            <li> The white mode vibration seems a little stronger, but that&#x27;s the only perceivable difference.  </li>
            <li> Switched from regular toothbrush to Philips Sonicare after doing some research among the other electric toothbrush vendors and models.</li>
            <li> Anyway, now that I have a proper consumer unit with all the parts, I can cast my lot with the other ecstatic reviewers for this product.</li>
            <li> Anyway, now that I have a proper consumer unit with all the parts, I can cast my lot with the other ecstatic reviewers for this product.</li>
            <li> only downside is that it is a little bit fragile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that I definitely prefer it to the rotary head of other brands...</li>
            <li> The bristles on this model are a bit stiffer and seem to be made of a different material than the other ones, and seem to polish teeth like a dentist.  </li>
            <li> other reviews I find changing the brushing cycle or stopping in the middle of the brushing routine is a PITA.</li>
            <li> How did we go without for so long!</li>
            <li> Cons - Other than the initial cost, none.</li>
            <li> This thing has a bunch of different modes (i.e. &#x27;Polish&#x27; when I had a little too much red wine and &#x27;GumCare&#x27;</li>
            <li> Due to the time commitment, I prefer to use it at night only, and I brush manual in the morning and after dinner since manual is faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I went this long without an electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> (ugh that was SO long ago!)</li>
            <li> I am not going to go into detail about the features &amp; what it can &amp; cant do as there is enough written about this in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have said it before in other reviews (written when I bought my last Philips Sonicare toothbrush)</li>
            <li> My original brush of this model eventually stopped &amp;#34;giggling&amp;#34; the brush head which rendered it useless.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it was a little more expensive, as are the replacement heads, but it works well</li>
            <li> It can also be charged on USB (electric and from any other devices such as your laptop etc).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to go back to old toothbrush after use this item.  </li>
            <li> It battery is very long lived.  </li>
            <li> but I notice that my gums are a little more weak now and was advised by my dentist to use a manual brush a few times a week to strengthen them.  </li>
            <li> If your hands are dry and the handle is dry, it will slip out of your hand before you even know what is happening.</li>
            <li> It protects the bristles while allowing air to circulate to dry the brush.</li>
            <li> It protects the bristles while allowing air to circulate to dry the brush.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush for anyone who wants serious dental hygiene and care.  </li>
            <li> It drives you crazy to pay more and actually get less for your money.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the setting for \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; but I also use the one for \\&quot;Gum Care\\&quot; at least once a day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I would like having it sit out on my bathroom counter, but it looks very elegant (as much as a toothbrush can) and the cord is long enough that you can move the base around and hide the cord behind things on the counter,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to the whitening results yet, since I&#x27;ve only been using the DiamondClean for a few days, but I can definitely tell you that this toothbrush makes my teeth feel cleaner than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li> This case is made of a white cloth/synthetic weave on the outside and some sort of green plastic on the inside.</li>
            <li> After I used the case for a few days I did take a damp cloth and did a once over the case and left it open to dry, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> then a few days later started working again but only sporadically for 20 seconds and dying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pull</li>
            <li> i rated it 4/5 stars only cuz even though i feel the brush head against the surfaces of my teeth and gum line, i still miss a few spots, but just in tiny crevices, so</li>
            <li> Then about 2 weeks later the brush started turning on by itself in the middle of the night, then it went dead and stopped working altogether.  </li>
            <li> I started off on the sensitive setting, and slowly am working my way to the regular setting.      </li>
            <li> The slimmer, sleek design is good-looking and the rechargeable base actually looks nice sitting out on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> While the brush itself may be an excellent design, the travel case requires that the brush head be removed from the base, and worse the head protector must be removed from the head before you put it in the box.  </li>
            <li> my other toothbrushes did their jobs well, however, they were a little bit loud.</li>
            <li> is the single unit you&#x27;ll need to keep your mouth up to par.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every single Sonic model has color-coded brush heads, or color coded rings that you put on the brush heads ..</li>
            <li> that is, every single model EXCEPT their ultra-high end Diamondclean?</li>
            <li> All in all, I can&#x27;t think of a single reason not to invest in this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The single button is all you need.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after a couple days and it became a crud-encrusted elephant taking over limited space on the bathroom</li>
            <li> The biggest challenge was getting into the habit of using it every single day.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can say about this model is that the smooth plastic body is a bit tough to hang on to.  </li>
            <li> However, I went ahead with the Diamond, hoping that it will last as long as previous models have.</li>
            <li> After all the money spent on this excessively high priced toothbrush, I&#x27;m disappointed that Philips wouldn&#x27;t throw one in for free, so I knocked one star rating off for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Yes, I agree that the DiamondClean brush heads ARE a notable improvement, but they can be used on other, less expensive Sonicare models.</li>
            <li> I think the glass cup it sits in is a bit silly, serves no real purpose and takes up too much space near my sink.</li>
            <li> 27 May, 2015 quit working, not even a year, these used to last longer, not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I never thought I had sensitive teeth in the past</li>
            <li> While the country of origin is nowhere marked on the unit itself, small print on the box shows the ubiquitous \\&quot;Made in .....</li>
            <li> Not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy it at first due to some reviewers not being happy with one switch mode, but I did not find it annoying or difficult at all.</li>
            <li> Well, that top heavy mother f-er is going to tip over, taking the much shorter glass cup with it because, as you recall, THE GLASS DOESN&#x27;T ATTACH TO THE PLASTIC BASE.  </li>
            <li> Loved the brush until yesterday when it died cold in my hand....was charged, would not light up to recharge and is simply dead.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it appears to be well made and the way it charges is too cool.  </li>
            <li> Also, the way it vibrates tickles my mouth in an uncomfortable way, so I don&#x27;t use it for the full time.</li>
            <li> Philips knows they created a problem, but apparently customer loyalty is not important to them.</li>
            <li> Deafening clattering, with a loose wobbly head.  </li>
            <li> I ended up wrapping the cord around the Case with a loose knot.</li>
            <li> And once you have the setting you want you can easily loose it by turning off the unit before score determined time</li>
            <li> So either we are all the unluckiest family out there, or there is some design flaw that causes the Sonicare DiamondClean&#x27;s vibration mechanism to come loose inside the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So either we are all the unluckiest family out there, or there is some design flaw that causes the Sonicare DiamondClean&#x27;s vibration mechanism to come loose inside the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are buying a philips toothbrush, do yourself a favor and search for &#x27;loose sonicare head&#x27;, those posts will show you how to fix it when it quits.  </li>
            <li> A Sonicare requires that you grip it loosely and don&#x27;t press it against your gum line.  </li>
            <li> I thought Apple had a near monopoly on clever, aesthetic, practical and whimsical electronics design.</li>
            <li> A second unit just broke down in about two years.</li>
            <li> After comparing several Sonicare models, I narrowed the field down to one or two.</li>
            <li> Only down side was</li>
            <li> I actually cycle through all of the settings and when I set the brush down, my teeth are cleaner than they have EVER been.</li>
            <li> It had gotten to the point that certain areas were pretty painful to floss or</li>
            <li> I could also see the toothbrush being knocked off of the travel charger base very easily if you used that on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable quality from this product, real dentist-quality cleaning with little effort.</li>
            <li> But mine was sent without a glass, with a worn and dog-eared instruction manual, and all the other parts poorly re-packaged in a bashed-up box marked \\&quot;Dental Professional Trial NOT FOR RESALE.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> tried to find a new one on here that was comparable but couldn&#x27;t, at least not with the gum-care setting.</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t get dirty easily for me that is.</li>
            <li> dirty - easily cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they wrote their reviews after only one use, but once you click through to the setting you want, it automatically keeps that setting as the default the next time you use it.</li>
            <li> After the Elite, I was using an Oral-B Professional electric toothbrush that I received for free from my orthodontist, until it died in a tragic outlet accident.</li>
            <li> I feel it should last longer than half a year if one pays close to $200 for it.</li>
            <li> Takes up less counter space and does a terrific job on the teeth.  </li>
            <li> After several days the sonicare started buzzing when putting slight side pressure on the brush head.</li>
            <li> Case in fact, I had previously ordered the basic model from amazon before I saw this and after delivery; decided it was too bulky for me</li>
            <li> The white model for her, and the black model for me.  </li>
            <li> The black model only comes with the charging glass.  </li>
            <li> cleaning also took about half the time, and it has been 9 months since they were last cleaned at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> you could always keep it in the closed travel case, but i like to let my brush dry.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is battery lasts less than 2 years.</li>
            <li> Each time one breaks after a year and a half, I swear I wont buy another, but others brands seem to have the same issue.  </li>
            <li> But I would encourage the Philips product developers to find a way to accomplish the same effect with less &amp;#34;tickling&amp;#34; vibration.</li>
            <li> , Philips will supply you with an extra six months of warranty, adding up to two and a half years.</li>
            <li> Note:  If you register the device online, Philips will supply you with an extra six months of warranty, adding up to two and a half years.</li>
            <li> then the previous version, smaller, lighter and recharger has been reworked so</li>
            <li> It is just a fact that brushing these areas with a regular toothbrush is not very easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would buy this again and in black next time!</li>
            <li> But then half speed comes back.  </li>
            <li> The glass induction charging is unqiue, it also comes with a different less bulky glass stand.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Sonicare we have bought but this model surpasses the previous versions.</li>
            <li> As if possessed by aliens, my toothbrush comes on in the middle of the night and scares me half to death.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review this product from the perspective of someone who has used other Sonicare (or other brands of sonic) toothbrushes, but as someone who has been using different incarnations of Oral B electric toothbrushes for years, I&#x27;ll admit...</li>
            <li> After one year an a half the brush started to turn on by itself (the same problem as with my previous Phillips brush), likely i had a warranty</li>
            <li> However, I will note that after purchasing the DiamondClean power head in April 2012, it just died yesterday (less than 3 years later).</li>
            <li> , you have to go through every modes to go back to the previous...</li>
            <li> Else no complaints, but I&#x27;m not particularly demanding on this product.</li>
            <li> Too expensive to die so quickly after the warranty expires.</li>
            <li> Hardly ever sensitive now!</li>
            <li> Also, replacement brushes are more expensive than my previous Sonicare and do NOT have colored bands, so you have no easy way to distinguish one brush from the other - especially when a couple is traveling.  </li>
            <li> The other electric tooth brush chargers I have had collect residue and must be disassembled and are difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> I think my next visit with my dentist should go very smooth and less painful.  </li>
            <li> not China like Sonicare is.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had very few complaints with the Sonicare and did see an improvement at the dentist -- until they all stopped working in a very short period of time relative to the expense of buying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am now looking into Oral B/Braun since I don&#x27;t want to risk blowing a huge amount of money on another Philips sonic toothbrush, only to have it conveniently break shortly after the warranty expires :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really mess with the different modes</li>
            <li> Other than that minor gripe</li>
            <li> At first it seems awkward putting this vibrating &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; in your month but after a few times I really got the hang of how to move it around cleaning the 4 zones of the mouth.</li>
            <li> The only minor annoyance is that you cannot change the &#x27;setting&#x27; on the brush without turning it on - so you are forced to click through the different settings while it is vibrating.  </li>
            <li> Like going to the dentist every single day!</li>
            <li> On the first handle, the entire metal shaft detached from the base and because it was 25 months old and outside of the 24-month warranty</li>
            <li> While this toothbrush may seem expensive to some, I am looking at it as an investment to effectively clean her teeth (in the absence of a regular professional cleaning) and hopefully prevent her needing expensive fillings and the accompanying pain and discomfort and risk of her needing to be sedated for a procedure.</li>
            <li> This thing will quickly make you realize how bad a regular toothbrush actually cleans your teeth.  </li>
            <li> and it takes so little space that it can be left on the sink.</li>
            <li> If your Sonicare Diamondclean is acting up, even a little</li>
            <li> If your Sonicare Diamondclean is acting up, even a little</li>
            <li> lighter, and the brush head is a little smaller.</li>
            <li> The little niggles - the battery seems to last about 10-12 days rather than the manufacturer&#x27;s indicated 3 weeks and USB connector on the toothbrush case is a mini-USB rather than a micro one, so if travelling for an extended period, it&#x27;s yet another cable to carry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charger options are terrific -- the glass, the little unit instead of the glass</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve only had it for a little while I don&#x27;t want to jump the gun and give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> last average 3weeks which is so powerful(I had to charge O&#x27;s brush all the time which was so bother me!)</li>
            <li> and I knew they must be getting really bad and felt just hopeless since I could barely tolerate trying to clean these</li>
            <li> Find a seller that offers the brush without the cup, the base is fine.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty much impossible to do since when you are brushing your teeth water and toothpaste is inevitably going to go down unless you keep your mouth shut closed completely while you are brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fall far, and it didn&#x27;t fall hard, but now the brush head no longer</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve previously used a Sonicare toothbrush or don&#x27;t mind the new super-clean sensation, you can disable this feature like I did by placing the handle of the brush into whichever charging source you choose to use, and pressing and holding the power/mode button down for a few seconds until it beeps.</li>
            <li> I have reduced my previous 4-star review (below) to 3 stars due to the unbelievably short lifespan of this toothbrush handle.</li>
            <li> next time I went to the dentist, I had no cavities, and I also had significantly less plaque growth compared to other trips to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> It stands apart from all Philip&#x27;s previous designs (and yes, I&#x27;ve used virtually every one of them over the years) due to its \\&quot;high-tech\\&quot; visual appearance.</li>
            <li> Handle is ALMOST totally gapless: a gap appears around the power button (but all the other troublesome gaps from previous models are now gone)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> - Handle is ALMOST totally gapless: a gap appears around the power button (but all the other troublesome gaps from previous models are now gone)  -</li>
            <li> so I have nothing to compare it to other than my previous regular brush.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the hard fitted carrying case (as compared to the fabric bag affair used on the earlier versions).  </li>
            <li> Aside from the counter-intuitive design, it just stopped working after 5 months of use (out of warranty, out of luck), but even when it did work it turned out to be a big, frustrating step down from the older model we had been</li>
            <li> the single button to change modes as other reviewers do,</li>
            <li> This is one of the most badly designed things I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> And holy crap what an amazing difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can go for a less expensive model if you want to use the Diamond Clean head replacements.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is it only lasts a week before needing a recharge.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to last a really long time, so I don&#x27;t usually even take the charging cable with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> I know it is a bit expensive, however I really like all the features, the case, the multiple charging systems, the quality, the results, everything.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a bit bitter about it.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a bit bitter about it.  </li>
            <li> You just have to be REALLY careful who you purchase it from here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I can only use this on &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; - even after a few months.</li>
            <li> You end up just scrolling through the settings instead, and end up on some other setting that you will probably forget about next time and be brushing your teeth on sensitive for days before wondering why it feels so weak.  </li>
            <li> Though prices can vary, take this roughly $200 toothbrush and compare it with a $4 one.</li>
            <li> They have a 30 day guarantee so there really is no reason not to try it if you&#x27;re considering it.    </li>
            <li> After $3k in gum and tooth work a few years ago, I was totally sold on power toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit expensive but worth</li>
            <li> Expensive but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> You advance to the mode you want, wait a few moments for the mode to register, turn the toothbrush off,  put your toothpaste on, and then when  you turn the toothbrush back on, it will remain in the pre-selected mode.</li>
            <li> Since the unit is advertised to hold a charge for 42 sessions, I would not be inclined to waste a bathroom electrical outlet in order to keepthe unit on charge constantly.  </li>
            <li> So careful if you have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So careful if you have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> and it should last a few years</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the brush head sanitary covers do not fit in the travel case.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> it slips and falls when wet.  </li>
            <li> I have used rechargeable toothbrushes for years,  When the last one died I went a few month using a manual, that will never happen again.</li>
            <li> Recently I was away for a week and only brought a regular toothbrush, and it worked so poorly in comparison with this one that I vowed never to travel without it again.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will last a few years.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but I think it is well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> But it is a pity that the that travel case is so useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I still cant generate that allegedly required click upon insertion of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works flawlessly as expected.</li>
            <li> to stand behind because the products really work.  </li>
            <li> I happened to have a regular dental cleaning scheduled (by coincidence) near the end of the 3 weeks, and it took my hygienist at least twice as long as she usually takes for the appointment.</li>
            <li> If you are a traveler... comes with a travel case (lime green inside, sturdy outside material) with a USB charger so you can plug into your wall or computer (like an iPhone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is not cheap and I would expect it to last longer than it did.</li>
            <li> On the phone they tell me to not get handle wet,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why some people find the design not very thought out being</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of time spent on the phone with costumer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No real negatives at this point.  </li>
            <li> last setting if used for a few seconds each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the toothbrush head off to find the rubber gasket between the toothbrush head and the handle partially eroded.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> The package I received came with everything expected.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no question about coverage.  </li>
            <li> I thought of trying to use some JB Weld or superglue gel to keep the metal rod in place but figured it would destroy the mechanics anyway, and could potentially damage my teeth.</li>
            <li> I could already start feeling a difference in my gums after just a few times using this toothbrush, and I look forward to seeing if my hygenist notices a difference next time I go in for a visit.</li>
            <li> personally I have trouble receiving packages through The Post Office for some unexplainable reason,</li>
            <li> so I bit the bullet and spent the money.</li>
            <li> That might not sound like a big deal</li>
            <li> It is much more convenient to charge this way than with a standard stand up base.</li>
            <li> Would you buy a car that forced you to go through 1st, 2nd, 3rd gear, reverse and neutral to turn off the car?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the glass for charging, but it also includes a regular stand-up base that you can use instead.</li>
            <li> The 1 st one I owned was effective, but I did not like how stuff would get in between the base &amp; heads.  </li>
            <li> So the cup is pretty much useless unless you wipe down the brush prior to charging.</li>
            <li> I had a previous Oral B power toothbrush which used a similar small brush head and compared to DiamondClean&#x27;S \\&quot;big\\&quot; brush head, I would not hesitate to go back to Oral B.</li>
            <li> The coating of the toothbrush has absirbed the color and turned to a pale blue color.  </li>
            <li> Starting with the surprisingly heavy package that includes a heavy glass tumbler for the unit to sit in, through which it recharges through induction (there are several other charging options included).   </li>
            <li> This is certainly no bargain.  </li>
            <li> brush seems stiff enough to work well</li>
            <li> I have had nothing but problems with my toothbrush as something is wrong with it and its never been right.</li>
            <li> charge won&#x27;t hold as long as my previous toothbrush</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s making a constant noise, and I have to charge it every few days instead of every other week</li>
            <li> For those long trips it&#x27;s one less thing you have to take with you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete design failure.</li>
            <li> The lady I talked to was friendly and professional and was set to send me a replacement charging base.  </li>
            <li> : It would be nice if the charging system allowed the cord to plug directly into the handle of the brush for travel so you would not have to carry the small round base along on trips.  </li>
            <li> a side note, the one warning I have for people who use electric toothbrushes is to be careful brushing a tooth with a crown on it, as I have been told by my dentist that the vibration will break down the cement holding the crown in place causing it to come loose.  </li>
            <li> a side note, the one warning I have for people who use electric toothbrushes is to be careful brushing a tooth with a crown on it, as I have been told by my dentist that the vibration will break down the cement holding the crown in place causing it to come loose.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I have developed a bad habit over many years of brushing too hard, and because of that I&#x27;m getting some slight gum recession, so I decided on this to help break the habit.  </li>
            <li> They offered me a small discount on buying the whole kit again (no option to just buy the brush that&#x27;s broken, because I obviously have the rest), but cut off the chat before I could get the code - not that I will buy one of these again.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned in some other reviews, the one button toggle system is really not an efficient one.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical, but after using this one for a few weeks, I can&#x27;t go back.  </li>
            <li> The only annoying thing is, starting and stopping the brush too quickly may cause you to cycle through all power settings before reaching off, eventually you&#x27;ll get used to it, but there is no fast extraction in this case.</li>
            <li> If you want to turn off immediately after start, the single button steps down the power settings before turning off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not positive i like that</li>
            <li> As others have previously mentioned, this is a big inconvenience and nuisance and tends to make quite a mess if you try to see what you are changing.</li>
            <li> Rather disappointing to spend $170 for a toothbrush that lasts only 14 months -- at this rate I could have purchased a new regular toothbrush each month!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not only seriously dangerous, but also makes the product pretty frickin&#x27; ineffective.  </li>
            <li> use the white mode, which is 2minutes of normal cleaning and 30seconds of polishing the front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;However, unfortunately there is no indication that your 2 minutes passed</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised someone approved this ridiculous design.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I held off buying one of these suckers for so long, and especially on the idea that it was \\&quot;splurging\\&quot; to do so.</li>
            <li> The annoying part is that I was forced to buy a new charger, however this toothbrush is better than any other Sonicare I&#x27;ve owned before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for a little over a year and has has half the regular use  </li>
            <li> In hindsight, it was a big step down and a lot of money wasted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a sucker for design, and for that, no other toothbrush on the market can compare.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very, very minor complaint, and frankly, my only one.</li>
            <li> has been using ORAL B in the past 10 years, I usually buy a new set within 2 years and spent averagely 150-200 for the each Oral B</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that its hard to press the button and see what mode your in if you have the brush already in your mouth because your hand naturally blocks it in this posture, but there&#x27;s ways around it I suppose.</li>
            <li> Especially with the clumsy mode changing single button feature.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but I now believe there is a difference from other products.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;ll turn off the brush, other times it will toggle.</li>
            <li> And that leads to my biggest gripe about this brush (other than the price)</li>
            <li> other words</li>
            <li> The glass is also scratched and has a sharp unpolished lip.</li>
            <li> then any other brush I&#x27;ve used in my life.</li>
            <li> Turns out pricy brushes leave a ridge due to design flaw.</li>
            <li> But I won&#x27;t worry about it too much, I usually bring extra usb cables with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrushes and gave up on them all because they didn&#x27;t perform as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Hesitant and skeptical at first, I could not justify the &amp;#34;investment.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> YOURSELF A FAVOR AND CHECK THAT YOU CAN BUY THE BRUSH HEAD REPLACEMENTS FOR DIAMONDCLEAN (OR ANY OTHER POWER TOOTHBRUSH)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two oral b electric brushes in the past, and it&#x27;s just not the same quality at all.  </li>
            <li> other than that</li>
            <li> I have not tried the other cycles yet.  </li>
            <li> but I almost didn&#x27;t get this toothbrush because of one of the other reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of any other option I need...</li>
            <li> but I still like to use all three modes one after the other to feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> It still cleans and whitens just as well as the other modes, but does so without being uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still working my way through all the settings to see if I can tell one from the other.</li>
            <li> Pretty weird experience for a $175</li>
            <li> I am not sure yet about the \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; capability - the jury is still out for me whether teeth actually can get whiter by using this brush.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the FlexCare model for the past several years</li>
            <li> and I use the other.</li>
            <li> I thought initially that the diamond head was to small because of the amount of paste you can get on the brush</li>
            <li> I NEVER use any of the other modes although I may try one day).  </li>
            <li> any other features</li>
            <li> One of my pet peeves was the leaking of the other toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I got the DiamondClean for Christmas of 2011, 18 months later it was dead!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure about the glass recharging station, but I guess if you have 2 brushes in the bathroom you can charge both at the same time.</li>
            <li> The same feeling that I usually get after visiting the dental hygenist when I go for my dental cleaning and exam.</li>
            <li> you have a small mouth, you may find brushes with a smaller head than this easier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First, the power on button became difficult to turn on.  </li>
            <li> I cant believe I spent $200 on a toothbrush!</li>
            <li> One complaint I have is that my toothbrush died after barely 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I had a bit of tarter on my lower teeth (I am due for a cleaning) and</li>
            <li> I use the small one rathe than the larger cup option provided as I like the toothbrush standing upright rather than tilted.  </li>
            <li> wife has had extreme dental work over the years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other electric toothbrushes before but this thing is like the Ferrari of electric</li>
            <li> My dentist as well as other dentist</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before I bought it</li>
            <li> It is very expensive but a fabulous toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare within the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had no problems at all with over-vigorous brushing, unlike some of the other reviewers.)  </li>
            <li> One other annoyance: it sometimes gets noisy and rattles (though maybe</li>
            <li> I just wish the USB connector for charging it in the travel case was micro instead of mini, so I could share it with all my other devices.</li>
            <li> and I like the other two options for charging stands.</li>
            <li> and I can see the difference between the other brand</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is a small problem there, so I dont know how anyone can know when he is on the last 30seconds,and he is supposed to polish the front teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> of Sonicare: except for diamondclean, other brushes are susceptible to stuff growing at the joint where head meets handle.</li>
            <li> The first two failed this way after about a year and within 1-2 weeks of each other.  </li>
            <li> Not consistent.  </li>
            <li> It is a pretty expensive toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how it compares to other electric brushes</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that the DiamondClean is what Apple might design if they were in the toothbrush business.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This one won&#x27;t last much past July 4th IMHO</li>
            <li> I was discouraged in buying the black because comments said the black toothbrush heads were more expensive and hard to get.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to research other brands.</li>
            <li> Other models have a rubberized button that overlays the button</li>
            <li> I am changing my rating to 3 stars from 1 star due to their customer service.</li>
            <li> Have had other sonicare toothbrushes</li>
            <li> reviewer didn&#x27;t like drinking out of the glass because of &#x27;sharp edges.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> comes with a kids or small head and a regular head, a glass for charging , metal plate charger ,travel case ,usb cable for charging and a stand for the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike all other charging stations I&#x27;ve seen that have a cable wrap for management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen this in other reviews.</li>
            <li> When I contacted sonicare they would not take back the brush because it was past 30 days, but could offer a 2 yr.</li>
            <li> Money well spent!  </li>
            <li> I swear that you cannot get your teeth any cleaner feeling than with any other electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Plus this thing was pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li> and I am done with sonicare and, moreover, with any other Philips product</li>
            <li> My wife uses the small brush head and I use the other, larger one.</li>
            <li> You can use the head on some other model brushes, and I believe they all advertise 31,000 strokes per minute or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will tell if the head will break on this model as well due to the cleaning routine I utilize.</li>

            <li> will tell if the head will break on this model as well due to the cleaning routine I utilize.</li>
            <li> some other reviewers mentioned, I wish that you could shift modes before turning it on.  </li>
            <li> Combined with the other flaws I mentioned below and the price of this product, I now give it one star.</li>
            <li> I would not  use any other toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Some other compatible models: flexcare, healthywhite, and easyclean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased the Philips DiamondClean, here on Amazon (cheaper here than the 3 other locations I looked btw)</li>
            <li> I decided to use other brand which is Sonicare and diamond care is</li>
            <li> Just the fact that it charges in the little sleek glass sealed the deal for me the little blocks the other sat on was just tedious to deal with and clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it is a little expensive, but totally worth the money!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now if Sensitive mode is any worse than the other modes in terms of cleaning power, it doesn&#x27;t show or the difference is absolutely minimal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excessive, too expensive, and the brush heads work on cheaper models - but the other models just don&#x27;t look this cool.</li>
            <li> even though i have a new replacement handle in the mail to me as i write this, i ordered an oral b toothbrush as well, because i know it&#x27;s just a matter of time until the sonicare breaks again, and i&#x27;m tired of having to deal with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I was so frustrated by the amount of tartar that had to be removed during my last checkup that I thought it might be worth a try.</li>
            <li> her THIRD Sonicare Diamondclean handle is now also broken, several months out of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact that I have direct experience with 2 Sonicare Diamondcleana, and another 2 through second hand experience, and all of them break, is unsettling.  </li>
            <li> Finally, two different types of heads are provided to get you started (each head lasts approximately six months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After over a decade of using Sonicare, I&#x27;m seriously considering purchasing the highly-rated Oral-B Professional toothbrush at nearly half</li>
            <li> all to say, i now see the pattern that sonicare units experience low durability such that the premium price presents a poor value.  </li>
            <li> cow I have had it for a week</li>
            <li> As for the design, I can&#x27;t see or change the setting without the brush being active, and</li>
            <li> When wet, the brush becomes very slippery and difficult to hold.</li>
            <li> 2016 A few months ago, the brush began to perform poorly (brushing wasn&#x27;t as intense).</li>
            <li> well, my only complaint is that the brush is really small compared to my regular electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it about another 3 months the pulsing action had gotten weak again.  </li>
            <li> No more being caught out with a flat toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only slight issue I have is the tooth brush head itself is a bit too small, and sometimes I put a blob of toothpaste on it and it immediately falls off.  </li>
            <li> my attachment point for the brush head is moving up and down as if something has broken inside that needs to be attached to have the intensity as was there when new.</li>
            <li> The Flexcare is more aggressive than the Diamond and within months my gums were very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I will say that I keep a regular toothbrush around for those random days where I am too lazy, late, or inebriated to spend a full two minutes brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I ended up using a conventional toothbrush for the trip.</li>
            <li> Kinda makes me think it&#x27;s not super scouring my gums all those other times,</li>
            <li> I bought it because my dentist told me I brushed my teeth too hard</li>
            <li> I also know for a fact that my wife and I do not brush our teeth hard and we literally just let the brush head &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; over the surface of our teeth applying just enough pressure for it to make contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found it hard to predict when it would switch modes or just restart in the same one.</li>
            <li> the visit to my dentist recently told me that I was brushing too hard</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s actually quality hard plastic).  </li>
            <li> have always been a sloppy brusher before I got my Braun (small mouth, overactive salivary glands -- aren&#x27;t you glad to know this?), and using the Sonicare was a return to my sloppy days.</li>
            <li> of diamondclean: much, much less susceptible to mold and other grime that forms between the handle and brush head of EVERY OTHER MODEL!</li>
            <li> The first one failed to charge after 15 months - battery was dead.</li>
            <li> I really wish NO STAR was an option.&lt;br /&gt;Buying an expensive electric toothbrush like this one</li>
            <li> To the credit of Phillips, the company replaced the head (twice) since it was past the Amazon warranty, but after a few months of use, the same problem resurfaced.</li>
            <li> Given the price ($189 at the time of purchase) it was NOT worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the battery life last at least a week</li>
            <li> I spoke with a second supervisor, Lisa, who was outright rude to me on the phone.</li>
            <li> The cup was unusual and silly to think its a charger......</li>
            <li> To give you an idea of my oral care habits, I brush at least 3 times a day with a Pulsar battery-powered tooth brush, rinse with CloSYS daily,</li>
            <li> For such an expensive toothbrush, I expected it to last longer!!</li>
            <li> They are marketing these as if the average household can afford one unit per person versus one unit per bathroom.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the toothbrush heads don&#x27;t have a way of identifying which one belongs to who.</li>
            <li> All the old ones have at least a bit of rubberized material to help the grip, but the DiamondClean is slick all over.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint--</li>
            <li> I have always brushed and flossed twice a day, but I have still gotten cavities in all the common places--between teeth and in the harder-to-reach areas of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Santa was very generous this year and under the tree arrived this incredibly expensive and fully featured</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish the carrying case allowed you to store the brush heads with the plastic cover.</li>
            <li> but... it&#x27;s not worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase the DiamondClean because of several negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it&#x27;ll last at least twice as long.g.</li>
            <li> perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Battery fully charged will last you for at least 3 weeks brushing 3 times a</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> While the brushing works, the whole thing is over-accessorized, over-designed, and indeed expensive.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is not worth the $200 retail price.  </li>
            <li> I have been using various models of this toothbrush since the late 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure whether over the long term they will continue to get cleaner and whiter</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it is pricey.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the handle is wide at the base and narrow at top</li>
            <li> For charging it up at home, the method is ingenious: it comes with a cup, that sits atop a charging base.  </li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush, and after lots of hunting I took a gamble as it was unclear if the base was 110-240v rated.</li>
            <li> The cup comes off of its metallic charging base, so I just set the cup &amp; toothbrush by my sink and leave the charger in a more inconspicuous area.</li>
            <li> The noise got worse and the brushing action diminished until it virtually stopped.  </li>
            <li> The glass that is provided is cool, but I&#x27;ll be using the simple base charger.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, but awful usability.  </li>
            <li> It seems really expensive but break it down by days of the year and how much you spend on dentist bills</li>
            <li> I note this in particular, because this toothbrush is very expensive, and part of this extra cost is due to</li>
            <li> But as other reviewers have pointed out, it&#x27;s more than a little annoying that you can&#x27;t turn on the brush, or cycle through cleaning modes, without having it in your mouth already.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s happened at least half a dozen times in the last year.  </li>
            <li> Let me break it down for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would cut down on the time it takes to brush, floss and rinse with an anti-plaque solution.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m thinking that will translate to fewer dental problems down the road.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush beats them all hands down.  </li>
            <li> 7 months down the line</li>
            <li> Their solution was a 15% discount and they suggested a 6mo warranty extension for additional $, which is just a slap in the face given mine broke down after 2 years and 7 months.</li>
            <li> I was torn between getting this model (DiamondClean) and the one a tier down in price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to wear down the compact brush</li>
            <li> I feel let down after all that I have bought from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> That said I am worried it will break down again after warranty...</li>
            <li> It also is closer to the way one would brush with a manual with its up and down, as opposed to spinning motion.  </li>
            <li> So I really don&#x27;t mean this to be a regular five star review.</li>
            <li> The value to price ratio just isn&#x27;t there, it is cheaper to go to the dentist and make the hygienist work a little harder!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other electric toothbrushes, but none compare to this one!  </li>
            <li> Would not get any other electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> charging base is very unique also</li>
            <li> They lost a lifelong Philips user due to taking manufacturing shortcuts that they never made with past models.nnecessary</li>
            <li> I noticed in one review that people were disappointed that it did not come with a UV disinfecting light as some other models do.  </li>
            <li> But it is very hard to try to keep my mouth closed while brushing the back teeth, the front teeth or tongue.</li>
            <li> I thought that the cup charger would be horrible because I had the stand before that left things nice and neat, but I have to say that I like it now after a few months of everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few oral b electric brushes, very expensive too, and they don&#x27;t even come close to the clean I can see and feel from this Sonicare DiamondClean.  </li>
            <li> must rely on the very subtle 30 second speed interuptions to know how long have been brushing for.  </li>
            <li> On top of that base sits a squat little GLASS CUP.  </li>
            <li> few thoughts on other reviews I have read</li>
            <li> few thoughts on other reviews I have read</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but works really well</li>
            <li> Not sure about the whitening of teeth yet but just got it and upped for the black limited edition model for travel, just felt that the over handling of the case would discolor faster...</li>
            <li> However, this model is very poorly designed - the metal rod on which the toothbrush head is placed became loose and completely stripped the metal around it from the vibration.</li>
            <li> toothbrush is very expensive, and your basically paying for the cool charging technology, and the absurdly overpriced new brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I asked myself if it made financial sense to purchase such an expensive toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It has two buttons and it&#x27;s half the price.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Over the past 10 years or so, I&#x27;ve owned three other electric toothbrushes: two other Sonicare models and one Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> and they did not exacerbate some recession I have on one tooth from previous orthodontia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> It comes with two brushes, a normal-sized one and one that&#x27;s about half that size.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t go into all the product details and features, as I feel those have been fully covered in the product listings and previous user reviews.</li>
            <li> After less than a week of using this brush, the stains are gone.  </li>
            <li> Less dorky.</li>
            <li> Less dorky.</li>
            <li> How did we come upon that subject?  </li>
            <li> They also require a receipt regardless if you registered your product, as I said, they basically accused my Father-in-Law of being a Time Traveler, trying to deny the warranty when the toothbrush had been out for less than a year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> How did we come upon that subject?  </li>
            <li> They also require a receipt regardless if you registered your product, as I said, they basically accused my Father-in-Law of being a Time Traveler, trying to deny the warranty when the toothbrush had been out for less than a year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price of this thing is ridiculous, and the only way for me to justify buying it is because of the sleek look, the glass charger, and the travel-charging case.  </li>
            <li> Also, I got the black one</li>
            <li> so if I want to get black heads</li>
            <li> I previously owned a number of ultrasonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> With less than two weeks of use, I see the plaque buildup is gone.</li>
            <li> 6 months after I bought it, it started to make an odd noise.  </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t have put this review for just one isolated incident, but unfortunately my husband&#x27;s toothbrush deteriorated in the same way after about the same time.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the black color of this toothbrush based on the recommendation from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for one and a half years</li>
            <li> i agree with a previous poster -</li>
            <li> I had problems w/ a previous version of sonicare but this version seems to have rectified all the previous problems.</li>
            <li> I have now had it for about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> When the timer indicates via a faint beep and a brief interruption of the brush, then you move to the next quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> My previous model was Flexcare with the Sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I believe the handle of all previous models were plastic, and I dropped one once - it didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy the BLACK Version.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hidden lights, is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had two of these DiamondClean toothbrushes and previously, two of the previous FlexCare models.  </li>
            <li> it much less convenient and less advantage than the cheaper models.</li>
            <li> if you shop at costco you can get two machines with diamond heads and a uv cleaner charger and a traveling charger for much less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price on the Amazon site, the least expensive way to purchase it.</li>
            <li> charging usually means no bulky power leads or transformers, however in this case you have to insert the toothbrush base into a case which is unnecessarily bulky, so you still have considerable bulk to pack into your wash bag, having said that, it will easily last 2 weeks of brushing on a full charge</li>
            <li> One odd thing about the travel case</li>
            <li> Typical high-quality Philips product.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the electric flosser and that stopped charging after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> It is a bit ridiculous but ultimately the reason for purchase of this over the 5000 series</li>
            <li> although in the black)</li>
            <li> It is difficult to brush someone else&#x27;s teeth, especially when they are not entirely cooperative with the process.</li>
            <li> it looked like there was less buildup on her teeth.</li>
            <li> However, I received HX9381/05 with no warranty and for distribution to dental, that is %50 less price.</li>
            <li> I have had two before but they acted up or stopped after using a couple of years or less.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had for slightly over a year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> star less...</li>
            <li> The batery life I got from these seven brushes was typically 6 days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their brushes work well, but they stop working within a year or or year and a half in our experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so any time I can carry less</li>
            <li> I have it for less than a year</li>
            <li> even if slightly unhandy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I previously had the &amp;#34;Healthy White&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My previous toothbrush was the battery operated Colgate Sonic brand.  </li>
            <li> MY TARTER IS LESS, MY MOUTH FEELS CLEANER.  </li>
            <li> If Sonicare would sell just the handle for less cost and provide warranty, then I would consider that option.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t have to take a charger when you travel for less than three weeks.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tell the difference between it and the less expesive models I have owned and used before.</li>
            <li> I noticed one of the worst areas of my mouth was slightly inflammed but the next day it felt much better.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY disappointed that this critical component is missing, especially since it&#x27;s always been on every single prior model.</li>
            <li> The main reason I chose this over the other models after my Braun broke due to my stupidity was the design.</li>
            <li> Very cool magnetic charging base</li>
            <li> But the truth is, as long as you&#x27;ve had it in your mouth brushing for at least 10 seconds it will turn off as soon as you press the button.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> This is not true at all.  </li>
            <li> Battery life needs help, loses juice and takes a long time to recharge.</li>
            <li> not because I didn&#x27;t trust him otherwise, but because I bought an electric toothbrush 20 years ago; I won&#x27;t mention the brand--but I will say that it had a hose to squirt water between my teeth and made a mess from water squirting and leaking all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I had my first experience of finding my teeth still dirty after brushing.  </li>
            <li> Why mess up something that was freat.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to knock it over.&lt;br /&gt;However, a small unconvince for the quality cleaning of your teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a true dental instrument, but I&#x27;m hoping that it will help loosen plaque and whiten my teeth over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It got progressively worse and now barely works and drives me</li>
            <li> No big, ugly stands or anything like a lot of the older electric toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Our family is on a tight budget</li>
            <li> One thing that disappointed me was that I bought a white toothbrush when I really wanted the black.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now as I mentioned above, I had a serious problem when it came to brushing regularly, but in the month since I&#x27;ve had the DiamondClean, I brush three times a day, every single day, without fail.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a small base that plugs in to the wall, you put a glass on top of that and put the toothbrush in the glass.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty annoying to keep having to send them back.</li>
            <li> I previously used a Sonicare Elite until it wore out a few months ago after about 8-years of use.</li>
            <li> so even if you registered your purchase with them when you first bought the diamondclean, they suddenly refuse to acknowledge it, adding frustration to an already annoying issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not nearly as good as sonic cares last few tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a 5 star review, but miraculously just a few months after warranty expires, so does the brush handle.</li>
            <li> the replacement brushes are very expensive, the only reason I bought this is that my old model stopped working.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Sonicare toothbrush and the battery went dead after 5 years.  </li>
            <li> This one is very hard to control, a simple touch makes it start and spread the toothpaste all over the bathroom, the mess it makes cannot be described.  </li>
            <li> Mine broken down 2 months after the end of the warranty and all customer support could do is offer a 15% discount on the next purchase.</li>
            <li> have a small narrow mouth and found it hard to reach upper tongue side without clacking the brush stem into my front teeth.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most badly designed things I&#x27;ve ever purchased.t of your mouth: it signals 6 times!</li>
            <li> People with a ticklish palate and gums might find it takes a little while to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 Diamondclean Rechargeable Toothbrush for a little over a month now.</li>
            <li> One note: the bottom of thehandle, where it stands on the charger, doesn&#x27;t have the hole that the little nub of the charger fits into to keep it stable.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little price</li>
            <li> with little to no satisfaction&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> All the little improvement touches.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this product once I saw the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sunday, 7/21/2013 - I do a little research to see what I can do to improve my oral health.  </li>
            <li> and it charges in the glass that comes with it when you sit the glass on this little port that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> I find the recharging system a little cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey....</li>
            <li> but again, my dentist is amazed at how little build up there is between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They seem a little gimmicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vibrations were a little off-putting in the beginning</li>
            <li> when my mouth is feeling a little hairy).</li>
            <li> That little glass cup you see in the picture; yes, that&#x27;s a charger.  </li>
            <li> I can see how plaque is removed in as little as 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> mode once or twice a week to get a little deeper, but otherwise stick with &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste would then either fall off or fling off everywhere little by little.</li>
            <li> The angled tip was a little puzzling to me as to whether to have the tip pointing towards the gums or towards the tips of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working well, although a little louder than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> There is a little dip in the bottom of the glass</li>
            <li> a little cover for the charger comes with it.</li>
            <li> The box was a little bagged up, nothing inside was damaged at all.  </li>
            <li> am not sure that the settings on the brush do anything other than extend the time of brushing.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because of the price.  </li>
            <li> This broke after a little over 24 months of use.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist is always amazed at how little tartar build-up is on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> a little pricy</li>
            <li> I give three stars to the product for average strength compared with other alternatives at half the price, minus two stars for poor product quality (it died within 11 months) and abysmal customer service.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the common manufacturing defect associated with a loose screw in the mechanism, this toothbrush is overpriced.  </li>
            <li> They say \\&quot;30 seconds per zone\\&quot; (top-outside, top-in, bottom-out, bottom-in), but sometimes I fall behind schedule and the brush shuts off when I&#x27;m only half done.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s very frustrating to purchase something new &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The handle was rather large and awkward to hold.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it would be too large since I travel a lot</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a little tip on cleaning the brush: every few months, put in the dishwasher to sanitize.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to press it really hard, and it gets harder by the day.</li>
            <li> dentist recommended I go electrical since I was brushing too hard and was causing my gums to recede, while at the same time not effectively cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> course, the biggest disappointment was that the whole damn thing stopped working altogether after just a few months.</li>
            <li> What I like is this model collects less gunk at the base of the brush, the glass is easier to keep clean and the travel charger/case has eliminated the need to invest in battery operated models for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to using my 10 year told tooth brush since this one was such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> have a tall, fairly heavy toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> every few days this will give you the longest life.&lt;br /&gt;Lithium Ion batteries dont like to be drained but can deliver allot of power</li>
            <li> Use everyday.</li>
            <li> It now failed completely.</li>
            <li> For the price of this item, it is definitely wasting money for a poorly made produce.</li>
            <li> The brush will not fit in the travel case with the cap on.</li>
            <li> The brush will not fit in the travel case with the cap on.</li>
            <li> I did find that the cup was missing.</li>
            <li> took a few days -and</li>
            <li> Drawbacks are few.</li>
            <li> You can turn the gentle-on mode again by repeating the steps: placing the handle on the charger and holding the button for another few seconds until it beeps twice.</li>
            <li> there you have it, 4 Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush sets, 3 of us went through multiple replacements, and all but 1 of them after 2 years are now broken.  </li>
            <li> few things to know:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> No help from support because out of warranty a few months.  </li>
            <li> Not happy and will go back to Oral B.  </li>
            <li> Stopped working in a few months.</li>
            <li> Snazzy appearance, but the brush started splaying out within a few days.</li>
            <li> B.&lt;br /&gt;This has a few modes that are varying lengths of time.</li>
            <li> The brush is supposed to hold a charge for a few weeks...</li>
            <li> And they all are too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> was at the store a few days ago and say a display that included both brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cup charger thing is a bit gimmicky</li>
            <li> everyday.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It surprised me that the automatic timer is set for merely 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, both myself and my girlfriend noticed that our teeth were whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, mold will appear in the crack that&#x27;s left behind.</li>
            <li> Also, the button is in a poor place, I hit it often mid brushing and it would change to another setting, and you can&#x27;t see it while brushing</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Whitening&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34;, and a few others.</li>
            <li> These are not cheap but the results speak for themselves.</li>
            <li> It only lasted 17 months, and then started to fail slowly, and finally stopped working.</li>
            <li> beware the mail-rebate is a sham, have sent across the form twice no response even after 8 - 10 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a advertised--about to go a few weeks between charges.  </li>
            <li> It is now dead and won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I used the Sonicare for a few days now.</li>
            <li> cup really isn&#x27;t a double use either which I think was the idea behind</li>
            <li> brush remembers the last cleaning mode used, which is also frustrating.</li>
            <li> The travel case that it comes with is heavy duty and has an USB plug-in</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although, there is one thing that I had trouble with.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;ve subtracted 1 star is today (Oct 10, 2014) the battery in my DiamondCare has just dropped dead.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a few weeks before I wrote the review</li>
            <li> Some people have complained about putting wet heads in the case.</li>
            <li> With this sonicare I can see the build-up again and have to spend time scaling my teeth myself every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now today it is completely dead, no battery.</li>
            <li> But if you turn it on and turn it off after a few seconds it does not turn off</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few months ago.</li>
            <li> and then when it was almost dead would go orange and buzz.  </li>
            <li> This one goes from green to orange</li>
            <li> The few times I&#x27;ve had to use a manual toothbrush, I felt like I didn&#x27;t even brush at all.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of brushing her teeth</li>
            <li> received my product a few days after ordering (Prime) and promptly followed directions to charge it.  </li>
            <li> I was told my gums were in trouble.  </li>
            <li> I am diabetic and have had trouble before.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I use it everyday and have had it for three weeks.  </li>
            <li> and then the trouble started.  </li>
            <li> After doing this for a few months, the shaft eventually broke, the the toothbrush head would just flex all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m stuck with my nearly $200 toothbrush that&#x27;s useless.  </li>
            <li> yes, finding that out was messy.  </li>
            <li> but the battery is dead and not recharging any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But there are a few negatives as well</li>
            <li> I have got my order but it was missing parts.</li>
            <li> Also, get a Waterpic and use it everyday / night</li>
            <li> I wanted to tell you that my poor old Sonicare electric toothbrush has lasted at least THIRTY-FIVE years...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite customer service acknowledging that it is sounds like a common manufacturing issue, they hid behind the 2 year warranty period and were not willing to budge after several attempts.</li>
            <li> It too quit working in less than 6 months!  </li>
            <li> has quality problems - stopped working after less than 5 months!</li>
            <li> slick design, but  ditto to previous  reviews.</li>
            <li> not sure what Sonicare has changed from my previous model</li>
            <li> At 51 yrs of age, I still get out of the dentist chair in less than 45 mins, cleaning, check-up and all!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really hard after that to read &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; and distinguish it from the other words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My other complaint is that the color/paint (replacement indicator) on the brush head vanishes way faster than the advertised time of 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other negative reviews on this site.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have complained that they must cycle through the mode menu in order to turn off the device.</li>
            <li> In sum, friends of mine, who lived in U.K. and purchased three of the DiamondClean over the past few years have had similar problems, and threw out the broken units.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing, go back to the drawing board and hire a new design team.</li>
            <li> After 1wk of using 2x a day I noticed a dramatic difference in the tarter buildup of my teeth that regular brushing and flossing wouldn&#x27;t take care of.</li>
            <li> It completely boggles the mind why they didn&#x27;t design this with a plastic cup or a cup that attaches to the base - or literally ANYTHING sturdier and less likely to SHATTER ALL OVER YOUR FLOOR.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush has a few cool features and upgrades, including a setting selection template that is lit from within, a slimmer handle, and a metal base that resists mildew.</li>
            <li> we did some research and switched to much less expensive basic models from Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> Charging stands waste space in small bathrooms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a few Electric dental systems in the past and always felt like my teeth were going to be knocked out.  </li>
            <li> - the only drawback I&#x27;ve noticed is that lately, the battery life seems to be getting a bit worse...</li>
            <li> I have serious trouble finding them for less than $30 for 2 heads.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are very expensive and don&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> It gets your teeth whiter in as little as two weeks!  </li>
            <li> but it could have been a little longer!  </li>
            <li> Extremely frustrating to have to deal with every single morning.</li>
            <li> I mean, plenty of folks get by with electric and manual toothbrushes costing much, much less.</li>
            <li> When traveling there is a little hard sided case that has the ability to charge the toothbrush also.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been back for a cleaning or exam since then, due to a crazy schedule, but I have been using the Sonicare faithfully and flossing not-so-faithfully.  </li>
            <li> The previous two I had eventually had battery failure after years of service.  </li>
            <li> Very little inconvenience.</li>
            <li> The Diamond replacement heads are a little expensive but that&#x27;s the only negative thing that I can say.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;d look nasty, but since the design seems to be all about appearance and not usability, it feels somehow appropriate to deface it in order to make it work.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;d look nasty, but since the design seems to be all about appearance and not usability, it feels somehow appropriate to deface it in order to make it work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure where to purchase it though.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure what to buy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, probably because I&#x27;ve made an investment</li>
            <li> With this brush, hitting the button after I&#x27;m done rinsing doesn&#x27;t turn it off; it switches to the next silly mode.</li>
            <li> This difference is small and it&#x27;s clinical importance is unclear.</li>
            <li> I angrily invested in a second handset that worked for almost 24 months but gradually (and almost not noticeably) got weaker and weaker.</li>
            <li> - In my past sonicare toothbrush (flexcare)</li>
            <li> To recharge the handle, you stick it into an included water-glass-shaped container that&#x27;s sitting on a small silver charging plate.  </li>
            <li> at least it was when I purchased it few years ago).</li>
            <li> The usual issue is that the power button becomes recessed and will not operate the handle.</li>
            <li> Not sure why some people area having problems turning off.</li>
            <li> Buy the 6-pack of brush head refills because they can get quite expensive in smaller packages.  </li>
            <li> No more arm ache with 3 mins of brushing manually - like</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> I did feel a sense of resentment towards Philips for excessive price and/or profit.</li>
            <li> Mine, however, did not include the glass, but instead a small stand.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure where Amazon is getting these from, but otherwise no complaints.</li>
            <li> I contacted Sonicare and was told that I was a couple of months past the 2 year warranty and that I was out of luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether there&#x27;s any substantive difference between the two head types.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve seen the hygienist everyday!</li>
            <li> All three units have failed in what appears to be the same way: the power switch stops working.</li>
            <li> On this current unit, the power switch failed within three months.</li>
            <li> usually it&#x27;s because the shaft inside would snap,</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it is breaking just as often, with the same issues as with the flexcare:  </li>
            <li> I have one (1) tooth implant that routinely collects plaque; I am anxious to discover if there has been an improvement with this Sonicare as I expect.</li>
            <li> is that the handle seems to be too slick.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head is small which works well for me as I have a small jaw.  </li>
            <li> Overall, its expensive and im</li>
            <li> head seems small</li>
            <li> head seems small</li>
            <li> But..and this is a small</li>
            <li> - I was never able to do that before.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after a year into it the replacement broke as well with the same problem.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is too harsh for my mouth!</li>
            <li> No better then the cheaper Philips model.</li>
            <li> The charging station/ glass is pointless</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when it came to brushing the back side of my teeth, I found that the intensity of the vibration provoked the gagging reflex in my mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please be aware of Philips warranty; it stinks!</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say here.</li>
            <li> The brush head is too small.  </li>
            <li> It works no more, and its out of warranty.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about all the bells &amp; whistles...</li>
            <li> There are lots of businesses out there that sell the hardware at a loss because it&#x27;s so expensive to make, but make there money back on consumables.</li>
            <li> Actually it didn&#x27;t burn out; it just started turning itself on at random times, and never when I needed it to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For example, I don&#x27;t have to push the button to turn it on, merely push the brush head back.</li>
            <li> This usually happens after 1.5-2 years of usage.</li>
            <li> there is some small space between the brush and the head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is unbelievable, feels like the dentist cleaned my teeth every morning</li>
            <li> No more complain from my dentist.</li>
            <li> so I would have to guess which settings it was on, and recently it would turn on/off randomly by itself.</li>
            <li> have had to replace this brush twice, and unfortunately the second time my warranty period was up</li>
            <li> And then eventually they will say sorry your replacement only lasted 3 months</li>
            <li> prior to purchasing the unit i had read that the diamondclean unit experiences quality problems and often fails within a year or two.  </li>
            <li> After the usual rundown they said they&#x27;d send me a replacement....</li>
            <li> in a few weeks!  </li>
            <li> If only I could make this sad news a \\&quot;fun\\&quot; review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed through trial and error that if I have the brush pressed against my teeth enough that hitting the settings/on/off button will turn it off on the first try, but ifthe brush senses no pressure then you have to keep pressing the button about 4 times or so (advancing through every cleaning setting) before it shuts off, very annoying!</li>
            <li> especially how darn expensive it was.  </li>
            <li> No more Sonicare for</li>
            <li> I just use it as usual.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind some small rubber pieces of grip here and there</li>
            <li> And all the accessories it comes with are equally slick, but also well thought through.  </li>
            <li> I have used it twice a day for the past two weeks</li>
            <li> I spoke with Chris at Amazon today and he was extremely helpful and tried very hard to get Sonicare to help me out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Having cleaner, healthier teeth and gums will make your visits far less painful both to your mouth and to your wallet.</li>
            <li> Option is, although very expensive, buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> The brush does stand up right in this base.</li>
            <li> If you do not have a Sonicare DiamondClean, or at the very least some other electronic toothbrush, you are living in the Paleolithic Era of dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> negative point : not easy to change modes</li>
            <li> Saw a difference in less than a week!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to drop the money on such an expensive toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the only bad thing is that the replacement heads are expensive other then that, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have now spent over $200 in purchasing two brushes and now my third one now has a bad switch.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is that brush heads are expensive, but...</li>
            <li> Also, the body is slick and hard to hold onto.</li>
            <li> I tend to brush my teeth too hard with my manual brush and so the power brush on the DiamondClean actually seemed like it wasn&#x27;t churning as hard as I thought it should, but then</li>
            <li> I was disappointed how this one did not last very long.</li>
            <li> While it worked it was ok, although I agree with the complaints about the stupid one button that you have to scroll through, which was particularly annoying if trying to turn it off earlier than the set time.  </li>
            <li> First the charging base is sleek</li>
            <li> After a long and silly chat discussion with Phillips they agreed to honor their 2 year warranty and send me a replacement.  </li>
            <li> As I said, just realize you are paying for the privilege of using the Sonicare DiamondClean for at least 2 years, anything past that is a bonus.</li>
            <li> As I said, just realize you are paying for the privilege of using the Sonicare DiamondClean for at least 2 years, anything past that is a bonus.</li>
            <li> only bad thing in my opinion is that it comes with no useful directions.  </li>
            <li> and it was broken in less than one year.</li>
            <li> and art deco fails in both our bathrooms with limited counter space</li>
            <li> and I was hesitant because some of the reviews said the brush head was loose and the brushing was difficult.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to keep track...</li>
            <li> I also found it hard to keep the spray inside my mouth -- this was never a problem with the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;The sloppiness may have been why it always seemed like I&#x27;d run out of toothpaste froth with this one  before I was done.</li>
            <li> I have to use it to reach hard spot in my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is hard to hold onto.</li>
            <li> All the settings sometimes make it hard to turn off with one touch</li>
            <li> Registered product at Sonicare website, received confirmation email for it, and yet Customer service was having hard time to find me in their database.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the system didn&#x27;t allow her to select and send only the charging base, so she ended up sending me a full replacement kit and had me swap the base and send it back using the prepaid return</li>
            <li> It took one or two brushings to get over the ticklish feeling, and to stop whacking my teeth with the brush, but it wasn&#x27;t a hard adjustment at all.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month now, and would say my teeth are at least 4 shades whiter.</li>
            <li> Which means that you need to take days (or at least hours) off, if you are employed 9-5.</li>
            <li> At least this one is.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my one complaint -</li>
            <li> And, I was prepared with my proof of purchase and fully expected to wait on hold, then be interrogated about what was wrong, how I was using it, where I store it, etc.  </li>
            <li> When it wore out after three months, i switched to the \\&quot;big\\&quot; brush head and it really sucks.</li>
            <li> One of the coolest thing, to me at least, is the charging glass.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it for at least a month before writing this review.</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicaire toothbrush for at least 12 years and it never did the damage that this one did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that I have naturally yellow teeth</li>
            <li> If you buy this Sonicare Diamondclean, SAVE THE RECEIPT and remember that you will probably have to get at least 1, maybe 2 replacements.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this Sonicare Diamondclean, SAVE THE RECEIPT and remember that you will probably have to get at least 1, maybe 2 replacements.  </li>
            <li> This just seems crazy to me--it should charge overnight and be fully charged for the next use.  </li>
            <li> this or at least put it on your Chanukah, Xmas, or Birthday list ASAP</li>
            <li> Maintains a charge for at least three weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing negative is the button sometimes sticks when changing modes or turning off.</li>
            <li> For instance, the one button to rule them all can sometimes be confusing.</li>
            <li> The charging stand has been a disappointment and stopped working shortly after I received the product.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this one late</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about this product.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush cleaned very well but mine started making weird noises and the fact that it didn&#x27;t have a select button made it even worse, don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> My one complaint (about all Sonicares) is the auto-shutoff after two-minutes.</li>
            <li> The motor has a tendency to change gears or just sound awful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in Phillips for not having designed this very expensive tool with more care for their customers.</li>
            <li> Also, a battery that is not fully or near-fully charged seems to provide weaker power to the brush head, so I prefer to charge mine at least once</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these units since late 2012.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush after my hygienist &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34; it (my regular tooth brush and technique weren&#x27;t cutting it).  </li>
            <li> But not having teeth sucks</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t floss, cause flossing sucks.</li>
            <li> But that had gotten a lot of use - 3 times a day at least.  </li>
            <li> I urge you not to waste your money on a product with a poorly built interior.</li>
            <li> These thick cords don&#x27;t bend well which means it&#x27;s gonna hang in my sink with the way my bathroom is designed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Companies like Philips make me sick when they subsequently &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; the design, reengineering their products to fail regularly.  </li>
            <li> this same progressive failure mode happened to me with the flexcare unit after 2.5 years, which was disappointing, but acceptable.  </li>
            <li> No more traveling with a bulky toothbrush charger, yay!</li>
            <li> I mean the difference is literally night and day.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I go to the dentist EVERYDAY!!</li>
            <li> Gone, for example, are the yucky gaps on the front control panel that, over time, collect toothpaste, water buildup, and so on, and become impossible to clean and unpleasant to look at.</li>
            <li> how horrible it is to not have an electric toothbrush, as it feels like my teeth is not getting even 1/10 as clean as it was getting with the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> how horrible it is to not have an electric toothbrush, as it feels like my teeth is not getting even 1/10 as clean as it was getting with the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Failure to heed that advice lead to speckles of toothpaste on my glasses, clothes, mirror, cat....</li>
            <li> While this wouldn&#x27;t have been the end of the world if Phillips would replace a product I purchased only a year and a half ago which was dubber &amp;#34;their finest product&amp;#34;, they won&#x27;t (because they base the warranty from when the product was produced NOT from when I purchased it).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushing head is very small, so it gets into all the nooks and crannies</li>
            <li> I did not like.&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive and not a good value compared to other models.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> broken shafts, weak motors, and dead batteries.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product initially.  </li>
            <li> Very pointless, its timed for a reason.</li>
            <li> Small confession, I have poor enamel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making strange noises along with sounding like an airplance is landing and at a crazy speed.  </li>
            <li> The brush itself is very slick.</li>
            <li> After the first try, I hated it.</li>
            <li> In order to get a charge up through the plastic base and into the toothbrush, you have to put the toothbrush in the short little cup.  </li>
            <li> I also like the new at-home charger base for this model.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.    </li>
            <li> If I could return this unit I would and get a much less expensive Sonicare.</li>
            <li> After about a month with the toothbrush, I tried using the Oral-B again - and thought it was crazy how big the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; Oral-B toothbrush head felt, and how poorly it cleaned in comparison to the Sonicare DiamondClean.  </li>
            <li> upgraded to this unit after my previous SoniCare brush failed to hold a charge after 10 years of use.  </li>
            <li> Seriously I don&#x27;t brush my teeth that often</li>
            <li> Do you want to pay a ridiculous price for a shot glass to use for mouthwash then rest the brush in it to charge?</li>
            <li> If I had purchased this at the RIDICULOUS price, I would be quite upset.  </li>
            <li> As others have pointed out, the DiamondClean doesn&#x27;t have the UV sanitizer of the less expensive FlexCare models.</li>
            <li> Seriously consider your fellow bathroom users while you are getting used to the brush and flosser.</li>
            <li> They only last about 2 months so having to spend $60 a year on toothbrush heads alone is absolutely insane.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> heads are a little expensive.</li>
            <li> a little on the expensive side</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are a little expensive and my battery appears to be losing its charge quicker than it should.  </li>
            <li> That said, I do use the Gum Care mode because I have bad gums and I figure an extra minute of brushing them can&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> issue with the one-button design is that you have to select the cleaning mode while it&#x27;s turned on, and if you&#x27;ve ever turned on a sonic toothbrush while it&#x27;s primed and outside your mouth, you&#x27;ll know that&#x27;s a bad idea.</li>
            <li> My last Sonicare lasted 6 years, so I am suspecting that this was a bad batch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given that I brush my teeth 1-2 times/day, every day, spending $200 on a toothbrush is a bit painful, but seems like a totally justifiable expense.  </li>
            <li> If you do find yourself in the wrong mode (which happens often if you&#x27;re sharing the brush within the family) you can&#x27;t cycle through the modes with the brush off -- a messy prospect if you&#x27;ve already pasted-up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it was enormously frustrating, but at least customer service would replace the unit each time after 20 minutes with them on chat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> $180 for a toothbrush that does not work after 3 months is not a good toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which I understood was not good for them.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just stops charging after a few minutes</li>
            <li> Not a deal breaker, but wow, is that annoying.  </li>
            <li> noticed though that the headbrush does not stick completely to the base toothbrush when I put it on.</li>
            <li> base does not have to attach directly if you use the glass.</li>
            <li> I was disgusted, I am a freak and take the brush head off and rinse both pieces individually then dry them both after EVERY brushing.  </li>
            <li> Single button to turn it on/off and switch the mode is very uncomfortable in use.</li>
            <li> Then, the mechanics for the brush head became weaker, then turned off and on at random (not very handy when it has toothpaste on the brush</li>
            <li> It was a little pricey!!!  </li>
            <li> I was tired of cleaning in the nooks and crannies of my old charger base.</li>
            <li> At least the size of the base is not too big.</li>
            <li> However, the chrome charging base had a minor cosmetic defect; the chrome had a small gouge in it.  </li>
            <li> short, if you&#x27;ve never wanted to take the plunge for a high-quality toothbrush, you won&#x27;t be disappointed in this.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was one month past the warranty, and Philips wouldn&#x27;t budge on a replacement.</li>
            <li> a weak motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dumb me.  </li>
            <li> and it is at an angle; it&#x27;s very hard to read.  </li>
            <li> I tend to brush very hard when I use manual toothbrushes, to the point of making my gums bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle of this toothbrush looks kinda snazzy, but it feels lighter than previous models and I am afraid that if I dropped it, it would be done.  </li>
            <li> Customer Service over the phone was very rude.</li>
            <li> I see from comments online that this is a very common problem with this device.</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean!)</li>
            <li> Bought not long before, the base is broken.</li>
            <li> Bought not long before, the base is broken.</li>
            <li> I have changed the way I hold it to avoid the nuisance, which is a little awkward.</li>
            <li> I have to guess based on the approximate shape of the blur.  </li>
            <li> To make matters worse the indicator lights behave as if it is charging so you have no way of knowing.</li>
            <li> You need to go there in person to leave the broken unit and then go another day to collect it.</li>
            <li> The purported long-lasting charge (three weeks) would seem to make the travel charger unnecessary, but I haven&#x27;t checked out the battery life yet.  </li>
            <li> It is not comfortable and the results are disappointing.</li>
            <li> Has poor engineering design.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need the USB adapter, a standard 110 (220) plug connects to a power base which allows for induction charging of the unit.  </li>
            <li> and it was broken.  </li>
            <li> I am taking away 3 stars because of the lack of reliability, although Sonicare WILL replace the broken handles IF you have your receipt and it is within the 2 year window.</li>
            <li> I am taking away 3 stars because of the lack of reliability, although Sonicare WILL replace the broken handles IF you have your receipt and it is within the 2 year window.</li>
            <li> I called Philips product support and was told that this loss of power is not uncommon and that as the product was within its one-year warranty, would be replaced within about 10 days.</li>
            <li> I chatted with Donna, and Agnelo, both of whom seemed poorly trained.</li>
            <li> time the customer service rep will make it seem like it&#x27;s your fault that the handle is broken, by asking things like whether you&#x27;ve dropped it or used it to joust with a tyranosaurus.  </li>
            <li> such that it became worthless (about 2 years.)</li>
            <li> I get behind my front bottom teeth, and I&#x27;m noticing my teeth</li>
            <li> If you are tired of going through the manual process of cleaning your teeth this brush is for you.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m covered for the year since you&#x27;re supposed to replace the heads approximately every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Went through 3 broken toothbrushes over a period of 3 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is suppose to be their top-of-the-line premium product and they won&#x27;t stand behind it.  </li>
            <li> I got this because I had a plaque problem behind my front lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this product is so poor in terms of durability.</li>
            <li> The design for mode selection is extremely poor.</li>
            <li> Instructions for using glass are unclear; seems an unnecessary addition.  </li>
            <li> Poor design allows leaks into the body of the toothbrush where it corrodes the circuit board.  </li>
            <li> What does seem to be annoying is that you can&#x27;t \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the toothbrush into a specific mode.</li>
            <li> mine&#x27;s broken already!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No vent holes in the travel case, made worse by its form-fitting plastic interior.</li>
            <li> No vent holes in the travel case, made worse by its form-fitting plastic interior.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to it.  </li>
            <li> It is not for the poor, I guess, but if you can afford a luxury, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> on button for this toothbrush is poorly constructed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it, but I&#x27;m just slightly confused.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even worse than manual brushing.  </li>
            <li> POOR QUALITY product</li>
            <li> these unnecessary</li>
            <li> I gave only 4 stars because the charging base is not stable.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, Sonicare does not stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> ~$200 for 24 months is not a great value.</li>
            <li> I had no idea how poorly my manual brushing had done.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get over how dramatically the pain has decreased in my mouth after TWO DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charging cup seems to be an unnecessary piece to me but takes nothing away from the product.</li>
            <li> At approximately one foot away from the toothbrush, I measure 100 milli-gausse of AC EMF.</li>
            <li> My sister is not happy because it doesn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; modes.</li>
            <li> My old one, sorry I don&#x27;t know the model, had a UV brush head sanitizer on the charging base that I never used.  </li>
            <li> Spending over $140 just for the toothbrush every 2 years and adding in another $20 for the price of replacement heads is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sonicare designers: if you are reading this, stop trying to impress with all these ridiculous and unnecessary bells and whistles!</li>
            <li> It has a small round base with the cord that plugs in to the wall.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it develops an annoying whine while operating, but I think it&#x27;s connected to using a toothbrush head too long.  </li>
            <li> I noticed--and so did my dentist--a dramatic improvement in the cleanliness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth, to the point that I have had dental floss break and get lodged between the teeth (very uncomfortable and</li>
            <li> only bad is the price its quite expensive!</li>
            <li> My old toothbrush would build up mold and awful stuff under there.  </li>
            <li> However, after two months of use, the base of the toothbrush stopped working as expected.  </li>
            <li> Then the replacement lasted around a year before the on-off button stopped working, causing the brush to run continuously until exhausting its charge--then being unable to turn on again.</li>
            <li> However, since my teeth were very badly stained, I use three different modes/cycles every time I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really very good about flossing</li>
            <li> The other issue is the base had imperfections and scuffs.</li>
            <li> The brush head will not correctly fit on the base and it makes horrible noise and doesn&#x27;t vibrate correctly.  </li>
            <li> Kinda sucks!!</li>
            <li> Also, the motion of the brush head  feels less violent than the rotary-style toothbrush I had before.</li>
            <li> I can see how it would be annoying to have to click through 4 times every time you use it, but the guys at Philips are a little smarter than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt so unnatural and abrupt on the teeth that I thought it was bad for my teeth!</li>
            <li> Customer service are totally useless.</li>
            <li> Unlike the Pro Results Plus toothbrush, it is difficult to switch modes because the toothbrush stays on and you have to keep pressing to go to each mode.</li>
            <li> the modes seem silly.  </li>
            <li> have never reviewed a product before, but  I am so angry I am writing this one.</li>
            <li> should anything go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I was blown away.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the cap cannot be used if using the Charging Travel Case.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the cap cannot be used if using the Charging Travel Case.</li>
            <li> I know that sounds weird -</li>
            <li> Dammed frustrating!</li>
            <li> I dispute the questions of whether this is illegal to sell as some have said.</li>
            <li> She asked me for the serial number and what was wrong.  </li>
            <li> an expensive one yes, but</li>
            <li> I had given them serial numbers, model numbers, descriptions of the problem, etc., but they sent me the wrong brush handle and have yet to correct the error.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> but works great....and all the replacement brushes for any types of these brushes are expensive...</li>
            <li> Sadly it stopped working after 8 months.</li>
            <li> break, is unsettling.  </li>
            <li> i also had the battery fail to charge, as well as</li>
            <li> I upgraded once my last Sonicare toothbrush became rather nasty and couldn&#x27;t hold a charge after 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (kinda difficult because they are not in the US).</li>
            <li> Expensive, but</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> With a 90-day return policy I feel that they trust their product, and if it isn&#x27;t what I hope for I am not stuck with an expensive unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> someone who was a bit skeptical making the change to the Sonicare</li>
            <li> Expensive without justification.</li>
            <li> was wrong.</li>
            <li> I travel frequently to different countries and, without getting into boring electrical/voltage/whatever discussions as to why</li>
            <li> Mine failed after a time, it can not be repaired.</li>
            <li> After 11 months, it randomly keeps turning on and vibrating.</li>
            <li> Overpriced the day you buy it, plus the replacement heads are expensive too.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> get me wrong</li>
            <li> The cost of toothbrush is expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but what does a filling cost these days?</li>
            <li> I like it, however it does weird things.</li>
            <li> Eventually the batteries will not charge anymore and the toothbrush will randomly start and won&#x27;t be turned off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an expensive brush, but what price do you put on the health of your teeth?</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Sonicare.</li>
            <li> But one of those replacements just failed and because it&#x27;s out of warranty, I&#x27;m stuck buying another one.  </li>
            <li> implementation is flawed.</li>
            <li> If the product fails after the warranty expires, the manufacturer of this product will do nothing to assist with repairs, or replacement.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after six months my wife&#x27;s toothbrush stopped working and mine feels like it is fading.</li>
            <li> Mine was made in China, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the glass.  </li>
            <li> Because the brush heads are expensive.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads are expensive, though.  </li>
            <li> and I was skeptical of \\&quot;sonic vibration\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with a product your dental hygenist recommends.</li>
            <li> Brush head replacements are expensive.  </li>
            <li> Oh, sorry, friends</li>
            <li> so you have to press the button 5 times to turn it off, which is annoying as I like to turn the brush on for a few seconds after rinsing it off to shake out excess water.</li>
            <li> Am I the only person who has had a terrible experience with the Sonic DiamondClean?</li>
            <li> was using a Crest SpinBrush for a decade prior to opting for the outrageously priced &#x27;sonic&#x27; option.  </li>
            <li> WTF??</li>
            <li> Expensive, yes.  </li>
            <li> downside is this is an expensive toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and this turned out to be everything as described and as almost all ratings had sad.  </li>
            <li> (-1 star for being so expensive).  </li>
            <li> This product will not treat you wrong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very annoying and gross.</li>
            <li> I had this model for about four years, before it finally failed.</li>
            <li> Expensive too.  </li>
            <li> ALITTLE ON THE EXPENSIVE SIDE</li>
            <li> and the brush heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> However, the motor mechanisms on both failed after about a year.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to using boring tooth brushes!</li>
            <li> brushing tedious.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sorry</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are expensive too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> ( I know weird), after discussing with my dentist I found out the onlyoption for me is Zoom.</li>
            <li> Replacement DiamondClean brush heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> Just a poorly designed product that I suspect is built to crap out within a set time, so that people are forced to re buy.  </li>
            <li> Very poor quality of installed recharging battery.</li>
            <li> The quality is very poor.</li>
            <li> The quality is very poor.</li>
            <li> Very expensive toothbrush with poor reliability.</li>
            <li> This IS crazy expensive, but I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it I end up spraying wet toothpaste somewhere around me, and it&#x27;s very annoying.</li>
            <li> Now I miss it badly and really mad that the product is broken.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but then, so are bad teeth.  </li>
            <li> Mine just started clattering like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to get it dirty</li>
            <li> (get to dirty).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to tell them &amp;#34;That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re stabbing me with the picks, idiot!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But this blasted away whatever was there</li>
            <li> Unhappy to the point of receding.</li>
            <li> not like is awkward to change the levels and see the battery level.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so disappointing.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush handle looked slightly dirty, but it wiped off with a damp cloth.</li>
            <li> it is quite awkward in switching settings when it on.</li>
            <li> also don&#x27;t travel with the brush because I&#x27;m afraid of leaving it or losing it</li>
            <li> This one is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Too costly and inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Well, as of 2/15/15 the toothbrush went crazy.  </li>
            <li> I am so unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is one expensive tooth brush!</li>
            <li> However, the brush heads are expensive!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> very disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> BEFORE you buy it, otherwise it is just a very expensive item.</li>
            <li> You merely plug the base in, set the tumbler on it, put the toothbrush inside it and it charges.  </li>
            <li> like some of the others, my very expensive tooth brush is losing its vibration ability.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m stuck with a very expensive electric toothbrush which \\&quot;I\\&quot; (not Amazon) will have to deal with the manufacturer to get it hopefully replaced ...</li>
            <li> It is very expensive, but feels like the dentist just cleaned your teeth every day.  </li>
            <li> this is a very expensive toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> ridiculous!!!</li>
            <li> I admitted that I still was just as bad as I ever was about that</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t find something this bad at a 99 cent store.</li>
            <li> Problem is the On/Off switches go bad in about 1 1/2 years from purchase.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had one go bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> I saw this bad boy in the store and asked for it for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve had bad</li>
            <li> My bad.  </li>
            <li> today it happened again, so I&#x27;m writing the DiamondClean off as a bad investment.</li>
            <li> Really bad experience  </li>
            <li> Bad Reliability of this product.</li>
            <li> The timer makes me brush thoroughly every time, breaking years of bad</li>
            <li> This is atrocious behavior from a company like Philips.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the price of replacing brushes is  rather painful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned it for a year and have been shocked to find it</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed in this unit.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with Philips.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am greatly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> When turning it off, if too soon after turning it on, it will cycle through all the functions rather than turning off - which is sometimes what I want and sometimes not - seems like a form over function design decision. :(</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with O.So</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Undeterred (or just stupid)</li>
            <li> Design stupid.</li>
            <li> Incredibly stupid design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Carrying case is stupid - brush just sits in there all day and grows bacteria.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then, you have a silver, plastic base.  </li>
            <li> The glass cup DOES NOT attach to the base.  </li>
            <li> And, remember, the glass isn&#x27;t attached to the base.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s awfully annoying.  </li>
            <li> Really annoying experience.  </li>
            <li> The base was sitting on my metal medicine cabinet which sits below my mirror</li>
            <li> If this brush&#x27;s base sit&#x27;s on metal</li>
            <li> and I expect a base without imperfections and scuffs for my $200 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;What idiots designed the electronic mechanism inside this</li>
            <li> I also like the travel case and the fact that you can plug your charging base into your laptop.</li>
            <li> You get a charging unit composed of a base and a glass tumbler.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly annoying.  </li>
            <li> &amp; then I couldn&#x27;t use it because I realized the base was not charging &amp; hadn&#x27;t been charging from the beginng.</li>
            <li> I charge my toothbrush using the included charger base that goes under the also included charging glass, which is where my DiamondClean toothbrush resides between uses.  </li>
            <li> Selecting from cleaning modes is annoying.</li>
            <li> they are worthless in my opinion.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s the pain in the ass, after almost 8 months of use, the charger base stops working.</li>
            <li> I hate, repeat HATE, brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> there is indeed a gap between the tooothbrush base and head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you like it or not - no software choices to turn yet another annoying feature off.  </li>
            <li> I just use the supplied charging base.</li>
            <li> I hate it</li>
            <li> I debated just living with it (which I considered somewhat annoying on a premium product), or returning the order to Amazon for an exchange.  </li>
            <li> Now, the metal connector on the brush has broke and it completly worthless.</li>
            <li> I hated brushing my teeth and now with this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the design.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;I am very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I am very disappointed by the durability of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My gums we&#x27;re receding terribly from the use of another toothbrush.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE DESIGN</li>
            <li> And, it comes with a USB charger cord for on the road sue, and a charger base that you set the brush in an it charges without no plug!</li>
            <li> Disgusting, I know.</li>
            <li> The noise is  very annoying.</li>
            <li> Having to switch through all the modes to turn it off is very annoying, and for the price it should come with one or two replacement heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst product design I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is shockingly well designed.</li>
            <li> , they did a horrible job on software.  </li>
            <li> You bet - terrible software programming.  </li>
            <li> But this toothbrush is terrible.</li>
            <li> the worst toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> terrible quality control at Philips; or, defective replacement units.</li>
            <li> I purchased it that night and figured worst case scenario I can return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy</li>
            <li> We contacted customer service and although they are replacing the brushes, they were absolutely HORRIBLE to work with.  </li>
            <li> However, since having a baby my gums felt horrible.  </li>
            <li> I have had sonicare toothbrushes for over 10 years and the quality of this model is the worst ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What in god&#x27;s name were these a-holes thinking when they designed this product???  Yes, the toothbrush itself is very effective and the travel case with the built in charger is totally clutch.....but the charging / storage system for use with the toothbrush in the bathroom is COMPLETELY WACK.  Let me break it down for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have a tall, fairly heavy toothbrush.  Then, you have a silver, plastic base.  On top of that base sits a squat little GLASS CUP.  The glass cup DOES NOT attach to the base.  It just rests on top of it.  In order to get a charge up through the plastic base and into the toothbrush, you have to put the toothbrush in the short little cup.  The toothbrush is several inches taller than the cup, making the whole thing wobbly and top heavy.  And, remember, the glass isn&#x27;t attached to the base.  So, one day let&#x27;s say you brush up against your toothbrush while going about your business, and that toothbrush happens to be sticking three or four inches out of the glass cup.  Well, that top heavy mother f-er is going to tip over, taking the much shorter glass cup with it because, as you recall, THE GLASS DOESN&#x27;T ATTACH TO THE PLASTIC BASE.  And then, wouldn&#x27;t you know, you have shattered glass everywhere and NO MEANS TO CHARGE YOUR TOOTHBRUSH ANY LONGER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not only seriously dangerous, but also makes the product pretty frickin&#x27; ineffective.  It completely boggles the mind why they didn&#x27;t design this with a plastic cup or a cup that attaches to the base - or literally ANYTHING sturdier and less likely to SHATTER ALL OVER YOUR FLOOR.  If you have children or pets or people who like to move their arms around in a bathroom, this is NOT the product for you.  And if you do take your chances and buy this thing and then almost certainly wind up with a shattered charging cup like me and many others, then be prepared to call the awesome folks at Sonicare to try and buy a replacement cup, only to be told that the cup is the ONLY componentof this stupid toothbrush set that you can&#x27;t buy replacements for AND even if they do find a replacement cup for you, it isn&#x27;t covered by the warranty....even though this is CLEARLY their design issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for nothing, Philips Sonicare...</li>
            <li> working good the only problem I have when the charge gose doen it vabreate in my hand</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re at the dentist, but the dentist is... YOUR HAND.</li>
            <li> After my dentist told me I was literally getting long in the tooth, I decided I need to upgrade my toothbrush to an electric one.  It takes a little getting used to, but really is superior to brushing the old way.  The brush has several modes, and tells you when to switch quadrants of the mouth, to ensure each area gets proper cleaning time.  The vibration feels good on the gums and leaves teeth feeling really clean.  The case is slick and can charge with an outlet or usb, very smart.  It also comes with a charger stand or a cool little glass you can just put the brush in to charge.  Changed my life.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say I am a skeptic and brand loyalist.  I&#x27;ve used Oral-B toothbrushes for over 30 years.  My Oral-B electric toothbrush recently showed signs of dying on me, so I started investigating a replacement.  I&#x27;d seen pamphlets for the Sonicare in several dentist offices and the dentist and staff at my dentist office all used them.  I figured maybe they got them free for allowing advertising material to be placed in the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the Sonicare and when I saw the price, I immediately switched back to looking at Oral-B toothbrushes.  Something kept nagging at me, so I returned to the Sonicare and read the reviews.  I asked myself if it made financial sense to purchase such an expensive toothbrush.  Then I realized that the cost of repeated dental visits and potential of having to wear dentures in the future overshadowed the cost of a good toothbrush.  My teeth are not in the best of condition and I have several fillings and crowns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time users, please take the following under consideration:&lt;br /&gt;  1) DO NOT deactivate the 14 day Easy Start feature.  The Sonicare operates and feels totally different than the other toothbrushes.  I was tempted to stop using it on the first try even with the East Start feature on.  I felt a strong ticklish sensation along the gums...especially behind the teeth.  The vibration was also strong.  This was not uncomfortable -- just very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;  2) If you think you might have a cavity, start of gum disease, or sensitive teeth, start out by using the sensitive setting.  I have sensitive teeth and some crowns, so I was worried about starting out immediately with the clean setting.  I noticed some bleeding around a couple of teeth, which was an indication of the start of some gum disease.  After three days, the bleeding stopped and hasn&#x27;t happened since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to stop using the Sonicare after the first brushing, but reconsider after the results.&lt;br /&gt;  1) I read reviews from some people who said they felt as if they had just stepped out of the dentist chair.  I figured they were full of what it takes to make the grass grow green.  Now I&#x27;m one of them.  Not only did I feel like I&#x27;d just stepped out of the dentist office after a cleaning, but the feeling of freshness and cleanliness lasted throughout the day...even after eating and drinking.&lt;br /&gt;  2) I have yet to use the whitening and polishing settings and my teeth already look whiter.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after using these settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, in my opinion, this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I wished I had it when I was younger and maybe things would be different.  I can&#x27;t wait for my next dental checkup to see how well I do.</li>
            <li> Just after one usage...my teeth feel cleaner, some of the tartar or tooth film is gone and I am very pleased.  I am looking forward to trying all the settings.</li>
            <li> Short: Buy a FlexCare or EasyClean instead.  You&#x27;ll save yourself over $100 and have a better tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this toothbrush you must turn it on while it is in your mouth (this is what the picture instructions indicate too) or the toothpaste falls off.  To find out which of the programs you&#x27;ve selected, you have to read the little words on the handle that light up.  That writing is tiny, it&#x27;s about four inches from your eyes and it is at an angle; it&#x27;s very hard to read.  I have to guess based on the approximate shape of the blur.  Happily the program I use first has two words in it so I can make out the space in the middle; but it&#x27;s really hard after that to read &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; and distinguish it from the other words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that there&#x27;s only one button to do two things: on/off and program select.  The FlexCare has two buttons and I loved mine but I wanted the &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; program - which means that after I squint at the lights to brush my teeth I have to squint again to whiten them.  I can&#x27;t even learn how many times to press the button and just count because it depends on how long it is since it stopped *and* the button doesn&#x27;t always depress properly; so I have to squint at the lights under my nose.  When I put it under the faucet to rinse it, I have to press the button five times to turn it on and off.  It doesn&#x27;t take all that long but it&#x27;s awfully annoying.  I suppose that if you use a car that takes two or three or four attempts to start in the morning then this may be the tooth brush for you - although you might prefer to spend the extra $100 on a mechanic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* If you want only one program, buy the (much cheaper) brush with only one program; you can still use the &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; heads if you want to.&lt;br /&gt;* If you want gum care, buy the FlexCare.  It has two buttons and it&#x27;s half the price.&lt;br /&gt;* If you want the whitening program... well, you&#x27;re stuck with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps a magnifying mirror would help, or you could color in the lights for the program you want so they&#x27;re easier to distinguish.  That&#x27;d look nasty, but since the design seems to be all about appearance and not usability, it feels somehow appropriate to deface it in order to make it work.  Yes, I&#x27;m a bit bitter about it.  Very disappointed with the design.  If the packaging hadn&#x27;t been plastered with design awards I&#x27;d have given it an extra star but Philips seem to think the design is important so it deserves to be penalized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be clear on the *function* though: The thing works well as do the others in the Sonicare line-up.  This is a review for the DiamondClean version, not the whole Sonicare line.  My dental hygienist says that my gums and teeth have improved tremendously over the years I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare brushes and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.p, or you could color in the lights for the program you want so they&#x27;re easier to distinguish.

            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for awhile now and it cleans like most brushes do. It has nice features and very nice design. This wont be for everybody since the brush moves such a way that it might bother some. The vibrations are pretty strong...</li>
            <li> Great only the serial number on the bottom of toothbrush is not valid when I try to register it.  Please help me to correct this.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Son is happy, uses it twice dauly</li>
            <li> ...and i can see why...cannot say my wallet was happy but well worth the expense...save your teeth and of family-get this!</li>
            <li> Good product!love it!!</li>
            <li> The exact same thing happened to me that happened to \\&quot;Organic Mama.\\&quot; (Read her review above.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It flaked after one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;???  I will have to check warranty on mine- but I am so disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is an update on 7/23/2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review applies to the Dental Professional Model - NOT this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Phillips because I was still under the two year warranty. They said because I bought the Dental Professional Model- the warranty won&#x27;t cover it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO BUYER BEWARE. DO NOT buy the Dental Professional Model!! The sellers buy them CHEAP and triple the price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the one listed here if you are going to purchase one: Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE has been fantastic! Because my model was defective they reimbursed my entire purchase amount back to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still want to try the Diamond Clean again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure where to purchase it though. You just have to be REALLY careful who you purchase it from here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my mother-in-law because she has a fantastic stank breath. This toothbrush not only reduced the smell but also reduced the yellowness of her teeth. It used to take her almost an hour to clean her teeth with a regular toothbrush, but with Sonicare it literally takes seconds. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I can only use this on &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; - even after a few months. And even at that, I can not last the full amount of time it specifies. I had hoped it would cut down on the time it takes to brush, floss and rinse with an anti-plaque solution. It does not. I still feel I need to floss and rinse.</li>
            <li> Feels like I just went to the dentist...every time!</li>
            <li> way to go philips&lt;br /&gt;again philips surpasses expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this can be charged on the fly..by micro usb. (i say get a mico usb to mini usb adapter on amazon for your travel use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge the toothbrush every few days this will give you the longest life.&lt;br /&gt;Lithium Ion batteries dont like to be drained but can deliver allot of power Kinda funny</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  My teeth are noticeably whiter, and they just *feel* clean, all day long.  Also, last dentist trip I wasn&#x27;t yelled at one time!  Can you believe that?</li>
            <li> Love it. My hygienist recommend me to buy it . It is so worth It.</li>
            <li> I have owned four different electric toothbrushes previously, but this one is by far the best! Gentle on my gums and yet whitened my teeth significantly within a week!</li>
            <li> Love this product, so glad I upgraded from my previous sonicare.  It delivers a deep clean feeling for your whole mouth and the multiple charging options are great and convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of different sonic toothbrushes and this one is the best by far! Leaves your teeth feeling like you just left the dental hygienist&#x27;s office!! Easy to use! Looks great! Has more than enough options! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My dentist mentioned this product. Honestly makes your teeth whiter within a few weeks :) Strongly recommend to people. Ace toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It is nice at the beginning but them it seems to me that it does not work as it used to work... I like white teeth and I think they are just about the same. in that sense I think that the price do not reflects the benefit.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Not only it is better than other toothbrushes, but it teaches you to actually dedicate the right time to brushing your teeth. Nice case; sleek design. A bit pricey, but I now believe there is a difference from other products.</li>
            <li> Operationally the toothbrush is great. Quality wise, it&#x27;s a piece of garbage. The old one lasted  5+ years. This one lasted 1.5 years before falling apart. Very disappointing since the operation is great. Also, the body is slick and hard to hold onto. Will not buy another one until they change the design.</li>
            <li> While it worked it was ok, although I agree with the complaints about the stupid one button that you have to scroll through, which was particularly annoying if trying to turn it off earlier than the set time.  You end up just scrolling through the settings instead, and end up on some other setting that you will probably forget about next time and be brushing your teeth on sensitive for days before wondering why it feels so weak.  But my real gripe?  Mine just started clattering like crazy.  Deafening clattering, with a loose wobbly head.  Still so,e brushing capacity but reduced to begin with , but hardly worth it with the cost of the possible hearing loss.  Then a couple of days ago, it just stopped vibrating barely at all.  Obviously something broke in the handle.  It wasn&#x27;t dropped, or mishandled (haha) in any way.  Just a poorly designed product that I suspect is built to crap out within a set time, so that people are forced to re buy.  But, they might have gotten it a bit wrong this time, as at this price point, we are hoping for more than a year or two.  Customer service are totally useless. Really annoying experience.  They offered me a small discount on buying the whole kit again (no option to just buy the brush that&#x27;s broken, because I obviously have the rest), but cut off the chat before I could get the code - not that I will buy one of these again.  But I&#x27;m not sure what to buy.  I did enjoy how it brushed..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush. I have been using it for about a month now, and would say my teeth are at least 4 shades whiter. My mouth has never felt so clean. It is easy to use, stays charged for a long time, and looks slick on the shelf. Nothing but the best can be said about this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> hello!  i just received this item.  both brush heads do not \\&quot;click\\&quot; all the way in.  there&#x27;s about 1mm gap between the brush head and sonicare device.  i called the customer representative and she said this was normal.  so i asked her then why the pictures on their advertisements don&#x27;t have this gap, nor did it \\&quot;click\\&quot; in like the template said it would.  she said it was just for marketing purpose photograph and that the gap is normal.  did your sonicare brush head click in all the way or does yours have this gap too?  thank you for your time and have a great day!</li>
            <li> I thought the Sonicare Elite was a great toothbrush, and it was. The Diamondclean has surpassed the performance of the Elite and has also surpassed my expectations.  To be able to charge my toothbrush from my laptop, while its in its carrying case...wow! No more traveling with a bulky toothbrush charger, yay!</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush, and I have to say it is a huge step forward- and I loved my first one. Once you have gotten used to using a Sonicare toothbrush your teeth never feel quite as clean from manual brushing, because they aren&#x27;t. I love how clean my teeth feel after, its honestly like I just got a professional cleaning at the dentist. The new design is sleek and clean; I love the all white look and the lit up settings, real classy. The new charging dock is pretty slick look too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that some people had issues with the multiple settings on the toothbrush. I&#x27;m not sure if they wrote their reviews after only one use, but once you click through to the setting you want, it automatically keeps that setting as the default the next time you use it. For example, the first time I used it I had to click once to turn it on, and then three more times to get to the \\&quot;Gum care\\&quot; setting. After going through the full cycle (3 min) it turns off like it should. The next time I pressed \\&quot;on\\&quot; it started right at the \\&quot;gum care\\&quot; setting, and it has for the few weeks that I&#x27;ve had the toothbrush. I can see how it would be annoying to have to click through 4 times every time you use it, but the guys at Philips are a little smarter than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of how great it makes my teeth feel, it is it also is a great motivator for me to floss more- I&#x27;m not sure why, probably because I&#x27;ve made an investment and I want to see the greatest return. 100% Recommend. You will never go back once you&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> When I received this I found out that it was a model that was for a dental office.  It was in funny packaging, but works great, keeps my teeth happy and clean, and ended up costing about $75 less than I could find elsewhere!  Nice buy, but if you don&#x27;t get expedited shipping it takes a long time to get.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this toothbrush after reading all of the reviews and seeing photographs of it. I loved the sleek, minimal look of the entire kit and decided to order one, despite the expensive price tag. Upon unboxing, I was really impressed with the included accessories (especially the charging travel case, wow!). The compact charging stand (if you didn&#x27;t want to use the larger glass cup) was a bit loose fitting on both top and bottom sides, but I decided I was able to live with that.   When I opened the travel case to reveal the actual toothbrush, I wasn&#x27;t nearly as impressed. The material they used (a soft, matte, plastic) just felt cheap to the touch. It is however, much more grippy when wet. As mentioned in some other reviews, the one button toggle system is really not an efficient one. Sometimes it&#x27;ll turn off the brush, other times it will toggle. I wasn&#x27;t able to get it to consistently do what I wanted. Then there&#x27;s the matter of the gap between the brush head and the handle. Again, this has been mentioned before, but unlike ALL of the photographs of the product, there is a 1-2mm gap that (in my opinion), ruins the refined and polished look of the unit as a whole. I understand that it doesn&#x27;t affect the functionality of the brush, and that space is necessary for the head to vibrate, but the ultrasonic motor could get away with just a hairline with the way that it operates. I just felt that the build quality was just not there. I have used both Sonicare and Braun units in the past, but this one just seems particularly off. I also don&#x27;t care for the fact that the unit is manufactured in China, unlike the German-made Braun brushes (there is an inherent difference in feel between the two).  Overall, it&#x27;s still a great functioning sonic toothbrush -- I was just expecting a bit more for the price I paid. I&#x27;m debating on whether to just downgrade to the model just below this one, as the extra cost doesn&#x27;t really seem to be worth it.</li>
            <li> Unlike the Pro Results Plus toothbrush, it is difficult to switch modes because the toothbrush stays on and you have to keep pressing to go to each mode.</li>
            <li> Over the past 10 years or so, I&#x27;ve owned three other electric toothbrushes: two other Sonicare models and one Oral-B.  This is my favorite, though it cost twice as much as any other.  It might be worth the incredible price difference for these features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It can be charged via USB (very handy for international travel because the normal Sonicare does not accept 220V).&lt;br /&gt;- I like the QuadPacer feature (also available on some other Sonicare models), because it lets me think less while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;- The toothbrush is lighter than other Sonicare models (about the same as the Oral-B).&lt;br /&gt;- The [[ASIN:B0052JN8QM DiamondClean brush]] material is finer than other Sonicare heads; it feels like it might clean a little better.&lt;br /&gt;- The replacement head is smaller than other Sonicare models.&lt;br /&gt;- Includes an attractive carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;- In my opinion, the unit is more attractive than any other brush I&#x27;ve seen; it just looks good on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the modes seem silly.  That said, I do use the Gum Care mode because I have bad gums and I figure an extra minute of brushing them can&#x27;t hurt.  And that leads to my biggest gripe about this brush (other than the price): There is no way to switch modes without turning the brush on, and there is no way to turn the brush off without switching modes.  To switch from the Normal mode to the Gum Care mode, I have to put toothpaste on the brush, put it in my mouth, and then hit the button 4 times.  After brushing, I like to rinse the brush and then run it for a couple seconds to shake off the excess water.  With this brush, hitting the button after I&#x27;m done rinsing doesn&#x27;t turn it off; it switches to the next silly mode.</li>
            <li> Good produck but so expensive... I bought also Oral-B 2000 after this to combine both of them. It&#x27;s a good idea-) In general I am satisfied..-)</li>
            <li> This brush gives me that fresh mouth feeling I could only get from the dentist before...also remarkable improvements in gum health.  If I would have known how good it was would have bought a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have used one model or another of the Philips Sonicare for over 8 years.  I am now pleased to say that my Hygentist is very pleased with my clean teeth for once.  I&#x27;m not really very good about flossing so she was always on me that I should floss that I wouldn&#x27;t have so much plaque every 6 months if I did.  Well I purchased the Philips Sonic Diamond Clean in January &#x27;12.  I just went to see my dentist and Hygentist.  Both commented how nice my teeth were.  They both said so you must be flossing now!!  I admitted that I still was just as bad as I ever was about that but I was now using the top of line PS Diamond Clean.  They couldn&#x27;t believe how well it cleaned.  My hygentist said \\&quot;I would NEVER tell anyone not to floss...but it sure isn&#x27;t hurting you\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m thrilled and will keep using this until PS comes out with something better than this.  Love Phillips Sonicare!![[ASIN:B0052JN7XG Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> Although I was very happy with this product, it has effectively died after two and a half years.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service says the most they can do is to offer a coupon for 10% to 15% off a  new unit.&lt;br /&gt;This response does not meet my definition of customer service or responsiveness to a defect in the product.&lt;br /&gt;I have never reviewed a product before, but  I am so angry I am writing this one.</li>
            <li> It might be a good toothbrush, but it&#x27;s not for me. I am wearing braces.</li>
            <li> Use everyday. Has a USB cable to recharge on your laptop! I think the glass cup it sits in is a bit silly, serves no real purpose and takes up too much space near my sink. Also, I don&#x27;t like to leave my toothbrush bristles out in the bathroom, as I read when you flush the toilet an unseen mist is sent through the room. Not as sanitary using it that way, and I keep it in my case. Great for travel and does a great job, worth the price. I like the various settings that run through cleaning, whitening, gum care, sensitive and I can use it to clean my tongue with my problem. Worth the price over cheaper brands. Top notch.</li>
            <li> No Complaints!! Really like Sonicare</li>
            <li> I began using a power brush about ten years ago. Since then, I&#x27;ve entered and graduated dental hygiene school and come to value power brushes as a great tool for everyone to improve their oral health. Even though it is possible to maintain a healthy mouth with a manual brush, it is more difficult and, for some people, not possible (due to coordination issues, arthritis, etc.). My first ten years of power brushing was with Oral B products (I&#x27;ve owned two of their models). I loved their brushes and felt they kept my teeth perfectly plaque-free and they did not exacerbate some recession I have on one tooth from previous orthodontia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got my DiamondClean while I was in hygiene school and I was a convert. The Sonicare seems much gentler than the Oral B brushes. At first it was a bit ticklish but I realized it was because I was so used to the more jarring sensation of the Oral B. The DiamondClean is aesthetically pleasing and the chargeable travel case is super convenient (and cute!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just break something down for anyone who is trying to decide between this and a comparable Oral B brush: They will both remove plaque if you use them correctly, for the full two minutes twice per day. Nothing will save you if you do not use these things the way they are meant to be used. There are plenty of studies available that support one type of power brush technology versus another, but nothing is clinically significant. That means that neither the Oral B nor the Sonicare is so vastly superior in bacterial plaque biofilm removal that I could recommend one over the other to my patients, based on that criterion alone. If you use the brushes correctly you can keep your mouth perfectly healthy (e.g: Prevent gum disease/periodontal disease if you don&#x27;t already have it and improve your ability to control periodontitis if you&#x27;ve been diagnosed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A systematic review was conducted by the Cochrane Library and this is the conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;There issome evidence that rotation oscillation brushes reduce plaque and gingivitis more than side to side brushes in the short term. This difference is small and it&#x27;s clinical importance is unclear. Further trials of good quality are required to assess the superiority of other modes of action for powered toothbrushes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, until there is more conclusive evidence, everyone should use the brush that they find most comfortable. My husband prefers the Oral B, FWIT. He just likes the little round brush head and, for whatever reason, likes the more jarring sensation from that brush.</li>
            <li> Expensive refills, but worth it!  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Never thought I would indulge in an electric toothbrush, but I have only been using this since December 7th, and I won&#x27;t be going back to a manual.....EVER!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He said he wants to die with all his teeth. He said it was the best present ever and he is very picky!</li>
            <li> This is number 2. The first one failed to charge after 15 months - battery was dead. I angrily invested in a second handset that worked for almost 24 months but gradually (and almost not noticeably) got weaker and weaker. It now failed completely. Naturally, the handset is completely sealed with no non.destructive way to change the battery. The latter are freely available for about $15 on the web but you need to dremel the handset in half, unsolder the old battery and solder the new battery in place.    Although I do like the cleaning performance of the Diamond Clean, I am not investing $200 in yet another handset. I now have two handsets, which are mechanically in perfect shape and am told by Philips support to throw them away after I hit the bottom of the handset with a hammer to discard of the battery separately. Ridiculous.    Edit: One thing I forgot to mention: what always made me shake my head with those handsets was the fact that Philips turned the principle \\&quot;form follows function\\&quot; around. The pretty, smooth surface looks great but is really not what you need in a moist bathroom environment. I had it slip out of my hands several times.</li>
            <li> Great brushing action, but the material is very slippery unless wet (which is odd but true). The shape of the handle is wide at the base and narrow at top so it has a natural tendency to escape your grip. If your hands are dry and the handle is dry, it will slip out of your hand before you even know what is happening. I run some water over the handle now and find that it adds a tacky feel that helps a lot. It has a visually sexy design, but ergonomics could be improved by adding a ridge or contour to grip the handle better. Overall I am happy with the results I get.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the Sonocare as it seems to do a better job caring for my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> My gums we&#x27;re receding terribly from the use of another toothbrush. Bought this and in less than a week they are back to normal. Teeth stay clean (like dentist clean) even after eating meals. This is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;White&amp;#34; function is fantastic.  2 minutes of brushing your teeth normally then 30 seconds of polishing your front teeth.  Not having to put it on a normal charger is a big win.  I just throw it in the cup and go.</li>
            <li> As described. Quite different from older style &amp;#34;electric toothbrushes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and find they are the best on the market.  your teeth feel cleaner and they are just more powerful than other brands.  they last well and Philips have excellent customer service should anything go wrong.  If you&#x27;re questioning the hefty price tag, get one of the cheaper models, however I&#x27;ve tried three of the current range and all are good toothbrushes.  The look and feel of this model is the best in my opinion, and the charger is brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy a Sonicare and I&#x27;m very happy that I spent the extra money to get the Diamond Clean model.</li>
            <li> Forget going to the dentist and wondering if your teeth are perfect, or barely passing the exam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the single unit you&#x27;ll need to keep your mouth up to par.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick review of the &#x27;clean&#x27; setting:Thirty second intervals update you on what side of your mouth needs to be glorified, after a two minute adventure you are left with a feel that only a doctor&#x27;s office can attain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is worth the expense, dental work is overpriced, as you know; this solves that headache in the future by fighting it in the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the third Sonicare I&#x27;ve purchased, the first DiamondClean: to which I will avail: my favorite toothbrush of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;six stars if they had it.</li>
            <li> I simply can&#x27;t get over what a tremendous toothbrush this is. Let me put it like this: after using it my teeth feel as clean as when I go to the dentist for a professional cleaning. I already had an Oral B electric toothbrush, but while it did a very nice job of cleaning my teeth, it was not even as remotely effective as this Philips Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush comes with a host of bells and whistles, but I don&#x27;t want to focus on those - though I will add that I love the different settings. I mainly use the setting for \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; but I also use the one for \\&quot;Gum Care\\&quot; at least once a day. And I also love the travel case, which has a USB connector so that you can recharge your toothbrush via USB cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As nice as the bells and whistles are, the main thing is how it cleans, and at this it excels unlike any toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. This Philips cleans my teeth so thoroughly that I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. I actually look forward to my next dentist appointment to see if they agree at what an extraordinary job this toothbrush does cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me put this another way. Though prices can vary, take this roughly $200 toothbrush and compare it with a $4 one. The $200 is the better bargain. I actually think you get more bang for the buck. Even though I got this for free for taking part of the Vine Program, I will never, ever be without a Sonicare again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I&#x27;m a rabid fan of this toothbrush. One can look through my reviews and I am often a fan of this or that, though I also am not afraid to be honest about a bad product. I wish that Amazon would allow reviewers to designate each year one item to be their Item of the Year, allowing you to put a rosette (like the Penguin Classical Music guide) beside it. This would get such a rosette. So I really don&#x27;t mean this to be a regular five star review. This is simply the best product that I have acquired in 2011. Nothing that I have acquired in a very, very long time does so much concrete good, does so much to enhance my health. My teeth have never felt this clean in my life and it is reasonable to think that this will lead to decreased cavities and dental work in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, I can&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush strongly enough.oes so much to enhance my health. My teeth have never felt this clean in my life and it is reasonable to think that this will lead to decreased cavities and dental work in the future.     In other words, I can&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush strongly enough.</li>
            <li> great toothbrush that really polishes your teeth up to a nice gleam.  I haven&#x27;t really explored the multiple modes, but hey.. it looks sleek and modern on my bathroom counter.  I dig it!</li>
            <li> I was interested in this system because it claimed to do the things that I needed to have done:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Remove plaque better than a manual toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;* Give me healthier gums in only two weeks&lt;br /&gt;* Whiten my teeth in just one week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very carefully read the directions before I used this toothbrush for the first time. The reason for this is that my gums have a tendency to bleed, and I have very sensitive teeth. I found that I had no problem using the system, that my gums felt better, and that my teeth did look whiter, as promised, with no other product (such as a whitener) needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system comes with a charger glass and a USB charging travel case. When I read on the box that the toothbrush could be charged by placing it in the glass (which also functions very well as a glass to hold water to rinse your mouth out with), I stepped back for a moment, thinking I had entered the twilight zone! Upon unpacking and closer inspection, I found that the glass is placed on a charger, which is plugged into an electrical outlet. Whew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using this toothbrush, and feel that this technology will go a long way towards improving my dental health without increasing the time that I need to spend on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be doing yourself a favor by using this product! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner. I went to the dentist last week and she said that my teeth are in great condition with very minimal plaque. I love this better than any other sonicare product I have used before</li>
            <li> I recently upgraded from my old sonicare toothbrush to this one. I must say, I like it a lot.     It&#x27;s not much different from my old model (flexcare), but the battery pretty much died so I needed to make a new purchase.     The design is by far the best one out of the other sonicare models. It&#x27;s really beautiful, the LED lights on it look great.     On the rest of the reviews, everyone is spot on. But there are some flaws:  - The travel case is fantastic, but when it comes to charging it has some issues. It doesn&#x27;t always charge, and the brush base has to be in the perfect position for it to charge. If it moves SLIGHTLY the LED battery light will stop glowing and the menu options will light up. It&#x27;s not the most stable.     - In my past sonicare toothbrush (flexcare) I always would turn it on for a quick second after I rinsed the brush off. With this brush you can&#x27;t, whenever you hit the on/off button it will go directly to the next speed. So you need to go to all speeds to eventually turn them off. I&#x27;ve now learned to just shake the head after rinsing it.     - The battery life has not yet made it to 3 weeks for me, simply only 1.5 weeks (on standard clean twice a day)    Overall this is the sonicare quality, and a great brush. It&#x27;s a bit high, but it&#x27;s totally worth the investment.</li>
            <li> ***FIRSTLY A BIG DISCOVERY***: I bought 2 Diamondclean brushes and had a problem charging both, but only in one specific outlet. Everywhere else it charged fine but the one outlet I needed it to charge in (bathroom) it wouldn&#x27;t. It drove me crazy to the extent that I had 2 different electricians out and not until just now on my own, did I discover the problem. The base was sitting on my metal medicine cabinet which sits below my mirror (older style built in to apartment prob from 70&#x27;s) and the metal was preventing the induction charging!!! If this brush&#x27;s base sit&#x27;s on metal it WILL NOT CHARGE!! To make matters worse the indicator lights behave as if it is charging so you have no way of knowing. Shame they don&#x27;t tell you this, would have saved Philips a return for no reason, and saved me 2 electricians and DAYS of headache.  I&#x27;m a LONG time 10+ years sonicare user and have always had the latest model, last being the flexcare with UV sanitizer. Although this Diamondclean model looks very cool and appears to have a nicer brush head I wasn&#x27;t expecting that much difference in performace over the flexcare which is already great. Needless to say I was blown away. This is 10 times better than the previous model solely in performance. And I&#x27;m referring to performance of the unit in terms of power. Way more powerful. In all honesty my teeth feel CLEANER than after going to the dentist. They literally feel like glass.   Why only 4 stars? (Originally I gave it 3 bc I thought there was a battery issue but I figured it out) Firstly you aren&#x27;t able to select the setting you want until it&#x27;s already on and spraying your bathroom with toothpaste. This isn&#x27;t a huge deal especially if you use the same setting every time (though that kinda defeats the purpose of the selection). You literally have to turn it on (while looking at it) to cycle through the settings and select the one you want. And since the pause only works after it&#x27;s been in the same setting for like 10 seconds, the alternative is selecting the setting before you put toothpaste on, standing there and holding it for 10 seconds running just to be able to pause it, to then put toothpaste on it. I guess this is the tradeoff of having only one button.   The other issue is the base had imperfections and scuffs. I opened 4 more brushes and most of the shiny chromed bases are scuffed. The glass is also scratched and has a sharp unpolished lip. You wouldn&#x27;t find something this bad at a 99 cent store. In all honesty I don&#x27;t think these things will bother or even be apparant to most people. Which is most likely why Philips allows it. IMO they need to step it up in the quality control department if they want to continue to attract discerning customers that will spend $200 on a toothbrush VS the ones that would rather spend $50-$100. I&#x27;m the $200 brusher and I expect a base without imperfections and scuffs for my $200 toothbrush. Period.  I found out they are manufactured in both Thailand and China. the base was flawless in the thailand brush. The china brushes were the ones with the lackluster bases.</li>
            <li> This is a decent electric toothbrush. It does the job well, my only complaint is that the brush is really small compared to my regular electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fascinated by the charging technology. There&#x27;s a small base that plugs in to the wall, you put a glass on top of that and put the toothbrush in the glass. The brush doesn&#x27;t make direct contact with the charger. There&#x27;s a travel case, and you plug a USB cable into the case to charge it. (You can plug it into the wall or into your laptop.) Again, the brush is not in direct contact with the charger. I know that this technology works, but I&#x27;m a software engineer, so this is magic to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good brush, nut the price is pretty steep.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to practically review this product...after all, I&#x27;d never spent more than $8 for a toothbrush, so this product (despite all of its bells and whistles) had a bold line to reach:  was it worth 30 times a normal toothbrush if that&#x27;s what you were going to pay for it?  I can happily say that after a few weeks of use, you can certainly justify the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips seems to have thought of everything that you might request for a toothbrush of this quality.  In terms of normal use, it is easy to use and clean.  The five different programs are more than adequate for everything that you might want, from a deep cleaning to a quick polish.  The inductive charging system within the rinsing glass is very effective, although the cord is a bit bulky and may be difficult to leave plugged in at all times.  The toothbrush is equipped with a carrying case and USB charger for travel use, and the two brush heads provided are of good quality and hold up well to daily use and cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;ve never wanted to take the plunge for a high-quality toothbrush, you won&#x27;t be disappointed in this.  If you&#x27;re used to Sonicare products, this is the top of the line.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try an electric toothbrush for quite sometime, and my dental hygenist does recommend the Philips Sonicare, but I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend that kind of money without really knowing how well they worked.&lt;br /&gt;The opportunity to try one out for myself, well a great chance to see how this product works and if it really is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Well, here is what I can tell you: as a person who has used a manual toothbrush for most of my life, I felt a little silly the first time I used this. I had to \\&quot;learn\\&quot; to wait till I got it in my mouth before I turned it on so I didn&#x27;t spray toothpaste everywhere. After getting used to that, I found it quite easy to use and I love the high-quality look of it. I didn&#x27;t know if I would like having it sit out on my bathroom counter, but it looks very elegant (as much as a toothbrush can) and the cord is long enough that you can move the base around and hide the cord behind things on the counter,&lt;br /&gt;There are several things I really like about this prouduct and just a few I do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt; The charger. They give you a small plastic stand or a realyl nice glass to use as a charger. Now, I tried the plastic one first, because I thought it would take up less room. I changed my mind when I tried the glass out because all you have to do is place the toothbrush in the glass and it charges! So no toppling over. great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case/charger eith a usb cord. I travel a lot for business and it&#x27;s great to know I can bring my electric toothbrush along because the case doubles as a charger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;pause\\&quot; every 30 seconds so you can tell when to move the brush to another part of your mouth. This is great because now I can see I have not been taking enough time to brush my teeth. (it is recommended you brush for 2 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different settings. Clean, white, gum care, polish. I have tried them all, but I mainly use the regular clean setting,and my teeth feel so clean! I do sometimes swtich to the white setting because I am a tea drinker and would love my teeth to be whiter. I also use the polish after clean, for an extra clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked 2 of the regular brush heads instead of one regular and one smaller. Not a huge deal, but I probably will not use the small one and for the price it would be great to have 2 heads. They do sell replacements, though, and they are not too high priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, it looks like that is  the only thing I do not like. The Phillips Sonicare Diamond head toothbrush is an excellent choice. I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a high-quality electric toothbrush.setting because I am a tea drinker and would love my teeth to be whiter.

            <li> first of all, I love the design and how it works when it is not defective. The warranty is 2 years which some of you will need like me. It was awesome for 1 year and then the battery for me dies out. I called their warranty department and after several weeks they shipped me a replacement. Still awesome with the replacement. However just today, the replacement after a little more than a year again, the battery becomes defective. For the price of this item, it is definitely wasting money for a poorly made produce. From the picture, you can see the charging light is not on for the replacement brush. I urge you not to waste your money on a product with a poorly built interior.</li>
            <li> After postponing the selection and purchase of an electric toothbrush for 3 years, having been bitterly disappointed in past purchases, I did the research, considered my dental professionals opinions, and those of family members, and purchased this wonderful item - Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 Diamondclean Rechargeable Toothbrush. I expected problems adjusting to the vibrations such as I had experienced before with other purchases, but to my amazement, the brushing was smooth as silk and quieter than expected.  I find the handle extremely well balanced and easy to hold and manuever.  The design is quite sleek.  Cleaning the handle and brush takes very little time and the cleanup gives a product that looks like it is new.  Although I hesitated to spend that much money, I am so glad that I purchased this.  It was worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is amazingly powerful &amp; gets your mouth clean.  I had an older Sonicare, but started with lowest setting first.</li>
            <li> The design is sleek and beautiful. I have used it for 3 days and my teeth have never been as this clean, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  It feels like I go to the dentist every morning, best way to start the day</li>
            <li> One thing is for sure, this brush leaves my teeth feeling far cleaner then any other brush I&#x27;ve used in my life.</li>
            <li> 27 May, 2015 quit working, not even a year, these used to last longer, not worth the price.</li>
            <li> What can I say, this toothbrush is great!  I think my mouth has never ever been this clean using the old school toothbrush. Since I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks, I&#x27;m still trying out all the modes, but the whitening mode, I believe, has made some difference so far.  I think my next visit with my dentist should go very smooth and less painful.  Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase a Sonicare.......love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using electric toothbrushes for more than 10 years and this thing is hands down the best one on the market.  I purchased this toothbrush a few weeks ago and even upgrading from my older Sonicare, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.      I never thought I had sensitive teeth in the past - I just thought the feeling I had after brushing was normal.  Using the sensitive setting on this toothbrush gives a better clean than I got in the past and doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth feeling like they vibrating afterwards.  Also, about once a week I would have some gum sensitivity where there would be redness and or bleeding which has gone away.    The 30 second interval timer is great as I like to zone out while brushing and this makes sure I move from each section of my mouth when needed.  With my old school Oral B toothbrushes I would sometimes go over the two minute timers as my teeth didn&#x27;t feel super clean but I haven&#x27;t come close to experiencing that with this brush.    My wife also uses and love this toothbrush.  As of now we have been two weeks without recharging this thing - we are trying to see how long it will really go.  It comes with a travel charger which is super nice, but really, if the battery lasts this long when would you really need it?  If for some reason you do need to charge it it comes with the handy charging glass to keep in your hotel room.    This is really the top tier toothbrush, as silly as it sounds.  They have a 30 day guarantee so there really is no reason not to try it if you&#x27;re considering it.    I really do look forward to brushing now and I&#x27;ve been using electric toothbrushes for over a decade - that&#x27;s saying a lot.    Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> the Philips Sonicare Diamondclean Rechargeable Toothbrush is what it would pick.  I have used an Oral-B battery powered toothbrush for years, but this Philips Sonicare blows it out of the water.  Where to begin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the design and feel of this toothbrush is incredible.  It feels comfortable and very natural in my hand, the start button is easy to push, and the overall look of the toothbrush is sleek and minimalist.  It comes with a snazzy travel case that can also be used to charge it (though it holds a charge for three weeks) either by plugging it into a wall socket, or, get this: plugging it into the USB port of a computer.  For charging it up at home, the method is ingenious: it comes with a cup, that sits atop a charging base.  All you have to do is put it into the cup after use, and it charges right there in the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush assembles quickly and easily, getting the brush-head on and off is as simple as pulling it off and then lightly snapping back on when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush has several brushing speeds, including: clean, polish, whiten, and settings for gum care and sensitive teeth.  If you are not accustomed to a toothbrush that moves this fast, the first time you use it might be a bit of a unique experience. People with a ticklish palate and gums might find it takes a little while to get used to it.  But this toothbrush is absolutely worth it: after I brushed with the Diamondclean, I felt like I&#x27;d had my teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a feature I found pretty interesting: every 30 seconds, the brushing action seems to pause as a reminder to move on to another quadrant of your mouth.  After 2 minutes, the toothbrush cuts off.  But if you&#x27;re not done brushing, just press the start button again, and it picks right back up where it left off.  The brushing head is very small, so it gets into all the nooks and crannies quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now completely spoiled for any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Still using it 2 years later.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect tooth brush.</li>
            <li> ***Update***&lt;br /&gt;In barely two months, my teeth look markedly whiter. Two people within the last week made of point of saying that they can tell I have had my teeth whitened (I haven&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush is the best electric toothbrush I have ever used and I have owned more than a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number one thing I like is the power. This brush really gets in and does its job using just light pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular model has multiple settings: Clean; White; Polish; Gum Care and Sensitive. Except for Sensitive mode, the difference is the amount of time the brush stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polish is the shortest and keeps the brush on for one minute. Clean adds another minute for a total of two and White adds thirty more seconds for a total of 2 minutes, 30 seconds. I use the &amp;#34;Gum Care&amp;#34; setting which is another 30 seconds for 3 solid minutes of running time. Sensitive mode runs for 2 minutes at less power to be more gentle on teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an interval timer for each setting with short beeps and pauses to remind you to move on to the next quadrant of your mouth. Sometimes I space a bit while brushing, so I find the timer a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an &amp;#34;Easy-start feature&amp;#34; that gradually increases the power over the first 14 brushings. It would seem to be especially beneficial for anyone not already using Sonicare brushes, or electric brushes in general. For those replacing or upgrading, the feature has a by-pass option to get the full benefits of the brush day one.&lt;br /&gt;The Charging Travel Case is cool; the ability to charge the battery by connecting it to my laptop via USB is something I found very smart. The downside of the case is that it does not seem to have been thoroughly thought out. The most glaring omission is not being able to store the USB cord inside the case when not in use. I ended up wrapping the cord around the Case with a loose knot. It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but the case does loose some of its cool factor with the cord dangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Hygienic Travel Cap&amp;#34; is a clear plastic cap engineered to fit tightly around the bristle end. It protects the bristles while allowing air to circulate to dry the brush. Unfortunately, the cap cannot be used if using the Charging Travel Case. The brush will not fit in the travel case with the cap on. I use the Charging Travel Case all of the time because it makes the brush really mobile, so the caps became just two more items floating around inside the bathroom junk drawer. For later generations, I recommend that Philips rework the case so that the brushes with caps on will fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend the Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush to anyone serious about keeping their teeth and gums in tip-top shape.g the cord around the Case with a loose knot.

            <li> The best perches I&#x27;ve  ever made!!!!</li>
            <li> After $3k in gum and tooth work a few years ago, I was totally sold on power toothbrushes.  I&#x27;ve gone through 3 of the AA-powered $20 version -- they&#x27;re great for travel, but water ingress in the bottom always ends up eventually destroying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that I brush my teeth 1-2 times/day, every day, spending $200 on a toothbrush is a bit painful, but seems like a totally justifiable expense.  So, I bought the top of the line, which is this brush.  The main features which sold me are the induction charging cup and the USB travel charger and case -- they looked great in the review, and in person, are just as good as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new and even more expensive diamondclean brush head does seem to be an improvement on both the E-type and the proclean brushheads previous; the main upgrade is a smaller, more dense head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably wouldn&#x27;t have upgraded from one of the regular sonicare products to this, but as a new customer for the rechargeable products, it seems like the best brush on the market.</li>
            <li> I already had a Sonic Toothbrush and was very pleased with it until Santa brought this little Diamond.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this toothbrush.  This unit can be charged three different ways, very handy for travel.  The replacement heads are slightly cheaper. This toothbrush has several brushing setting.  I find myself brushing 2 or 3 times longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to find words for this toothbrush, but \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; and \\&quot;more than I thought possible\\&quot; seem like they won&#x27;t do it. This is the best toothbrush I have ever had. I know that sounds weird - after all, it is just a toothbrush. But it cleans in a way that I have never seen a toothbrush do before. It also is incredibly well thought out. The brush heads have wear indicators on them so you know when to replace them. It charges in the glass, so the handle stays clean and you can stick the glass in the dishwasher. The battery lasts, well, not quite forever, but nearly. The travel case protects the toothbrush and charges straight from a USB port on your computer so, if you have a trip that lasts longer than 2-3 weeks (the battery life) you can just hook it up to the computer with the same cable you use to download pictures from your camera to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one. I&#x27;ve had 4 or 5 sonic toothbrushes and nothing else compares.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the Philips Sonicare Diamondclean toothbrush. Skeptic that I am, I thought it was just another example of a doctor being influenced by a big corporation.  However, I was so frustrated by the amount of tartar that had to be removed during my last checkup that I thought it might be worth a try. Let me say that I have used an Oral B electric toothbrush for the last three years and hoped it would prevent the tartar buildup.  But it didn&#x27;t.  When I first used the Diamondclean, I knew this was no ordinary electric toothbrush. The brush itself moves at at extraordinarily high speed. It&#x27;s like having a hummingbird in your mouth. As a result, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the brush action that does such a great job or the sheer speed.  The result?  After every brushing, my mouth feels like I&#x27;ve just had my biannual cleaning. I&#x27;m really eager for my next appointment in Spring 2012 to see if my anecdotal impressions are borne out by a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> Unlike the previous \\&quot;Flexcare\\&quot; and \\&quot;Elite\\&quot; models, the \\&quot;Diamondclean\\&quot; model has been designed by clueless people who maybe produce art for modern museums, but certainly have never used the toothbrush for actually brushing their teeth.  The \\&quot;Diamondclean\\&quot; model offers five different modes: \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, \\&quot;white\\&quot;, \\&quot;polish\\&quot;, \\&quot;gum care\\&quot;, and \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;. You select the mode you want by pressing a *single* button multiple times. So, if you want \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;, you need to put the brush head into your mouth, and press the button five times. You can&#x27;t do that while looking at the display, because the handle will turn on on the first button press, and splatter the toothpaste all over the place in \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode, while you&#x27;re progressing slowly to the mode you actually want. What kind of art house goon comes up with such impractical designs?  To recharge the handle, you stick it into an included water-glass-shaped container that&#x27;s sitting on a small silver charging plate.  While this resembles an old-fashioned toothbrush sticking in a water glass for rinsing your mouth (\\&quot;How cute!\\&quot;), it makes the electric toothbrush lean at a 30 degree angle, wasting space next to your sink. There&#x27;s also an adapter that lets it stand vertically, but you need to make sure you always put the handle back exactly the same without rotating, because it won&#x27;t charge if it&#x27;s not 100% aligned.  And make sure it&#x27;s not located next to anything metallic, like a metal bathroom cabinet! Surrounding metal will *discharge* your Sonicare!  In fact, I sent the first Diamondclean back to Amazon, thinking the battery was defective. When the second shipping arrived and showed the same problem, I put it away from the metal cabinet and it charged fine.  This was never a problem with the Elite model, which was a great product for brushing your teeth instead of fancy-pants industrial design.  It comes with two brushes, a normal-sized one and one that&#x27;s about half that size. If you&#x27;re a couple, you have to either agree who&#x27;s using the odd-sized one or buy an extra one, which comes at about ten bucks extra. Yes, per brush head.  If there was a prize for the most useless industrial design, the person who came up the Diamondhead mode selector would certainly deserve it.  Also if there was an industry award for throwing a product on the market without any consumer testing, the Diamondhead would be a top candidate.</li>
            <li> When I first got this Sonicare toothbrush, I decided not to post a review immediately. Instead, I chose to take my time and see what the effects of using this product would be over a long period of time. After three months of using this toothbrush, I can say that it does have a whitening effect on my teeth and it does, indeed, promote gum health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first sonic toothbrush I ever used, and, at first, I have to say that the sensation in my teeth was unpleasant. I have sensitive teeth, so it took a little while to get used to this toothbrush. What really helped was the function of the product that ensures that the first few brushing sessions are less intense than the regular ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that I saw any whitening effect in just one week, as the promotional info promised. However, three months into using the product I can say that it definitely does whiten teeth. It isn&#x27;t going to substitute whitening treatments you can get at a dentist&#x27;s office but it does have a noticeable whitening effect. I also have noticed a significant improvement in my gum health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I appreciate the most about this product is that it&#x27;s perfectly suited for traveling. The travel case is very sleek, light and it charges the toothbrush, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great brush to replace the old one, very powerful and it charges very fast&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful and my teeth are super clean !</li>
            <li> I was so wowed by this toothbrush from the first use that I wanted to post a review immediately. I gave it a week to be sure. It&#x27;s a killer, in a good way. I have used electric toothbrushes and water flossers in the past and nothing seemed to be that exceptional. More recently, I have been using battery-powered brushes from the supermarket and they seemed \\&quot;fine.\\&quot; On my last cleaning, my hygienist recommended getting an electric toothbrush and she wouldn&#x27;t suggest a particular brand but said to get the best I could afford. I shopped around online and in retail stores and this seemed to be the winner. I still hesitated, thinking \\&quot;how different could this be from from the three toothbrushes powered by AA batteries that I already own?\\&quot; I took the plunge and I knew I had made the right decision once it was turned on and working on my teeth. The brushing action created an immediate sensation throughout my mouth so I knew it was really getting in there to clean. And my teeth felt cleaner than if I had just been in for a professional cleaning. Brushing is such a pleasurable experience with this Sonicare that I actually want to brush more than usual. It was fully charged on arrival and is still going strong after one week. It is sleek and looks great sitting in the glass cup. I happen to prefer the smaller brush head but it&#x27;s nice to have the larger option. This is a superior dental system that gets my teeth cleaner and whiter and gets me more motivated to brush. Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today, so far dissappointing experience. It seems I can&#x27;t get it right and I am splashing paste all over the counter. I did deactivate the easy start, since I have been using oral B model for the last 3 years. the Braun brush head is circular and never had problems with spraying paste. I am going to work on it and update later.I have had no issues with the Braun, it was doing its job well, I had two, one died and I needed to buy a new one, I thought I will try this one. Like the diamond clean I was using the top of the line Braun(or at least it was when I purchased it few years ago). The noise of this one is also kind of grating but again this  may feel like that as it is different from the Braun, and will take some time to get used to it. One other thing which is different - it completely stops after the cycle is over, the braun would continue and give 30 sec beeps, so when you were done with your brushing for 2 mins you could work on the gums for another min etc. Hoping I would be able to work it out</li>
            <li> The fit and finish of this product is absolutely excellent. I am a very big fan of the charging system and inductive charger in the storage case. I have only had the toothbrush for a few days now, but have been enjoying it very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works exactly as expected and does provide a good brushing experience. Since I haven&#x27;t had a sonic toothbrush, the first experience tickled the roof of my mouth, but I quickly got adjusted to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one gripe I have with it is that after the 2 minute brushing cycle the unit automatically turns off. I would prefer it not to because if there are areas of my mouth (namely tongue) that I haven&#x27;t gotten to yet I have to turn it on again. Last but not least, the single button interface means that if you press the button once the brush turns on, the second press (if within 5 seconds) cycles through various brushing modes. I like to turn on the brush when rinsing it, but end up cycling through all the modes instead of turning it off. I guess it&#x27;s something to get used to.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great while it works, however, it is extremely unreliable. The first one I had worked great until it was about a year old and then it broke. My second one lasted less than 2 months until it started making funny sounds. The same with my third one and my fourth one. Dammed frustrating! To their credit Philips keep exchanging them but it&#x27;s pretty annoying to keep having to send them back.</li>
            <li> I previously used a Sonicare Elite until it wore out a few months ago after about 8-years of use. After the Elite, I was using an Oral-B Professional electric toothbrush that I received for free from my orthodontist, until it died in a tragic outlet accident. I decided that was a sign to try the new Sonicare, and I&#x27;m very glad I did! The DiamondClean is amazing! It is way better than either the Oral-B or the Elite. The DiamondClean is compact, lightweight, quiet, the brush bristles are soft, and it leaves your teeth feeling extremely clean after use. I would highly recommend this toothbrush! If you&#x27;re debating between the Oral-B and the Sonicare, buy the Sonicare! The only thing I do not like about this product is the induction recharging &#x60;shot glass.&#x27; While I like the concept, the actual &#x60;shot glass&#x27; is huge--more like the size of a whiskey glass!</li>
            <li> A second unit just broke down in about two years. Even when in warranty, getting a replacement in Athens, Greece is a hassle. There is only one shop where you can replace the unit. It is located in a suburb of Athens (Nea Ionia) and works from 9am to 3pm, workdays only. You need to go there in person to leave the broken unit and then go another day to collect it. Which means that you need to take days (or at least hours) off, if you are employed 9-5.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. I really love it and it cleans the teeth just perfect, leaving my mouth feeling fresher and cleaner longer. The only downside is the price.. But then it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Update 10-17-16: I have reduced my previous 4-star review (below) to 3 stars due to the unbelievably short lifespan of this toothbrush handle. I can&#x27;t believe how many times I have had to have this replaced. Just initiated another warranty claim today. I purchased a new one myself after the first one died, because it was just barely out of warranty. I believe today&#x27;s warranty replacement request is the 3rd one. The usual issue is that the power button becomes recessed and will not operate the handle. On one occasion, the issue was that the handle would no longer charge. You can (and definitely should) register this product online, because that gives you an additional 6 months of warranty coverage. You&#x27;ll need it.  _________________ I have been using a standard electric toothbrush for many years, and I have long wondered if the sonic toothbrushes were all that much better. Yes, they are. At least this one is. After brushing with this DiamondClean, my teeth feel as clean as they do after a polishing at the dentist&#x27;s office minus the grit from the paste they use. I&#x27;m pleasantly astounded. You can barely see that the brush is moving, but it is. The vibration is intense, and you&#x27;ll feel a tingle or tickle while using it. That&#x27;s unnerving at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly. There is considerable splatter during brushing if you&#x27;re not careful. I have used the clean and white modes so far, and both make my teeth feel smooth and clean. The white mode vibration seems a little stronger, but that&#x27;s the only perceivable difference.  This toothbrush has a very sleek design - it looks very nice in my bathroom. The charger is a glass that you rest the toothbrush in, but a smaller travel charger is also provided. Apparently there is no difference in charging power, so I assume the difference is mainly a matter of aesthetics. I could also see the toothbrush being knocked off of the travel charger base very easily if you used that on a regular basis. The DiamondClean also comes with a nice travel case. The purported long-lasting charge (three weeks) would seem to make the travel charger unnecessary, but I haven&#x27;t checked out the battery life yet.  Here&#x27;s my one complaint - the reason I&#x27;m only giving this four stars. The DiamondClean has a timer mechanism that reminds you when to switch from one set of teeth to the next. The idea is to ensure that you&#x27;re spending enough time brushing each section of your mouth. However, at the end of the timed cycle, the toothbrush shuts off! I am rarely finished at that point, so I have to take the toothbrush out of my mouth, put my glasses on to make sure I&#x27;m activating the correct brushing mode, and then start the cycle over. (Yes, you can shut it off manually.) I wish there were a way to deactivate that timer.  I can&#x27;t attest to the whitening results yet, since I&#x27;ve only been using the DiamondClean for a few days, but I can definitely tell you that this toothbrush makes my teeth feel cleaner than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before. And I&#x27;m thinking that will translate to fewer dental problems down the road.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works well as a toothbrush, but the batteries are not replaceable and the unit cannot be repaired, according to Philips. Mine broken down 2 months after the end of the warranty and all customer support could do is offer a 15% discount on the next purchase.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I just bought this -my third Sonicare model - and I am already in love. There are several designs fixes which make me happy over my last Sonicare. First the charging base is sleek but mostly it&#x27;s EASY TO CLEAN. I was tired of cleaning in the nooks and crannies of my old charger base. Just gross. Next the brush head is EASY TO CLEAN. No longer am I worried about the germs collecting in the brush head basin.  I often cleaned it with listerine to keep it sanitary but it was still easy to find gross murky, germy water left behind after brushing. Removing the reservoir was really good for this upgrade. Lastly, being able to charge while the brush is still in the case just makes sense. I&#x27;m sure there will be tweaks to improve the case, the brush, the charger, etc... But I cannot begin to tell you how excited I am to have this version. If it cleans only as well as the last version I will be a very happy customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using: I am still in love.  Not sure why some people area having problems turning off. I don&#x27;t have to scroll through different options to turn the brush off early. I hit the button once and the brush turns off. To clean the brush, I turn it back on and rinse and turn it off. No excessive button pressing. I think maybe some reviewers did not deactivate the \\&quot;easy start\\&quot; feature that comes as a factory default. I deactivated it before my first time using it.  Maybe that made a difference.  I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay here&#x27;s yet another update: it stopped working. Battery was charged but it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I called sonicare and read the numbers on my unit. They are sending me a replacement handle. Took care of it in 5-10 minutes. Worth every dime. If I had the money, I&#x27;d buy some stock in the company too! I&#x27;m just that happy!!!!</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Sonicare with this Diamond Clean. So far no complaints. Does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> Quit working after a yea but they replaced the entire thing promptly. When I went for my last cleaning the hygienist asked if I had one of these because she said I was not cleaning the backs of my front teeth. Turns out pricy brushes leave a ridge due to design flaw. Cannot change stars but just wanted to update my review.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush overall. Nice design. The travel case/charger is nice.     Here&#x27;s where is falls short:   Seems like the mode should be able to be set. IE set for Gum Care as the default setting. The manual lets you turn off the &#x27;Easty-start&#x27; setting, but no way to set a default mode setting.     I, too, got the &#x27;Dental Professional Trial NOT FOR RESALE&#x27; packaging in a slightly dinged outer box. But, not bad enough for me to send it back. I dispute the questions of whether this is illegal to sell as some have said. Its not like its the &#x27;Do Not Remove&#x27; label on a mattress. I say that tongue-in-cheek. It seems to be just some verbiage for marketing and sales reps.     I did find that the cup was missing. I called the Phillips Customer Support number in the paper work inside (800 682-7664) and mentioned the model and that the cup didn&#x27;t come with it and without any complaints or objections, are sending me a replacement cup \\&quot;in 7-10 business days.\\&quot; From what they said, it sounds like it happens, my guess would be some factory packaging problem - made in China after all.     The USB case/charger is great, but i think they should have found a way to pack the USB cable in the case at least. But I won&#x27;t worry about it too much, I usually bring extra usb cables with me when I travel. If I need to charge it, I&#x27;ll just use one of those.     Overall, since it is marked down, it is worth it. But, not at suggested retail.  Why no voting buttons? We don&#x27;t let customers vote on their own reviews, so the voting buttons appear only when you look at reviews submitted by others.  Permalink  Comment Comment</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it if you are using non-sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit expensive but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the USB charging case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks use:&lt;br /&gt;I love the sense of clean after use. It&#x27;s ultimately clean.&lt;br /&gt;No significantly whiter teeth thought. I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrushes and gave up on them all because they didn&#x27;t perform as advertised.  This toothbrush beats them all hands down.  Nicely designed, variable speeds makes brushing easy rather than a chore.  Cleans up easily, and I really like the rechargeable stand.  Been using this product for three weeks now and haven&#x27;t given up.  I recommend this brush for anyone who wants serious dental hygiene and care.  Don&#x27;t be put off by the price -- it is definitely worth the investment for your oral care.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this item.  I like Sonicare and have used it for years.  My flex gave out after several years and I upgraded to the Diamond model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked.&lt;br /&gt;nicer finish.  The handle has a very nice finish and feels less slippery than previous models.&lt;br /&gt;Diamond head does a nice job but it will fit on most model handles so not a big deal here.&lt;br /&gt;Charger is cool.  I like the glass and even the plastic induction charger that comes with it.  Haven&#x27;t used the travel kit yet and probably won&#x27;t but if I do it could be handy.  It does look very cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like.&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive and not a good value compared to other models.&lt;br /&gt;You can not see which setting it is on because it moves from setting to setting while the brush is vibrating.  If you take it out of your mouth to see which setting it is on, it will splatter toothpaste and water several feet in the air spraying your counter and mirror.  HORRIBLE DESIGN and in my opinion could make this model a pass for some.&lt;br /&gt;You can not change the default setting for which timer you use.  This could change my opinion of the above flaw which causes the brush to spray water everywhere, but Philips missed the opportunity to incorporate this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have money to burn and like Apple like styling, this is a very nice looking update to the Sonicare line and you will enjoy the feel of it.  If Value for your dollar is important, this is definitely not the model for you.  Especially with the clumsy mode changing single button feature.</li>
            <li> Two defective units already only after about a year. Phillips customer service so polite but they never replaced my unit.&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive toothbrush should last more then a year. Still under &amp;#34;warranty&amp;#34; but Phillips never sent replacement unit.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever written about a product I have purchased on Amazon.  Phillips impressed me so much that I felt compelled to do so.  I purchased this toothbrush a year ago at the recommendation of my dentist.  Since then I have been extremely pleased with it as it is easy to operate and always makes my teeth feeling very clean.  There was also a noticeable difference when I went to my dentist again for a check up and cleaning 6 months later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a couple days ago the toothbrush was out of juice despite having been on the charger all night.  I tried the travel charger and different outlets and still, it would not charge.  I was quite upset as this was the most expensive toothbrush I have ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I set aside 20-30 minutes out of my day to call Phillips about the issue because from experience, that is a minimum when calling any customer service department.  And, I was prepared with my proof of purchase and fully expected to wait on hold, then be interrogated about what was wrong, how I was using it, where I store it, etc.  But, to my surprise, I was connected immediately to a live rep without having to navigate through 10 minutes of prompts and press this and press that.  When the rep came on, she was very nice and very helpful.  She asked me for the serial number and what was wrong.  Five minutes later they were sending me a new one and an email confirmation was in my inbox before I even got off the phone with her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not upset the thing stopped working.  It happens.  I was extremely impressed by how they handled it and that the process was completely painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos Phillips!!</li>
            <li> The brush head size is much better than any Oral B product my wife and I have tried.  It easily gets into all the difficult to reach spots.  The soft bristles are easy on the gums.  And, boy do your teeth feel great after brushing, while the vibration is not too strong like it is on some of the older Sonicare models.  Also, this unit has a significant improvement over the older style brush heads that collected water, toothpase and grime.  These are easier to clean, easier to remove and attach and the whole brush and handle system is far more sanitary and easy to clean than older Sonicare models.  Travel case is really nice too.  Love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It would be nice if the charging system allowed the cord to plug directly into the handle of the brush for travel so you would not have to carry the small round base along on trips.  At least the size of the base is not too big.</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed in this unit. I had a Sonicare Elite for 14 years that finally died so wanted to replace it. I don&#x27;t mind paying for something that is good, but this unit is just as good as my very much less expensive Elite unit. It does not appear to clean my teeth any better. The glass cup is in the closet as it really isn&#x27;t useful for me. If I could return this unit I would and get a much less expensive Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I would not even give this product a 1 star.  I really wish NO STAR was an option.&lt;br /&gt;Buying an expensive electric toothbrush like this one should, it should last for years.&lt;br /&gt;I had a Sonicare over 10 years ago that lasted for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this model, it turns on ok but the electric motor cuts out intermittently.&lt;br /&gt;The slightest pressure against your teeth and it stops working.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t ever charge it, you can use it as a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big question:  \\&quot;What idiots designed the electronic mechanism inside this toothbrush?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;My Advice with buying ANY SONICARE PRODUCT, BUYERS BEWARE.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL NEVER BUY A SONICARE PRODUCT, EVER.</li>
            <li> Works great. Takes some time to get used to (coming from using a manual toothbrush all my life) but it cleans fantastically.</li>
            <li> I have had nothing but problems with my toothbrush as something is wrong with it and its never been right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never using a normal toothbrush again. This thing is a dream.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Sonicare -- but this particular model ceased operating properly (no head vibration) after a couple of months -- To the credit of Phillips, the company replaced the head (twice) since it was past the Amazon warranty, but after a few months of use, the same problem resurfaced. Given the price ($189 at the time of purchase) it was NOT worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up purchasing the flex-clean model for about $129 and I am very happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> Wow! This is one expensive tooth brush! Going to the local college of dentistry for my dental work and my student dentist recommended I get one of these because after brushing my teeth for almost 60 years evidently I still wasn&#x27;t getting how to do it! Well, it&#x27;s not my fault if they change the size of the brushes and the way you&#x27;re supposed to brush every twenty years or so, right! Hesitant and skeptical at first, I could not justify the &amp;#34;investment.&amp;#34; However, after reading all the specifications and asking around about other products and checking out what was available in local stores, I took the plunge and ordered one. I am totally surprised at how clean, white, and shiny my teeth are after about two weeks of using this brush. Granted, we did the routine maintenance cleaning at the school, but the results cannot be disputed. And, not only does this thing do a great job, but it times you in each quadrant, so your teeth and gums get a workout. I had a cheap battery operated brush before this, but it&#x27;s no match for the constant battery power of this machine! I charged it when I received it, and haven&#x27;t charged it again in over two weeks! The charger is that new type where you just drop it in the provided charging glass and it charges by electrical conductance or something. And, it comes with a USB charger cord for on the road sue, and a charger base that you set the brush in an it charges without no plug! One thing I did not do is order extra brushes at the time I ordered the product. Do this, you will need them! As a &amp;#34;tool guy,&amp;#34; this is a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; tool, not some gimmicky toy, while being safe and clean and easy to use with minimal practice. Read the instructions, it has a &amp;#34;slow speed setting&amp;#34; from the factory that you can use to get used to the vibes, or remove to use the full power from the get go. Smile!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It cleans my teeth very effectively and much better than my old Braun toothbrush. Well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I like the product so far.  My teeth always feel super clean after brushing and the timers on the brush setting help me to remain diligent when brushing; even if I&#x27;m half asleep.  This is my first Sonicare so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it too.  My only complaint is that its hard to press the button and see what mode your in if you have the brush already in your mouth because your hand naturally blocks it in this posture, but there&#x27;s ways around it I suppose.</li>
            <li> so far,  i love this baby  my teeth feel like they have had a professional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;had to learn the controls,  took a few days -and did i mention its high tech pretty?</li>
            <li> Years ago my Mom bought electric toothbrushes for my entire family on the theory that jaw-rattling fire hazards must be better for your teeth than plain old .99 cent drugstore brushes. The results were less than impressive, and that was my first and until now last experience with electric brushes. Until I got this product, and saw where the technology has gone in the last ten years.  When I got the Philips Sonicare, I was particularly interested in the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; setting, because I drink a lot of green tea and have stains that are tough remove, mostly because I never stop drinking tea. This brush really did whiten as promised, and polished, and removed plaque like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a strange experience to wake up in the morning with your teeth still feeling completely clean. My gums are noticeably less swollen in the morning and the tea stains are definitely improved, but the real surprise was my skin. I suffer from severe food allergies, and unless I eat nothing but apples and lettuce my skin has a strong tendency towards redness and irritation. Since using the brush my skin is much less red, and when I stop using the brush it goes back to flushed-looking. I think this is because the brush is cleaning my teeth so much better and allergens are being removed quicker. It was such an unexpected benefit I wanted to mention it.  Drawbacks are few. The design of the charger is inelegant (it looks ready to tip over any second) but serviceable. I think the brush should come with three normal-sized brush heads, instead of one full-size and a bonus itty bitty brush head. Kinda strange. The product is clearly supposed to resembled an Apple Iproduct, for reasons known best to Sonicare. Does everything have to look like an Iphone?   The travel case and computer charger are nifty, the sensitive setting useful (these brushes still rattle your jaw), and all else worked just as it is supposed to. Well worth the money and the health benefits, even the surprise ones. All in all:  GRADE: A</li>
            <li> The Best tooth brush I have ever experienced.  My teeth feel very clean and my mouth refreshed .</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and before we bough it we did several days of research. I can say that research really payed off.  The diamond clean makes my teeth feel cleaner than any dental visit I have ever had. Everything about the diamond clean is top notch and it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought the product under their 30 days money back guarantee. I like the brush. However, there is one caveat: it comes with two different brush heads, a big one and a smaller one. I used the smaller one first and I like the product. When it wore out after three months, i switched to the \\&quot;big\\&quot; brush head and it really sucks. The feeling and the cleaning is just not the same. It is not comfortable and the results are disappointing. The real problem is that teh \\&quot;smaller\\&quot; brush is not being offered anywhere, not Amazon and not even at Phillips&#x27; website ([...]). I had a previous Oral B power toothbrush which used a similar small brush head and compared to DiamondClean&#x27;S \\&quot;big\\&quot; brush head, I would not hesitate to go back to Oral B. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND CHECK THAT YOU CAN BUY THE BRUSH HEAD REPLACEMENTS FOR DIAMONDCLEAN (OR ANY OTHER POWER TOOTHBRUSH) BEFORE you buy it, otherwise it is just a very expensive item.</li>
            <li> AWESOME toothbrush.  The longer you use it, the better it feels.  Never realized I had so much plaque in hard-to-reach areas.  I&#x27;ve used two oral b electric brushes in the past, and it&#x27;s just not the same quality at all.  The design is very classy and looks nice on the counter.  I use the glass cup for my retainers, and don&#x27;t really need to charge the brush often, so just leave on the counter.  Buy the 6-pack of brush head refills because they can get quite expensive in smaller packages.  This is a wise investment to prevent plaque build up and cavities that cost more in the long run.  My teeth feel lighter and so much fresher.  Get one now!!!</li>
            <li> The best tooth brush I have ever used. After 4 months using this I will never go back to another tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I loved it until it broke down on me last month. I bought it last December, the 27th...I feel it should last longer than half a year if one pays close to $200 for it. Now it just goes off on its own, just starts buzzing when it&#x27;s just sitting there, acting erratically...did that for a while until the battery finally completely died in it.</li>
            <li> DiamondClear was recommended by my Hygienist and I&#x27;m very pleased with the cleaning capability. At first it seems awkward putting this vibrating &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; in your month but after a few times I really got the hang of how to move it around cleaning the 4 zones of the mouth. I was thinking that I didn&#x27;t have to continue flossing but that is not true--still have to floss. But this product is worth the price and I&#x27;m looking forward to getting a good report upon my next trip to the Hygienist.</li>
            <li> It has been 1 month now and I still don&#x27;t have any problems with it. My daughter is even using it!</li>
            <li> This thing rocks! I bought it because my dentist told me I brushed my teeth too hard and it was causing indention&#x27;s in my teeth along gum lines. I tried to be a good tooth brusher and take it lightly but still got a lecture from the guy. Here is the answer.. an expensive one yes, but sooooo worth it. I rarely use anything except the Clean option but the whitening and Polish setting really do work. Stays charged awhile too so you don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping the thing plugged in on your counter all the time</li>
            <li> I bought the DiamondClean to replace my old Braun toothbrush, which lasted more than a decade. The Sonicare has a much subtler vibration mechanism than the Braun, and I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a good thing. While my teeth certainly feel clean, I&#x27;m not sure my gums are getting the coverage they had with the Braun. The DiamondClean is a very good looking toothbrush, and feels good in the hand. My next visit with the dentist will decide if I keep it, or switch back to the Braun.</li>
            <li> Works well. Love the product.  My dentist is loving me. And all of the functions and modes work well too. And the auto timing function makes me brush as long as I am supposed to.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this toothbrush.  But...the first thing I noticed is that I had a harder time reaching my back teeth.  The handle was rather large and awkward to hold.  I made a huge mess while brushing my teeth when I don&#x27;t normally.  After about a month and a half, it started making strange loud noises as I was brushing my teeth.  I finally called Sonicare and they told me they would replace the unit within 90 days of purchase, but couldn&#x27;t replace it with a different unit that might fit my hand and mouth better.  They could only send me the same unit.  However, they could offer me the money back guarantee.  When I asked how much they would refund me, the rep said she didn&#x27;t know, but it would be the average retail price.  I have to send back the unit first then wait 4-6 weeks for a refund check.  I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll receive the check after I send off the toothbrush.  That makes me nervous.  I&#x27;d like to replace this unit with another one and try it since I keep hearing such great things about them.</li>
            <li> I liked the look and feel of this unit as well as the fact it came with a unique travel case,  My Sonicare DiamondClean lived up to my expectations for the first 14 months -- then stopped working.  After a long and silly chat discussion with Phillips they agreed to honor their 2 year warranty and send me a replacement.  I had given them serial numbers, model numbers, descriptions of the problem, etc., but they sent me the wrong brush handle and have yet to correct the error.  For $200 I expect the product to last longer than 14 months, and I expect the company to back up their warranty.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first and clearly my last Phillips brush purchase.</li>
            <li> So far this toothbrush is amazing, comes with two heads</li>
            <li> This is my first ever high-end electric toothbrush and it has lived up to all of its promises. Every time I brush my teeth, they feel smooth and sparkle like I just left the dentist! I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase and would recommend it to all of my family and friends.</li>
            <li> No need to pay  extra for the cup!  Find a seller that offers the brush without the cup, the base is fine.  Very pleased with the new model.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best tooth brushes that I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for change.  If a toothbrush has to be technologically advanced, it better prove to me that it&#x27;s worth the price and the change in style.  This toothbrush is amazing.  I have no plaque, I love the timer, and it&#x27;s packaged in almost apple like design.</li>
            <li> 1) Pick up toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;2) Add toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;3) Put mouthwash in glass&lt;br /&gt;4) Select setting and brush until end of cycle&lt;br /&gt;5) Spit, rinse (including tb head&lt;br /&gt;6) recharge</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Philips Sonicare product. I have severalof these power toothbrushes, include one that uses AA battery for travel. If you ever brushed with Sonicare, you&#x27;ll never forget the clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This power toothbrush took it to the next level. Same cleanliness option, but with several options: clean, white, polish. gum care and sensitive. Charging system is also improved: it came with a glass that you could just drop the toothbrush in and a travel case that uses USB charging. You could use the power adaptor or charge your toothbrush with your laptop! And it is smaller too, so if you are on a short, less than 5 days trip you could just drop it into your briefcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough of how impressed I am to this version. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush, and after lots of hunting I took a gamble as it was unclear if the base was 110-240v rated. I can confirm that both the USB charger and the charging base are multi voltage capable and work fine in Australia.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 Diamondclean Rechargeable Toothbrush for a little over a month now. I must say I&#x27;m impressed! I&#x27;ve been an old-fashioner manual tooth brusher all my life and this is the first time I&#x27;ve ventured into the realms of the power toothbrush. First off, the DiamondClean system is compact and easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter top space. One of the coolest thing, to me at least, is the charging glass. The DiamondClean comes with a glass that actually charges up the toothbrush while it rests in the glass. How cool is that? Yes, it&#x27;s the same glass you can use for rinsing your mouth when you are finished brushing. I also like the travel case and the fact that you can plug your charging base into your laptop. Technology rocks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important aspect of the DiamondClean system is how well it works in your mouth. I wanted to use it for at least a month before writing this review. After a month, I can say that I am really impressed with the results. I tend to brush my teeth too hard with my manual brush and so the power brush on the DiamondClean actually seemed like it wasn&#x27;t churning as hard as I thought it should, but then, as soon as I was finished - wow! My teeth and gums felt amazingly clean and fresh! Over the course of a month there has been a marked and remarkable improvement in the health of my gums and mouth, and my teeth do seem to even look whiter and healthier. The Smartimer and Quadpacer features make sure that you have brushed sufficiently and in every area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great system. Five stars, two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush lives up to the hype. It is a solid design. The battery is long lasting the storage options are modern and functional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes for many years, most recently with the Oral-B 3D line, which I thought was pretty good.  When I first tried the Sonicare DiamondClean, I thought that even the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; head was tiny, but was pretty impressed by how well this toothbrush cleans.  After about a month with the toothbrush, I tried using the Oral-B again - and thought it was crazy how big the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; Oral-B toothbrush head felt, and how poorly it cleaned in comparison to the Sonicare DiamondClean.  The Sonicare is quite expensive, but the performance is considerably better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I had an older model of the sonicare toothbrush and desired something similar.  To my surprise it is a much better product, not just &#x27;the new model.&#x27;  My teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been nearly a month and I&#x27;m satisfied, it delivers more than promised.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed not only with  Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean but with quality of service Amazon provided.&lt;br /&gt;Being an overseas buyer I can say confidently I&#x27;m protected with Amazon&#x27;s policy and Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean&lt;br /&gt;is the best brush I have used. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 20 yr. old daughter and she can&#x27;t stop raving about it! She says that brushing her teeth is now a pleasure!</li>
            <li> Does everything it is supposed to. It really does help your teeth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a hit with my son on Christmas morning!&lt;br /&gt;He charged that morning and after a few uses raved over how his teeth felt and looked!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after having an older model sonicare brush for about 10 years.  After using this new brush, my teeth feel absolutely cleaner!!  Love the glass charger and all the available settings.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> toothbrush is really great.  only bad thing in my opinion is that it comes with no useful directions.  not that you need instructions to use it but i would like something to tell me how to turn off the easy-start feature.  other than that its awesome.  good job sonicare.</li>
            <li> great quality. I have been using it for over two years and still as powerful as before. the battery still works as great as before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive. Has poor engineering design. Usability leaves much to be desired. Single button to turn it on/off and switch the mode is very uncomfortable in use. The button gets stuck all the time.&lt;br /&gt;And on top of that it broke down in one year.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the best product available in the market. I recommend it. The only thing that it didn&#x27;t like about it is the price.</li>
            <li> I am Very impressed with this! Great, hard, modern, classy, travel case, which can also be used to recharge toothbrush with USB connection. Yes, charge it from your computer if you want.   The feel of this is different than anything I have tried before. Brush size nice and small. The glass charger is amazing! I was like &#x27;is this really going to charge?&#x27; Yep! charged and ready to go!  The whole thing smells of flash and modern. Then you use it and get the clean and again WOW! No more arm ache with 3 mins of brushing manually - like any of us really do that!  Very, very pleased with this purchase, as long as it stands up to the test of time.</li>
            <li> I have had several sonicares over the years. They all do a great job on teeth and gums, but until this one, it was really hard to keep the handles/stands/chargers clean. Because of the tight design on the handle and the unique charger, no more gunk everywhere! Also, the new brush head is a significant improvement. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. My teeth, tongue, and the whole mouth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Great upgrade from previous sonicate tooth brush. The only annoying thing is, starting and stopping the brush too quickly may cause you to cycle through all power settings before reaching off, eventually you&#x27;ll get used to it, but there is no fast extraction in this case. The extra power settings are probably overkill unless you have a medical need for more gentle brushing at times.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works better than the last model I had. I don&#x27;t like the display. And once you have the setting you want you can easily loose it by turning off the unit before score determined time v</li>
            <li> My whole family uses Sonicare toothbrushes.  Mine was getting kind of old and had a bad habit of accumulating \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; under the brush head.  I was reluctant to spend so much money on a new toothbrush, but after reading reviews decided to take the plunge.  it was well worth it.  This toothbrush works better than my old model and stays cleaner.  The head design is better and the unit looks sleek.  The charging cup is convenient.  Most importantly it makes my teeth feel cleaner then even the older Sonicare did.  Although it was expensive, I think this toothbrush was a good buy.  Much cheaper than a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> From the moment we opened the box, the packaging, materials, and instructions, were perfectly and conveniently packed. Everything was thought of in the packaged box including a travel case and wireless charger. Every time I use my tooth brush, my mouth and teeth feel and look so clean, just like the moment you leave the dentist chair for a dental cleaning. We are purchasing a few more for Holiday gifts. Definitely a must have! Thank you Philips and Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> My wife has owned previous models of the Sonicare, but this one is by far the best yet. We both use it...a beautiful design with a slim handle that is comfortable to hold. The brushes are easy to change...just push on and pull off..no need to twist. Compared to manual and battery powered toothbrushes, this Sonicare leaves your teeth feeling really clean. If you are so inclined, the brush head is small enough to clean the top of your tongue, which some hygienists recommend. Expensive but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Ok, I may have jumped the gun. It&#x27;s true that my toothbrush isn&#x27;t working one year and ten days after I bought it, but I chatted with Aaron at Philips Sonicare last night and he&#x27;s going to send me a new one. When I get it I will edit this review to five stars. I like the tooth brush and so far my experience with customer services has been great. I should point out that my husband go the same tooth brush a month or two before I got mine and his is fine.  This product didn&#x27;t even last a year. I stopped working after I had it for 11 months. I owned a Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean before this one that lasted for a few years.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use and get used to. Great price. I would recommend this product to anyone interested in keeping their teeth clean,</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicaire toothbrush for at least 12 years and it never did the damage that this one did.  The small brush is not as effective as the larger one that I have been using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too much of a reviewer but love reading reviews before I purchase an item. I must say. I love my toothbrush! Every morning and night I brush my teeth for 2 minutes using the timer (30 seconds on each section of your teeth). I&#x27;ve taken my toothbrush in my travel bag and it&#x27;s so practicle. I won&#x27;t go into too much detail but I will say that I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my smile and It feels good to have the very best.</li>
            <li> I received it on time and immediately removed it and began charging it.  It takes 12 hours to fully charge.  The charge is estimated to last through 3 weeks of use (twice a day).  On Clean, it brushes for 2 minutes (30 seconds front and back, upper and lower).  I use a 2-minute cycle for the upper teeth and another 2 for the lower (just my preference).  It gets my teeth much cleaner than normal brushing; I noticed a slight whitening effect after a few days.  I have not tried the other cycles yet.  You get a charging unit composed of a base and a glass tumbler.  You merely plug the base in, set the tumbler on it, put the toothbrush inside it and it charges.  It also comes with a travel case which has its own cords to charge from the wall outlet or a usb port on your computer.  I have not tried charging that way.  The toothbrush is very attractive.  It is very sleek and the handle is all white.  The different cycles that you can use are invisible until you turn it on or charge it.  Then the cycles are lit up and glow.  After using the toothbrush, the cycle \\&quot;lights\\&quot; fade away and all you see is a white toothbrush.  It is very easy to clean.  There are 2 brush heads and a cover to slip over the bristles after use.  I am very satisfied and love using it.  I cannot speak to its longevity as I have only had it since the 3rd week of December.  I do recommend this based on my own use.  You can get replacement brush heads on Amazon as well.  It is well made and even the glass tumbler is heavy glass and attractive.</li>
            <li> Have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for years and I love this newest edition.  Takes up less counter space and does a terrific job on the teeth.  Try it and your teeth may be thanking you!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  It times my brushing so that I don&#x27;t rush and the vibrating stimulates the gums so that they feel healthier.  Can&#x27;t go back to regular brushing.</li>
            <li> In just a fee weeks i saw impressive results, my teeth had never felt cleaner and they are getting even whiter, the gum option is perfect for a much necessary massage every other day.</li>
            <li> This is my first sonicare that I bought after my Oral B died after about ten years. Initially I was quite impressed with how well it cleaned, much better than my old Oral B.  After several days the sonicare started buzzing when putting slight side pressure on the brush head. After two weeks it got to the point where just barely touching the side of the brush head, particularly when brushing rear molars, the unit would buzz loudly and there was no vibration at the bristles. Quite aggravating after spending nearly 200 dollars. So I called sonicare for a warranty replacement, which they honored. Received the replacement unit a couple weeks later. That was about six weeks ago and the problem is starting again with the replacement unit. There are several other Amazon reviews reporting similar problems. The only recourse I have at this point is to continue warranty claims until expiration and ultimately never purchase a phillips brush again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Excellent shipping, too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I almost didn&#x27;t get this toothbrush because of one of the other reviews I read. It said that you cannot turn it off to take it out of your mouth without paste flying everywhere because there is only one button for power and mode.&lt;br /&gt;If you turn it off mid-brushing to spit, like I do, then that would be a deal breaker. But the truth is, as long as you&#x27;ve had it in your mouth brushing for at least 10 seconds it will turn off as soon as you press the button.&lt;br /&gt;Great toothbrush so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great! My 6 year old Sonicare finally crapped out on me and chose this one as a replacement.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush with new improved brushing features.  Clean, polish, sensitive, etc.  It is pricey, and does not come with a sanitizer.  I kept my old sanitizer which works very well with this.  I love it! It was nice to be able to get the perks with the store card for 6 months interest free financing at time of purchase.</li>
            <li> Switched from regular toothbrush to Philips Sonicare after doing some research among the other electric toothbrush vendors and models. It has great cleansing power (I feel my teeth are completely clean after each brush), a good 3 week battery life, and cool chargeable traveling bag for the brush. I can&#x27;t think of any other option I need...</li>
            <li> This is simply the best toothbrush on the market. Not only does it clean and whiten your teeth the best of any other manual or electric toothbrush, it is probably the most high-tech device that a person can stick into their face, and it even changed how I brush my teeth by promoting. This is a must-buy for any tech-centric gadget head who cares about oral health and hygeine. I never brushed my teeth regularly before this brush. In fact, I can say with honesty that even three times a month would be giving myself too much credit. Disgusting, I know. But then one day a month or so ago, part of a tooth got chipped off because of a large cavity so I went to the dentist to get it fixed and afterwards, resolved to try a hardcore toothbrush to see if that would make a difference. I did some research and after trying out the Sonciare HealthyWhite, which is also a great toothbrush for people who don&#x27;t want to spend so much, I decided to purchase the Sonicare DiamondClean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product arrived, I immediately opened it to find a very attractive toothbrush and many accessories. This is literally a high-tech swiss army knife for your teeth. The handle of the brush itself is made of a faux-ceramic material that feels great in the hand, and even though it doesn&#x27;t have the ridges or rubber grip of other Sonicare brushes, it will never slip or slide out of your hand. The DiamondClean brush heads are also very nice and professional looking. The brush handle is ceramic white on the body and chrome on the bottom, where it touches the inductive charger. There is one power/mode button on the handle that cycles through the various modes (of which there are five), and each mode has an illuminated display that lights up a soft white color when that mode is selected and active. There is also a battery/charge indicator on the front near the bottom that lets you know when you&#x27;re running low on battery, when the brush is in use, and when it&#x27;s charging. One note: the bottom of thehandle, where it stands on the charger, doesn&#x27;t have the hole that the little nub of the charger fits into to keep it stable. It is kind of concave and stands on the included chargers, which surround the bottom portion of the handle, preventing it from falling over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DiamondClean includes two brush heads in the package, one standard size and one compact. I have yet to use the compact one but it looks like it would be just as effective as the standard size, but a bit smaller. Changing from using (rarely) a manual toothbrush to the HealthyWhite was a huge difference, and from the HW to the DiamondClean brush heads made a huge difference. You can feel it immediately. The bristles on the outer edges of the brushing surface of the DiamondClean head are white and blue (blue being the indicator bristles that tell you that you should replace the head when they fade to white) and are arranged in sort of a concave almond shape around the center bristles. The center bristles are the special part of this brush head. They are the green ones in the middle, which appear to be both thinner and more fine than the outside white/blue bristles and are also more densely packed. This is where the real cleaning action happens. These bristles are arranged in a semi-geometrical orientation that really scrubs and cleans your teeth. Also of note, these brush heads can fit on the HealthyWhite and most likely some other Sonicare brush handles, but not the Essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with several different charging options, and this is where the techies should pay attention. For regular use in your home bathroom, there is a charging plate that plugs into your wall with the standard 2-prong power socket, and you can put the included clear plastic charging stand on the plate which is a good looking charging option, and is what I use. The other home charging option is to use the included charging glass, which also fits on top of the charging plate (you can put either the charging stand or the glass onto the charging plate), and allows you to sit your toothbrush in a glass as many people do, and charge it at the same time. I prefer the charging stand because it is more compact and clean looking and keeps the tooth brush standing up straight, matching my other dental tools, instead of leaning against the large glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final charging option is also one of the coolest accessories that comes with the brush, and that is the charging travel case. This case is made of a white cloth/synthetic weave on the outside and some sort of green plastic on the inside. There is room for two extra brush heads that fit snugly into their designated areas and space for the toothbrush handle next to that. This case also uses the inductive charging method, so all you have to do is place the handle into the form-fitting slot for it and it will charge when you plug it in, and plugging it in is the fun part. This charging travel case is powered by USB and has a mini-USB port on the end so you can plug it in to charge from a USB port on your laptop or by using the included USB power adapter and cable. Very cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the special features this brush offers is the gentle-on feature, which, for new Sonicare users, starts the brush on first use on a low-power mode, gently increasing the power over the next 14 uses to gradually and gently acclimate the user&#x27;s mouth to the sensation of using a Sonicare. I guess this is here because some people feel that the toothbrush is too strong when they use it the first time and the sensation is somewhat ticklish, but I didn&#x27;t require that. If you&#x27;ve previously used a Sonicare toothbrush or don&#x27;t mind the new super-clean sensation, you can disable this feature like I did by placing the handle of the brush into whichever charging source you choose to use, and pressing and holding the power/mode button down for a few seconds until it beeps. This means that now, whenever you use the brush even if it is the first time, it will always operate at full 100% power. You can turn the gentle-on mode again by repeating the steps: placing the handle on the charger and holding the button for another few seconds until it beeps twice. Another feature is the quadpacer, which tells you how long to brush each quadrant of your teeth. It is recommended that you brush for a full two minutes, so the quadpacer splits that up into 30 seconds of brushing for each quadrant. When you turn it on, after 30 seconds the toothbrush will beep and pause for a second, which indicates that you should move on to the next part of your mouth. Most of the modes work this way, The way I do it is I brush the outside-upper teeth first, then the inside-upper, then outside lower followed by inside lower. However, since my teeth were very badly stained, I use three different modes/cycles every time I brush my teeth. I start out with the standard power Clean mode that goes for two minutes in 4 intervals, then move on to White mode, which is higher powered than Clean mode, which goes on for two minutes in 4 intervals plus another 30 seconds of an even higher powered brushing in 2 intervals for your \\&quot;glamour\\&quot; teeth, or front teeth, top and bottom, followed by the Polish mode, which is the strongest and highest-powered mode the toothbrush offers, giving you 30 seconds each for your top front teeth and lower front teeth. I&#x27;m sure some of it is redundant but I still like to use all three modes one after the other to feel cleaner. There are also two additional modes that the toothbrush offers. After Polish is Gum Care, which massages your gums and stimulates the blood flow there and helps to reverse and prevent gingivitis, and after Gum Care, the final mode is Sensitive, which speaks for itself. It is a lower-power mode that you should use if your teeth or gums are sensitive and you feel discomfort using the other more powerful modes. Now if Sensitive mode is any worse than the other modes in terms of cleaning power, it doesn&#x27;t show or the difference is absolutely minimal. It still cleans and whitens just as well as the other modes, but does so without being uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as I mentioned above, I had a serious problem when it came to brushing regularly, but in the month since I&#x27;ve had the DiamondClean, I brush three times a day, every single day, without fail. I don&#x27;t know if other people who had brushing problems have experienced the same thing, but this has made a huge difference for me. Not only are my teeth visibly white (they used to be quite yellow), they feel incredibly clean and fresh after brushing with the Sonicare Diamondclean, which no manual toothbrush can ever replicate. Just for the record, I also use the Sonciare Airfloss since I got this, which is a great device to use before brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using this brush for just over a month and my teeth are more than 5 shades whiter. I have actually gotten compliments and am greeted with surprise every time I smile because my teeth were noticeably yellow before and you could see that a mile away. Now my pearly whites are really pearly white and people are astounded and don&#x27;t believe that a toothbrush could make such a huge difference. I mean the difference is literally night and day. I&#x27;m hooked to my Sonicare DiamondClean now. If your teeth need to be whitened, this is the way to go. Just in case anybody was wondering, I use [[ASIN:B004VGSVHS Crest 3d White Vivid Anticavity Teeth Whitening Radiant Mint Toothpaste 5.8oz, Twin Pack 11.6 Oz Total]] with this brush and rinse out with [[ASIN:B009PIJV1W Crest 3d White Arctic Fresh Rinse 32 Fl Oz]] mouthwash after brushing.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get the DiamondClean as a gift, since my FlexCare model had died recently (prematurely--disappointed about that), but it didn&#x27;t take long to fade.  In changing the design from two-buttons to one, they went too far.  You can&#x27;t turn the toothbrush off when you want to!!  It changes modes instead of turning off.  When I&#x27;m done brushing my teeth, I turn the brush on again to rinse it out.  If you press the button again, within 5-10 seconds, it switches modes instead of turning off, and you either have to toggle through all 5 modes, or wait another 5-10 seconds before pressing the button again.  If you happen to want to turn the brush off in the first 5-10 seconds after you start brushing, you run into the same problem.  It&#x27;s incredibly annoying.  Since it doesn&#x27;t seem to offer any other significant features over the FlexCare, other than a nifty USB charging case, it doesn&#x27;t seem worth the extra money for extra frustration.  And one nit: you would have thought they would have solved the problem of the toothbrush rolling over after you load it up with toothpaste and set it on the counter, but they missed the boat on that, too.  It does a fine job of cleaning your teeth, as prior Sonicare brushes have, but if the battery is going to die in 2-3 years, anyway, why invest so much in a lousy design?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several sonicares over the years and I was very happy with them. The only exception being that the water and \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; would get caught in the part where the brush was attached. This is the best part of this toothbrush , there is no place for the water to get caught! Otherwise all the bells and whistles are just that. If I ran through all the cycles it would take me an hour to brush my teeth. I do like the holder, but I can&#x27; t justify the price.</li>
            <li> Had it for a few years now... Love it.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from a sonicate I&#x27;d had for about 10 years, which finally the battery was dead and wouldn&#x27;t hold enough charge to get through a full brushing.  This one - wow!!  The vibration is far more intense, has multiple &#x27;levels&#x27; of cleaning purposes and it is sleek and lightweight.  Additionally, I travel tons, so the travel charging case is perfect for me.  The home charger is sleek and easy to clean, unlike my last one.  So far, I love it!</li>
            <li> I always had an oral B toothbrush but I find I like this even more. They glass charger that you can place this in is awesome and it takes so little space that it can be left on the sink. So far I am impressed with the toothbrush but the proof will be when I go for my dental check up and see if it made a difference in my tarter buildup.</li>
            <li> Not the cheapest toothbrush on the market....but works great....and all the replacement brushes for any types of these brushes are expensive...but if it does what you need like this one does.....its worth it...  The brush hold a charge for a long time...maybe recharge every 2 weeks.  Carrying case also has build in travel charger....its all first class!</li>
            <li> I must admit this is my first foray into the world of electric toothbrushes.  For years I have debated whether or not to get an electric toothbrush, but I was pleasantly surprised with this one.    Firs the design is excellent.  The look and feel of the toothbrush is exemplary.  It has a modern look, and clean simple feel.  The design allows you to lay the toothbrush into a glass cup which will charge your toothbrush while you are not using it.  The cool factor is definitely at work here, a portable charging station that you can also use to rinse out your mouth when you are finished.  The toothbrush has several settings so you can adjust the vibration to your own personal preference.      Personally it took me a day or two to adjust to the vibration of the toothbrush, this may primarily be because I am not accustomed to an electric toothbrush, but after a few days I am definitely hooked.  The vibration makes your mouth feel clean and fresh, and it keeps that fresh feeling throughout the day.  It also gives you that feeling without a lot of work on your part.  You simply have to hold the toothbrush in your mouth and the vibration does all the work getting into areas that are tough to get clean with a regular toothbrush.      The brush portion easily pops off for changing, or for travel use, or for disinfecting.      The adjustable settings allow you to choose how strong you want the vibration.  I started off on the sensitive setting, and slowly am working my way to the regular setting.      Overall I really enjoy the toothbrush, and I am expecting my next dental appointment to support this feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun electric toothbrush for many years, with no complaints. I decided to purchase a Philips Sonicare toothbrush after discussions with my dentist. I was not having any dental problems. To the contrary, I feel incredibly lucky to be 59 years young and never even had a cavity! We just felt this may be an even better dental hygiene option for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research on the various manufacturers and models. Ultimately, I decided I wanted to try the Philips line of Sonicare toothbrush. This conclusion based on familiarity with Philips, product features, and user comments. After comparing several Sonicare models, I narrowed the field down to one or two. I kept coming back to their newest model, this DiamondClean Sonicare, but the price seemed prohibitive. Frankly, I had no intention of spending this much for a &#x27;toothbrush&#x27;. I mean, plenty of folks get by with electric and manual toothbrushes costing much, much less. I did feel a sense of resentment towards Philips for excessive price and/or profit. I looked for coupons, deals, etc. Any way to lessen the impact on my wallet. When the dust settled, I was ordering the DiamondClean through Amazon. Amazon consistently gives me the best prices, with no shipping costs, in a secure format.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this brush now for one week. Initial reaction? Finely engineered precision instrument. Has a very nice feel to it, in the hand and in use. Very pleasing aesthetic look to it, like comparing a Ferrari to, well, any other vehicle. It gives off a very determined but gentle hum that varies with the cleaning program I select. I am finding I seem to prefer the Clean and White mode. The best part is once I complete the brushing, my mouth feels like it has just been overhauled! The term squeaky clean comes to mind. It truly does leave that &#x27;just had a professional dental cleaning&#x27; feel in my mouth. I can feel a pleasant sensation in my gums, too, which is very good for blood flow and overall gum health. (And no, I am not a Dentist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go into all the product details and features, as I feel those have been fully covered in the product listings and previous user reviews. I do not get a sense of any changes I would make to the mechanics or features of the unit. I intend to give my impression on the overall effectiveness, which is the only subject that really matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this toothbrush successfully complete it&#x27;s intended duties? After such a brief time using my Philips Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush, I can already fully commit to this one statement - &#x27;THE best toothbrush I have EVER used!&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Probably the best toothbrush there is when it comes to cleaning your teeth. However, this product missed out on five stars for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The first brush I ordered stopped working completely after about two years. Unfortunately, I was one month past the warranty, and Philips wouldn&#x27;t budge on a replacement. You&#x27;d expect a $200 brush to be more reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The power button and timer could be a bit more intuitive (as other reviews have already mentioned and covered in detail).</li>
            <li> I have had two Sonicare diamond clean tooth brushes and I love them.  Problem is the On/Off switches go bad in about 1 1/2 years from purchase.  I have now spent over $200 in purchasing two brushes and now my third one now has a bad switch.  For $400 I can buy a lot of toothbrushes.  For something so expensive, Phillips needs to have a better warranty.  There is an obvious problem with their switches on these brushes.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great brush and does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li> The main thing I realized after recieving this toothbrush is-- there are people out there leading such exciting lives that they need to recharge their toothbrushes with their laptops! What else is going on out there I need to know about?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this thing pretty much scared me at first. I had to start on the &#x27;training wheels&#x27; setting otherwise known as sensitive. No kidding, I must be, because my first reaction was to throw it across the room. When the directions say- may cause some tickling, believe it. Eventually I did get used to it and learned to keep my tongue out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my teeth feel great. My gums feel healthy. I&#x27;m afraid that I have naturally yellow teeth so I can&#x27;t say much about the whitening feature but it certainly does make your mouth feel clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still working my way through all the settings to see if I can tell one from the other. My mouth, it&#x27;s still learning.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric toothbrush and I am nothing but impressed. I&#x27;d always been very skeptical about shoving a battery-operated, vibrating toothbrush into my mouth and having it produce results better than what I was getting with a regular toothbrush, but I&#x27;m sold now. Every time I use this thing I feel like I just walked out of my dentist&#x27;s office and without all of the poking, prodding and scraping!! It tickled my mouth a little bit at first, but after about a week I was used to it and I could use it comfortably. I really dig the charging station. It&#x27;s literally charges itself while it just sits in a glass next to your sink. No big, ugly stands or anything like a lot of the older electric toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve seen. This really is the total package. The only thing that even begins to bug me is that the heads cost about $15 a piece, but according to the manual, they should last six months. Time will tell on that one...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know. It seems like it might indeed be a good toothbrush. I love the way it looks, and the travel case is surprisingly nice, with the USB hookup being a great idea for travel. But mine was sent without a glass, with a worn and dog-eared instruction manual, and all the other parts poorly re-packaged in a bashed-up box marked \\&quot;Dental Professional Trial NOT FOR RESALE.\\&quot; What is going on? Is  Amazon or Phillips trying to recondition samples sent to dental clinics? Pretty weird experience for a $175 toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have an update regarding the comment by the  \\&quot;design flaw\\&quot; poster. There actually is a way to select modes without your toothpaste spraying everywhere. You advance to the mode you want, wait a few moments for the mode to register, turn the toothbrush off,  put your toothpaste on, and then when  you turn the toothbrush back on, it will remain in the pre-selected mode. (I cannot confirm whether, as the poster says in the comments to his/her review, that 10 seconds is then deducted from the brush cycle. I wasn&#x27;t going to keep the toothbrush, so I didn&#x27;t make it as far as actually brushing and testing the cycle durations.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m going to give it three stars for now, then try to replace it. If it turns out to be the toothbrush of my dreams, I&#x27;ll add stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the brush. I was able to get a new one for $130 from my dentist (after rebate, and including tax). I&#x27;ve been using this for four days now. I have to say, each time I brush my teeth they feel like I just got back from the dentist. In fact, about three weeks ago I had my teeth cleaned professionally, and I still had some light stains on my upper teeth. After less than a week of using this brush, the stains are gone.  Also, the motion of the brush head  feels less violent than the rotary-style toothbrush I had before. It feels like this motion will be easier on my receding gums, although it&#x27;s too soon to say for sure. In terms of style, the brush is more streamlined and minimalist than my previous toothbrush. Less dorky. The charging glass has a pleasing, stout solidity to it, like a whiskey glass, and it&#x27;s an ingenious solution to the daily grind of recharging electronics. The travel case is nice too. With my old electric toothbrush, the travel case was so chintzy I immediately threw it away, but this case is nice enough that it looks like something you would buy separately for another twenty or thirty bucks. It has the fit and finish of, say,  an eyeglass case. Real design work all around. Anyway, now that I have a proper consumer unit with all the parts, I can cast my lot with the other ecstatic reviewers for this product. This is definitely the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. Even if I&#x27;d had to pay the full retail price of $210, it would have been worth it.malist than my previous toothbrush. Less dorky.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electrical toothbrushes by Philips&#x27; competitors for more than 20 years now. After three weeks of using Philips&#x27; Sonicare Diamondclean, my teeth feel very clean, are more polished and need less care when flossing. The very small brushhead manages to get around my 4 wisdom theeth very easily and cleans very well in between teeth. And I love the Gum Care setting that gently massages the gums. I find that the brush is easy to handle and like the feel of the material in my hands. The battery seems to last much longer than those used in my previous brushes.  The travel set is practical albeit it takes up quite a bit of room in the luggage. I am not sure yet about the \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; capability - the jury is still out for me whether teeth actually can get whiter by using this brush.  In summary, this is the best electrical toothbrush that I have been using in the last 20 years and I would think that it is the best currently on the market.  It is worth the investment! (I didn&#x27;t like to see that the \\&quot;leader\\&quot; price has already been reduced...</li>
            <li> Had this toothbrush about a week now and love it. Mine, however, did not include the glass, but instead a small stand. Also worth noting that large red letters across the front of the box read \\&quot;Dental Professional Trial - NOT FOR RESALE\\&quot;. So I&#x27;m not sure where Amazon is getting these from, but otherwise no complaints.</li>
            <li> Its my first elctric toothbrush, and great! I can&#x27;t say yet anything about the long term benefits, just tha it leaves me with a neat and clean feeling. the induction charger is nice, and the travel case (which is also a charger) is also very well made. The whole product is beautifully engineered. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My first power toothbrush was a Braun Oral-B and I used it diligently until its battery finally died. Before I replaced it, I asked my dental hygienist who enthusiastically recommended the Phillips Sonicare units. At first, I was skeptical that a handheld so-called \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; unit could compete with a dentist&#x27;s professional gear.  The first time I used the Phillips, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is almost equal in cleaning power to my dentist&#x27;s.  I get practically the same skull-rattling sensation from this unit that I get when I&#x27;m in the chair.  My teeth have the same squeaky clean feel they do when I&#x27;ve had them professionally cleaned.  I had been using the FlexCare model for the past several years and I decided that I should keep it in my desk at work so I replaced it at home with the new DiamondClean model.  While they both have essentially the same engine in them (31,000 strokes per minute), the newly designed brushes seem to do a slightly better job.  The redesigned power handle is quite effective too, yielding a sleek-looking object which appears to be less prone to becoming a \\&quot;crud-magnet\\&quot; around its base.  The ergonomics are slightly different than the previous versions as this model appears to be somewhat squared off in the hand as opposed to the earlier rounded power units.  I especially like the hard fitted carrying case (as compared to the fabric bag affair used on the earlier versions).  The ability to recharage the shaver thru a USB port is a great plus as I&#x27;m often travelling and find myself short of electrical outlets.    If you don&#x27;t need the USB adapter, a standard 110 (220) plug connects to a power base which allows for induction charging of the unit.  It comes with a standard bathroom glass and a flat glass hockey-puck piece, either of which have fitted bases to sit on top of the charging unit.  Since the unit is advertised to hold a charge for 42 sessions, I would not be inclined to waste a bathroom electrical outlet in order to keepthe unit on charge constantly.  Instead, I&#x27;ll just pop it onto the charge overnight every week or so.  In short, while pricey, I&#x27;m thrilled with the unit.  And my dental hygienist is always glad to see me because she&#x27;s starting to clean a set of almost perfectly clean teeth already!  One side note:  I&#x27;ve been using Phillips (Norelco) shavers and oral products for years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve found one that was not built in the Netherlands.  While the country of origin is nowhere marked on the unit itself, small print on the box shows the ubiquitous \\&quot;Made in .....\\&quot; legend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the cup - it also comes with a small clear disc which has a diameter of 2.75 inches which is much more streamlined.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything that I do not like about this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s a wonderful investment for dental care and I&#x27;m very happy that I made the purchase using coupons and discounts that were available at the time.</li>
            <li> I am fifty something guy with some gingivitis and an implant.  My hygienist asked me if I had ever tried this brush.  She wasn&#x27;t happy with my tooth brushing skills using an Oral B.  So I bought one here.  What a difference!  My teeth have never felt cleaner.  Best of all is that I can make them feel that clean each time I brush again.  I expect a very high grade for brushing the next time I get a cleaning, too.  As she said I would.  Now I&#x27;m getting more of these for the family.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying this toothbrush after going to the dentist and finding that I had to have 2 cavities filled.  The bill cost almost as much as this toothbrush (I had been eyeing it for awhile), so I thought &amp;#34;I&#x27;m going to pay this now so I don&#x27;t have to pay it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I went to the dentist, I had no cavities, and I also had significantly less plaque growth compared to other trips to the dentist.  they also commented on how my teeth had gotten a shade brighter, without any type of whitening toothpaste.  Furthermore, my gums had become even stronger and healthy since the last time they saw me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the toothbrush is also just fun.  The timer helps you ensure that you are spending enough time brushing in each area of your moyth, and the fast movements feel like you are giving your mouth a massage.  The toothbrush also holds a decent charge, and can go for a long time without having to recharge the tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to ANYONE.</li>
            <li> Met expectations for an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush ever. Sadly it stopped working after 8 months. Thankfully Philips customer service was amazing and they sent out a replacement.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to have. I have been using for 2 months and results are awesome.My tooth and gum looks clean,</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush! Was hesitant on shelling out the money but glad I did. The vibration of the toothbrush gave my mouth a strange feeling at first that I wasn&#x27;t used to, almost like a tickling but after a handful of times I got used to it. You know that feeling of slick clean teeth after leaving the dentists office? That&#x27;s how my teeth feel every time I brush. The &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; mode really leaves your teeth feeling slick so less food is able to build up. After 1wk of using 2x a day I noticed a dramatic difference in the tarter buildup of my teeth that regular brushing and flossing wouldn&#x27;t take care of. The best thing about it is that I got my husband to use it as well and he loves it! It has helped with the overall appearance and I drink coffee ALOT and it has helped with whitening of my teeth. If you or your spouse are thinking about getting one, save some money and buy 1 and share!! It comes with two different sized toothbrush attachment heads. He uses one and I use the other. After I brush my teeth, I pop my brush head off and he attaches his on. It&#x27;s like two for the price of one!! Ha. We will be ordering replacement heads in a couple of months, DEFinitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I am used to a manual toothbrush and never tried any kind of electric ons in my life until my dentist recommend it to me. Well, from the first try my teeth feels much cleaner. It&#x27;s like you cleaned them at the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging mechanism is another story. It&#x27;s just a mind blowing future technology thing. Every time I go to the bathroom I have to check it out of curiosity. As for the price, yes it&#x27;s a little bit high but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just simply Amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my wife, she loves it. She can&#x27;t get over how clean her teeth feel. She says that its like getting your teeth cleaned by the dentist.</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare is the best thing you do for you teeth.  Once you start using it you will wonder how you ever lived without it.  Your teeth and gums will be healthier than ever before.</li>
            <li> After using Electric Oral B Toothbrush for over 8 years, it was time to replace and upgrade my electric toothbrush.  At first, I was very sceptical of buying a different brand since I was very happy with my Oral B product.  However, many of my friends and relatives already had bought the Philips Sonicare Toothbrush and told me how happy they were with this product.  So that&#x27;s when I decided to purchase it after so many great reviews.  Tell you what, the first time I brushed my teeth with this new Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean Toothbrush, I instantly fell in love!  I am so happy that I bought this product and my teeth are sparkling clean and so much more whiter and brighter than they were before.  This new toothbrush removed all of the plaque and tartar from my teeth!  I love it so much and from now on will never switch to another brand!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever! I use all the settings.</li>
            <li> I bought this for nearly $200 and it worked well for around 12 months.  Then, it quit working - it will turn on but vibrates so softly that it doesn&#x27;t clean at all.  I have tried resetting it and looked on manufacturers website, and the warranty just ran out.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Teeth have honestly never felt so clean. Takes a bit to get used to. Let the brush do the work</li>
            <li> It makes the cleaning process very easy, but it broke after 9 months.</li>
            <li> I have owned the flexcare (model below this) for a couple years. the difference between these two models is pretty minor but if you are buying your first quality electric (not the cheapo junk) then this is the best price you will find anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because I have to travel for work and my wife still wanted one at home, so naturally I got the new one since it can be charged on 110v-220v through a wall or usb in the case or out of the case. It is very versatile and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is very appealing but only one major flaw. There is only one button but 5 brush settings, so you have to hit it several times if, like me, you finish brushing, spit, rinse the brush under water and then pulse it to dry it out (knock the water off).&lt;br /&gt;This means you have to hit the button 6 times to go on and off one time. Not a deal breaker but an oversight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hard case is awesome for traveling though.&lt;br /&gt;And the charge lasts about 2 weeks. Charge it until it stops itself as the instructions don&#x27;t mention this.</li>
            <li> The main reason I chose this over the other models after my Braun broke due to my stupidity was the design. I value design a lot, as far as functionality goes I do prefer this fancy toothbrush over my Braun 9000. It definitely provides a much better cleaning. Heck my gums looks much better than my last dental visit, I can&#x27;t wait for my next dental cleaning appointment to hear what my dentist says. I&#x27;m truly satisfied with this product from the moment I saw it I knew I wanted one. Case in fact, I had previously ordered the basic model from amazon before I saw this and after delivery; decided it was too bulky for me so I returned it and got this much sleeker stylish model and couldn&#x27;t be more please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there is one issue I have discovered with this particular model and that is,it attracts grease off one&#x27;s hands easily. This is something that was never present on my braun. Consequently, I gotta wash the handle with dish-washing soap once a week to keep it looking pristine.</li>
            <li> My new toothbrush is a replacement for an older model Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  I am very pleased with my new toothbrush and feel that upgrading to their newer version worth the extra money.  My toothbrush arrived before the date predicted and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL HELP ME KEEP MY TEETH UNTIL THE END &amp; SO I&#x27;LL BE SMILING IN MY CASKET. ( ; - )</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for! This toothbrush has everything in one, It works excellent!  my teeth actually feel cleaner and look much  better and healthier, compare to a regular electric toothbrush of course I still floss my teeth. the battery life last at least a week but, that&#x27;s because I brush my teeth tree times a day.  it&#x27;s a little price but it&#x27;s worth the money. the only bad thing is that the replacement heads are expensive other then that, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I admit to being a complete gadget freak! And this toothbrush fulfills my needs. It works great and, in my opinion, is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve had. I was afraid it would be too large since I travel a lot but it&#x27;s not. The case is ingenious and I love that I can charge it from my computer.Not that you&#x27;ll have to. It battery is very long lived.  And the glass cup charger is great. It&#x27;s actually attractive while also being useful. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I get high marks from my dentist since I started using sonicare brushes. I like the whitening setting; it really makes a difference in reducing my coffee stains. The travel case is really nice and works well. I love it so much I am buying one for my husband.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using these toothbrushes for over 3 years now.  When they first were introduced I bought one for myself, one for my wife, and one for my parents to share.  So in all, I have experience with 2 in my household and second hand experience from my parents.  My Father-In-Law also bought one as well and had a similar experience as ours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, this toothbrush is incredible!  It cleans better than any electric toothbrush available.  I love the different settings and programs it offers. It is also extremely stylish and looks like it is from the future. I have gone to the dentist and been told that there really isn&#x27;t anything for them to do as I didn&#x27;t have much to clean at all.  The convenience it offers when charging is also incredible as all you do is plop it into the base or put it into the cup and it charges without plugging anything into it.  The travel case is also incredible and works perfectly, you just plug in the usb cable and it charges just like how a cell phone would. Overall this toothbrush is everything I was looking for in a toothbrush!  With that said, I have to go into detail with the issue we have all had with the Sonicare Diamondclean handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery holds a great charge and is not an issue.  The function when it works is excellent!  The accessories are great!  But there is some fatal flaw in the design of this toothbrush that makes it extremely fragile.  Something inside comes &amp;#34;unglued&amp;#34; and the vibration delivered to the brush head is reduced by 90%, but you can feel the mechanism inside the handle vibrating and making strange noises.  This will occur if you drop it, EVEN ONCE.  I had this happen on my first brush, it slipped out of my hands (As it is a very sleek design) and fell into the sink and it was broken.  I contacted Sonicare and was told that dropping it voids the warranty and there was nothing they would do about it as it is considered abuse.  The fact that it was dropped from about 1 ft into my sink, ONCE, was not of concern to them.  After speaking with several supervisors they sent me a replacement as a one-time customer goodwill.  From this point on I was incredibly paranoid using it, gripping the handle until my fingers turned white for fear of dropping it and destroying another one.  I also briefed my wife on it as well as my parents, telling them that they better not drop it as it would void the warranty and even a little drop would break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things went well for a while, until about 14 months after the replacement, the same issue that occurred after dropping it, was happening again, but I had NEVER dropped it and have actually handled it with such care due to the trauma of my original experience with Sonicare Customer Service.  The mechanism had again somehow disengaged partially, reducing the vibration by 90% and making the Sonicare more of a normal toothbrush with a vibrating handle.  I contacted Sonicare, and after adamantly denying that I dropped it, they finally authorized a replacement, thank goodness for the 2 year warranty.  Mine lasted about 10 more months and it again, had the same issue and had never been dropped.  I contacted Sonicare and was told that I was a couple of months past the 2 year warranty and that I was out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my wife&#x27;s Sonicare Diamondclean, as she experienced the same issue.  She never dropped it, and was paranoid after my experience.  After about 11 months she had to have hers replaced due the same thing I experienced.  Her second one broke after only 8 months so she got a second replacement.  It lasted about 9 months and now she is out of warranty and her THIRD Sonicare Diamondclean handle is now also broken, several months out of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parents also had a similar experience.  The first Sonicare Diamondclean handle broke after about 8 months, received replacement.  Second handle broke after 10 months, received another replacement.  The third one broke after 9months and is now out of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Father-in-Law also purchased one of these after seeing how awesome it was during the first few months, and I told him he better not drop it.  He ended up having the same issue come up and when he tried to redeem the warranty for a replacement, because he did not have the receipt they refused to replace it.  Keep in mind, this is when the toothbrush was first released, so the thing hadn&#x27;t even been out for a year yet.  Even so, they refused to give him a replacement without the receipt/proof of purchase and it took me escalating it to darn near the CEO to get his replaced.  I calmly explained to them that my Father-In-Law was NOT A TIME TRAVELER and he had not somehow traveled into the future, bought their Sonicare DiamondClean, and then traveled back in time 18 months before release of the DiamondClean.  That their product had not even been out for 1 year, let alone 2 years.  After this reasoning they replaced it and said that it was a one time exception.  Interestingly, it has been working fine since then, going on close to 20 months now, but I suspect it will fail within the next few months, and he is already out of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it, 4 Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush sets, 3 of us went through multiple replacements, and all but 1 of them after 2 years are now broken.  NONE of those have been dropped, and I can personally vouch for mine and my wife&#x27;s being drop free.  As for my parents, they assure me it was never dropped and that is enough for me.  I also know for a fact that my wife and I do not brush our teeth hard and we literally just let the brush head &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; over the surface of our teeth applying just enough pressure for it to make contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the toothbrush is ridiculously awesome, and when it works it is the best thing ever!  The fact that I have direct experience with 2 Sonicare Diamondcleana, and another 2 through second hand experience, and all of them break, is unsettling.  Also the fact my Father-in-Law got lucky and his replacement is still working after 20 months also shows me it could be a sporadic quality control issue.  Either that or my Father-In-Law doesn&#x27;t brush his tooth as often as us.  So either we are all the unluckiest family out there, or there is some design flaw that causes the Sonicare DiamondClean&#x27;s vibration mechanism to come loose inside the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I have a bunch of replacement brush heads sitting in my drawer but no toothbrushes that work with them.  We have resorted to using a normal manual toothbrush while we figure out what to buy to replace the broken DiamondClean handles, especially since our finances are not in the best place due to medical bills, and lets be honest, the Sonicare Toothbrushes are not cheap. My gosh how horrible it is to not have an electric toothbrush, as it feels like my teeth is not getting even 1/10 as clean as it was getting with the Sonicare.  It really makes you miss an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the one warning I have for people who use electric toothbrushes is to be careful brushing a tooth with a crown on it, as I have been told by my dentist that the vibration will break down the cement holding the crown in place causing it to come loose.  How did we come upon that subject?  because my crown fell out.  ;)  So careful if you have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hope this review has helped you guys out and helps you make a more informed decision.  If you buy this Sonicare Diamondclean, SAVE THE RECEIPT and remember that you will probably have to get at least 1, maybe 2 replacements.  If your Sonicare Diamondclean is acting up, even a little and it sounds like the handle is beginning to rattle, get it replaced immediately.  I would highly recommend attempting to get it replaced before the 2 years is up, as that way you can at least get almost 3 years of use from the original purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am giving it 2 stars as thetoothbrush is incredible, the accessories are great, and it works fantastically!  I am taking away 3 stars because of the lack of reliability, although Sonicare WILL replace the broken handles IF you have your receipt and it is within the 2 year window. As I said, just realize you are paying for the privilege of using the Sonicare DiamondClean for at least 2 years, anything past that is a bonus. It may not be the original one you bought, but Sonicare will ensure you get a replacement as long as you are within the warranty period.  Also, their customer service is not the most friendly and they will try to trick you into admitting fault so they can immediately deny a replacement and void your warranty. They also require a receipt regardless if you registered your product, as I said, they basically accused my Father-in-Law of being a Time Traveler, trying to deny the warranty when the toothbrush had been out for less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now you know the risks and perils involved with entering into the transaction of obtaining a Sonicare DiamondClean.  Farewell and stay vigilant, as it is a great toothbrush, but you are going to have to fight for your right to brush with it...break, is unsettling.  Also the fact my Father-in-Law got lucky and his replacement is still working after 20 months also shows me it could be a sporadic quality control issue.  Either that or my Father-In-Law doesn&#x27;t brush his tooth as often as us.  So either we are all the unluckiest family out there, or there is some design flaw that causes the Sonicare DiamondClean&#x27;s vibration mechanism to come loose inside the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I have a bunch of replacement brush heads sitting in my drawer but no toothbrushes that work with them.  We have resorted to using a normal manual toothbrush while we figure out what to buy to replace the broken DiamondClean handles, especially since our finances are not in the best place due to medical bills, and lets be honest, the Sonicare Toothbrushes are not cheap. My gosh how horrible it is to not have an electric toothbrush, as it feels like my teeth is not getting even 1/10 as clean as it was getting with the Sonicare.  It really makes you miss an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the one warning I have for people who use electric toothbrushes is to be careful brushing a tooth with a crown on it, as I have been told by my dentist that the vibration will break down the cement holding the crown in place causing it to come loose.  How did we come upon that subject?  because my crown fell out.  ;)  So careful if you have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hope this review has helped you guys out and helps you make a more informed decision.

            <li> My Phillips Sonicare toothbrush worked great for three weeks &amp; then I couldn&#x27;t use it because I realized the base was not charging &amp; hadn&#x27;t been charging from the beginng. I now have to charge it in it&#x27;s travel case. The toothbrush itself I really like &amp; when it&#x27;s charged, it&#x27;s great!! But it&#x27;s very frustrating to purchase something new &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes since the original model with the screw-on brush head.  While better than a manual brush. I feel like they could be so much better.  Sonicare brushes, and this brush is no exception, isn&#x27;t as good at removing stains as touted, and the implication that it can clean in between teeth because it sends &amp;#34;sonic waves of cleaning&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t hold true.  You&#x27;re not getting rid of the floss anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to know:&lt;br /&gt;- It takes more than 12 hours to fully charge the brush when it&#x27;s depleted.  This just seems crazy to me--it should charge overnight and be fully charged for the next use.  This problem has been in every Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;- It tends lose strength as the battery gets below 50-75%.  So it&#x27;s just not doing as good a job unless it&#x27;s freshly been charged even though it touts a long time in between charges.&lt;br /&gt;- This particular model puts the modes and the power on the same button.  If you click the button within 6 seconds of turning the brush on, it will switch between cleaning modes.  Since I regularly turn the brush on and run it under water after brushing to clean the brush, if I don&#x27;t wait the right number of seconds, I have to push the button 5 more times to cycle through the modes to turn the brush off.  Older models had separate buttons for power and mode, and I find that design preferable.&lt;br /&gt;- The heads that come with this brush don&#x27;t have interchangeable color rings so it&#x27;s hard to keep track... is this my brush head or my wife&#x27;s?&lt;br /&gt;- You can use the heads from the Pro Results line as well as far as I can tell.  I&#x27;m not sure whether there&#x27;s any substantive difference between the two head types.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my son who likes it very much. this is his first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great results.  It&#x27;s an upgrade from my old Sonicare model.</li>
            <li> The sonic is awesome had it about a month now and my mouth has never felt cleaner when I am done brushing.  I can definitely see my teeth getting whiter from use.  It has a 2 minute time that&#x27;s recommended and I have been brushing 3 to 4 times a day.  It&#x27;s is a bit pricy but you will save that back in toothpaste.  I thought initially that the diamond head was to small because of the amount of paste you can get on the brush but it actually is plenty.  It&#x27;s great considering the crest 3D white is about $8 a tube.  No complaints at all so far.</li>
            <li> Since this is my second Sonicare toothbrush, I have a comparison.  This is the best because I don&#x27;t have to charge it often, it is thin and easily held, and it cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to get used to but it a great product. I had been reluctant to spend so much money just for a toothbrush, but I was very surprised to that really does make a difference. After just a few days my teeth were whiter &amp; it really does an amazing job of cleaning between teeth.</li>
            <li> I have tried the battery operated types Oral B, Crest Spin etc. with little to no satisfaction&lt;br /&gt;This only cost me $109.00 on a clearance rack @ Target&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it&#x27;s a super investment.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully Target makes Pro Power brush heads&lt;br /&gt;6 for $30.00 as opposed to $25.00 for 2 sonicare&lt;br /&gt;Beware, you will be checking your choppers out&lt;br /&gt;Way more than often.&lt;br /&gt;Combined with Flossing after eating and Arm &amp; Hammer Peroxicare toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;So much improvement and no regrets&lt;br /&gt;Buy this or at least put it on your Chanukah, Xmas, or Birthday list ASAP</li>
            <li> The initial product that was sent to me malfunctioned after only a day. I contacted Amazon &amp; they sent me a replacement the very same day- before I even returned the first one. The second one arrived in 2 days. I had never had to make a return to Amazon before &amp; I was extremely pleased at how easy it was. Very little inconvenience. The product itself is fantastic. My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve seen the hygienist everyday!</li>
            <li> Died after using for just 6 months.</li>
            <li> I love the small head on this brush, it makes cleaning your molars much easier.</li>
            <li> Even though it is expensive this has been a great toothbrush.  I travel a lot for work so it is very nice having the carrying case that doubles as a charger.  The charging glass is very nice and looks good on my bathroom counter..... since it is glass it is very easy to clean.  My mouth has never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> I got two of these - one for my husband and one for me.  My unit&#x27;s on/off switch never seemed to work well but it worked until recently and now can&#x27;t turn it on and if I do get it going, it starts changing speeds over and over.  No help from support because out of warranty a few months.  Not happy and will go back to Oral B.  Had one of those that was working for 10 years before I tried the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Great! use  all the time</li>
            <li> The unit was the modern model that i wanted, it came and nodamage and worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would caution that the vibration to the teeth and gums ---- this is not for a kid,&lt;br /&gt;or someone with bonds, fillings, or bridges it can vibrate the tooth and weaken the mortar&lt;br /&gt;or misuse on gum line , keep off of gum line , if not unit is so effective you&#x27;ll have no gums left.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush before this and loved it.  The battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any longer so I decided it was time for a replacement.  I looked around and saw many positive reviews for the Diamondclean from Sonicare.  Well let me tell you, from the first use I could tell it was much better than the Oral B.  Its been a week now and every time I brush i feel as if a dentist has just cleaned my teeth. Yes, this brush is that good. If you have the money, BUY IT.</li>
            <li> Wanna get your teeth white and shining again.  This does it.  Sounds like a commercial, but the power is this unit is amazing.  White teeth in 2 weeks.  Easy programming, and the USB powered travel case is a huge hit.  Not to mention the coolness of the shot glass that mimics as a charger.</li>
            <li> Had Oral B first this just seems to move far faster and leave teeth cleaner. Low the glass less messy easy charging.</li>
            <li> Since I hate and avoid going to the dentist, I thought a top-of-the-line toothbrush would be a good idea. It is.&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush,coupled with a WaterPik flosser makes my teeth feel like they do after going to the dentist. And without the hassle of getting a cleaning by someone who might not be very gentle and all the rest of it,like not caring if your jaw is getting tired from holding your mouth open or if the light is shining in your eyes etc;like my last dentist&#x27;s hygienist did her job. And for some reason I get migraines after getting a check up and cleaning,I think it might be from the air they blow onto your teeth,or I was given a touch of gas when I specifically said I didn&#x27;t want anything to relax me. In my case anything that let&#x27;s me avoid appointments is a good thing. This toothbrush is well worth it the expense,for what it does and for the fact you might be able to avoid dentist visits completely,or limit them to very infrequent check-ups and cleaning appointments.</li>
            <li> Good design, cleans really well. Comes with a nice case and accessories.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! I was hesitant on spending so much on a toothbrush, but it is MORE than &amp;#34;just a toothbrush&amp;#34;.... Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older E series that I had for a good 8 years.  I had an Oral B first, then I bought my wife a Sonicare E series that she didn&#x27;t like as much as my Oral B, so we switched.  I liked the E series way better than the Oral B.  The Sonicare just felt like it was doing more by vibrating and the way the movement is different from Oral B, and the result was that my mouth felt cleaner.  I was debating between this Diamond Clean or possibly the next stop down or maybe even an Oral B again (Oral B 5000 or 7000, or Sonicare Flexcare).  The price of this thing is ridiculous, and the only way for me to justify buying it is because of the sleek look, the glass charger, and the travel-charging case.  That&#x27;s enough for me, I&#x27;m easy.  After 2 months of use, I&#x27;m still happy with my purchase.  The Diamond Clean definitely feels more powerful than the E series, but not too overwhelming (by the by I NEVER use any of the other modes although I may try one day).  It&#x27;s a little bit louder than the E series too, but still not as loud as the Oral B 5000 that I bought my wife.  One thing that some reviewers had a problem with was only having 1 button versus 2 and having to shuffle through all of the modes before you can turn it off.  This is not true at all.  Once you turn the brush on and let it run for 5-10 seconds (which is about the amount of time it takes me to clean off after using it), the singular button WILL in fact turn off the brush rather than having to cycle through the other modes. I kept my E series fairly clean by unscrewing and rinsing out after every use, and I still do the same thing here - rip the brush head off and just give it a quick rinse.  I&#x27;m somewhat of a neat freak with my toothbrush and the Diamond Clean definitely doesn&#x27;t have as many nooks and crannies for crust to build up in which is a big plus.  The only things that I don&#x27;t like about this toothbrush is that the travel case doesn&#x27;t work with the covers for the brush heads.  Also, I got the black one so if I want to get black heads I&#x27;ll end up buying them online or at a store I don&#x27;t like to shop at.  But all of that is peanuts to me.  It&#x27;s excessive, too expensive, and the brush heads work on cheaper models - but the other models just don&#x27;t look this cool.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this product.  She is a dental hygienist.  I really think this product does a great job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> My wife and I just purchased two DiamondClean toothbrushes.  The white model for her, and the black model for me.  We discovered that the white model comes with a charging stand that allows you to charge and store your toothbrush in an upright position.  The black model only comes with the charging glass.  I prefer the charging stand because its more compact and takes up less counter space.  I contacted Philips and their support person directed me to their parts site to purchase the charging stand separately for an additional $20 after tax and shipping.  He could not tell me why Philips doesn&#x27;t provide a stand for the black model, he just confirmed that they don&#x27;t.  After all the money spent on this excessively high priced toothbrush, I&#x27;m disappointed that Philips wouldn&#x27;t throw one in for free, so I knocked one star rating off for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is much more powerful than your average battery powered unit.  Your teeth and gums will really feel it.  In fact, the instructions say that the unit doesn&#x27;t reach full power until after 14 days, so that your mouth can get used to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few electric toothbrushes and this is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;Feels strange to begin with as the brush vibrates very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Brush heads are a little expensive.</li>
            <li> ********************************************&lt;br /&gt;See my updates following the original review - the short of it, now two years after purchase I&#x27;m still very happy with the DiamondClean toothbrush!  Also, some reviewers/users complain about not being able to select the mode without the toothbrush &#x27;spraying all over.&#x27;  This is NOT an issue if you read the manual and it&#x27;s very simple to select the mode you want.&lt;br /&gt;********************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest update 4/2014 -- am currently using and testing both the [[ASIN:B0086VIA3O Diamond Clean Standard Replacement]] and the InterCare Standard Replacement Brushes.  The [[ASIN:B00HMMUD2O InterCare Standard Replacement Brush Heads ]] are very similar to the DiamondClean in type, but they offer deeper cleaning in interdental spaces/gaps than do the standard DiamondClean Brush.  Right now I am switching back and forth between these two brushes to see if one works better than the other for me.  Although I just started doing my &#x27;trial&#x27;, I believe that for me, the Intercare brushes may work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** ORIGINAL REVIEW ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded to this unit after my previous SoniCare brush failed to hold a charge after 10 years of use.  I was very happy with how using a SoniCare brush improved my gum&#x27;s health, so for me it was a &#x27;no brainer&#x27; and I knew I would replace the old SoniCare with a new one from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When making my buying decision, I was trying to decide between the DiamondClean and the [[ASIN:B002CVTVVY Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]].  I was interested more in function and practical features than I was in design, or the USB charging capabilities.  One of the features of the FlexCare Plus brush that I was very interested in was the UV sanitizing feature.  Before making my purchase, I read as many reviews as I could, I visited a local store that carried both the FlexCare Plus and the DiamondCare, and I also asked my periodontist for his recommendation.  From my store visit, I was leaning towards the FlexCare Plus model because of the UV cleaning option and the fact that there was a separate On/Off button.  My periodontist said that he didn&#x27;t believe the UV feature would make much difference, and that it would be just as good to periodically soak the brush head in Listerine or similar product. In other words, he said he didn&#x27;t think it was &#x27;worth paying extra for&#x27; the UV sanitizing feature.  Instead, he suggested I go with the model I preferred based on price and any other features I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided on the DiamondClean model based on its having a better performing brush.  I have to admit that I was concerned with two things about this model: no On/Off switch, and a smooth surface which I wondered if it would be slippery when wet.  Now, after over a month of use, I can report that I am very, very pleased with my decision.  First, the cleaning ability of this brush far surpasses the older unit it replaced.  Second, the surface is not slippery when wet and it actually feels very comfortable in the hand.  Lastly, the issue I was concerned about the most -- not having an On/Off switch and having to cycle through all five settings whenever one uses it -- is a non-issue.  As you will see in some of the other online reviews, some users complain that the DiamondCare&#x27;s lack of an On/Off switch causes as situation such as what this reviewer wrote: \\&quot;You select the mode you want by pressing a *single* button multiple times. So, if you want \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;, you need to put the brush head into your mouth, and press the button five times. You can&#x27;t do that while looking at the display, because the handle will turn on on the first button press, and splatter the toothpaste all over the place in \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode, while you&#x27;re progressing slowly to the mode you actually want. \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In actual use the DiamondCare is not saddled with the problem if one follows the procedure in the owner&#x27;smanual.  The way it works is like this: after one choses the mode one wants to use -- by pushing the button to cycle among the various modes (i.e., Sensitive, Whitening, Cleaning, Gum Care) -- the DiamondCare operates in that mode for the completion of the cycle.  The next time one uses the brush, simply put your toothpaste on the brush, press the On/Off/function combo button, and the DiamondCare starts up in the same mode you selected last time.  If one needs to interrupt your brushing, simply push the function button and the brush remains in &#x27;pause&#x27; for 30 seconds. When you push the button again it starts up where it left off in terms of mode and timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I simply can&#x27;t believe how clean my mouth feels after each use. My gums are looking great and I&#x27;m looking forward to many years of satisfaction from my DiamondCare brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** UPDATE -- 4 months after purchase ****&lt;br /&gt;After over 4 months of use I am pleased to say that I am still very happy with my SoniCare brush.  A full charge lasts for about 3 weeks. I don&#x27;t keep the unit constantly charging, but instead give it an overnight charge after the status light turns amber for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** UPDATE -- 1 YEAR LATER ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still very happy with the Sonicare DiamondClean.  It is easy to use, clean, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it moderately wet.  Maintains a charge for at least three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE -- 2 YEARS after purchase ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush is still working well.  I have never used the USB charging feature, but I do like the nice case for travel.  Because the case itself can charge the toothbrush with a USB cable, one need not be concerned about how much their toothbrush is charged before a trip.  I charge my toothbrush using the included charger base that goes under the also included charging glass, which is where my DiamondClean toothbrush resides between uses.  This is nice because it helps protect your brush from beingknocked off the counter or shelf in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is a very good toothbrush.The two chargers are very handy. The box with the USB charger is convenient upon travelling.&lt;br /&gt;The drawback is the cost of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Congrats Philips on addressing so many improvements in this great new toothbrush.  i had a Philips FlexCare Plus before this and used it for several years until it finally died.  i loved it, and this one is even better.  All the little improvement touches.  Storing it in a glass with an inductive charging system is brilliant...easy access, and frankly i don&#x27;t really know if the big cleaning device for the FlexCare Plus really worked or just made me feel good.  The form factor is so much improved.  Lighter, easier to hold.  Adding a charging function to the case brings this up to date in a great way.  Great job Philips!  The best electric toothbrush yet!</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace a Sonicare Flexcare that we had been using for 4 years. Flexcare was great, this is better. Different brush design, teeth feel cleaner, Also, gum cleaning program does a very good job, in addition to the regular cleaning program. New charger very elegant, new travel case also very elegant. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After owning a Sonicare for years, I decided to upgrade to the Diamond Care based on the great reviews and stunning design. As a piece of art, it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. As a toothbrush, it doesn&#x27;t work (literally). Aside from the counter-intuitive design, it just stopped working after 5 months of use (out of warranty, out of luck), but even when it did work it turned out to be a big, frustrating step down from the older model we had been using.&lt;br /&gt;The multiple brushing modes are great, but the one-button interface is counter-intuitive and even after months of use I found it hard to predict when it would switch modes or just restart in the same one. If you do find yourself in the wrong mode (which happens often if you&#x27;re sharing the brush within the family) you can&#x27;t cycle through the modes with the brush off -- a messy prospect if you&#x27;ve already pasted-up. And, speaking of sharing the brush within your family, unlike the lesser Sonicare models, they don&#x27;t make color-coded Diamond Care heads, so you&#x27;re never quite sure if you&#x27;re using your own.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the biggest disappointment was that the whole damn thing stopped working altogether after just a few months. Our older Sonicare had been working flawlessly for 6 years when I decided to step up to the Diamond Care model. In hindsight, it was a big step down and a lot of money wasted. Still looks great, though...</li>
            <li> The design of this toothbrush is second to none and is reminiscent of the minimal, yet beautiful, design of Apple products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, this toothbrush works extremely well and cleanses teeth easily and expertly. I have found it to be a superior product to brushes offered by Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel a lot, so my favourite aspect of this toothbrush is the included travel case which allows the device to be inductively charged by USB, thus negating the need for additional chargers. Battery life is also impeccable, and lasts for well over a week of twice a day 2 - 5 minute brushing sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it is a little bit fragile. If dropped on its head, it may break easily (this was my second purchase after the initial toothbrush met its demise from a 50cm fall onto a tile floor).</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted here. This thing has been rock solid and does the job solidly. Nice piece.</li>
            <li> New charger is awesome, I&#x27;ve used sonicare for years and highly recommend it! This new model is the bomb! Love it!</li>
            <li> Powerful.  Best powered tooth brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I actually can&#x27;t wait to go back to the dentist for my next check up to see the difference.</li>
            <li> I love this new toothbrush except, the handle is slippery and easy to drop since there is no rubber for traction to keep it gripped in your hand.  Bottom is different from their older models.  My charging devices I had for my earlier sonicares will not work with this product.</li>
            <li> The best electric toothbrush on the market.  It cleans so much better than the toothbrush I was using.</li>
            <li> Stopped working in a few months. I guess factory defect. But when it was working it was 5/5.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever!</li>
            <li> Use of two months, a fresh mouth feel than before</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how this toothbrush could receive anything but 5 stars. I am someone who has, no matter how often I brush and floss, always been burdened with many dental problems. That is until I received this toothbrush as a Christmas gift. I have been using this toothbrush since Christmas Day, so not even a month. I saw the dentist in November and had another appointment today. My dentist immediately noticed a difference in my teeth. She noted that they were brighter, and said they looked to be much cleaner than our last visit. Every time I am finished brushing I feel like I just left the dentist. I also love that this has a pause feature, so you can turn the brush off without it losing it&#x27;s spot in the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is this one is a bit better! I love it. Ive only brushed for one night but I can tell even though my head is new on my older brush that this tooth brush is awesome!!! Thumps up! Try it!</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Philips toothbrush I&#x27;ve had in 2 years. The first one bought in 2011 was the HX6590 which stopped working after 6 months. I was sent a replacement which stopped working after another 6 months. Undeterred (or just stupid), I thought maybe the model was a dud and decided to try the HX9332. I thought the more expensive product would be more reliable. 7 months down the line and it has stopped working. Lasted 1 more month than its predecessors. Philips toothbrushes suck. I WILL NEVER BUY A PHILIPS TOOTHBRUSH EVER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> This is a really ingenious toothbrush. The case doubles as a charger. It can be plugged into a computer via USB or charged via an AC power adapter. The charger is 220V compatible so it is suitable for international travel. The glass is a charger as well ! The toothbrush lights to tell you which mode it&#x27;s in - clean, white, polish, etc. Despite running on battery, it is very powerful.  If this toothbrush was any fancier, it would fly off to remind you it&#x27;s time to brush.  The only downside is the high price. I have to note that I got this one free through the Amazon VINE program. I am not sure that I would have paid the list price on this for a new one. But if you really have to have the best on the market, this is it.</li>
            <li> Eleven months after I purchased this item, the vibrational force decreased significantly. I called Philips product support and was told that this loss of power is not uncommon and that as the product was within its one-year warranty, would be replaced within about 10 days. Three weeks later, still not having received the product, I attempted chats with Philips customer-support staff. I chatted with Donna, and Agnelo, both of whom seemed poorly trained. Seemingly no matter what I said, they responded by telling me that someone would contact me within 24 to 48 hours. Then, I called customer support. I was told by supervisor Justina that while Philips has units in stock, the units are reserved for sale and cannot be used as replacement units for defective product under warranty. I asked Justina to contact the physician customer-support group to see whether they could solve my problem and she agreed to call me back the same day (I am a physician). She never called me. When I called her back, she had left for the day. I spoke with a second supervisor, Lisa, who was outright rude to me on the phone. When I explained my problem—that it was taking too long for me to get a replacement toothbrush—I explained to Lisa that I am a physician and that if it might result in better service, she could transfer me to the physician customer-support group. She said to me, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m happy you&#x27;re a physician.&amp;#34; In response, I said that the only reason I was mentioning I was a physician is that Philips is a healthcare company that has separate groups for physicians and consumers. I told her that it was snide and inappropriate of her to say that she was &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; I&#x27;m a physician. She claimed that she meant it sincerely. I asked her why she was &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; with my career choice, and she said it just made her happy. This is atrocious behavior from a company like Philips. Someone at Philips should bring this feedback to the attention of the people I&#x27;ve named herein (assuming the names are real and not aliases), and should overhaul the management and training of the customer-support department. I give three stars to the product for average strength compared with other alternatives at half the price, minus two stars for poor product quality (it died within 11 months) and abysmal customer service.  Update 12/22/15: I&#x27;m now on my third replacement unit. All three units have failed in what appears to be the same way: the power switch stops working. On this current unit, the power switch failed within three months. Philips continues to have the most poorly trained support group. I&#x27;m constantly told that someone will call me within two to four business days, but no one ever returns my calls. I would go with another brand.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a number of ultrasonic toothbrushes. This is by far the best. My teeth are dentist clean everyday. I love it. The best part is the gadget factor. First, is the glass charger. One of my pet peeves was the leaking of the other toothbrushes. I was always cleaning up paste leakage. With the glass charger that is not a problem. Second is the USB travel charger. Brilliant!!! I travel internationally for busniess and carrying one more charger is a total PITA.  I love that I can just plug into my computer.  The third thing and possibly the best, is the jewelry cleaning aspect. I don&#x27;t know what made me the think of it - maybe the name. But, I used the smaller head that comes with set to clean my engagement ring and eternity band. Oh my!!! The best cleaning.  I have a steam cleaner and an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner. The Diamondclean did the best job. I have no idea if it is safe to clean your jewelry with this toothbrush, but it works.  Proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> first let me start by saying that i used to love sonicares.  i&#x27;ve owned every generation, and until the flexcare generation, each one has served me loyally for years until the batteries were just too old or the buttons would literally wear off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately, starting with the flexcare generation, while you gain a slimmer handle, a MUCH better removable tip that is much easier to clean or prevent gunk, and more powerful motors, what you lost is reliability.  in the two years i had my flexcare, i had to replace it SIX times under warranty.  usually it&#x27;s because the shaft inside would snap, so while the handle would buzz, the tip would no longer vibrate.  i also had the battery fail to charge, as well as a weak motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was enormously frustrating, but at least customer service would replace the unit each time after 20 minutes with them on chat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with the diamondclean, the handle and tips got even better...when it works...  but unfortunately it is breaking just as often, with the same issues as with the flexcare:  broken shafts, weak motors, and dead batteries.  i purchased the diamondclean on 3/25/12, and am currently on my SIXTH replacement handle (7/22/13).  and unfortunately now philips requires you to provide original receipt after the second replacement handle, otherwise they won&#x27;t send them any more.  so even if you registered your purchase with them when you first bought the diamondclean, they suddenly refuse to acknowledge it, adding frustration to an already annoying issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so after a ton of years of being an incredibly loyal sonicare user, i&#x27;m just fed up.  even though i have a new replacement handle in the mail to me as i write this, i ordered an oral b toothbrush as well, because i know it&#x27;s just a matter of time until the sonicare breaks again, and i&#x27;m tired of having to deal with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;each time the customer service rep will make it seem like it&#x27;s your fault that the handle is broken, by asking things like whether you&#x27;ve dropped it or used it to joust with a tyranosaurus.  that way they can deny your claim.  while i&#x27;ve never done either of those (t-rexes are more scared of manual toothbrushes), i suspect that what is actually causing the issue (other than overly brittle metal shafts, obviously) is having a relatively small jaw.  if the head jams up by your jaw/gums/cheek as it&#x27;s trying to vibrate 30K times per second, either your face, or the shaft, have to give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i guess if you think about it that way, i&#x27;m glad that the sonicare keeps breaking...  &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Just went to the hygienist today, and she said my teeth looked great. Thank you sonicare diamond.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed, actually.  I&#x27;ve been on a 3-month cleaning schedule for years.  Always, lots of plaque, pockets in my gums, etc.  After seeing my dentist in November, he recommended the Sonicare.  I hadn&#x27;t been back for a cleaning or exam since then, due to a crazy schedule, but I have been using the Sonicare faithfully and flossing not-so-faithfully.  Today, during my exam, he found ONE pocket of a &#x27;4&#x27; and most of the rest were 1&#x27;s and 2&#x27;s.  A record for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning also took about half the time, and it has been 9 months since they were last cleaned at the dentist.  I never thought I&#x27;d hear him say, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll see you in 6 months.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a believer!  (The travel case is pretty cool, too. by the way!)</li>
            <li> whole different kind of tooth brushing, very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare brushes for many years because they have been recommended by my dental hygienist. This brush does a lot of the work for you and is very thorough. I am a nut regarding my teeth and dental hygiene and this def lives up to high standards. Would absolutely recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush ! I just received it yesterday from Fingerhut w/standard shipping and all I can say is I should&#x27;ve switched ALONG TIME AGO! I&#x27;m in love! My teeth feel like they were cleaned by the hygienist after every time I used it. I went from this crappy battery powered one that was ok but standard for cheap . After upgrading all I can say is .............IM IN LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box is a small medium size, very sleek like the brush itself. Everything was packed as it should in a soft box case and everything in separate plastic bags. The tooth brush was in its separate bag which I think it should be kept in the travel case just as a precaution when shipping. When u boxing and setting up it was pretty easy. The cup was unusual and silly to think its a charger......but it is. The plug could&#x27;ve been a little smaller than it is but its fine. I keep the cup charger in the bathroom and the travel case in our bedroom just in case if we had guests over. The travel case is plugged into my DVR box and it charges fine. The travel case is a high quality plastic on the inside and really unique on the outside, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s made from a highly durable nylon. I&#x27;m afraid to get it dirty haha. It comes with one standard brush head and one compact one. Using the brush wasn&#x27;t hard it was mostly charged and I used it right after packaging. The brush doesn&#x27;t get dirty easily for me that is. Very high quality! It&#x27;s better than my 18 year olds sisters Oral B Pro 5K brush. It has a lot stronger sonic pulsation and I love it to death! Now about the affordability , it is pricy but you get what you pay for, and to keep the battery in its tip top shape always charge it everyday. Not doing so could shorten the life of the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affordability: it is one of the priceyest ones I&#x27;ve seen but i bought mine from Www.fingerhut.com and I have no problem with the price. I pay only $22.00 a month until I pay it off next income tax. This is a great brush and I recommend it to anyone! I can&#x27;t wait to go to my next dentist appointment!</li>
            <li> Like it and have given one to a family member also</li>
            <li> I had it for 18 month. I can&#x27;t use it now, because turn on/off button doesn&#x27;t work, and charging function doesn&#x27;t work too. My wife had same experience after 8 month. 2 Stars because it cleans teeth really well.</li>
            <li> As a Dental Hygienist, I tell my patients daily to get an electric toothbrush and no not necessarily this one. The reasons I recommend an electric toothbrush are, it helps prevent further gum tissue recession, it gets your mouth cleaner, it does the work for you and its just easier. I have heard many of my patients tell me that they like the Oral-B spinbrush the best as comopared to Sonicare. I personally have never used the Oral-B spinbrush. While I do like the diamond clean, I think my next electric toothbrush purchase will be a Oral-B spinbrush. The reasons are because the Oral-B spinbrush covers more surface area of the teeth as compared to Sonicare, its spinning action seems much more gentle than the excessive vibrations of the Sonicare TB. To me the diamond clean is a bit too much, I have to use the sensitive setting and still it can be a little powerful for me. It is super easy to clean though and to recharge, it takes hardly anytime to recharge it maybe an hour or two and its ready to go for another 2 weeks with repeated use.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is so astonishing that I look forward to “brushing.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist suggests occasional brushing with no toothpaste. I often do this before going to bed. I brush with toothpaste every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Sonicare when my Oral-B electric toothbrush diminished dramatically in performance with age such that it became worthless (about 2 years.). I now know that even when new the Oral-B was infinitely inferior to the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the Philips Sonicare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) RPM is incredible; dramatically more than the Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt; Minor notes: I must spread toothpaste on my teeth before I engage this electric toothbrush. Also after engaging this Sonicare my head must be over the sink as the RPM causes me to drool. Maybe more than you wanted to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) My teeth feel squeaky clean;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) I love the traveling case:&lt;br /&gt; When I took my Oral-B on a trip I put it in a plastic baggie.&lt;br /&gt; Often on arrival I found the Oral-B had activated and discharged its battery.&lt;br /&gt;The included travel case with the Sonicare prevents unintended activation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) I have had this Sonicare for about a month. After the first 24-hour charge, it still has maximum charge / RPM after 30 days. The Oral-B required constant charging.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a second Sonicare for my wife. She loves it. Even at $190 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used to have two Oral-B’s in 2 separate chargers all the time. Now we have one charger on the bathroom counter for both of us – and we seldom need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually look forward to my next cleaning with the hygienist. I have one (1) tooth implant that routinely collects plaque; I am anxious to discover if there has been an improvement with this Sonicare as I expect.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years and was happy this one was recommended.  It&#x27;s even better than my original one.  Runs a long time on a charge and makes my teeth feel like I just had a cleaning.  Very easy to charge and well worth the money.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my third Philips Sonicare and I found the Diamond Clean to be superior than the regular sonicare.  Has improved my dental check-ups.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Durable&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Our teeth are white.... boom.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing toothbrush to use-I&#x27;ve only used it for the past 3 days, but I&#x27;m sold. I&#x27;ve previously used the Sonicare Flexcare for 3+ years and thought it was a great toothbrush, but the DiamondClean surpasses it. It seems alot more powerful and my teeth feel &amp; look better. The main reason I purchased this toothbrush is the fact that it has only 1 button for on/off and mode changes- Using the flexcare, more often than not, I would accidentally change modes during brushing-would have to stop change back to clean. This does not happen with the DiamondClean! The sleek look and the cool charging options make this Sonicare a pleasure to own and use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few oral b electric brushes, very expensive too, and they don&#x27;t even come close to the clean I can see and feel from this Sonicare DiamondClean.  It really is the best in this category, and infinitely better and cleaning your teeth and better oral care than a manual toothbrush.  It&#x27;s worth the investment if it saves you from even just one cavity, so I recommend it highly.  I just wish I had something like this when I was a kid, else I wouldn&#x27;t have these old mercury filling these days.</li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare Toothbrush user for over 15 years, but not any more!  The toothbrush does do a great job cleaning, but the quality control has disintegrated.  My first Sonicare lasted for over 5 years and was only replaced because the rubber was worn.  Since then, my husband and I have gone through 4 models.  I got the DiamondClean for Christmas of 2011, 18 months later it was dead!  Spending over $140 just for the toothbrush every 2 years and adding in another $20 for the price of replacement heads is ridiculous! The value to price ratio just isn&#x27;t there, it is cheaper to go to the dentist and make the hygienist work a little harder!</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush cleans 100 times better than any other power toothbrush.  I like to use the compact head with the pointy tip and longer bristles in the front. It realy cleans between my teeth, my somewhat crooked bottom teeth have had all the tarter brushed away.  My teeth feel like I have been at the dentist after every brushing.  Co-workers have noticed that I have whiter and brighter teeth.  And I definitely tell them why.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best that I have ever owned. I have owned many of the other electric toothbrushes on the market, to include the previous models by this name brand. The cleaning power of this brush is superior by far. It is a bit costly but worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush ive ever used! Feels really solid and well built.  The travel case it comes with is also awesome and useful.  It comes with 3 options to charge. 1. put the glass ontop of the charger then the brush in the glass.  2. put the plastic tray on top of the charger then the brush in it and you can keep the glass somewhere else or not even use it.  3. use the travel case.. put brush inside and plug in the usb cable to the travel case and bam!</li>
            <li> I received this toothbrush for Christmas, and I&#x27;m very impressed with it. I&#x27;ve never owned a sonic toothbrush before, but love my Clarisonic face cleaner so much that I thought I&#x27;d try one out!  One thing I really appreciated about this model was the \\&quot;Soft Start\\&quot; feature. This makes the toothbrush start softly the first couple of times you use it and ramp up in intensity over the first 14 uses. You can disable this option if you&#x27;re already used to the feeling of a sonic toothbrush, but since I&#x27;ve only used manual toothbrushes, I really appreciated being able to ease my way in.  Also, I LOVE the cup charger. The cup comes off of its metallic charging base, so I just set the cup &amp; toothbrush by my sink and leave the charger in a more inconspicuous area. The toothbrush will indicate when it&#x27;s time to charge it, so I&#x27;ll simply move the cup back over to the charger then (this happens about once a week so far). Originally, I thought the USB charger was a silly idea, but USB wall outlets are becoming much more comercially viable, and I even have a few USB outlets on most of my surge protectors, so I could actually see myself using this feature eventually.  Altogether, I&#x27;m extremely impressed at how much cleaner my teeth are! It&#x27;s almost completely stopped the plaque build-up I get behind my front bottom teeth, and I&#x27;m noticing my teeth are much whiter, too. I find the pulse of the timer when it&#x27;s time to switch zones is extremely useful at making sure I&#x27;m brushing evenly, also. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product. Get it!  *edit (oops. Just realized I typed \\&quot;tootbrush\\&quot; a couple times)</li>
            <li> I converted from a Oral B brand brush after having it for 8+ years and love my new Philips Sonicare.  My teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why, with these brushheads being so similar to the ProResults Soniccare heads, that they decided to remove any sort of individual identification of brushheads (ie color coded rings). Every single Sonic model has color-coded brush heads, or color coded rings that you put on the brush heads .. that is, every single model EXCEPT their ultra-high end Diamondclean? Doesn&#x27;t make any sense. With 4 folks in our household using this brush, we need the color-coded brushheads to make life a lot easier.  EXTREMELY disappointed that this critical component is missing, especially since it&#x27;s always been on every single prior model.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is expensive but does a good job.  I am a convert and may never hand brush my teeth again.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used (and I researched them before I put up the big bucks for this one), but I am more than glad I did.  It works much better than I expected and actually saves me time brushing.  It holds a charge for days between charges and the stand is very small but works great.  Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I used a competitor&#x27;s product for 6+ years and loved it. I did not think it possible that another toothbrush could surpass that product. But, this one has. My dentist recommended this. I researched models and decided to splurge on this one. I am really glad that I did. This toothbrush works as promised, is packaged wonderfully, and actually makes brushing somewhat less tedious. The glass is very handy, as is the travel case. My teeth and gums feel reinvigorated and healthy. I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li> We purchased two and have now used these toothbrushes for a number of weeks.  We had problem with one charging.  It was the charging unit and we were sent a new one at no cost immediately.  They have worked great, holding a charge for 3 weeks or so and have cleaned and revitalized how our mouths feel.  I cannot wait for our next dental check up.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has a built in timer and that you have choices as far as cleaning, polishing, sensitivity, etc. I am not sure about the glass recharging station, but I guess if you have 2 brushes in the bathroom you can charge both at the same time.</li>
            <li> Great if you can afford it.</li>
            <li> i recently &#x27;upgraded&#x27; to this diamond clean system from the sonicare &#x27;flexcare&#x27; system. the overall clean feeling is roughly the same, although the new diamond clean system has a much cleaner design. i do have two issues. first, to toggle between the function, you must press the power button until you reach the desired setting. unfortunately, you&#x27;ll have to know just how many &#x27;clicks&#x27; it takes to get there as there is no why to see which function is illuminated while the brush is in your mouth. of course, you can select toggle between the functions while it&#x27;s not in your mouth, but then you&#x27;ll have toothpaste all over your bathroom. the second issue is with the travel case. there is no space for the brush head cover. i don&#x27;t know about you, but when i travel, i like to keep my toothbrush covered (you never know what housekeeping is spraying in the bathroom). you could always keep it in the closed travel case, but i like to let my brush dry.</li>
            <li> Snazzy appearance, but the brush started splaying out within a few days. Selecting from cleaning modes is annoying. I miss my old Sonicare.  ***UPDATE*** July 5, 2016 A few months ago, the brush began to perform poorly (brushing wasn&#x27;t as intense). Tonight it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, even though I recharged it three days ago. I think I&#x27;m going back to a regular toothbrush for a while. My Sonicares don&#x27;t last me very long.  ***UPDATE JULY 6, 2016*** Good thing I registered! I was barely covered by the warranty, and will receive a new handle. I think I initially received a lemon since the charge never lasted more than a few days.</li>
            <li> Wife and I have it does great job very pleased with it. Two different charging stands would recommend it without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Marked improvement over the cheaper models.</li>
            <li> Great Toothbrush my Teeth have never been so clean. I picked this model after a long market research and I am very happy.</li>
            <li> This keeps my teeth so clean. I&#x27;m able to clean my back molars without trouble and my teeth feel incredibly smooth and polished for a good while after I brush. Switching from a manual toothbrush, the results I see with this brush is amazing. If you can afford it, I would definitely buy this product, but if not the other sonicare brushes are amazing too!</li>
            <li> excellent machine as suggested by my dentist</li>
            <li> great battery life, great reviews and comes with a lot of accessories.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing negative is the button sometimes sticks when changing modes or turning off.</li>
            <li> Oprah Magazine recommended this product.  I was highly disappointed.  I don&#x27;t know if it was because I bought it from an outside provider other than Sonicare, but the toothbrush does not work right.  The brush head will not correctly fit on the base and it makes horrible noise and doesn&#x27;t vibrate correctly.  I really wish i hadn&#x27;t spend this large amount of money on a toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t work half as good as my $20 sonicare that I bought from CVS.</li>
            <li> I upgraded once my last Sonicare toothbrush became rather nasty and couldn&#x27;t hold a charge after 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new one is really nice. The handle is sanitary and there is no soft rubber component that might discolor or accumulate grime. The bottom is recessed and smooth and easily wiped clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charger is really convenient. The carry case and USB charger are awesome as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge won&#x27;t hold as long as my previous toothbrush but this one has more charging options. That&#x27;s something I can live with.</li>
            <li> Although this is the most expensive personal dental hygiene item that I have ever purchased, I felt the difference after the first use.  The same feeling that I usually get after visiting the dental hygenist when I go for my dental cleaning and exam. The built in timer really helps to give all of your teeth the right amount of bruching time.  Very satisfied with the puchase on Amazon.com and with the seller of this item.</li>
            <li> When it first arrived 5 months ago, everything works fine and it looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I recommend anyone to look for something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- pressing the button to stop, may get you into the different modes instead. I feel the various modes isn&#x27;t practical and more a marketing gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;- the button is barely working now! I have to press it really hard, and it gets harder by the day. Obviously it didn&#x27;t go through a proper stress test.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently deployed overseas and had this product was recommended to me by one of our military dentists. I grew up without dental care and thankfully the military has been able to provide me with some much needed maintenance over the years, but I&#x27;ve still struggled with an occasional cavity here and there no matter how often I brushed or flossed.  I was a little hesitant to purchase this product once I saw the price and I was concerned about it being able to be shipped to my current location BUT it arrived here in 10 days and I think I&#x27;m in love! This toothbrush was without a doubt worth every penny, I never thought I&#x27;d ever be this excited about brushing my teeth or find myself writing a product review for a toothbrush! My point is, this product works. My teeth have never felt cleaner and after a week I can already see a difference. Although this product isn&#x27;t perfect -- *you have to switch through every setting to actually turn it off/no UV cleaning kit*-- I would still highly recommend this to friends,family, and other Amazon members.</li>
            <li> There is no need to purchase the additional warranty.  The product has a free 2 year warranty upgrade included as long as you register the product by 12/30/2015.  This gives you a total of 2.5 years of warranty.</li>
            <li> They keep changing these things and this one is better than the previous versions but there are still some issues. For instance, the one button to rule them all can sometimes be confusing. I don’t know that any of the other modes are even worth having. I’d rather have just one mode. Also, because of the one button if you want to turn it on just temporarily to get water out after rinsing it you have to wait a certain amount of time or press the button like 5 times till it turns off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of Sonicare toothbrush models and this model is BY FAR the best yet! The slimmer, sleek design is good-looking and the rechargeable base actually looks nice sitting out on the bathroom counter. I can go just about 3 weeks without needing to recharge, however.  The travel case and USB charger make traveling with this super convenient and easy. This pretty little toothbrush does the most amazing job cleaning AND whitening teeth! My smile was noticeably brighter/whiter after only 1-2 weeks of daily use and it feels like I got a professional cleaning after each use. Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> to try an electric toothbrush is a very different feel, I would not use a manually toothbrush never again. The Sony care is very good and versatile</li>
            <li> This is our 4th Sonicare in the last 10 years.  This model is definitely the best one yet.  The carrying case and bathroom charger are the best design to date!</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare toothbrush for years now and when my trusty old Sonicare finally broke, I purchased this new one. While some reviewers have stated that they don&#x27;t like the charging glass, I actually like it. I think it adds an elegant and stylish alternative to the old charging station. This brush does a great job and leaves my mouth feeling truly clean.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I&#x27;ve found with this new design is that the handle seems to be too slick. I&#x27;ve had it slip out of my hands while brushing my teeth on two separate occasions so far.&lt;br /&gt;If they could fix that, this toothbrush would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love using a Sonicare toothbrush and I cannot see myself going back to using a regular manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a little pricy, I still love it for its effective cleansing effect. The white design is also very nice. My husband and I share this one, and we only need to charge it every 1.5 wks or so, which is very convenient. After using it for a while, I also bought another one for my dad.</li>
            <li> This is a big improvement over the pervious models. No mold that grows like before.  Only issue is they last just enough to be outside the warranty and need to be replaced every 2.5 years.</li>
            <li> I wanted to tell you that my poor old Sonicare electric toothbrush has lasted at least THIRTY-FIVE years...it was sold to me by my dentist when they first came onto the market!  I have used it daily for all these years (I&#x27;m 83 years old!) and it started to become very noisy lately.  I just found the problem, and thought I&#x27;d share it...the outer body has cracked from the small rectangular hole in the threads at the top of the main body, so of course the vibration noise has increased.  Now I will have to replace it, but I think you might be pleased to know it has lasted so long!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a dying Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrush, the kind with a round head. Possibly the Advanced Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get my teeth very clean, and I like the charging tumbler and travel case. The tumbler glass is very thick, it&#x27;s very easy to charge, and the interval alerts are helpful. But I ended up giving it to my sister and reordering one like my old one.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a small mouth, you may find brushes with a smaller head than this easier.&lt;br /&gt;I have a small narrow mouth and found it hard to reach upper tongue side without clacking the brush stem into my front teeth. I&#x27;ve chipped my front teeth more than once (not on plastic), and worried the vibrating clack would chip them.&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a sloppy brusher before I got my Braun (small mouth, overactive salivary glands -- aren&#x27;t you glad to know this?), and using the Sonicare was a return to my sloppy days. I also found it hard to keep the spray inside my mouth -- this was never a problem with the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;The sloppiness may have been why it always seemed like I&#x27;d run out of toothpaste froth with this one  before I was done. I tried squeezing toothpaste into the brush (not just onto) but it didn&#x27;t help. Never a problem with the Braun/Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;This has a few modes that are varying lengths of time. I tried two of them, the regular one and whitening. It shuts off at the end of the mode. I was used to how the Braun continues after the 2-min alert, then I&#x27;d brush my tongue then shut it off. I ended up using the whitening setting on this to get another 30 secs of power for tongue work, though I&#x27;d shut it off after 5 secs.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad my sister had mentioned she was going to replace her dying Sonicare. Now she has a new one (pink!) that she knows she loves, and I have one like my old BraunOral-B on its way.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the packaging on this. Almost entirely recyclable, not overly packaged, and IIRC, didn&#x27;t require scissors or Band-aids.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent cleaning, but not the brush for me.</li>
            <li> Decently put together. When brushing teeth the motor torques up and you lose vibration. Drives me nuts as I barely put the brush to my teeth and it sputters and loses the ability to clean. Extremely frustrating to have to deal with every single morning.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this toothbrush  : )&lt;br /&gt;Have used many different electric brushes and this by far wins hands down.  It&#x27;s like a trip to the hygienist every day! Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Only drawback is battery lasts less than 2 years.</li>
            <li> This IS crazy expensive, but I&#x27;m a convert. My dental hygienist has more than gently suggested over the years that I get a Sonicare to help fight plague and improve my gum health. With less than two weeks of use, I see the plaque buildup is gone. And, my gums are not bleeding.</li>
            <li> Seriously I don&#x27;t brush my teeth that often but when I do I use this thing. But really this brush is great. I don&#x27;t think my teeth have ever been so clean. I like the many settings it offers along with the 30 second intervals. The travel charge case is also great. I wish they would have included more heads with this but then how would they be able to overcharge you for the replacements, duh. If you are tired of going through the manual process of cleaning your teeth this brush is for you. Squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> Healthy teeth and gums because of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Make no mistake, this is the best toothbrush available and a work of art.  It reminds me of Eve in the Wall-E movie with its clean white finish and glowing graphics.  I was in heaven until 6 months after I bought it, it started to make an odd noise.  The noise got worse and the brushing action diminished until it virtually stopped.  The toothbrush was effectively cactus, and a very expensive cactus at that.  I approached Amazon who initially refused to allow me to return it as the 30 day return period had elapsed.  When i pointed out that they had an obligation to take back faulty products that they have sold within the first 12 months, they relented and sent me a new toothbrush.  Great result in the end, even though I did have to plead my case to get it.  If this quality issue hadn&#x27;t have happened I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  My teeth feel much cleaner and it seems to keep coffee and tea stains away better than my regular toothbrush.  The toothbrush head is small which works well for me as I have a small jaw.  It would be good if the manufacturer offered multiple sizes of brush heads.  I love the charging cup.  It is much more convenient to charge this way than with a standard stand up base. (We have those for our children.)</li>
            <li> I like this product because help to mantein more clean and health my teeths and gums. I recomended it for every body.</li>
            <li> My Phillips Sonicare HX9332/05 just up a quit one day, about 8 months after my Amazon.com purchase date.  No problem. I contacted Phillips 800 number, a real person answered the phone and 5 minutes later (following some basic information), a new product is on it&#x27;s way including a prepaid lable to return the broken one.  Awesome! No run-around what-so-ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a sincere pleasure purchasing and using a product whose manufacture is dedicated to honoring their product warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars all the way!</li>
            <li> Unit did not even last 6 months.  First, the power on button became difficult to turn on.  Then, the mechanics for the brush head became weaker, then turned off and on at random (not very handy when it has toothpaste on the brush and it&#x27;s not in your mouth).  Very disappointed in this product.  Will not replace with the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/22/12:  We had purchased two of these at the same time.  My husband had never even opened the box as his old Sonic was still working just fine.  After my DiamondClean quit, I claimed the second, brand new unit.  It too quit working in less than 6 months!  It started switching to the lesser power without me even touching the power button.  Then, it quit altogether.  After years of various Sonic electric toothbrushes that lasted much longer (we kept upgrading for lighter models), he&#x27;s just ordered Oral Bs for both of us through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had been using the essence model for about 5 years before buying this one. I only switched bc I left the old one in a hotel and I wanted something newer. The function is really the same and if your on a budget the essence will work for you ( and its $30). I do like the new one, the case is just flashy but the design is nice. Smaller. lighter, and the brush head is a little smaller. I also like the fact that the blush head comes up easily and there is no pocket to build up all that gunk. My old toothbrush would build up mold and awful stuff under there.  I don&#x27;t really mess with the different modes bc they are worthless in my opinion. The sensitive might be useful bc it pulses a little more gently. The brush bristles seems tougher too. I&#x27;m not positive i like that yet but will see over time.  I do like the 30sec timer for each quadrant. Overall, its expensive and im sure you can make out with an older model, but i felt like splurging.</li>
            <li> Love the Philips Sonicare HX9332/5 DiamondClean,  so far it&#x27;s doing the job at hand.  Not sure about the whitening of teeth yet but just got it and upped for the black limited edition model for travel, just felt that the over handling of the case would discolor faster... (get to dirty).  The charge is on point after the first full day of charging (required)  2 wk&#x27;s 1/2 almost 3, but in all fairness, I didn&#x27;t wait till the 3wks was up before putting the brush back on the charger. You get use to the rapid vibrations on your gums but there is a setting to ease you thru it if needed.  Hope for the amount of money spent, this will be a good lasting investment.  Happy Cleaning.</li>
            <li> best toothbrush i have ever used. the travel case with charger is amazing and its the only charger i ever use. the brush itself is nice and sleek and easy to hold. the battery life is acceptable. a normal charge lasts about a week. i have to admit that i have not used anything but the standard brush setting. it does everything i need.</li>
            <li> My husband asked for this particular Sonicare since he travels most of the time.  It&#x27;s great for traveling and home...as typical, Sonicare is the best mouth hygiene device,  Try it...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really liked this toothbrush for the first 6 months or so. It very effective in cleaning and does excellent job of preventing (even reversing!) gums from receding. The one button design to switch between different brushing techniques would not be my first choice, but I dealt with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about a year now, and its performance has definitely declined.  The vibrations are lot softer now - clean mode is like sensitive mode and with the sensitive mode almost nothing happens.  Plus, it&#x27;s making a constant noise, and I have to charge it every few days instead of every other week initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have put this review for just one isolated incident, but unfortunately my husband&#x27;s toothbrush deteriorated in the same way after about the same time.  This makes me believe that the toothbrush is designed to last a little more than a year (warranty time), which is highly unreasonable for such a high cost.  I still like to use a Sonicare toothbrush for brushing, but I will stick to the cheaper versions to buy them every year or so.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Whitens and cleans as advertised and my teeth feel so nice all the time!! I love the timed brushing, I love the travel case and easy charging. The only thing I&#x27;d say as a so-so, is that the part where the head and the body of the brush come together (which is separated any time you want to travel, for example) get stinky from water getting lodged in there. I just take the pieces apart after I brush my teeth to let them dry, and in the past I&#x27;ve used some rubbing alcohol/soap to try and get the parts clean. No biggie.</li>
            <li> The perfect sonic toothbrush, worth the money.  The charger glass is great too.</li>
            <li> I cant believe I spent $200 on a toothbrush! It does the job but I could buy a lot of conventional toothbrushes for that kind of money.</li>
            <li> Love this my teeth are whiter now they even when I was using the older Sonicare. Would buy again for gifts too.</li>
            <li> This cleans you teeth very well, but I did not notice it DOES NOT take the same brush heads as my old one.  I do love Sonicare toothbrushes, but now I have to buy brush heads for this and brush head for the one my husband has.  It is a pain.</li>
            <li> Tuesday, 7/16/2013 - I went to the dentist for a cleaning and was told that I have to floss more because my gums bleed severely when they&#x27;re doing the cleaning.  I&#x27;d like to tell them &amp;#34;That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re stabbing me with the picks, idiot!&amp;#34; but I just smile and nod.  They indicate that if I don&#x27;t change the overall health of my gums, they&#x27;ll want to do more frequent visits with some sort of gum care routine.  As you know, dentist visits are expensive and I have NO plans in going there any more frequently than the standard every six months.  To give you an idea of my oral care habits, I brush at least 3 times a day with a Pulsar battery-powered tooth brush, rinse with CloSYS daily, Listerine Zero on occasion and floss when I feel the need/have the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday, 7/21/2013 - I do a little research to see what I can do to improve my oral health.  Yes, I will try flossing more but I think, &amp;#34;Hmm, I wonder if a better toothbrush that massages my gums better would help...&amp;#34;  So I start looking at the top rated/most featured electric toothbrushes.  Far and away, this one had STELLAR ratings.  Wireless charging was a smart/cool idea that honestly attracted me the most.  So I added it to my cart and waited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday, 7/23/2013 - I receive the DiamondClean and unbox it.  It comes out of the box with a charge (helpful so you can get started right away) and immediately notice the quality of the pieces.  Everything is smooth and designed well, also feels sturdy in the hand (not plastic-y).  I pop on the full-sized head and use the &amp;#34;CLEAN&amp;#34; option of the 5 choices on the brush.  2 minutes later, my teeth feel as smooth as glass.  Mind you, I had a dentist appoint exactly a WEEK ago so there shouldn&#x27;t be any real build-up.  But this blasted away whatever was there and my teeth are slippery-smooth.  Definitely feels cleaner, that&#x27;s for sure.  I purchased 3 replacement DiamondClean heads as well so I&#x27;m covered for the year since you&#x27;re supposed to replace the heads approximately every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Designed beautifully&lt;br /&gt;-AMAZING clean!  This is my first SonicCare so maybe others can do a similar job but my readings say this model is up towards the top.&lt;br /&gt;-Wireless charging is handy&lt;br /&gt;-Travel case is sturdy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Short USB cable included and what seems like an oversized AC-to-USB converter.  Though it&#x27;s mostly used for travel so no real problem.&lt;br /&gt;-Brush head seems small but that&#x27;s probably just because I&#x27;m coming from a full size brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a premium product and that comes at a price.  I personally think the price is worth it and HIGHLY recommend you consider this.osed to replace the heads approximately every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Designed beautifully&lt;br /&gt;-AMAZING clean!

            <li> My daughter-in-law is a dentist and gave me the Sonicare diamond clean toothbrush for Christmas two years ago.  I really loved this toothbrush.  One complaint I have is that my toothbrush died after barely 2 years.  Once this toothbrush quits, there is nothing you can replace or fix.  Option is, although very expensive, buy a new one.  I liked the toothbrush enough to buy another one, but this time I sent in the 2 year warranty with an extra 6 months. My husband has the identical toothbrush; his is still working perfectly after two years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had my diamond sonicare for a week, and I already can see and feel a difference. I didn&#x27;t even realize how stained my teeth were - I drink a lot of coffee and red wine. I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I tried both the oral b and sonic care. This one is my second sonic care brush. keeps a long charge and I really like the features of the travel case and the charger cup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, it works just as advertised. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. If you&#x27;re in the market for an electric toothbrush, this is the Ferrari of the options.</li>
            <li> Got it because I travel so much and it&#x27;s easy to charge via USB but it&#x27;s a great quality tooth brush with many settings to choose from.  It works great and is not too rough on the gums.  I had one before that felt like it was ripping the teeth out of my head but this one goes much easier on teeth.  It&#x27;s a cool design the way it charges in a case and it charges in the glass that comes with it when you sit the glass on this little port that comes with it.  So if you want the best quality toothbrush then you&#x27;ll have to pay the price but believe me it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it online but rather at Shoppers Drugmart, either way my comments are valid&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- many cleaning options&lt;br /&gt;- the battery lasts for a long time (I think I charge it once every 2 months or so) and I brush twice a day&lt;br /&gt;- The travel case is light and nice to have, (though a little bulky). Charging with the USb option is also handy sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;- It recharges to full battery pretty  quickly, I just leave it on for a day to be on the safe side&lt;br /&gt;- I can feel the difference on how it cleans my teeth compared to high-end manual brushes and low-end electronic brushes (I have not had the OralB experience)&lt;br /&gt;- It is pricey, but in the long run you only need to replace the brush head (and it comes with two). It&#x27;s an investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- There is no way to tell how the battery life is doing. When it&#x27;s low on battery you only know because it just stops!!! and obviously it&#x27;s not ideal to go charge it for a little while when you&#x27;re in a rush just to have some charge to be able to use it!!&lt;br /&gt;- There are many hi-tech ways to recharge it, including this one way of putting it in this glass cup they provide, but it is a bit confusing to master. I just put it in the travel charger and plug it in. It&#x27;s fine. But it would be nice to have better directions on the alternative ways I&#x27;ve paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied and would highly recommend it (I bought it right after I had to get a few cavities filled in, and I realised how important a good toothbrush is). I can&#x27;t go back to manual brushes or low end electronic ones. You can really feel the difference as you race your tongue across your teeth. But..and this is a small but..It would be nice if it warned you when the battery is low.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge much longer than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems well made - I&#x27;m glad I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m brushing more... so it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased the black color of this toothbrush based on the recommendation from my dentist.  I am glad I did!  Great feel to the toothbrush and great results!  My dentist is happy with the results too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not crazy about the glass for the charging system.  I haven&#x27;t had to travel with it yet.  The brush is supposed to hold a charge for a few weeks...so shouldn&#x27;t need to take it with me anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to purchase this fr my dentist for a lower price than on this site.  Check with yours.</li>
            <li> All of the people in our dentists group use the Sonicare.  This diamond clean model is great. It replaces an 8 year old sonicare, and it definitely is better than the old one by quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the toothbrush performance, it is as advertised.  The charging stand has been a disappointment and stopped working shortly after I received the product.  Fortunately the travel case also functions as a charger, and I use it at home.  I did receive a charging stand replacement under the warranty, it also did not work.  I gave up on trying to get one that works.  All said, next time I need a new toothbrush, I will probably buy one of the older models.</li>
            <li> I was used to using the Oral B electric toothbrush so I was really overwhelmed, at first, when using the Sonicare.  The vibration in my mouth was almost too intense and you can&#x27;t brush with you mouth partially open or you will spray toothpaste everywhere.  Once I was used to the intensity of the toothbrush, I was really impressed with the results.  It&#x27;s funny because it cleans so well that you can feel all the parts of your teeth that will get even the slightest bit of residue on them - I was never able to do that before.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t last! Went through 3 broken toothbrushes over a period of 3 years. The product is great when it works but just about a year into it, the button starts getting stuck and the vibrating silver rod gets jammed. Eventually, it becomes unusable and warranty only lasts for 2 years from purchase date. Philips obviously knows about the issue as I went into the service centre and the service rep knew right away what the problem was and didn&#x27;t even bother to check and gave me a replacement. Unfortunately, after a year into it the replacement broke as well with the same problem. For such an expensive toothbrush, I expected it to last longer!!</li>
            <li> This is not nearly as good as sonic cares last few tooth brushes.  This one stutters and doesn&#x27;t work that well. It looks good in my bathroom though, which is why it got a second star.</li>
            <li> Having never owned an electric toothbrush ever, I made the leap and went all out buying the best of the best. And holy crap what an amazing difference. This thing makes my mouth feel like I just got out of the dentist office every time I use it, looks amazingly cool and considering it cost about as much as 2 trips to the dentist and it should last a few years it&#x27;s totally worth every penny. I will probably eventually get my wife one as well.</li>
            <li> Great product and it works. The price is high but worth it. Would recommend. Like the different settings and durability.</li>
            <li> we have no regrets with this product. easy to use and clean. easy to get the brushes from local stores.</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth very well. At first the vibration seemed too much but after the first few days it&#x27;s fine. Very pleased and it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on the counter.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush when it is in working order.  Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  However, after two months of use, the base of the toothbrush stopped working as expected.  I&#x27;ve had to work with the manufacturer to get it fixed, and its been about a month and I still don&#x27;t have the replacement.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush with the compact head does a super job on my implants.</li>
            <li> This replaces my former Sonicare. I would give this new modern &amp;#34;space age&amp;#34; looking one 5 stars if it had ANY place to store more than one toothbrush besides the flat travel case. They are marketing these as if the average household can afford one unit per person versus one unit per bathroom.  Whoever designed it must have one bathroom per family member - or live alone. Also, replacement brushes are more expensive than my previous Sonicare and do NOT have colored bands, so you have no easy way to distinguish one brush from the other - especially when a couple is traveling.  The unit itself brushes your teeth very well.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush but it just died over the weekend - two and a half years after purchase so it is is now out of warranty. Too expensive to die so quickly after the warranty expires.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly on the design and additional features that come with it compared to other Philips and Oral-B options.  The cup, carrying case/charger and sleekness drew me in.  I think the carrying case is the most useful for me.  Instead of putting it in a plastic bag you can throw it in the case and charge it on your computer, through the case if needed, now that&#x27;s a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of downsides, the charger for the carrying case is mini-USB, pretty dated, should be micro so it matches almost all phones now sold.  This cleans your teeth really well but I notice that my gums are a little more weak now and was advised by my dentist to use a manual brush a few times a week to strengthen them.  Your results will vary but this was a surprise to me at my last dental visit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this handle on June 18th 2014, and it broke after exactly 13 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem seems to be the rubber around the on/off button started leaking causing the brush will turn on sporadically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips customer service is very nice and offered a replacement immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Sonicare in 3 years; the last one broke after 23 months and I was also offered a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to keep your $150+ handle for more than a couple years, consider getting an extended warranty</li>
            <li> The clean feeling I get with this toothbrush is like nothing I&#x27;ve ever experienced with a toothbrush. It cleans so well, and I feel cleaner than a standard brush and the cheaper electric brushes I&#x27;ve tried. The battery life is great, and the multiple options for charging are great! I love the USB charging case for times on the road.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush.  The previous two I had eventually had battery failure after years of service.  I received one as a gift for Christmas and about a year later it got very loud and something rattles inside.  I called customer service and they said because I couldn&#x27;t provide a proof of purchase they couldn&#x27;t do anything about it.  They wouldn&#x27;t even take it back for inspection.  It is junk.  Their customer service is also very rude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is suppose to be their top-of-the-line premium product and they won&#x27;t stand behind it.  I will NEVER buy another Philips product EVER.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is too harsh for my mouth! The only gentle setting is the &amp;#34;sanitize&amp;#34; setting. My old one was much more gentle.  I wish I still had it!</li>
            <li> Brush stop working after 35 days... it turned on itself during night when we sleeping for 3 nights in row. then it decide not working... 35 days... just out 30 days return policy. I am really speechless</li>
            <li> Awesome! It&#x27;s like a clean at the dentist every day!!!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality of installed recharging battery. It&#x27;s not charging after 3 months of usage. The same situation with battery on my Philips goLITE BLU Light Therapy Device. I am disappointed with Philips.</li>
            <li> I got this for my parents but the battery couldn&#x27;t get charged after 5 months. I&#x27;m trying to get a replacement (kinda difficult because they are not in the US). The one I got for my wife and myself is still good. Overall experience was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a toothbrush that made my mouth fell so clean.  Little pricy, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I got this because I had a plaque problem behind my front lower teeth.  I brush twice a day, but always had build up there.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, and my dentist cleanings have been much easier.  If I forget to bring my Sonicare and have to resort to a regular toothbrush, my mouth doesn&#x27;t even feel clean, not compared to the Sonicare clean I am now used to.  I really like that it comes with a traveling case, very useful, and you can charge the toothbrush through that traveling case.  Very convenient.</li>
            <li> This is great product I purchased for my wife this past Christmas , she uses it every day and is the best electric tooth brush she has ever own , and she has used many different models for over 20 years . A high quality product and highly recommended .</li>
            <li> Have used the older, larger versions of the Sonicare for years. Splurged on the top of the line and it is really worth it. Much lighter, easier to hold and seems to do a much better job cleaning my teeth. A pleasure to use!!</li>
            <li> The main draw of this toothbrush for me was aesthetic more than function - and it definitely is a very good-looking toothbrush - the only drawback I&#x27;ve noticed is that lately, the battery life seems to be getting a bit worse... (The rechargeable travel case is also a feature I really like!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Oral-B electric toothbrushes but nothing comes close to this, I&#x27;ve been using DiamondClean for more than a year now, it leaves my teeth super clean in less brushing time, stays charged for a very long time, beautiful design &amp; very well made plus few extra great features such as the carrying case and the USB charger.. Simply Perfect.</li>
            <li> excellent product, quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I never thought I would ever spend this much money for a toothbrush but I am so glad I did! This product really works. I can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth are after using it. Better yet, they stay feeling clean for hours after using. The diamond brush head is small and so gets to the back teeth and backs of teeth easily. My gums look healthier too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find that it took long to adjust to the vibration at all but there is a sensitive setting to help you get used to it. (My husband complained that it rattled his teeth at first, I didn&#x27;t have that sensation, only a slight tickling of the gums for the first couple of days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included travel case with built in charger works well and even lets you plug it into a USB port on a laptop to charge if you choose. (It can also plug into a standard 110 outlet). It will hold two brush heads for travel, but you could include heads for the whole family in ziploc bags if needed.</li>
            <li> Best ever.  Feels like I have had my teeth cleaned every time I use it.  Expensive, but well worth the money.  Dental hygienist said to change heads every 2-3 months.  I will never be without a Sonicare toothbrush.  I purchased a cheap imitation once and it was not even close to the quality or value.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for one and a half years and I loved it. It cleans my teeth better than any other manual/electric toothbrush I have ever used. My dentist was actually impressed at how good I maintained my teeth when I was seeing a dentist for a wisdom teeth. Also, this toothbrush has an extremely elegant look. You can charge it in the cup, in the traveling container or just the toothbrush alone. I also love the design of the travelling container/case. It allows me to take it on the aircraft with my trips :) awesome. Can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush on the market, it my opinion.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and ease of usage. However, the brush heads are expensive! Bit of gimmicks in glass charging unit etc. can do without and reduce the price!</li>
            <li> It is reliable and cleans my teeth way better than with a regular tooth brush.  This product is worth every penny.  The only downside is that  the replacement brushes cost $10 each!</li>
            <li> I recommend this toothbrush.  I can tell a difference when I brush my teeth with the Sonicare versus a regular toothbrush. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Cleans my teeth thoroughly and adds a lovely shine to my smile.  I would recommend this toothbrush. I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Naw I&#x27;m just kidding but it is a pretty penny and it feels incredible on my teeth,get it love it and smile because of it</li>
            <li> Amazingly worth the money! I definitely would recommend this toothbrush to others spare no expense on your teeth. I Love the different setting on it and it has more power than the other sonics that I have had. Again LOVE LOVE IT!!! Great product. Love the styling of it (black) . Traveling case is a plus.</li>
            <li> I have used the ORAL-B units for at least 15 years and was pretty satisfied with them (each lasted about 5 years), though I did find that sometimes there was still some food at my gum line when finished.  I have very tight teeth, to the point that I have had dental floss break and get lodged between the teeth (very uncomfortable and one time I needed my desist to remove it).  My current Oral-B is getting to the point that the battery is giving up so it was time for a new one so I did an extensive search and comparison and decided on the Sonicare DiamondClean for this purchase.  The price kind of made me shutter, but the reviews made me look past that and go for what the brush can do for my teeth.  With a 90-day return policy I feel that they trust their product, and if it isn&#x27;t what I hope for I am not stuck with an expensive unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was blessed with very straight, white teeth, but with the whiteness came soft enamel and despite taking great care of my teeth i have had many cavities and now crowns.....  I brush, I floss, I get cleanings to keep my teeth in as good a shape as possible.  I am concerned about my gums as I get older and from what I read the Sonicare is superior for preventing gum disease.  So I will give it a whirl and update my review within 90 days.  I am hoping for my teeth&#x27;s sake it will be a 5-star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using this toothbrush for almost a month and I am astonished at the difference in my teeth!  The first week or so my gums were a bit sensitive, but that went away rather quickly.  I had a bit of tarter on my lower teeth (I am due for a cleaning) and it is nearly gone!  I have been using the whitening setting, which may be the key.  My teeth also feel cleaner than they ever have, and I would not have believed that possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From someone who was a bit skeptical making the change to the Sonicare I can say that I highly recommend it as the better product on the market.  Surely worth the investmentwhen you consider how much dental work costs!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself works great. I find the recharging system a little cumbersome.  The best way for me was to use the case to recharge as it took up less space on the sink counter and was less likely to be knocked over .  These brushes are quite expensive and dropping one would be a catastrophe; however they do an outstanding job on your teeth.</li>
            <li> I looked at several toothbrush models, finally deciding on the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean in part because of the travel case.  Have had it about 2 weeks.  Works great.  The travel case is definitely a good part of the decision because it will allow for very effective recharging while on the road with the same amount of storage.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. I really like the plastic it&#x27;s made of, it has a high quality feel. I&#x27;m not using the provided glass to charge it, but the regular stand which is not shown in the picture. Overall a nice and complete package.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for an earlier model.  Works fine. no complaints.  Could have gotten a better price by going to Bed Bath and Beyond that offered a good price, a mail in refund and 20% off on a store coupon.  I bought a Keurig  coffee maker from Bed Bath and Beyond a few weeks later and with special price and store coupon it was a better price than Amazon</li>
            <li> Outstanding.  Worth every penny.  The variety of settings allow my wife and I to choose the settings that work for best for each of us.</li>
            <li> I loved it for 1 1/2 year but it just broke yesterday. While brushing my teeth, the unit simply stopped functioning and does not show charging lights when in the charger. Kinda sucks!! Until then, I would have given it a 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, well-designed, relatively quiet electric toothbrush. The handle is smooth but matte (not slippery), and I love love love the charging station (using either the glass cup or a more traditional stand-up attachment that comes with it). I also love the beautiful carrying case that is included; it doubles as a USB charger and makes me feel fancy every time I travel. That said, if you&#x27;re just looking for function, my sense is that the toothbrushes that are a step or two down are equally effective. I&#x27;m just a sucker for design, and for that, no other toothbrush on the market can compare.</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush. it cleans extremely well and the design is appealing. my only complaint is it only lasts a week before needing a recharge. it doesn&#x27;t completely shut off after a week, but I get the warning beep and an orange light. I thought I read it would last three weeks without need for a recharge. but otherwise a lovely purchase.</li>
            <li> Expensive without justification.No better then the cheaper Philips model.The noise is  very annoying.Braun(oral b) would be a better  choice.In my opinion</li>
            <li> Its a great toothbrush! I love the portable charging case it comes with. The charging station/ glass is pointless</li>
            <li> My dentist and I love this. It has greatly improved my gum loss particularly in the hard to reach back teeth.</li>
            <li> Best customer service and great product.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is so poor in terms of durability. I had one and it was broken in less than one year. Due to warrantee, I got a free replacement and it was broken again in about one year.</li>
            <li> i have not owned an electric toothbrush before, but this one got great reviews, and so far my teeth definitely feel cleaner than before.</li>
            <li> A well designed, very powerful toothbrush. So powerful that if the plastic back side of the brush touches a tooth while brushing, it sends chills down my spine. This sort of &amp;#34;tickling&amp;#34; sensation takes some getting used to. Maybe that&#x27;s the same with all electric toothbrushes, but this one feels like it rattles your brain. That said, it sure does clean your teeth really well and in a very short amount of time!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush holds charge for days.  Two ways to charge with the stand and the handy USB travel case.  Perfect power brush for travel.  My only issue is that the brush head sanitary covers do not fit in the travel case.</li>
            <li> This is my second diamond clean. Love it.</li>
            <li> Hard to bring myself to say that a toothbrush warrants this kind of praise but wow!  That is an awesome toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I bought tis on Oct 13 and it has just quit working. I need Phillips to fix it or replace it. I need amazons help to do this.</li>
            <li> Its good, but doesn&#x27;t have proper instructions for using its various functions... so you might want to research it before buying it...&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I definitely prefer it to the rotary head of other brands...</li>
            <li> As this is my first electric toothbrush, I can&#x27;t really compare.  That said, it works very well and my teeth definitely feel very clean after using it.  The little niggles - the battery seems to last about 10-12 days rather than the manufacturer&#x27;s indicated 3 weeks and USB connector on the toothbrush case is a mini-USB rather than a micro one, so if travelling for an extended period, it&#x27;s yet another cable to carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problems with the seller either - fast and efficient service</li>
            <li> i have been using this for some time now and i think it will require a trip to the dental hygenist every 3 years instead of each year . it is that good.</li>
            <li> Recommend to me and I love it!</li>
            <li> Does a great job on keeping teeth clean and massaging gums! Has several settings for those who like more pressure, and charges wirelessly in a cup. Sometimes it develops an annoying whine while operating, but I think it&#x27;s connected to using a toothbrush head too long.  Battery life needs help, loses juice and takes a long time to recharge. Does come with slimmer travel charger.</li>
            <li> I have never been so amazed by a toothbrush. I love my Sonicare! It is definitely worth every dollar. If you care for your smile. Use sonicare.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THE ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH AS A GIFT. THE PERSON ASKED FOR THE DIAMOND MODEL. I CHECKED PRICES ALL OVER AND EVEN SOME HAD ON SALE BUT NON HAD AS GOOD AS A PRICE AS AMAZON FOR THE SAME ONE. I RECEIVED QUICKLY AND IN GOOD CONDITION. THIS TOOTHBRUSH WAS RECOMMONED BY DENTISTS. I INTEND TO PURCHASE ANOTHER SONICARE FOR MYSELF. THE RECEIVER OF THE GIFT IS VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT. IT WORKS GREAT AND FEELS LIKE YOU JUST CAME FROM DENTIST GETTING A CLEANING.</li>
            <li> I have been using Phillips products for years and I can say I have never had a problem with there products they work well and the quality is excellent! There toothbrushes all work flawlessly and are the best I have used and I have tried the competitors and I still prefer Phillips!</li>
            <li> I have owned three of these sonic are brushes. The first one I had was a Diamond type and I loved it. My dentist loved it too. More importantly my teeth loved it. Gentle on the teeth and gums, but my teeth were never cleaner. I wish I had had one of these when younger as I might have avoided a lot of dental work through the years. This first one lasted my two and a bit years. At some point it just started to not turn on for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with a cheaper version, the Flexcare. I figured the technology would be the same, just a different handle.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. The Flexcare is more aggressive than the Diamond and within months my gums were very unhappy. Unhappy to the point of receding. I kept using it, not quite able to believe the toothbrush was at fault. The Flexcare does have different settings but they aren&#x27;t very different. And they all are too harsh for me. My son, who is 23, however loves his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at the store a few days ago and say a display that included both brushes.&lt;br /&gt;As I handled them I realized that there is a very distinct difference in how aggressive they vibrate. I much prefer the gentler Diamond brush and bought another one.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they would make it clear that the different brushes feel different and act differently. My hope now is that my gums will get happier now that I have my new Diamond brush.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Toothbrush stopped working after 2 years. For the price I expected a lot more. I&#x27;ve had cheaper toothbrushes last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Takes some getting used to, but does a great job. I can see why the dentists love them.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare after not using one for a couple of years.  The bristles on this model are a bit stiffer and seem to be made of a different material than the other ones, and seem to polish teeth like a dentist.  After my first use, I did indeed feel like I just got my teeth cleaned.  Could not stop running my tongue all over my ultra smooth teeth that felt better than some professional cleanings I had in my lifetime.  I read other reviews about their teeth becoming more white after a few weeks of use and was skeptical.  What I noticed is my teeth are now brighter and although not sparkling white, there is quite a noticeable difference.  The charger is a clear glass with a plug.  Looks nice on my bathroom sink.  I&#x27;m really impressed with the whole thing and really like brushing my teeth again since the tooth brush does all of the work and the brush tells you when to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> Those are words I never thought I&#x27;d say. Yet there they are. And it was definitely amazing. And the carrying case is the best part. I travel frequently to different countries and, without getting into boring electrical/voltage/whatever discussions as to why, the carrying case USB charger is unbelievably convenient (not to mention cool). The cup charger thing is a bit gimmicky (Why is that better than just setting it in the charger?) but whatever. The toothbrush itself is amazing and very modern and classy looking--which, while not the primary thing I&#x27;m looking for in a toothbrush, is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> easy to use and really clean</li>
            <li> Since my dentist recommends Phillips I chose this model after my first Sonicare had to be replaced.  I checked the reviews on this model and made my purchase using my Amazon Prime with 2-day shipping.  This model has multiple charging options which I first thought was kind of unnecessary, however, I decided I like it; especially the option to charge using a computer - so easy when travelling.  I use the glass drinking glass option at home; it is just so easy and the glass is there always for rinsing so it is a win win.  I recommend this efficient tooth brush to anyone who wants quality with multiple ways to recharge, when necessary.  Thank you Amazon and Phillips for helping to keep my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> This product replaces my high-end Braun.  There is simply NO comparison.  I will not be going back to the Braun.</li>
            <li> Believe the hype! I have used other name brand electric toothbrushes over the years but the diamondclean sonicare electric toothbrush is the best.  My teeth have never felt cleaner.  It is now approaching one year and still, my teeth have never felt cleaner.  This product cleans, polishes, and whitens your teeth with additional cycles for gum care and sensitive teeth. It is a bit pricey.  The replacement brush heads are pricey too.  Isn&#x27;t your smile worth it!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT! Mine failed after a time, it can not be repaired. All that was offered was 15% off new unit. Why make something that can not be repaired.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use &amp; recharge. My DDS said this was the one he used. Light weight and small enough for small hands.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my wife as present, she is loving it. The design is elegant and thoughtful. I like the inductive charging base and the beautiful white casing. The minimalism design and impeccable build quality reminds you of Apple products. I didn&#x27;t use it but she claims it&#x27;s better than her Oralcare.</li>
            <li> Replacement for my Oral-B which I had for several years. I read the reviews and decided to purchase the Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 Diamond Clean.  The different modes are easy to use and the product is user friendly. I like the smooth handle. My older brush had a plastic grip on the back of the handle which made it hard to clean. Overall, worth the money.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush literally does all the work for you.  Great product will tell all my friends how white and clean it gets your teeth.</li>
            <li> Quality product.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist thinks it has improve my cleaning routine based on my last appointment.&lt;br /&gt;Having the timer making conscious about spending enough time cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Looks nice on shelf. My one complaint is that the brush heads will quickly vibrate off the body if I&#x27;m not brushing while it&#x27;s on. Still would purchase.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was a gift for my wife.  She has been extremely happy and feels that her teeth and gums have never been so clean.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric tooth brush and it works great. I get that clean from the dentist feel every time. I was advised not to buy a cheap one and I am glad I didn&#x27;t - high quality and the charging in the cup or USB case work great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift &amp; it was very well received.When I purchased this item it was not available in most local oulets.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one of the older Sonicare products and loved it. When I purchased this, it came with a travel case, charger, a cup and the brush; basically everything you see in the picture. I tend to brush my teeth often and was able to buy a refill brush set with 6 on Groupon for about $12. The replacement brush can be costly, so I decided to save money and buy a cheaper replacement brush that fits the DiamondClean. I only use the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; setting, so if you just want to clean your teeth, you can buy a cheaper Sonicare brush that doesn&#x27;t have the extra settings. It would probably be cheaper. I should have done that, but I love the way the DiamondClean Toothbrush looks.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the toothbrush heads don&#x27;t have a way of identifying which one belongs to who. Not a problem if you are the only one using toothbrush. Love everything else about it!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Everything I expected. Have used cheaper brands and they don&#x27;t seem to hold up.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The Diamond Clean was recommended by my hygienist and I&#x27;m so glad I followed through on her recommendation.  My teeth and gums are cleaner and healthier; both the dentist and I noticed.  I have since bought one for each of our four daughters and they are equally happy.</li>
            <li> We needed to replace a Sonicare which we had used for about twelve years as it was worn out.  There are now many different models to choose from and we went with the top of the line model.  I am glad we did.  It is elegantly designed and very practical.  Two different bases are provided neither of which has to be permanently plugged in.  You just stand the bases on the charger when the unit needs to re-charge.  The carrying case is also a charger which can be plugged into a USB port on a computer or even into the car charger for your cell phone.  The design and finish are excellent and a real departure from other models and the main competitor..  As another reviewer stated, it could have been designed by Jony Ive.  The noise level is unobtrusive.  In fact it is quieter than the old model that we replaced.  We are very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush produced amazing results.  My teeth began looking whiter as soon as I started using this toothbrush.  This toothbrush gives me the feeling of just having my teeth cleaned at the dentist with every use.  It&#x27;s a great looking toothbrush and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th purchase of sonicare toothbrushes.  I like the cleaning ability of sonicare over Braun; however the durability of the devices and the brushes are sorely lacking.  Each time one breaks after a year and a half, I swear I wont buy another, but others brands seem to have the same issue.  Electric toothbrushes just clean better, so I will most likely do the cheaper models as they all seem to have the same life span.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with plaque build-up.  It is great!  I use the smaller head toothbrush and is works great.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid this was a huge letdown, really not happy. I would never buy a philips toothbrush again. I tried contacting them but they did not help me at all. Just get a cheaper product, this one is made cheap and sold for way too much.</li>
            <li> I am using this 4 to 5 times a week and I still do manual brushing but every so often I realy think  I have to use it to reach hard spot in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it is a good investment and you should have one. It minimize professional cleaning by your dentist to once every two years instead of once every 6 month.</li>
            <li> I spoke with Chris at Amazon today and he was extremely helpful and tried very hard to get Sonicare to help me out.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased 4 Diamond Clean PHILLIPS SONICARE Electric Toothbrushes (2 in August, 2 in September 2012).  ONE out of FOUR purchased never held a charge well and now will not charge at all.  We contacted Phillips and while this is an almost $200 toothbrush, an investment in my book, they would do nothing to help me replace the rechargeable piece.  They offered me a free pack of new heads- REALLY!</li>
            <li> Very easy review...Best brush on the market.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for hears.  My old unit, one of the original larger heavier ones, finally stopped holding a charge at all.  I looked carefully at all the Sonicare models, which I think are confusing as to which is best to pick, and in the end chose the DiamondClean due to the nicer looking charging cradle and the smaller size overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love everything about this model, except that I find it to be a little slick to hold well.  All the old ones have at least a bit of rubberized material to help the grip, but the DiamondClean is slick all over.  Other than that it is great.  I really like the charging cradle.  I use the small one rathe than the larger cup option provided as I like the toothbrush standing upright rather than tilted.  It is a nice feature that depending on the mode of cleaning you choose the vibrations are different.  Small thing but cute.  Cleaning is just as good as all my other Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the money.</li>
            <li> After 11 months, it randomly keeps turning on and vibrating.</li>
            <li> Excellent results. With regular 2 minute brushing, I was able to get rid of my gum disease and the need for periodontics surgery. I am extremely happy for saving few thousands of dollars and avoiding the painful surgery.</li>
            <li> It is everything promised in the ad...easy to use...just remember that all the different brushing will light up when charged for you to pick...when off, you won&#x27;t see the options</li>
            <li> I swear this feels like you&#x27;ve been to the dentist every day.  I&#x27;ve used Sonicare in the past, but this is the best one yet. Just wish they had a UV head cleaner for this unit.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist suggested I change over from the basic Sonicare to the  Diamond. Can&#x27;t say enough good things: easy to use, easy to clean, and the cup holder is actually attractive on a sink.  Amazon&#x27;s price was the most competitive price I could find, much less then at retail stores.</li>
            <li> This top of line toothbrush died in two years. I still loved it till it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to buy a new one as a replacement as it gave me the best feel.</li>
            <li> I hate toothbrushes, but this one is great. First, the charging cup is great and that&#x27;s my go to way of charging it. It&#x27;s never given any problems. The charging case is also pretty cool and I like the USB charging ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush itself is great as well. I&#x27;m not sure how all the different settings brush differently, but the brush looks great and does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a reliable brush that can be charged easily from computer or wall while looking nice, this is your way to go.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Takes getting used to but works if you work it!&lt;br /&gt;I especially love the travelling case and charging glass - quite amazing. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> And my check ups are much better. My 1st one quit working and I called it in, they sent me the new updated version and it has more power and the battery last for weeks and weeks. Very good purchase. Spend the money, your teeth and gums will thank you</li>
            <li> As one of a fairly significant number of folks who are susceptible to gagging when brushing their teeth, I had pretty high hopes that this toothbrush might be an ideal solution for me. First, it offers a very compact brushing head which truly is the perfect size for someone like me with a small mouth and a susceptibility to gagging when brushing my teeth. I was also attracted to the fact that it is more effective in removing plague, which should mean that it has to be in my mouth for a shorter period of time. When I actually received the product, I was really delighted by what was promoted as a feature to &amp;#34;ease in&amp;#34; to the vibration by starting at a lower level and then slowly increasing over the course of 14 days. So first, the compact brush head is AWESOME! It is perfect - exactly the size for those of us with a sensitivity to gagging. I found it worked wonderfully on the outer side of my teeth. Unfortunately, when it came to brushing the back side of my teeth, I found that the intensity of the vibration provoked the gagging reflex in my mouth. I tried to use the so-called &amp;#34;ease-in&amp;#34; function multiple times, but it did not work as described in the instructions so I just gave up and reached for my old electric brush to do the back side of my teeth. I did notice that the awesome compact heads will fit other Philips toothbrushes so that may be a solution. But I would encourage the Philips product developers to find a way to accomplish the same effect with less &amp;#34;tickling&amp;#34; vibration. In the meantime, please, please, please keep making those awesome small compact heads!</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe it does look a little bit like an Apple design.  However, the ergonomics and practicality team must have not had much say.  -The glass charger is more clutter, doesn&#x27;t look as neat (IMO), fragile, and not any more functional.  Waste of money unless you really like the sitting in a glass look.&lt;br /&gt;-Ergonomics- hello?  Sleek and slippery with no rubber or tactile grip on a toothbrush?  Big step backward.&lt;br /&gt;-Functionality-I don&#x27;t notice any material improvement from my Healthy White model (that is before the shaft fell out).  Has a USB travel charger, but I pack light and leave the Sonicare at home, so no use for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.  Buy the Healthy White (although mine did break after about 18mos)</li>
            <li> I have had a regular Sonicare toothbrush for 10 years and I recently replaced it with the Diamond Clean. My teeth have never felt SK clean. They felt like I just left the dentist. I would recommend this toothbrush to everyone.</li>
            <li> Sonicare users know, this brush is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has had extreme dental work over the years and she&#x27;s fanatical about brushing and flossing.&lt;br /&gt;If you are too, this will fit right in to your routine. Simply the best</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is great, the feel of my teeth after using it is wonderful.  However the handle is so sleek and smooth it is hard to hold onto. it slips and falls when wet.  Gotta&#x27; figure out a way to get some texture onto it.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love my Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve had other electric toothbrushes, but none compare to this one!  I feel like my teeth are sparkling white every time I use it!  I would never go back to a regular toothbrush.  Nothing compares to this!  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> My dental  hygienist recommended Sonicare as the best electric toothbrush available. I am most happy with this version of the product. Very 21st century.</li>
            <li> I have used rechargeable toothbrushes for years,  When the last one died I went a few month using a manual, that will never happen again. The Philips Sonicare DiamondClean is by far the most superior brush I have ever used.  My teeth feel &amp;#34;Dentist Clean&amp;#34; everyday.  I may not used every setting but they are available if I so choose.  I highly recommend the Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li> Good, my teeth are definitely cleaner than what they used to be but battery life isn&#x27;t as good as I expected or advertised to be.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was recommended by an article in Departures magazine. It&#x27;s awesome but it sounds like a bee when it running. It&#x27;s a happy sound and makes me smile &amp; now my teeth sparkle</li>
            <li> Bought two of these.  The batteries on both of them went out exactly one month after the warranty went out. The batteries are considered non-replaceable because you have to solder the battery terminal ends somehow within the handle. (Wish I knew that when we bought them!)  Contacted Philips today via 24/7 chat.  Was told, &amp;#34;Please buy another toothbrush.&amp;#34; Worked well while the batteries were okay.  But I did not spend this much money to be completely out of a tooth brush in 25 months. (And I just got done buying a pack of heads two months ago... Uggg!)  The $7 cheap powered toothbrushes on the market have replaceable batteries and therefore are a much better buy.</li>
            <li> In spite of high price for a toothbrush, it is worth spending on this.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to feel the difference within few days.&lt;br /&gt;Non-electric toothbrush can never compete this</li>
            <li> I generally like this toothbrush. It has lots of features and a clever charging station design. My only complaint--and it&#x27;s minor--is that it&#x27;s not intuitive to switch between functions (cleaning, polishing, sensitive, etc.). If you have toothpaste on your brush, and you want to toggle to your preferred setting, the toothpaste will fly off as you find your preferred setting--and when the brush is in your mouth, you can&#x27;t easily see what setting you&#x27;re on. So you have to choose the setting well before you put the paste on your brush. Might not be a problem for some, but there should be a more intuitive way to choose your default setting instead of hitting a combination of buttons to set it.</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference after the first use, especially coming from a manual toothbrush. I use to use a sonicare years ago when I have braces, then transitioned to an Oral B electric toothbrush, and after that a manual. Decided to order this and just received it today. After the first use I&#x27;m not disappointed. Light weight, looks great, and multiple ways to charge. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Loved the brush until yesterday when it died cold in my hand....was charged, would not light up to recharge and is simply dead. What to do?&lt;br /&gt;Purchased Oct 30, 2012 twenty months ago. This is pretty pricey at monthly cost for equipment of $9.50 for the twenty months it functioned perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good but not really better than my old one</li>
            <li> it is good ,I don&#x27;t see a difference with the cheapest one .It take too long to shut it off .</li>
            <li> Having to switch through all the modes to turn it off is very annoying, and for the price it should come with one or two replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other electric toothbrushes before but this thing is like the Ferrari of electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth and gums feel much cleaner and healthier.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just get this out of the way right up front: this latest incarnation of the Philips Sonicare toothbrush is quite pricey. And, yes, you are probably paying a fair percentage of that price towards the unit&#x27;s stylistic design. But this latest model comes with a number of nice accessories that work with the brush to make you understand the higher price for the unit, and therefore, possibly make it a good choice if you are looking for a new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush itself is gorgeous. It stands apart from all Philip&#x27;s previous designs (and yes, I&#x27;ve used virtually every one of them over the years) due to its \\&quot;high-tech\\&quot; visual appearance. Gone, for example, are the yucky gaps on the front control panel that, over time, collect toothpaste, water buildup, and so on, and become impossible to clean and unpleasant to look at. This new model has more of a uni-body shell that contains a gap only around the power button itself. The texture of the white finish (you can also purchase the toothbrush in all black, by the way) feels somewhat like unglazed ceramic: it not only looks wonderful, but it feels great in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation is quite similar to all the previous Philips models, with available \\&quot;cleaning,\\&quot; \\&quot;gum health,\\&quot; \\&quot;whitening,\\&quot; etc. modes.  A nice touch is the default initial setting that, over the course of the first 14 operations, slowly ramps up the power to acclimate those who have never used this type of brush in developing a comfort with the high frequency vibration feeling (this ramp-up in vibration power can be disabled, as well; check the manual for the two-step process to do so). A stronger, sequenced vibration while brushing alerts you to switch to the next quarter of your mouth so that you will get equal coverage for all teeth during each brushing session. The battery is listed as a three week duration, assuming normal use. My previous Sonicare brushes generally lasted this same length, and this model has proved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device comes with a number of very snazzy accessories. First, a wide-mouthed, heavy glass cup (yes, it is actually made of glass, not plastic) sits on top of the charging base. You simply place your toothbrush into the glass for charging. When not charging, the glass cup can sit on the counter and continue to serve as a decorative toothbrush holder. (The charger, by the way, is universal voltage, so it can be used in Europe, as well as North America.) This is one of the most obvious fancy item on the accessories list, but it does not stop there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also an acrylic stand which can also be placed on top of the charger, in case you prefer not to use the glass cup. And the supplied case is much more exotic than we&#x27;ve seen before with other electric toothbrushes. On the end of the case is a USB port, and inside, a induction charging panel. Yes, you guessed it: during travel, you can place the toothbrush into the case, close the case, and then plug it into an USB port, and the toothbrush will charge while sitting in the case! Nice touch. And, a supplied USB adapter that plugs into the AC socket (the adapter is also universal voltage, so it works both in North America and Europe, and is much smaller and lighter than the main charger) can also be used to charge the toothbrush while it is in the case (and the USB adapter is supplied, along with a USB cable, in addition to a normal a/c charger. Finally, two different types of heads are provided to get you started (each head lasts approximately six months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this is a very gorgeous and somewhat unusual toothbrush, and it has won at least two separate design awards. Once you look it over in person, you&#x27;ll see why. I&#x27;ve used both the Braun and Philips types for years, but I have to say this Philips model is the best one I&#x27;ve used yet. Get it when there is a coupon or sale available, and that will help with the price.

            <li> The cleanest my teeth have ever been. The materials and construction of the toothbrush are of high quality. The unique ultra-sonic pulses are superior to the conventional toothbrush and the rotadent, another mechanical toothbrush I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush does cost a lot but it&#x27;s worth it. You can&#x27;t get this much quality for a lower price. Everything from the charging station, to the toothbrush, to the bristle head are sturdy, powerful, and well constructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It surprised me that the automatic timer is set for merely 2 minutes. I used to brush for 5 minutes with the rotadent. But let me tell you, 2 minutes is enough and your teeth will feel completely clean. It does an amazing job of removing plaque and stains. After a few weeks of use, both myself and my girlfriend noticed that our teeth were whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is I&#x27;m so happy that I purchased this toothbrush. It does the best job and feels great to use.</li>
            <li> Saw a difference in less than a week!!</li>
            <li> Have had this for about a month now and I love it!  The small head makes it easy to clean teeth in the back of your mouth.  The glass cup charger is a neat feature and the travel charging case is also wonderful.  All around it&#x27;s the best electronic toothbrush I&#x27;ve had so far.  I would highly recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This one is high end and luxurious. The design is smart.&lt;br /&gt;A little loud inside mouth though.  Need to be careful with the handle to avoid touching tooth.</li>
            <li> First of all I never write reviews until now. I really wanted to warn anyone that have to deal with Philips warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please understand the product is great unless it breaks. I love the product until after 8 months the handle will not charge anymore and hence the toothbrush will not turn on. I have to admit, it is somewhat upsetting that a toothbrush for roughly 200.00 bucks would last only 8 months but either way the handle was in warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I called the warranty personnel, she was really fast and gave me a reference number for my replacement handle and instruct me to call back within 2-3 business days to receive my tracking number. She also mentioned the delivery time would be 7-10 business days from today (the day I am talking to her).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I love the product until it breaks which makes perfect sense to anyone that loves their product. Therefore within 2 business days, I chatted with the customer service regarding my order and they mentioned that there is no tracking number or anything and decided to mention to me that the item is not in stock, also please check in 2 business days. Ok, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 business days later from the chat date, the next agent mentioned the item is in stock and no tracking number yet. They also mentioned that it will take 7-10 business days from when I first called. Finally, they mentioned to check back again in 2 business day. Ok, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the cycle continues until today. Today is the 10 business day and I decided to see what is going on. Of course! I receive the same answer as before but this time I wanted to talk to a supervisor. the supervisor gave me no tracking number which was suppose to be given to me 7-8 business days back and mentioned to follow back on Monday when the updated shipping detail will be available. I mentioned that I know it is not his responsibility but would like a shipping contact to see where the shipping is. Of course, no response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware of Philips warranty; it stinks! I wish I could say that you will get a truthful answer if you ever talk to them but I would be lying to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for the product when it works&lt;br /&gt;1 star for the longevity of the product (should be longer because you spend 200.00 -&amp;#62; also surprised the agent first time I called that this expensive item was deflective)&lt;br /&gt;negative max stars for warranty -&amp;#62; when you spend a decent amount on the item, you would assume there is an honest answer of when you would receive your replacement item under warrant. But expect longer than the promised 7 - 10 business days.</li>
            <li> ILIKE THIS PRODUCT VERY MUCH AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS MY DENTIST NOTICE RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li> Replacement/upgrade from 2006&#x27;ish Sonicare Elite&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be a vast improvement of the older Sonicare Elite that I have used for years, It is noisier than my old one but it seems to clean a whole lot better. This unit is considerably easier to clean than those like the Elite that have a screw on head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviews I find changing the brushing cycle or stopping in the middle of the brushing routine is a PITA. The cost for this specific unit is higher than I might have considered if I had not been using this brand and style of toothbrush for almost 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase it again? Yes.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say here. The product gets your teeth the cleanest you&#x27;ll ever feel and see but...... I had to replace the product twice, after a while it started making a lot of noise, a loud buzzing sound.  I purchased twice from amazon. Finally I called Phillips and explained the situation to them. They replace both of them for me within the year of my original purchases.  I would say Philips was very helpful, great customer service if you have your issue escalated to their team.  Takes some time to get through to them.  Not sure how to rate the product but as far as Phillips they were good to me.</li>
            <li> From the first day I started using the toothbrush I can feel the difference with my teeth and gums, can&#x27;t wait until my next dentist appointment to hear the results from using the Sonicare toothbrush in which they recommended.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my sister and she loves it. Received it on the day before her birthday.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended this toothbrush for our son.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  I like the choices which could be use while brushing.  Everyone in our household will be choosing Phillips electric toothbrush very shortly.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush money can buy.This is the only tooth brush i will ever use.I love this electric tooth brush and i would recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric toothbrushes you can buy. It has a lot of different modes that ensure a great clean. The glass charging case is super neat and it looks right at home in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Great device but costs too much! Like many others, I would much prefer to have the mode switch as a separate button from the on/off as it can make things a bit messy!</li>
            <li> Dentist asked what I started using haha.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son&#x27;s birthday recommended to him by his dentist and he said he loves it!  Works great and makes his teeth feel like a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li> I just bought this toothbrush and I do plan to return it tomorrow. The design for mode selection is extremely poor. You need to press it several times with the brush in your mouth to choose the mode you want. Whoever came up with it and/or approved it needs to be purged not just from Phillips but from the overall engineering/design community...</li>
            <li> I had to replace my regular sonicare brush (because I have gingivitis, which is sexy as all get out I know but my dentist made me buy it) because TSA pulled my brush out of my bag and forgot to put it back in, and I didn&#x27;t realize until I got home. I called and told them (Indianapolis airport, just fyi) and they were adamant that they had no such brush. So I was out $120 on a brush just from passing through security. I&#x27;m sure I could have wreaked havok with it when the plane was in the air but they were clever enough to foil my plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to find a new one on here that was comparable but couldn&#x27;t, at least not with the gum-care setting. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s here somewhere, there were just none in stock, which I found fascinating. I ordered this one late (shipping notification was at 11:30 PM) and it was on my porch at 9 am the next day with my regular 2 day prime shipping. I&#x27;ve been an Amazon Prime member since day one and that was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can just toss the brush into a glass and it charges without plugging in, and the design is so much more than any one person needs in a toothbrush. But it still cost $189 for a toothbrush. I&#x27;m a cheap sort of person normally so if I could have found my old one still, I would have reordered that. Such being said, I don&#x27;t feel ripped off. This is as sexy as toothbrushes for people with gingivitis get. :D</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m perfectly happy with this Brush, I&#x27;ve had it several months now, and purchased one for my wife a few weeks after being the family guinea pig.  It looks amazing, very clean modern design.  It comes with a sleek wireless charger (you plug in the cup to the wall and just lay your toothbrush up right to charge).  The new diamond care bristles on the brush seem to genuinely make a difference over previous models.  My teeth feel legitimately cleaner than they did before I switched to the newer model.  My only concern with my brush (and in full disclosure this particular model hasn&#x27;t given us any issues) is that most of my sonicare updates have been forced.  After a year or two they all seem to sputter out and refuse to take on a charge.  I would love to be able to update on my own terms rather than water damage or planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li> This is the most powerful toothbrush ever...can&#x27;t wait to get back to dentist to see what they think, but my teeth and gums are happy happy</li>
            <li> Better than I expected, am very pleased with the ease of use.</li>
            <li> It is exactly like the models in the US. But cheaper.  Love this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! My teeth are as white as never before! Hm... Maybe I should try Hollywood?.. )))</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! !!! I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years and  the charging technology is cool</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist can tell and so can I. It works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Sonicare for about 10 months.  Works reasonably well, but my dental hygienist tells me that my teeth aren&#x27;t any cleaner than when I was using a standard manual toothbrush.  The replacement heads are very expensive and don&#x27;t last that long.  If I had it to do over, I probably wouldn&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes. My wife and I share one and burned out one that was 5 years old. For brushing 2-3 times per day between the two of us I&#x27;d say it had a good life!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my existing Sonicare tooth brush, my old one after 5 years it wouldn&#x27;t hold charge. This model is awesome, the carrying case is a charger..! so you don&#x27;t have to take an additional charger with you. It is slick and thin, fits in your hand nicely. I&#x27;m yet to figure out the Whitening mode do I need a special or just regular tooth paste.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare toothbrush is fantastic.  It does it all and more.  It REALLY gets the whole mouth super clean and not with much effort.  I&#x27;ve wanted this for quite some time.  I&#x27;m SO glad I was finally able to get it.  It may be rather expensive, but honestly,  this toothbrush is well worth it!</li>
            <li> The brush head is too small.  Instructions for using glass are unclear; seems an unnecessary addition.  Miss the sonic cleaning feature of past models very much.  Regret that parts from older models are not compatible.  Would rather have been able to simply order a toothbrush equal to previous models.</li>
            <li> Great unit a lot better then the previous version, smaller, lighter and recharger has been reworked so it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> Was worried because of some negative reviews regarding switching brushing modes, but found it to be rather straight forward and easy. I have been using a Sonicare Essential electric brush for the past 10 years and while this one is more expensive, it is worth it. Much easier to keep clean, not as heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li> Just what the Dr. Ordered..</li>
            <li> Awesome clean big improvement on the Braun option. Replacement Diamond clean mini heads are costly but worth getting. No dental bills!</li>
            <li> i agree with a previous poster - these just don&#x27;t last.  i have had two in two years.  the first was replaced under warranty, the replacement they sent me lasted until today&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jury is out of they will replace the second one</li>
            <li> This is a good toothbrush from a cleaning standpoint, but this is my second Philips toothbrush to breakdown within 2 years or so. I think Philips engineers their toothbrushes to breakdown in around 2 years when the warranty expires, which forces the user to upgrade and/or buy a brand new toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would avoid unless you&#x27;re comfortable buying a new toothbrush every 2 years.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it every day and have had no issues. I love the design as well.  Works great with braces.</li>
            <li> Great design, using the glass to hold the toothbrush and charge it is cool and functional.  The toothbrush also does a great job of cleaning your teeth and massaging gums.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had problems w/ a previous version of sonicare but this version seems to have rectified all the previous problems. Nothing cleans teeth better.</li>
            <li> Excellent upgrade from my many years old Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li> Design stupid. Would you buy a car that forced you to go through 1st, 2nd, 3rd gear, reverse and neutral to turn off the car? That&#x27;s what this thing does. Do you want to charge your toothbrush on your computer? Do you want to pay a ridiculous price for a shot glass to use for mouthwash then rest the brush in it to charge? When I called Phillips, they had a smart-mouth call me back and tried to make me think he was doing me a big favor by returning the product in the 30 day free return policy. I fill out pages of forms, only use Fed Ex at my expense and wait 6-8 weeks for a refund. I&#x27;d like to say that this product is a joke but it&#x27;s not funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Two weeks of phone calls and lies and today they agreed to refund with no guarantee of how much I would receive.But I will need their forms which I waited for 2 weeks to receive via email. I don&#x27;t trust them and will move on as I can&#x27;t believe this treatment. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Aside from the common manufacturing defect associated with a loose screw in the mechanism, this toothbrush is overpriced.  Overpriced the day you buy it, plus the replacement heads are expensive too.  We were able to stomach the initial price and the the holding us hostage for the price of replacement heads, but, the last straw came when we fell victim to a loose screw in the mechanism.  It works no more, and its out of warranty. If you are buying a philips toothbrush, do yourself a favor and search for &#x27;loose sonicare head&#x27;, those posts will show you how to fix it when it quits.  These issues, (initial purchase price and replacement head price), will be paramount in our mind as we shop for a replacement.  P.S.  Amazon is sending a new unit now....Its NOT a Philips!</li>
            <li> My headline says it all!  I also think my teeth are getting whiter with each use!  I use a regular toothpaste daily.  I plan to get some whitener as I think using it with this product will give me top notch results!  I have nothing negative to say about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this brush for 3 years and it finally kicked the bucket last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Has a lot of different vibration settings.  (I don&#x27;t believe vibrating at a different frequency does anything special for the cleaning process.  The settings are mostly to set an internal timer for it to turn off.)&lt;br /&gt;-Slender, elegant design.&lt;br /&gt;-Cool recharging station (it recharges by inductive charging)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Comments:&lt;br /&gt;Most brush heads you buy come with a ring that fits between the brush head and the toothbrush.  USE IT.  If you don&#x27;t, mold will appear in the crack that&#x27;s left behind.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if none of these problems happen to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely the most expensive toothbrush in my life, so is the maintenance of it. Because I thought this is it, the ultimate toothbrush that will stay with me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it turns out that the head doesn&#x27;t last 3 months (they are pretty expensive too), maybe around 2 months, and it gives me an annoyingly loud and harsh sound every time I turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s the pain in the ass, after almost 8 months of use, the charger base stops working. I didn&#x27;t use it very often because I&#x27;m travelling a lot from home (I think I only used it for 4 months and it is not plugged in most of the time!!!). I don&#x27;t know where to get this repaired or replaced... Anyone??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for a toothbrush, it does work a lot better than the others, it looks great too. I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m not that lucky, but it seems like the quality control is poor...</li>
            <li> The Sonicare electric toothbrush was highly recommended by my dental office. The diamonclean is the highest end Philips has - if I was going to go with it, I was getting the top end product, but that&#x27;s me. I can feel how much smoother my teeth feel and provide the sense of cleanliness. But the real proof will be if the office notices on my next visit. I certainly intend on using the diamondClean.</li>
            <li> The best of the best!</li>
            <li> A little pricey....&lt;br /&gt;Like having your own personal hygienist that does not talk too much!!</li>
            <li> So far I have been happy I ordered this product. My much older electronic brush did a good job, but this new unit seams to leave my teeth cleaner and I&#x27;m starting to see some whitening.</li>
            <li> Love this power toothbrush! Easy to use, many settings, and great teeth and gum care!</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush....for about a year, then it conks out on you.  I opened mine up to see if i could replace the battery.  You could, but that wasn&#x27;t the problem.  Poor design allows leaks into the body of the toothbrush where it corrodes the circuit board.  Thankfully, I got this as a trial product.  If I had purchased this at the RIDICULOUS price, I would be quite upset.  I replace this with a $20 Target brand and my teeth are doing just fine.  I could replace that toothbrush every single year for 9 years to equal the cost of one of these toothbrushes.Also, the button is in a poor place, I hit it often mid brushing and it would change to another setting, and you can&#x27;t see it while brushing so it was hard to get it back to the right setting.</li>
            <li> It is a good toothbrush, but for the money, it is quite expensive.  I would have probably been better off buying a less expensive model as it would have done just as good of a job.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush until it stopped working after 2 years, with no support offered by Philips.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy if you like spending $90/year on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Just got another replacement. I still love the brush and so does my dentist. This time it continued to charge but would not run. This time around customer service from Phillips was super and quick but my original warranty will still apply and expires mid September. So I have my 3rd toothbrush in a little under 2 years - wonder how long this one will last. I will definitely be looking at the competition if this one fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially very pleased with this product as my first review shows; but then ... At almost exactly one year from purchase, the battery died. A replacement is in the mail after dealing with Phillips&#x27; cumbersome web support. I generally avoid rechargeable appliances for this very reason but I thought given the price and the Phillips name that I could expect more, but I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! This brush really cleans; my teeth don&#x27;t feel this clean after professional cleanings. We did have to search on the net for product info and detailed instructions but the effort was well worth it. It is not cheap but it works better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> wow great product.  so much better than oral b.  much longer battery life but even more importantly the cleaning experience is far superior.  like how teeth feel noticably clean after brushing.  only minor point is lack of the timer that oral b had  instead. must rely on the very subtle 30 second speed interuptions to know how long have been brushing for.  it is only a minor point. this product is excellent</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush as a gift from a friend who is a dentist. I have now had it for about a year and a half. My teeth are marvelously white! My dentist (not the fiend) is very impressed. I must confess that I no longer floss but again, my dentist is amazed at how little build up there is between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I also think that the way this brush splits up the timer is nice. It buzzes lightly every 30 seconds to tell you to brush a different quadrant. Another positive is that this brushes charger is so cool! I like the wireless charging and it charges quickly. If I go on a week long vacation I never take my charger. It holds the charge for the whole week easily when brushing three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;This brush has many brushing options. &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Whitening&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34;, and a few others. I only have experience with Clean because that is my primary concern when brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I did not rate this five stars is the price of new heads. I have serious trouble finding them for less than $30 for 2 heads. When they are on sale it is still $24. This might have something to do with name brands. I feel like having a really nice toothbrush and going off brand is cheating my self so I simply suck it up. I recommend asking your dentist if they can get a discount.</li>
            <li> this is my 3rd sonicare toothbrush.  i was so happy with my purchase that i bought 3 more for family members.  i just tried out the diamond clean and i was was impressed.  the toothbrush is sleek and beautiful.  one for the millennium!  my other toothbrushes did their jobs well, however, they were a little bit loud. this one is super quiet.  i would feel comfortable brushing my teeth when my partner is asleep.  its beautiful and still makes me feel like i have just left the dentist&#x27;s office! great job, sonicare, for your continued improvements . I&#x27;m loving it! i solidly recommend!! i never thought it could get any better!</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been brushing our teeth with manual toothbrushes for 40+ years. We finally bought the Sonicare electric toothbrush and we both in love with them! How did we go without for so long! Our teeth feel so much more clean now!</li>
            <li> after using the sonicare flex plus i ordered this for my wife and she absolutely loves it, this diamond clean is outstanding she loves it and have teeth feel like when she comes from the dentist nice and clean. The handle is nice and sleek the white setting brush mode is incredible</li>
            <li> I had a top of the line Oral B electric toothbrush before, and what a difference! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the DiamondClean heads or the mechanism or both, but it seriously works better than any toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried, including a previous Sonicare. Recently I was away for a week and only brought a regular toothbrush, and it worked so poorly in comparison with this one that I vowed never to travel without it again. Charging in the glass it comes with works great and looks a heck of a lot better than the usual charger, plus it&#x27;s not as easy to bump it and tip it over. And I don&#x27;t find that the handle is slippery at all. All in all, I can&#x27;t think of a single reason not to invest in this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd sonicare and I love it. It is the only toothbrush that DDS recommends. I bought this one only because you can charge via standard USB so it is for traveling. The glass to recharge it is awesome too. The only thing I did  not like is awkward to change the levels and see the battery level. Other than that I do recommend if you want to have a toothbrush that really works and easy to transport.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest you invest in your mouth. This one is so good words can&#x27;t describe it. I am normally a cheap person but the visit to my dentist recently told me that I was brushing too hard and I needed to invest in a brush.  After reading all the positive reviews, I chose this one.  I am not sorry.</li>
            <li> Love this so far.  Have to charge it every 10 days to 2 weeks instead of every 3 weeks, but&lt;br /&gt;it works effectively.  Hope it lasts, especially at this price.  Not so admiring of the brush heads&lt;br /&gt;which wear out too fast.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever used.  I have been using an electric toothbrush for ten years, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I bought my first sonicare in 2001 and it lasted until Jan. 2013. Lasting 11 years is quite impressive for anything. I debated on brands and did all the normal research, which merely indicated they were almost the same, but finally I decided, why switch, the first one worked for a decade, if this one just works 5-6 years I&#x27;ll be happy. The Diamond is quite different from the first one and has more more controls than I&#x27;ll ever use. It also seems quieter and faster.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I can be a bit too easily distracted by the latest shiny new gadget and this thing really does look the part. However, I&#x27;ve been a long time Sonicare user (and always will be a Sonicare user, these things turned my gum health around). So, I love the way this toothbrush looks, the charging station is cool and fun, and being able to charge by USB is actually pretty darned useful.&lt;br /&gt;However, the one thing, and the most important thing that swung me to buy this is that my dental hygienist (who I trust and respect very much) said this was the best Sonicare ever and would really improve my tooth and gum health. For that, the expensive price suddenly becomes much more worth it. Use one of these and floss regularly, and you will see better teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;Hey, and the fact that it looks cool in my bathroom ... well that&#x27;s just a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> The Best, by far.  Surpassed all my expectations and I immediately noticed a difference the first week I used this product!</li>
            <li> Too just for the money. I paid only for a glass of charging. Cleaning system was not changed. And teeth for 2 weeks not became more white. I thought it would be more technological purchase. Very beautiful design. And pleasant to the touch &#x3D;))</li>
            <li> Sonic always makes great products. It was time for an upgrade so I researched and chose the DiamondClean. I love it. It has more options than the older models and does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! Its powerful enough to keep plaque away, making checkups at the dentist drama-free with minimal effort on my part. This is dental care for the future.</li>
            <li> My hygenist recommended this brand so I bought the best one.  It has a wonderful travel and charging case &amp; does an excellent job.  I am not sure about all the bells &amp; whistles...the jury is still out about them.  I am looking forward to getting back to the dentist office and getting a report that my teeth &amp; gums look better than ever.  Hope a hope a hope!</li>
            <li> Great product, but has quality problems - stopped working after less than 5 months!</li>
            <li> This brand was recommended by my dental hygenist. I really like it. It does a very good and efficient cleaning. Comes with a really nice travel case as well. I love the &amp;#34;glass&amp;#34; charger. Comes with regular charger for travel.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. Really, the idea of spending this kind of cash on a toothbrush seemed absolutely ludicrous to me up until a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like going to the dentist. Aside from Bill Murray, I&#x27;m not sure many of us do. But, I dragged myself to that devil-spawns office last week and was informed I had some fillings that were needed. I was also encouraged to fork out the dough for this toothbrush, which he tried to sell me there. I opted not to, but decided to buy it later after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way I can properly put into words how much better this thing is than a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothbrush. To put it simply, my mouth has never in my life felt this clean, and I will never, ever go back to normal tooth brushes again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will not be a purchase you regret.</li>
            <li> So far so good. My friend has it. I charged it and it&#x27;s been working for 2 weeks now. Great battery don&#x27;t have to keep plugged in. Hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever!</li>
            <li> It feels really good on the teeth. It cleans much better than my old worn out Sonicare (it was very good for its generation). It is easy to clean and the charger is glass so also easy to keep clean. The travel case is a bonus as it also can act as a charger. A very good all around product that is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best (and by far the most expensive) toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful&lt;br /&gt;- Many cleaning modes&lt;br /&gt;- Awesome rinse glass / charger&lt;br /&gt;- Great carrying case which doubles as a travel charger&lt;br /&gt;- Long battery life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the glass charging solution. It&#x27;s great to be able to just drop the brush in the glass and know it&#x27;ll be charging perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts so long that I&#x27;ve taken two-week trips abroad and not once found the need to plug the carrying case in to charge the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The elegant one-button design really isn&#x27;t the best user interface&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive&lt;br /&gt;- Wish the charge cable would fit in the case as the case feels overly large&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue with the one-button design is that you have to select the cleaning mode while it&#x27;s turned on, and if you&#x27;ve ever turned on a sonic toothbrush while it&#x27;s primed and outside your mouth, you&#x27;ll know that&#x27;s a bad idea. So to pick a mode you have to have the brush in your mouth and try to focus your vision on the display which is just inches from your eyes, while pressing the button to select the next mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is very convenient, but it does feel larger than it needs to be, I&#x27;m sure they could find a way to fit the cargo cable within the case, even if it was a shorter cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all the pros outweigh the cons by a large margin. This is a fantastic toothbrush and if you&#x27;ve never used a sonic toothbrush you&#x27;re in for a real treat.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare my first didn&#x27;t make 6 months before it died, I am happy to say this one is now over a year old and still takes and holds a charge like new, I think they improved the technology so now they don&#x27;t over charge where the earlier models may have. These are not cheap but the results speak for themselves. My dentist as well as other dentist I know all highly recommend these and the reason I got another was my dentist told me he saw a major change with me using it for just 3 weeks in tooth and gum health.</li>
            <li> Sure, paying nearly $200 for a toothbrush seems a little ridiculous, and maybe it is. But in all honesty, I have lived this toothbrush. The extras make a difference. For example, the wireless charging. Just set the brush in the cup when you&#x27;re done brushing and it charges. It&#x27;s that easy. You don&#x27;t have to line it up any special way to make it work. The travel case has come in handy several times as well. It protects the toothbrush and is an easy way to charge it on the go, of you even need to. The battery seems to last a really long time, so I don&#x27;t usually even take the charging cable with me when I travel. It hasn&#x27;t died on me yet. The different settings are also a nice touch. I also like that it times your brushing and lets you know when to switch to the next section of your mouth. I have enjoyed this toothbrush, and my dentist seems to think it was a good choice.</li>
            <li> It works great until it does not any more.  The battery can&#x27;t be replaced and either it dies or it malfunctions after about 15 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so disappointing.</li>
            <li> And there are lots of pennies!  Bought it based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation. Makes my teeth feel as if I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist&#x27;s for a cleaning.  My dental hygienist tells me it&#x27;s the best toothbrush out there and I agree. Well worth the price although it would be nice if replacement brushed were a bit less expensive.  Still, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item June 8, 2012 and absolutely loved it.  At first.  About 8 months in, I noticed it wasn&#x27;t quite as powerful as when I first bought it - so I gave it a good scrub and replaced the head unit (I do this faithfully every 3 months anyways) and it sort of seemed better.  About a month ago it really started loosing power even though the power indicated showed that it was fully charged and then finally yesterday morning it died and won&#x27;t recharge.  Rather disappointing to spend $170 for a toothbrush that lasts only 14 months -- at this rate I could have purchased a new regular toothbrush each month!  My last Sonicare lasted 6 years, so I am suspecting that this was a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I originally had the E-series, which I bought about 7 years ago. It was great but it died in August, 2013. I was reluctant to spend the money on the Diamond series. However, after I used it once it was worth the money. As of this writing I&#x27;ve had the toothbrush for about 7 weeks and there&#x27;s a big difference in clean feeling across my teeth. I read other reviews before I bought it and I was hesitant because some of the reviews said the brush head was loose and the brushing was difficult. It works well for me and the brush head is secure. I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems that some have stated. I would say like the older models, you should keep constant contact with your teeth and the brush while it&#x27;s on. Do not loose contact from one quadrant to the next. So far I don&#x27;t find any special acrobatic techniques needed to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> Just a wonderful device.  Makes you brush for two minutes as it lets you know when 30 seconds is up.  My teeth feel so smooth and clean.  I&#x27;ve had other electric tooth brushes and none made my teeth feel this clean.  If I should win the lottery I will purchase one for everybody I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact with all the government programs perhaps every American (ones with teeth) should get one.  Within say 20 years, the false teeth people would go out of business, there would be less bacterial endocarditis, smokers would get more dates, (whitens too) and dental insurance rates would go down.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush from Sonicare. My teeth feel exceptionally clean and polished in comparison to my previous Sonicare toothbrushes. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  My teeth feel like they are professionally cleaned with every use.  This is the best purchase I have made this year.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It&#x27;s hard to go back to old toothbrush after use this item.  My teeth have never felt cleaner!</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Great job. Don&#x27;t always make the complete 2 minute mark though.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush.  It is very expensive but a fabulous toothbrush.  A nice touch is the fact that you can charge it via USB and a charge will last a couple of weeks.  Saves having to use an outlet for it.  Notwithstanding the price, I recommend the DIamondClean.</li>
            <li> Wow, this product is great.&lt;br /&gt;First let me tell you I never used an electric toothbrush before... so I decided to give it a try when I saw this product available. I always heard wonders about Philips electric toothbrushes, and I know they have been around for years... but I never imagined myself using one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush has the most wonderful feeling in the mouth and the teeth get REALLY clean. In my case I did not feel any bleeding or sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Diamondclean comes with two heads and a great travel set. It is easy to assemble, easy to use... and you can even charge the toothbrush via the USB port on your computer (brilliant!). The pressets are easy to understand and the whole product has a quality that is hard to beat. And on top of it the system looks robust enough - meaning it does not look like it&#x27;s gonna break three months from now. I simply cannot see a flaw on this product. Congratulations Philips: you converted a skeptic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that my teeth have never been as clean since I began using this brush a few weeks ago.  I have always brushed and flossed twice a day, but I have still gotten cavities in all the common places--between teeth and in the harder-to-reach areas of my mouth.  In addition, I get tartar buildup behind my front teeth, both on the top and bottom.  It is just a fact that brushing these areas with a regular toothbrush is not very easy.  However, this amazing toothbrush makes it possible to brush your entire mouth with the same effective motion.  It is effortless, and it only takes 2 minutes.  The built-in timer that tells you when to brush another area of your mouth is GREAT.  You divide the brushing into 4 parts: front of bottom teeth, back of bottom teeth, front of top teeth, and back of top teeth.  When the timer indicates via a faint beep and a brief interruption of the brush, then you move to the next quadrant of your mouth.  To summarize my thoughts, here are the positive and negative points about the brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Amazing Clean: My mouth just feels cleaner after two minutes of using this brush.  I think the feeling comes from the gentle vibration of the toothbrush, which stimulates your gums as you are brushing.  In addition, I know my mouth is cleaner because I could not possibly brush this vigorously in tough-to-reach places with a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Long Battery Life: Even with 2 brushing cycles per day, I only charge the brush about once every two weeks.  I plug it in to charge when I go to bed, and I unplug it when I get up the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. USB Charging/Storage Case: This is a pretty amazing creation.  You simply put the brush and heads into the case, attach the supplied cord to the case, and plug it into the wall or a computer (yes, a computer).  The toothbrush magically charges in the case, even though nothing is plugged into the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Easy to Handle: The brush has a nice feel in your hand.  It is easy to hold, even when it is vibrating.  I have never dropped mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Simple to Use: I never actually read the instruction manual.  The brush comes with a \\&quot;Quick Start\\&quot; card that is the super-short version of the instructions.  I have never needed to look at the lengthy instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVE OR QUESTIONABLE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Availability &amp; Cost of Replacement Brushes: I believe it is recommended that you change the brush every 3 months.  I have not used mine that long, but I have looked at the cost of replacement brushes--currently 3 for $38 on Amazon.  This is certainly no bargain.  I have seen Philips replacement brushes at Sam&#x27;s Club, but not for the Diamondclean model.  Maybe they will get them in the future.  In the meantime, this toothbrush could cost you over $50/year if you replace the brush every 3 months.  That is about $50 more than a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Many Different Modes: The first mode is \\&quot;Clean\\&quot;.  It is the only one that I have ever used.  I have my doubts as to whether a different method of brushing could actually make my teeth whiter or more polished.  Therefore, I have never even tried those modes.  They seem a little gimmicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. USB Glass Charger: The concept of putting your toothbrush in a glass to charge it is neat, but I haven&#x27;t seen the real advantage to this over the USB Charging/Storage Case.  For me, this is a once-every-two-week activity, and I don&#x27;t plan to keep the toothbrush on the counter sitting in a glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Funny/Concerning Instructions: Given the price, I hope to use this toothbrush for many years.  However, in the instructions, Philips shows you what to do with the toothbrush before you throw it away (throw it away?!?).  You simply cover it with a soft cloth (pictured in instructions), whack it with a hammer, remove the rechargeable battery, and then throw the smashed toothbrush in the trash.  GREAT!  I hope I won&#x27;t be doing this anytime soon.  My lastmicrowave lasted only about 6 years.  I better get no less than that from this toothbrush, which cost me more than a new microwave.than a new microwave.</li>
            <li> After the first time you use it, which is creepy if you don&#x27;t already use an electric toothbrush, it quickly becomes the best thing since sliced bread!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has multiple modes (although I only use the basic one) but does a great job. If you are a heavy brusher this will help you go easy on your gums. My dentist even complemented the results. The only down side is that replacement heads are VERY spendy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with travel kit and a few charging options which work a little bit like magic.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to give this toothbrush 5 stars, but I just couldn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not a bad device by any means but it&#x27;s partly a step backwards from the Flexcare+ model and is it really worth the price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying this is the 4th Sonicare Toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.  I had the Essence, than the Flexcare, than the Flexcare+ and now the DiamondClean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the Flexcare or the Flexcare+ do you really need to upgrade to this model?  Probably not, Sonicare&#x27;s own website states you get a 44% better clean using the new DiamondClean heads, so the handle obviously makes no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong the new handle is very cool, slick design, even slicker charging options, but did Sonicare have to remove features to do this?  For instance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery icon is now 1 solid icon rather than 3 different slices, now you can&#x27;t tell when the battery is getting low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The button to change modes was removed, now there is one button for power and mode changing, this means unless you want to splatter toothpaste all over your mirror you need to change the mode in your mouth while trying to squint at the brush to see what mode it&#x27;s on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why was the UV cleaner removed?  Ok, I really didn&#x27;t use this often but it was cool to know I had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is very expensive, and your basically paying for the cool charging technology, and the absurdly overpriced new brush heads.  Currently a pack of 3 runs almost $35. In contrast a pack of 7 ProResults can be had at a big name Warehouse store for around $40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also while putting your toothbrush in the cup for charging is cool, is that really practical?  If anything it&#x27;s going to start making the bottom of the handle sort of gross, how many germs collect in that cup overnight unless you clean it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, cool charging technology does not take the place of convenience features.</li>
            <li> Wow!  My teeth have never been cleaner.  And they were whiter after the first brushing.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but when you figure how much whitening at your dentist&#x27;s office would cost.... this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using sonic care forever now. This is the 3rd model I bought.  They design is great, handle is slim and you have to get use to it though. (Slippage).  Polish feature is great, makes your teeth really clean. But I think its the same as the older model with the 2 stage button.  The carrying case with charger is brilliant! Great job on the design.  Overall:  You are paying for the design only.  This unit is pretty much the same as any other previous sonic care model.  They need to make the battery replaceable to justify this model.  The glass cup should have had a slimmer cable to hide to achieve the overall seamless look.</li>
            <li> As much as I absolutely loved this toothbrush and miss the clean feeling it left me with, my toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t charge in either charging port after just under a year of owning it. The toothbrush wasn&#x27;t damaged at all and this happened unexpectedly. For the amount of money my husband spent getting me this as a gift, I would have liked to have a longer lasting product. I truly enjoyed it while it lasted, but I can&#x27;t bring myself to ever purchase another one of these.</li>
            <li> This brush was recommended to me by a friend.  When I got my toothbrush I totally loved it, my teeth are so clean.  The vibrations were a little off-putting in the beginning but it starts off gently and gradually works up to full speed over a period of 14 brushes.  I love the timed intervals depending on which setting you pick and I like that you can have different cleaning settings.  Overall a fantastic toothbrush that delivers everything it says in a very nifty package designed beautifully for both home and travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes consistently for about 15 years.  During that time I used two different Sonicares, the original one and the Elite.  Each of them performed great and lasted about 7-8 years before the battery finally started to fail.    I&#x27;ve been using Diamond Clean for about 6 weeks now and I&#x27;m extremely happy with it.  My teeth feel extra clean and smooth after each time I brush.  I&#x27;m not exactly sure why it seems to perform so much better than my prior Sonicare but I&#x27;m guessing its primarily due to new brush head design.    At first I was unsure if I wanted to spend the extra money for the Diamond Clean model but I decided to go for it since I&#x27;ve been happy with my prior Sonicare toothbrushes and since they last for quite a while.  I figured the extra $50 or so the Diamond Clean cost over the other models would be minor when spread out over the 7-8 year lifespan of the product.  Pros - Quality design and construction.  Leaves teeth feeling extra clean.  Brush heads attach and remove easily.  Cons - Other than the initial cost, none.</li>
            <li> This is probably my 4th or 5th Sonicare in over a decade. I&#x27;m been using them since they came out before Philips bought the original company. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had one go bad. They&#x27;ve all been rock solid. I&#x27;ve only bought new units when Philips had made some substantial changes. The one I&#x27;m replacing has been going strong for about 3 years now and I just happened to see that they have this no Diamondclean model.  First off. The newer style heads are a blessing. All the models I&#x27;ve had before had though drop in a cavity and twist lock design. Toothpaste and water always managed to get in over time and it was an annoyance to clear. These newer style look light they won&#x27;t have any of that problem.  This is also my first Sonicare with more than two modes. I don&#x27;t know that they really have a different brushing style but the ability to have a mode with a different time is nice so that I can brush longer without the brush going off and having to turn it on again. That was always just a minor inconvenience. What does seem to be annoying is that you can&#x27;t \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the toothbrush into a specific mode. You can turn off an off the \\&quot;ramp-up\\&quot; mode, cycle through the different modes, but you can&#x27;t leave it in a specific mode. You have to CYCLE through a long list to get to what you want each and every time you start the brush. I read through the manual, read the Philips FAQ, and even spoke with a CSR at Philips and nope. That just seems silly since I would figure most people are going to use one or maybe two modes so to have it start at a different position in the list would seem a no brainer but Philips didn&#x27;t do it. What is interesting is that the CSR said other (older) models do. But not the newest, most expensive, and most featured Diamondclean. Weard.  The charging glass is very nice and WELL built. They also state you can use it for rinsing your mouth. That&#x27;s nice. For charging it seem really cool that you can just drop the toothbrush in glass without having to make sure it&#x27;s positioned the right way, REALLY cool. Problem is if you&#x27;re using it to rinse with I don&#x27;t think you want to also store the bottom of the toothbrush in it afterwords. Doesn&#x27;t seem right. They also include a charging cradle though instead if you want to use the glass as a glass. That&#x27;s a nice dual featured option. Only problems though are that it does have to align a certain way and it&#x27;s not always clean how the toothbrush fits in it (direction wise) so you just need to rotate it a certain way and remember that&#x27;s how you left it. It also would have been nice if the charging cradle was glass so you could drop in the dishwasher like the charging glass but it&#x27;s high quality plastic. It&#x27;s not a big deal but would have been nice.  The travel case with USB charger / AC adapter is a smart idea and I don&#x27;t know why someone didn&#x27;t think of it sooner. For those long trips it&#x27;s one less thing you have to take with you. The case itself it also excellent quality, well built, and stylish.  There is no UV cleaner on this model. Personally I never had the model with one. I always question if it really makes a difference. Sure UV can kill the little grubbies but over time they can also mutate and become stronger. Not to mention the UV doesn&#x27;t seem like it would have an effect in crevices where the light doesn&#x27;t reach. I just don&#x27;t know that it \\&quot;really\\&quot; makes a difference.  The cost of toothbrush is expensive. Yes. But my first Sonicare over a decade ago was MORE expensive and in todays dollars would be even more so. Are they making a large profit off these. Possibility. But they also seem to spend a lot of R&amp;D to constantly refine and upgrade, not just repackage/redesign or add gimmicks. Given that you get the toothbrush, two heads, two chargers (home/travel), travel case/charger, glass, etc and they are all very high quality, excellent build quality/construction/design I think you get what you&#x27;re paying for. They are also some of the most popular and recommended professionaltype home toothbrushes. The replacement heads on the other hand due seem more expensive compared to their other models which contain more parts/plastic. I&#x27;m sure that will change. But this is also a change in business too. There are lots of businesses out there that sell the hardware at a loss because it&#x27;s so expensive to make, but make there money back on consumables.</li>
            <li> love it. my gum just getting better and better. It&#x27;s kinda magic for me.</li>
            <li> This is one of my best purchases of the year (the other being the Nutribullet). My friend suggested I treat myself to this Sonicare DiamondClean. He also told me it would change my life. And it has. I hate, repeat HATE, brushing my teeth. I don&#x27;t find it pleasurable in any way. I would rather suffer at the hands of my dentist every 6 months than to brush my teeth on a regular basis. This thing has a bunch of different modes (i.e. &#x27;Polish&#x27; when I had a little too much red wine and &#x27;GumCare&#x27; when my mouth is feeling a little hairy). The 30-second interval timer is really handy b/c it makes sure you reach every part of your mouth and not just the front teeth. It seems really expensive but break it down by days of the year and how much you spend on dentist bills and it&#x27;s totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally.</li>
            <li> Love it so much!!This is my second time to purchase this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I have used Sonic toothbbrushes for about 10 years and this is my third one.  I have been very pleased with each of them. I therefore was expectng this one to be good but I did not expect it to be as good as it has been.  This brush is much more powerful and feels like a tool that the dentist would use rather than one I would be able to use at home.  I have been using it now for two weeks and I can&#x27;t wait to hear what my dental hygienist says.  My teeth feel very much cleaner.  They feel like I have just come from the dental office after each brushing!</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for years. My previous model was Flexcare with the Sanitizer. Before purchasing Diamondclean, I thought the performance for both of the models  should be quite similar and didn&#x27;t expect much an \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot;. I was wrong! Diamondclean is definitely much more powerful than the Flexcare, noticeably more powerful! I definitely think the newer brush heads clean a lot better as well. I didn&#x27;t expect that. I always thought Flexcare did an awesome job on cleaning my teeth, but I think Diamondclean does a better job.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush cleaned very well but mine started making weird noises and the fact that it didn&#x27;t have a select button made it even worse, don&#x27;t get me wrong this toothbrush is very appealing to the eye and the glass cup was and inventive way of charging it but it wasn&#x27;t durable and it Philips needs to fix those flaws.</li>
            <li> As a dental professional I have been using Sonicare for over 10 years. Though I bought this product w/ a professional discount, I agree with other reviewers who said this new model isn&#x27;t worth the jump in price from previous ones. If I didn&#x27;t get the discount, I would not spend $220 on it. I personally don&#x27;t have a problem w/ the single button to change modes as other reviewers do, but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t use them because they are hogwash (except maybe the sensitive mode). My main gripe is the handle is made out of ceramic and is SLIPPERY! I believe the handle of all previous models were plastic, and I dropped one once - it didn&#x27;t break. I&#x27;m concerned w/ this new model the handle case would crack if it were dropped. I probably won&#x27;t drop it, but still. Sonicare would probably tell me that the crack wouldn&#x27;t be covered under warranty but of course I would argue that it&#x27;s a design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give three stars because my teeth still feel \\&quot;dentist clean\\&quot; after using this brush, so it does what its supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare designers: if you are reading this, stop trying to impress with all these ridiculous and unnecessary bells and whistles! I bought this product to brush my teeth, not as a decor to blend w/ my furniture.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare within the past 15 years. I just love this product. Definitely makes a huge difference in dental visits (my teeth are cleaner and whiter) and they also last a really long time. Would not get any other electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned -- or even used -- an electric toothbrush before.  I bought this product, pricey though it is, based on the reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it, and still happy a year later, as I update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I can&#x27;t compare this brush to other electric toothbrushes for how effectively it cleans, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth certainly feels clean after the 2 or 3 minutes.  (I&#x27;ve had no problems at all with over-vigorous brushing, unlike some of the other reviewers.)  It&#x27;s certainly a good looking toothbrush, too, and since it sits out in the bathroom (at least in my minuscule bathroom, it has to), that&#x27;s important to me as well.  The charger options are terrific -- the glass, the little unit instead of the glass both work and are equally convenient.  (I haven&#x27;t used the USB option, and I didn&#x27;t see the point of it -- who would charge a toothbrush through a laptop??!!??--, but someone pointed out that it&#x27;s convenient for international travel, which makes sense.)  So all in all, great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only deduction, a star, is for the design flaw that many others have complained about: the single button that switches modes *and* turns it on and off -- but, very unfortunately, only in sequence of modes.  In other words, if you&#x27;re brushing in \\&quot;clean,\\&quot; and want to end early, you have to cycle through the other modes before it turns off.  Not a deal breaker, but wow, is that annoying.  One other annoyance: it sometimes gets noisy and rattles (though maybe mine&#x27;s broken already!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it&#x27;s expensive.  But worth it to me, at least, and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I&#x27;ve wanted in a toothbrush. The case is amazing...it allows charging while in the case using usb to a wall outlet or computer. The glass and plastic stand that are included to hold the toothbrush in the bathroom are both high quality, and the toothbrush itself has a nice heft.</li>
            <li> I had the Sonicare Flexcare awhile back, but the battery started to lose its charge after one or two brushings, so I started shopping. I had read that most people didn&#x27;t notice a difference between sonic and non-sonic variety, so I opted for an Oral B electric (rotating-head) brush.  ...mistake.  The brush-head was tiny, it was loud, the battery didn&#x27;t last more than 3-4 days, and I never really felt that ultra-clean like I did with the Flexcare.  Goodbye, Oral B!  Hello, DiamondClean!  This is amazing.  The look is sleek and classy, tho, the handle is a little .. not slippery, but an odd smooth that takes a little getting used to. It charges fairly quick and the charges have lasted about a week (two brushings per day). It&#x27;s quiet, too; just a low hum that can&#x27;t really be heard outside of 10 feet. I&#x27;ve read complaints about the multiple modes and having to awkwardly scroll thru them while the brush-head is in your mouth; honestly, I haven&#x27;t even needed another mode other than the standard. Why? Because the power is glorious! I missed it SO much with the oral b. This leaves my mouth feeling amazing!  My one complaint (about all Sonicares) is the auto-shutoff after two-minutes. They say \\&quot;30 seconds per zone\\&quot; (top-outside, top-in, bottom-out, bottom-in), but sometimes I fall behind schedule and the brush shuts off when I&#x27;m only half done. Simple enough-- turn the brush on again for a fresh two minutes. I hesitate to mention anything positive about the oral b, but that one stuttered the brush at the two-min mark, then just kept on going.  I wish Phillips would incorporate that feature.  It&#x27;s a very, very minor complaint, and frankly, my only one. This toothbrush is well-worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, amazing charge time and faultless so far... lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Result are in sync with the claims happy with the product also with amazons delivery as this was my first online import to India Mumbai.</li>
            <li> Had my dental check up today, this baby works!</li>
            <li> Expensive, but awesome! Battery lasts about 3 weeks. Travel case with USB charger is a big plus. Love this toothbrush. I don&#x27;t use the glass, it&#x27;s too big on my counter. Otherwise, the toothbrush works great.</li>
            <li> Dental care is highly important to me, that&#x27;s why I decided to make this investment. At first this product was amazing, but like many others have experienced, my tooth brush broke about 1 year after I bought it and the replacement heads just buzz off the top. It&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> Love it so much!&lt;br /&gt;Good product, good design. Clean and comfortable, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it again when good price.</li>
            <li> Just fabulous! cleans very well&lt;br /&gt;It does everything it says on the website! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I take it every where I go. I can&#x27;t use normal toothbrush anymore</li>
            <li> This is by far the most expensive toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever bought, but I think it was worth the money.  My old one (A $60 dollar DazzlePro) burned out after about a year or so.  Actually it didn&#x27;t burn out; it just started turning itself on at random times, and never when I needed it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this thing is probably what you&#x27;d get if Apple designed electric tooth brushes.  It&#x27;s sleek looking, the lights kinda &amp;#34;fade in and out&amp;#34;, the product packaging is a work of art, and every detail was meticulously crafted by engineers who obviously lose sleep over this sort of thing.  My favorite feature is the inductive charging!  That little glass cup you see in the picture; yes, that&#x27;s a charger.  You just drop the toothbrush in there and the lights turn off, and the &amp;#34;Charging&amp;#34; light starts pulsating.  It even comes with a fancy travel case with the same inductive charging ability, only this one uses a USB cable.  Yes, it&#x27;s that geeky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only slight issue I have is the tooth brush head itself is a bit too small, and sometimes I put a blob of toothpaste on it and it immediately falls off.  However, I think this makes it easier to reach those back wisdom teeth so perhaps it&#x27;s worth the occasional mishap.  I&#x27;d recommend this tooth brush to anyone!</li>
            <li> Cleans great and has a great aesthetic design. The protective travel case that includes charging via USB is genius. The only downside is that it&#x27;s not possible to choose the toothbrush&#x27;s mode before turning on the sonic vibration. But honestly, I only use the standard 2-minute cleaning mode, so this isn&#x27;t a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush!  I read all the reviews before i bought it and i agree with the majority of them.  This really makes your teeth feel dentist-clean - everyday!  Only down side was It was a little pricey!!!  That kept me from buying it for quite awhile but the reviews finally won me over (and my old Sonic was dying....).  Hopefully it will last a few years.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush handle looked slightly dirty, but it wiped off with a damp cloth. I received it quickly. I love the way it makes my teeth feel. Although it was pricy, it was well worth it!</li>
            <li> Wireless charging is so cool. I just wish the USB connector for charging it in the travel case was micro instead of mini, so I could share it with all my other devices.</li>
            <li> Really makes your mouth feel clean!</li>
            <li> I previously had a 5 star review, but miraculously just a few months after warranty expires, so does the brush handle. I loved the product and took great care of it, but a little after the 2 year warranty expired the brush started to stutter and switch between low and high vibrations as if one of the gears rusted away. It got progressively worse and now barely works and drives me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite customer service acknowledging that it is sounds like a common manufacturing issue, they hid behind the 2 year warranty period and were not willing to budge after several attempts. Their solution was a 15% discount and they suggested a 6mo warranty extension for additional $, which is just a slap in the face given mine broke down after 2 years and 7 months. I explained I have been a lifelong Philips customer, and my family still has 4 old Sonicare models that have lasted me 8+ years without issues, and that a sub 3yr shelf life for their &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; almost $200 toothbrush doesn&#x27;t seem right. Their response was &amp;#34;Yes, that&#x27;s actually the normal time frame for a Sonicare (diamondclean) to last because it has a motor attached to a batter inside the handle connected to other electrical components.&amp;#34; Effectively they admitted that its normal for these expensive toothbrushes to begin to break down just after the warranty period, and just hope their customers keep replacing them. If you ask me almost $100 a year for a toothbrush is a complete scam. They lost a lifelong Philips user due to taking manufacturing shortcuts that they never made with past models.nnecessary (my roommate has one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baseline: its not necessary, but neither are any of the flexcare models or any oral-b over the 1000. The diamondclean is a high end luxury no frills kind of model that feels great in your hand and is built to last. The long term batterly life and sleek design make it terrific for travelers.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have developed a bad habit over many years of brushing too hard, and because of that I&#x27;m getting some slight gum recession, so I decided on this to help break the habit.  I&#x27;ve always thought that electric toothbrushes were a bit of a gimmick so I&#x27;ve never bought one until now, but I am impressed!  The first time I used it, my teeth felt much more clean than they ever have from normal brushing.  It is expensive, but it appears to be well made and the way it charges is too cool.  You just set it in the inductive charger, and that&#x27;s it.  The only thing that bugs me, is that it doesn&#x27;t seem that it runs long enough before the timer shuts it off.  For example:  the &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; mode is 2 minutes long.  You&#x27;re supposed to divide your mouth up into 4 sections, and after 30 seconds it alerts you that it&#x27;s time to move on to another section.  I&#x27;m finding that I don&#x27;t have enough time to finish up each section before moving on, so I wish there were a way to disable that feature.  Other than that minor gripe, this is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> good look and great performance</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how this works!  My teeth feel cleaner than when I go to the dentist for a cleaning.  I can see how plaque is removed in as little as 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> anti bacterial construction, after 3 years of daily use it still looks new, the battery is great too it lasts for weeks and even after the low battery warning you can still go a few days</li>
            <li> Teeth have never felt so clean.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is reliable and cleans my teeth way better than with a regular tooth brush. Best toothbrush yet. Love the black makes it look even better sitting the the cup to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to get the following as well&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0086VIA3O/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B0086VIA3O&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;derdigki-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;F4U3V3FRKXEINQ47&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy brushing</li>
            <li> My handle stopped working after 11 months.  The replacement process was painless.  I did it via Sonicare&#x27;s instant chat on the website.  Hopefully the new one lasts as it does not get it&#x27;s own 1-year warranty!</li>
            <li> Got the toothbrush from our dentist in 2012.  In early 2014 the shaft for the brush didn&#x27;t work. This toothbrush was always kept at home or in a case when traveling. We called Phillips and were told this toothbrush is NON REPAIRABLE! After almost 2 years we are out the $150 we spent on what we thought was a solid, long lasting electric toothbrush. We&#x27;re trying the competitors brush now and for less money, it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Too bad it&#x27;s so pricy.</li>
            <li> Love my new toothbrush! It is expensive, but I think it is well worth the investment.  It definitely has helped make a better cleaning habit. It arrived on a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy the BLACK Version. It is PAINTED and the Paint comes off with use.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s the best! Teeth feels really clean after use.</li>
            <li> Mouth, gums and teeth feel fresher comparwd</li>
            <li> It only lasted 17 months, and then started to fail slowly, and finally stopped working. The head was no longer aligned with the motor, and finally seized up.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I don&#x27;t regret buying this toothbrush at all.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth have become more white.  In addition to working great, the product looks great.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical...I&#x27;ve tried other brands of electric toothbrushes and never been satisfied.  But once I tried the Philips Sonicare I was thrilled.  It is not harsh and abrasive like some other toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve tried.  My teeth feel squeaky clean.  The recharger is so convenient - my toothbrush is always ready to go.</li>
            <li> It is too noisy!&lt;br /&gt;And, it is out of order in 6 months. I&#x27;m not sure if this is single issue or not, but Philips service is excellent that I got a new one when I reported to the Philips service center. (The new one is noisy too.)</li>
            <li> new advanced head wonderful Polish mode wonderful  no UV ? and art deco fails in both our bathrooms with limited counter space so I waiting on the next unit non art deco flagship</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare died after 5 years so I needed a replacement right away.  After using the Sonicare a regular toothbrush just wouldn&#x27;t cut it. I purchased this toothbrush and have been happy since it arrived.  Has a few new features that my old one didn&#x27;t have which was nice.  After a few months of use I can&#x27;t be happier it cleans my teeth very well and feels good in your hand while using.  The Diamond replacement heads are a little expensive but that&#x27;s the only negative thing that I can say.  It&#x27;s expensive but what does a filling cost these days?</li>
            <li> mazing toothbrush! It&#x27;s been about a month now and everytime I use this brush my mouth truly feels dentist clean! The design and the charging glass are som of my fave specs for this toothbrush and the options as well! I would definetly recomment this brush to everyone who wants to have healthy gums and clean teeth!</li>
            <li> UPDATE 5/2014: After two years of use, the power button on the handle had become so unresponsive to operate, that it required a very forceful two-thumb push to turn on my toothbrush. I contacted Philips via their website, using their online assistant, and a replacement handle was shipped to me the same day. I simply had to return mine in the same box as the replacement, and Philips paid the return shipping. How easy was that?! My two year warranty had actually expired one month prior (isn&#x27;t that always the way it goes?) but it turns out that because I registered my toothbrush--which I didn&#x27;t even remember doing--the warranty got extended by an additional six months. Great customer service, Philips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW: Funny, i don&#x27;t remember reading that Jonny Ive was moonlighting over at Philips. But this is their second new dental product in a row--the first being the AirFloss--that might lead you to think that Sonicare design was now being done by Apple. And I mean that in the most complimentary way. This is, without question, the most modern and elegantly designed electric toothbrush on the market today, and I can only compare holding it to the feeling you get when you hold an Apple product. But is it worth the premium price being charged for it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ANSWER IS YES, IF...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You have money to splurge a bit and value great design very highly. The ceramic feel of the power handle (though not actually ceramic), the hidden areas that illuminate to indicate mode and battery status, the brilliance of a travel case that both closes magnetically and charges the power handle via USB cable from your computer or the included USB power adapter--the whole package has just been thought through with incredible attention to detail. There&#x27;s even an alternative to the one feature I didn&#x27;t like, which was the charging glass--it looked too big and clunky in photos, which is exactly how it looks when you actually see it. Plus, do we really need to mimic the old, unsanitary practice of standing wet toothbrushes up in a glass to store them? Fortunately, there&#x27;s a much smaller and more elegant charging stand included that can be used instead of the glass. You never see that in photos of this toothbrush, and I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) You don&#x27;t care if the premium price buys you no functional or performance advantage of any type over cheaper models in the Sonicare line. You know you&#x27;re paying for the design, and you&#x27;re fine with it. (Yes, I agree that the DiamondClean brush heads ARE a notable improvement, but they can be used on other, less expensive Sonicare models. See below.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ANSWER IS NO, IF...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You expect a premium price to buy you better functionality and performance over less expensive models. The DiamondClean toothbrush doesn&#x27;t, trust me. Ignore most of the five star review hype that you read about this brush (\\&quot;Cleanest Teeth EVER!\\&quot;) and focus on these facts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) The power handle, which is the heart of any electric toothbrush, is just the FlexCare+ handle with a different skin on it. Specs are identical and--if you go to a store and hold them side by side--you&#x27;ll see that size, shape and weight are the same. Only the elegant, ceramic-like skin on the DiamondClean model, with it&#x27;s hidden lights, is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) While the DiamondClean brushes DO clean somewhat better than older Sonicare brush heads, you can use DiamondClean brushes on some of the older, cheaper Sonicare models like FlexCare. Since the power handles are essentially no different, the cleaning you get will be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It drives you crazy to pay more and actually get less for your money. As others have pointed out, the DiamondClean doesn&#x27;t have the UV sanitizer of the less expensive FlexCare models. And I just saw a Costco special that included two Sonicare power handles, two chargers, two travel cases, plus four brush heads that included two DiamondClean ones... all for $120.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Design just isn&#x27;t that important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value of great design is very much a personal decision. While I decided that the DiamondClean was worth it for me, it might not be for you, depending on your priorities. But either way, I thank you for taking the time to read my review. and I hope you found it \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; in making your purchasing decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATES: The longer you use a product, the better you get to know it. The section below contains more on the pros and cons I&#x27;ve experienced since I wrote the above review after extended use of the DiamondClean:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: 1) The ceramic-like power handle, which I thought might get slippery during usage when wet, actually maintains a nice grip to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: 1) No vent holes in the travel case, made worse by its form-fitting plastic interior. So if you pack the brush head while damp--which often happens when traveling--it stays damp, in a dark, tightly enclosed space--the perfect conditions for promoting bacteria and mold growth. 2) When a second family member recently joined me in using the DiamondClean, I suddenly realized that there&#x27;s no storage for multiple brush heads. (Except in the travel case.) Plus, there&#x27;s no system for color-coding the heads for different family members. Bottom line: you have to store multiple brush heads in a medicine cabinet or elsewhere and somehow color code them yourself.r /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Design just isn&#x27;t that important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value of great design is very much a personal decision.

            <li> The timing of this gift was awesome as it was the perfect stocking stuff for Xmas, I am just not sure if it was not a selfish gift. My wife loves the concept of an electric toothbrush and this one is hands down the best one she has ever owned - result a beautiful smile on a beautiful girl; what more can I ask.</li>
            <li> Received products with the perfect condition. All items received as stated in the product description. Delivery was fast and on schedule. All products work well and fully function.</li>
            <li> I have tried several power brushes. This is definitely the best. Even my dental hygienist noticed the difference.  After using it for a year, I bought one for my husband too. Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush! It&#x27;s been several years since I used an electric toothbrush, probably when I was 12 (and it was a very cheap version), so going to this toothbrush after using a standard toothbrush for most of my life was like a breath of fresh air. My teeth have never felt so clean. I also love all of the accessories that come with it - the travel case (which has a convenient cord for charging by USB or standard outlet) and I like the other two options for charging stands. Electric toothbrushes have come a long way and this toothbrush actually looks sleek and stylish. I am also very pleased with the battery life on it - a charge can last me at least a few weeks. No complaints at all!</li>
            <li> Perfect, it takes a little getting accustomed to but after a week you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Very good investment in my teeth!</li>
            <li> great tooth brush, really like mine!!!</li>
            <li> Use this daily along with the wife and we both love how well of a job this cleans our teeth compared to a conventional tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Ive had mine for over a year now, absolutely love it! No problems so far, working just as new. Brush heads must be changed out every 2-3 months. I have noticed my teeth significantly healthier and whiter.</li>
            <li> I like it, however it does weird things. For example, I don&#x27;t have to push the button to turn it on, merely push the brush head back. Who cares, right? Except when I&#x27;m brushing it forces the brush to cycle for seven minutes, when I&#x27;m not paying attention because I&#x27;m doing ten things at once in the shower because I&#x27;m hungover. And it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m taking my teeth to the batting cages... it doesn&#x27;t take much. It&#x27;s an annoyance for basically the most advanced consumer toothbrush in the history of the planet of Earth.</li>
            <li> Love the tooth brush and I can see the difference between the other brand</li>
            <li> pricey but well worth it</li>
            <li> Amazing tool. Been using this for almost a year now and by dentist and dental hygienist have said it&#x27;s made a huge difference in keeping my teeth and gum clean. Makes brushing simple.&lt;br /&gt;Quick tip: don&#x27;t put tooth paste on this brush since the vibration will just shake the paste off. Instead, use a regular brush to spread tooth paste around your mouth/teeth then use this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Watch the YouTube video by Philips on how to use it.</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference to how smooth and clean my teeth feel</li>
            <li> I purchased the Diamond Clean toothbrush through Amazon prime. Having purchased for more than 100 items through Amazon Prime, I would say that this is the only one that is not up to the standards of Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the product is for Dental Professional Trial so it&#x27;s not intended for resale. It might be good to check whether the product that you purchase will be under warranty. Second, it doesn&#x27;t have the charger glass as shown in the pictures. You may want to consider these points if you want to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides these points, the other reviews about the product quality is very accurate. This product is Philips&#x27; flagship model so the rest is just the personal preference between Oral-B and Philips.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a disaster:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You can&#x27;t set the mode on the toothbrush. It&#x27;s a complete design failure. The toothbrush has five modes. The \\&quot;on\\&quot; button immediately starts the toothbrush and then you press it repeatedly to cycle through the modes. You have to look at the handle of the toothbrush to see what mode you&#x27;re in. Fine, but you need to put the toothpaste on the toothbrush and put it in your mouth before you start using it. If it&#x27;s in your mouth and ready to use, you CANNOT look at the handle to see what mode you are in. So, it isn&#x27;t possible to set it correctly to the brushing mode that you want when you are ready to start brushing. It&#x27;s the worst product design I&#x27;ve ever seen. The only solution is to count the number of times you press the button while the toothbrush is in your mouth and hope that you guessed right. Incredibly stupid design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The toothbrush head does not attach securely. The toothbrush head vibrates itself off of the handle--it&#x27;s moving at 33,000 vibrations per second and does not lock into place. The manual shows that toothbrush head attaching with a loud \\&quot;click\\&quot; but the manual is generic and not relevant to this model. The toothbrush head does not \\&quot;click\\&quot; into place. It just smushes on and then wiggles off while you use the toothbrush. I tried with both of the toothbrush heads that come with the toothbrush and neither of them attaches securely. Another complete design failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The manual gives incorrect information about the brushing modes. There is supposed to be a beep to indicate moving the brush from one section of your mouth to another. There is no beep: the brush just pauses briefly which is very confusing--it seems as if you&#x27;ve accidentally turned off the brush for a second. Without the beep you can&#x27;t tell if you turned it off by accident or that&#x27;s the signal to move the brush to another part of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The toothbrush is supposed to signal three times to move to another part of your mouth: it signals 6 times! This makes no sense. The manual clearly states that the brushing cycles are divided into four parts (one for each quarter of your mouth). If it is signalling me to move the brush six times, it is obviously not guiding me through brushing four sections of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very very disappointed. This is one of the most badly designed things I&#x27;ve ever purchased.t of your mouth: it signals 6 times! This makes no sense.

This is one of the most badly designed things I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. The last one we purchased lasted for 3 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for 7 years now and DiamondClean is the latest in the family of rechargeable electric toothbrush. So far, it feels great, especially the brush head. My main issue with Sonicare toothbrushes are their batteries. Eventually the batteries will not charge anymore and the toothbrush will randomly start and won&#x27;t be turned off. There is nothing that you can do except to buy a new one. This usually happens after 1.5-2 years of usage. My other complaint is that the color/paint (replacement indicator) on the brush head vanishes way faster than the advertised time of 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the new design for the DiamondClean, I don&#x27;t like the cup charger, because it collects water after using the toothbrush. I&#x27;ve always had problems with the bottom of the toothbrush yellowing from water dripping from the top after usage.</li>
            <li> I love the DiamondClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.  It is my first Sonicare, and I decided to splurge.  You get a great cleaning with this toothbrush.  The travel pouch is a nice accessory .  I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I want to quantify my 3 star review of the Sonicare by saying I love this toothbrush and the sonicare brand of toothbrushes.  Having used these for years, I can say they are the best toothbrushes going, however, my one complaint is that you cant replace the battery after it dies.  Come on Philips, get with the program and make these things were you can change out the batteries, we fill up the landfills enough with stuff like this and that goes for your Razors too.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews before mine and decided to pull the trigger on this amazing tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that it is amazing! I actually cycle through all of the settings and when I set the brush down, my teeth are cleaner than they have EVER been. I am very happy I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Seems much better than my old HealthyWhite (as far as brushes per minute), but I definitely think the included cup is weird and could get gross very fast.</li>
            <li> Brushes very well, all the setting are different and useful, if I had a choice I would make the head a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent &amp; enjoyed using it...&lt;br /&gt;but beware the mail-rebate is a sham, have sent across the form twice no response even after 8 - 10 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 12 weeks -&lt;br /&gt;Even after several follow-up around 4 times haven&#x27;t received the rebate.{don&#x27;t have any point of contact apart from sending across mails]</li>
            <li> We have used Sonicare electric toothbrushes for years. This one is the best yet. It works beautifully, adjusting from one speed to the next easily if needed with a perfect timer. It feels wonderful in the hand, making brushing longer a pleasure. We are thrilled with the design. It is a fabulous visual as well as ergonomic design which makes looking at it and using it a pleasure. The case is gorgeous. Being able to just set the toothbrush in the glass rather than fuss with getting it on a peg is the greatest! We have two and both are working perfectly. Hats off to Phillips for excellent industrial design.</li>
            <li> Lets start from the external to the internal characteristics of the brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sonicare Diamondclean looks awesome in appearance, really, the best looking toothbrush out there.&lt;br /&gt;Its sleek and nice in touch, and with the power button changing modes it is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed though that the headbrush does not stick completely to the base toothbrush when I put it on. It makes the click sound, its secure, but its doesnt really stick there. there is some small space between the brush and the head.&lt;br /&gt;I spoke to philips support agent about that and they said that this is the way it works, so if it happens to yours, do not worry. there is indeed a gap between the tooothbrush base and head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internal characteristics: the sonicare diamondclean is fantastic while brushing the teeth, by the time you finish your brushing, you feel and see your teeth being so clean and nice that you cannot believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the white mode, which is 2minutes of normal cleaning and 30seconds of polishing the front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;However, unfortunately there is no indication that your 2 minutes passed and you are not on the last 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;That is a small problem there, so I dont know how anyone can know when he is on the last 30seconds,and he is supposed to polish the front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, I recommend it!! Its much nicer than the Oral B, and really powerful.</li>
            <li> BEST TOOTHBRUSH EVER, IF YOU CAN AFFORD TO BUY THIS TOOTHBRUSH DO IT!! YOU WONT REGRET IT&lt;br /&gt;NOTICED A BIG DIFFERENCE WITHIN A WEEK</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B that stopped working after almost 8 years of use and my hygenist suggested I try the Sonicare. After reading all the Sonicare reviews, I decided on the DiamondClean.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a week and so far, I really do like it. This brush is much more powerful than my old toothbrush. I can tell a big difference in how clean my teeth are after using this one vs. the Oral B.  If you want a powerful electric toothbrush with all the \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot;, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I&#x27;ve had this for a week and it definitely does more than brushing alone, I just love this! It definitely looks like it could have been made by Apple, it looks very cool. I was surprised that the charging glass really works, and the case is cool too. I charged it for 24 hours before using it for about a week. I didn&#x27;t notice any battery drain but used the charging glass anyway. It seems possible that it may indeed last the nearly 3 weeks as advertised. I&#x27;m pretty sure my teeth are whiter after using this as well.</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> this Product is amazing. works 10 times better than other electric TB.</li>
            <li> excellent product, very useful for my teeth</li>
            <li> While I still have quite a bit of cynicism about such toothbrushes, this brush seems to have been satisfactory so far. I have been using this toothbrush for about 2 months now and I can say there is at least 50% less plaque deposition near my front teeths (performs better in front of those teeths than rear). However I have no clue how is it performing for plaque between the molars, which my dentist will tell during my next visit. I am satisfied with the toothbrush, but at $175 price point, I wouldn&#x27;t call it a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Nov 26, 2012 :-&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this brush and it is working great. My teeth are far cleaner and whiter and I wouldn&#x27;t exchange it for anything else.</li>
            <li> It is amazing!! Everytime I brush my teeth, they feel dentist clean!!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush as an upgrade to my FlexCare and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  While many have complained about the one button design, I would respectfully recommend reading the manual.  The brush was designed with simplicity in mind.  Eliminating the second button is a feature, not a downgrade.  Here&#x27;s how it works:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Press power/mode button and scroll through menu to find desired mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2). Press power/mode again to power off.  You have 30 seconds to place toothpaste on brush before mode is canceled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3). Place brush in mouth, then power back on . . .brush will run for full time of mode setting, then power off automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case was designed to charge the brush, so a form fitting interior was necessary in order for the handle to make proper charging contact.  Admittedly, it would be nice to have the ability to place the cap over the brush head, however, doing so in the form would prevent ample air circulation, causing bacteria growth.  My work around is to place the cap in the second brush compartment and put the cap back on when I arrive at my destination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lack of storage for the charging cord, is that really necessary?  Neither my iPad or iPhone have on board storage capability and I travel just fine with both.  I keep the cords for all three in a pocket in my carry on flight bag.  The charger cord is always there, in it&#x27;s pocket when needed.  On board charger capability would have required a larger case, giving reviewers one more complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, a UV Sanitizer would be perfect, and perhaps they&#x27;ll bring back the standalone sanitizer that was once available.  I kept my Flexcare + sanitizer and use the charger side to charge my AirFloss.  However, i managed to live most of my life without a sanitizer but if the lack of one would be a deal breaker . . .there&#x27;s still the option of choosing the FlexCare +.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When put into perspective, this unit&#x27;s design was fully tested and there&#x27;s a logical reason for every feature.  I sincerely couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.here&#x27;s a logical reason for every feature.  I sincerely couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Perfect</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is unbelievable, feels like the dentist cleaned my teeth every morning</li>
            <li> After using an electric brush for years the experience of the new Phillips Sonicare was a revelation. The contrast between my trusty old Oral B and my bright and shiny, streamlined Sonicare is the difference between a Model-T and  Ferrari. Try it. You&#x27;ll be amazed by this marvelous piece of technology.</li>
            <li> The reviews here do a great job of highlighting the finer points of this electric brush as well as comparing it to other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have appreciated a visual context to the comments and so I&#x27;ve created this brief video to allow those in the future this luxury:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Inability to change the settings without turning it on is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;The handle isn&#x27;t the most helpful for a solid grip.&lt;br /&gt;The cost of replacing heads can add up.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product initially.  This is my first kind, so I cannot compare with others, but all I can say is it is worth every penny.  No more complain from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot for a living and it occurred to me that much of the time I was using a regular toothbrush, while my trusty electric stayed at home, not being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I saw this bad boy in the store and asked for it for Christmas.  Turns out Santa was very generous this year and under the tree arrived this incredibly expensive and fully featured electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging mechanism is super cool.  It looks like a glass tumbler, yet through the magic of electromagnetic induction it charges the toothbrush just by putting it in the glass tumbler.  When traveling there is a little hard sided case that has the ability to charge the toothbrush also.  Just plug a USB cord into the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it is this travel case that ultimately cost this product a gold star.  While the brush itself may be an excellent design, the travel case requires that the brush head be removed from the base, and worse the head protector must be removed from the head before you put it in the box.  In fact there is no actual space for the head cover at all.  So you end up putting that in a separate plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one move this negates so much of the practicality of the travel case, which was one of the primary reasons for my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside the manufacturer claims that the brush can go three weeks without charging, so I don&#x27;t actually need to charge the brush on my trips.  But it is a pity that the that travel case is so useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a brush, it&#x27;s fantastic.  Other than the snafu with the travel case, it does a fantastic job.  Multiple modes, and a really clean feeling.  It&#x27;s an expensive brush, but what price do you put on the health of your teeth?</li>
            <li> After a year and half, it&#x27;s kind of broken. The vibration comes and goes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever owned or used one of these then you already know the basics of how this kind of toothbrush works and the Diamondclean is no different.  I&#x27;m a fan of Sonicare and purchased this one to replace one that I accidentally damaged.  The only negative I can say about this model is that the smooth plastic body is a bit tough to hang on to.  My previous Sonicare had rubber around most of the body and that made for a secure grip. The Diamondclean has a very smooth body and it seems to slip and slide around in my hand. This is a great toothbrush but it works the same as the lower models.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have been using sonicares for the past 9 years, and my teeth have never been in better shape. However when deciding which sonicare to buy, you have to keep several things in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Essence: good basic brush, not as many strokes per minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Flexcare/ + : Good advanced brush, with lift most stains with pro results brush, give an awesome clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3: Diamondclean: ok, slightly more advanced, charging glass only looks cool but is hard to keep clean with water stains etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of diamondclean: much, much less susceptible to mold and other grime that forms between the handle and brush head of EVERY OTHER MODEL! yes there is no way to fix it, the gap will get toothpaste in it, and bacteria will grow on that sugar. It will be a biofilm that will get daily nutrition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of Sonicare: i can never go back to regular brushes. my teeth will never feel as clean with manual brushes. When i forget my sonicare during travel, i have lot regretful travels. yes not an exaggeration, but a fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons of Sonicare: except for diamondclean, other brushes are susceptible to stuff growing at the joint where head meets handle. The \\&quot;other\\&quot; modes are barely ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons of diamondclean: The travel case is very unintuitive when it comes to storing wet brushes. How do you vent it to ensure bristles dry?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strive to write short, to the point reviews. if you have questions, please comment, i will be happy to answer.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had two of these DiamondClean toothbrushes and previously, two of the previous FlexCare models.  They perform very well and are good/better than the previous Oral-B models.    But I am not at all pleased with Sonicare reliability.  Within 2.5 years of owning two of these DiamondClean toothbrushes, I&#x27;ve had 3 just stop turning on.  The first two failed this way after about a year and within 1-2 weeks of each other.  Philips customer service was great and after confirming it wasn&#x27;t just a charging issue, replaced both due to the 2-year warranty.  But one of those replacements just failed and because it&#x27;s out of warranty, I&#x27;m stuck buying another one.  I like the Sonicares and think they&#x27;re the best available, but I&#x27;m not thrilled about spending $200 every 2-3 years for an electric toothbrush.  I hope that they&#x27;ve figured out the kinks over time and my new one will be more reliable.    BTW, I use an older FlexCare for travel (better battery life) and it failed about the same way, but at least not until many years after the warranty expired. I still keep going back to Sonicare...</li>
            <li> The great thing is it stays charged for weeks!  Really does a better cleaning that you&#x27;d pay for and receive at the Dentist office, worth the price.</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush. it definitely makes my teeth feel cleaner. as well, my dental hygienist showed me how to use it properly,&lt;br /&gt;which is let it do the work for you (at a 45 degree angle)  once it is in place.working that way around your mouth. she strongly suggests&lt;br /&gt;adhering to the 30 seconds in each quadrant. the toothbrush and holder are both nicely designed. i debated whether to spend the $$ but i am glad i did.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Worth the money, you&#x27;ll feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The motor has a tendency to change gears or just sound awful.  Not consistent.  Get&#x27;s your teeth clean tho.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old Oral B electric brush died and for 6 months I used the hand brush. At a teeth cleaning the hygienist asked me when I stopped using an electric brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent toothbrush recommended by my dentist. I like the various modes: Clean - Whiten - Polish - Gums. My dentist gave me a little tip on cleaning the brush: every few months, put in the dishwasher to sanitize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each use, my mouth feels like I just left the dentist after a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> my favorite electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This is my 1st Sonicare tooth brush and I can defiantly say that I should have got one years ago. This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this toothbrush I felt like I had just been to the dentist for a cleaning.  It cleans EVERYTHING!  I also feel like my smile is whiter!  The fact that you can use the travel case and just plug it into the wall to charge is also a great bonus!&lt;br /&gt;Worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying an electric toothbrush for the first time. Everything sounded great about this one. The five modes sounded like a great idea. It is however it&#x27;s implementation is flawed. How do you actually set the mode you want and get toothpaste on the darn thing?     You can apply paste, then stick it in your mouth and turn it on. That works fine but what if you want the fourth mode? By the time you press the button three more times to get to that mode, the paste is gone! I suppose you can put it in your mouth then press the button several times but then what&#x27;s the point in having the nice display.    When you push the power button it immediately starts in the first mode. Try putting paste on it and selecting a different mode. It will liquefy the paste and fling it off the brush. There either needs to be a delay or a 2nd button. The delay would stall the onset of power for 2 or 3 seconds to give you enough time to stick the brush in your mouth before turning it on. The 2nd button would select the mode and the first button would turn it on. Either way would solve the problem. Do the designers actually use their own creations? It&#x27;s a pretty nice brush otherwise.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is shockingly well designed. I say this as someone who worships at the altar of Apple (and Porsche).   If customer delight is what you seek, and you need a new electric toothbrush.....you will not be disappointed. Period. Starting with the surprisingly heavy package that includes a heavy glass tumbler for the unit to sit in, through which it recharges through induction (there are several other charging options included).   The unit itself is stunning. Just a pure white and very light unit, until you turn it on and status information glows through. The fitted travel case is a trip in itself: mini USB connector to charge through your computer (or USB charger) and a magnetic closure. But since the toothbrush uses a Lithium Ion battery (good for three weeks) it is just for safety.   I thought Apple had a near monopoly on clever, aesthetic, practical and whimsical electronics design. But some rogue design group at Philips is emulating 1 Infinite Loop in the electric toothbrush department!  PS: my dental hygienist says Sonicare toothbrushes are a bit better than Oral-B. Certainly more delicate and logically as or more efficacious due to the very soft bristles and the very high frequency it oscillates at. But they got me 100% with the design!  PPS: I bought one for myself yesterday, for my wife today.</li>
            <li> The handle is smooth and fits so nicely into your hands that you simply want to hold it. The display lights up with clean, white lights. It is incredibly easy to use, and leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed. With three great-looking, streamlined ways of storing your DiamondClean (case, glass, or stand), what&#x27;s not to love? The case is sturdy with magnetic closure. The charging glass is simple enough to fit into any bathroom setting. Brushing your teeth is a two-time daily must, but now, you&#x27;ll both love and enjoy it!  I don&#x27;t have any real problems with having to change the mode while brushing. It&#x27;s a simple matter of counting. I normally stay between \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;White\\&quot;, anyways. Not to mention, it&#x27;s easy to see considering how long the handle is?  My only complaint is that I wish the carrying case allowed you to store the brush heads with the plastic cover. Other than that--very pleased with this unit.</li>
            <li> LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE it. The travel case has a USB port - brilliant! The toothbrush itself works wonderfully and has numerous settings.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty expensive toothbrush.  The instructions were not real clear.  I had some questions that I just worked out through trial and error.  It says it holds its charge for 3 weeks, but I have had to recharge weekly.</li>
            <li> This item has changed my life.  Best toothbrush that I have ever used.  My mouth is changed forever.  I actually look forward to brushing my teeth because of how wonderful my teeth feel when finished.  Fantastic travel package too for those who travel.  Consider no other toothbrush.  THIS IS THE ONE.</li>
            <li> I withhold one star because the instructions need help.  Luckily the stuff is simple enough... But I still cant generate that allegedly required click upon insertion of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I got this last April 2012. and I must say it&#x27;s what tooth brushes ought to be, reminds me of Eve vs Wall-E. Anyway I am going to make this very short and to the point. if you are an &amp;#34;Executive summary&amp;#34; kind of person:&lt;br /&gt;1. powerful to clean the teeth and gentle in the same time,&lt;br /&gt;2. different brushes to suit different sizes! (depending on your purchase they might be included, if not get them on amazon)&lt;br /&gt;3. different modes for different needs.&lt;br /&gt;4. super quiet compared with other electric brushes.&lt;br /&gt;5. Long lasting charge (I took it to travel for 10 days, brushing morning and evening and it still had charge)&lt;br /&gt;6. easily rechargeable through either the main unit (which is no touch charging by the way) or the travel pack which can be hooked up to a laptop usb outlet!!! isn&#x27;t that awesome?&lt;br /&gt;7. feels great in your hand and the vibrations on your teeth,&lt;br /&gt;8. cleans like no other tooth brush does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I am not forgetting anything,&lt;br /&gt;it is a bit pricy, but if you take into consideration the &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; visits to the dentist it is a good investment towards your oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> Our dental hygienist recommended this toothbrush to my husband and I. Not only did she use and love it, but we discovered that pretty much everyone at our dentist&#x27;s office had switched from any/all other electric toothbrushes to this one. After only the first use, I understood why they had all switched. Having used other spin-brush type electric toothbrushes for nearly 20 years, I was shocked by how much cleaner my teeth felt with the sonic diamond clean. It was literally like a &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; level of clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a fairly expensive option compared to many of the other electric toothbrushes available, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. If you dread going to the dentist, do yourself a favor and get this toothbrush. Having cleaner, healthier teeth and gums will make your visits far less painful both to your mouth and to your wallet.</li>
            <li> this is a good product, maybe just a tad expensive but cool productl and i like this product and recommend</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush  twice a day for three weeks. My teeth are noticeably whiter and they feel as smooth as after a professional cleaning. I agree with commentator who mentioned that you must select the cycle before putting dentifrice on the brush. Failure to heed that advice lead to speckles of toothpaste on my glasses, clothes, mirror, cat.... I also purchased the air flosser. It does a great job too, once I figured out how to use it without looking into the mirror. Now I don&#x27;t have to shine the mirror twice a day. Besides clean teeth and breath I have a spotless bathroom too. Seriously consider your fellow bathroom users while you are getting used to the brush and flosser. Both are well worth the money. The Amazon price was lower than the Phillips website for both products.</li>
            <li> slick design, but  ditto to previous  reviews. it is quite awkward in switching settings when it on. i have to look in the mirror to see the setting.  the chargers are bulky and their style adds nothing to the convenience or  advantage.  it much less convenient and less advantage than the cheaper models. i do like the chrome on the body and the top of it as opposed to the plastic on prior models.  i can keep the machine  much cleaner. it does clean my clear very but i am using the diamond heads now. i used the diamond heads on my daughter&#x27;s prior machine and it did just a well.  if you shop at costco you can get two machines with diamond heads and a uv cleaner charger and a traveling charger for much less.</li>
            <li> I hated brushing my teeth and now with this toothbrush I&#x27;m addicted to it.  This thing will quickly make you realize how bad a regular toothbrush actually cleans your teeth.  It feels like I went to the dentist every time I use this thing, if I haven&#x27;t already convinced you I highly recommend this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The glass dock is awesome, charges the thing through the glass however you put the toothbrush in the glass.  The carrying case is very nice with a magnetic close, it also acts like a dock by having the option to charge the toothbrush while it sits inside the case.  The sonic vibration is intense and takes a couple days to get used to but really does a great job vibrating the plaque off.</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on some reviews I saw (not on Amazon) that rated it very highly AND lauded the Amazon price, which was the best I found.  The product performs great, getting that &amp;#34;like the dentist&#x27;s cleaning&amp;#34; feel I would not have believed was possible before trying the product.  I really like the design and it is easy to handle and operate.  Batter life a advertised--about to go a few weeks between charges.  The compact head seems the right size, and so far everything is holding up great.  Registering the product allowed me to get a discount on some of the replacement heads, which was a better price for those than offered at Amazon or other sites/stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 4 various sonicare models prior to purchasing the diamondclean model. Bought mine November of 2011 and in January I notice the sonic vibrations/pulsing motion was not as powerful.  As days went by the pulsing action got weaker and weaker.  I called in sonicare and they were happy to give me a replacement body.  What was neat was it came with a new brush head also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it about another 3 months the pulsing action had gotten weak again.  I&#x27;ve replaced the head, the body was fully charge but the pulsing action was so weak that it couldn&#x27;t clean my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 5 modes; clean, white, polish, gum care, and sensitive.  Honestly they should just have 2 modes; clean and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paying $180 for a toothbrush that does not work after 3 months is not a good toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy the cheaper elite series that was around $50 and very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 and using this product has whitened my teeth, cleaned them better and gently massaged my gums. I absolutely love this toothbrush and bought one for my special-needs 21 year old son who hates brushing his teeth, He especially likes the gentle gum massage which is an area the dental hygenist recommended he show extra care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. Your teeth, gums and mouth in general will rejoice!</li>
            <li> I have always used the sonicare line, but this one is gives the most superior cleaning I have ever had at home. I am so satisfied that I want to recommend it to everyone. When finished, my teeth feel just as clean as if I had had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  It does a phenomenal job and always leaves my teeth exceptionally clean.  Will buy another one as this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare toothbrush user since 2002. I am very impressed with the cleaning power and multiple modes featured  on the Diamond Clean toothbrush.  It has superior cleaning power and gets between teeth, right where I need it, to tackle those pesky coffee stains.  I&#x27;ve got a dental cleaning appointment in 2 weeks and I already know my hygienist is going to be very pleased! The Sonicare Diamond Clean is definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li> BEST electronic toothbrush, works great!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful toothbrush. I feel like my teeth are really getting clean.</li>
            <li> Its a bit overkill for my needs.  I don&#x27;t use all of the settings...  BUT if you will then get it.</li>
            <li> Sonicare 9332 DiamondClean is a life changer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended I go electrical since I was brushing too hard and was causing my gums to recede, while at the same time not effectively cleaning my teeth.  She claimed frequency of the brush strokes mattered, not power.  So I did some aggressive research and went with the top of the line Sonicare.  I tried OralB before and quit because the brush head rotates and rips your gums more  - OralB is an entirely different technology.  The brush on the Sonicare, on the otherhand, cleans without actually rotating, and thus doesn&#x27;t rip your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this, you will never feel clean going back to manual brushing.  And yes, all the studies are right, you do spend more time cleaning with an electrical, which is counter intuitive, because you are systematically trying to cover every surface of every tooth.  So be prepared for a 5 min brush.  Due to the time commitment, I prefer to use it at night only, and I brush manual in the morning and after dinner since manual is faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who can spend the money should have one of these.  In my opinion, and I am not a dentist, but I believe you actually come out saving money because if you use this product, floss, and use mouth wash, at least 2 times a day, you can certainly reduce the number of times you go for &amp;#34;regular cleaning&amp;#34;.  So rather than pay 100-200 bucks to your dental hygenist every 4-6 months you can now go every 8-12 months.  And I am sure when you do go after 8-12 months, your teeth will show up 2x cleaner than manual brushing and showing up every 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw - very easy to clean and charge.  Reliable technology.</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush with a great travel pack and recharge system, offering several ways to charge the brush. Particularly appreciate how long it will last on a charge. Not sure if I will ever use all the features the toothbrush and charging system offer but have immense respect for a product that has been this thoughtfully designed, both functionally and aesthetically. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase! It&#x27;s well worth the price on the Amazon site, the least expensive way to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I love how well it cleans but... it&#x27;s not worth it for the price. The battery stopped recharging after about 14 months of use, changing modes while brushing is the only way to avoid splatter (and then you have to guess which mode you are on because you can&#x27;t see the light), and the brush heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> My last Sonicare did a great job until the internal charging circuit finally failed.  This one is even better.  The order process via Amazon was quick, easy, and reliable as always.</li>
            <li> My dentist continuously recommended the Sonicare.  Since I have braces I felt it was time.  I reviewed each available and this one stood out to me.  Yes it was more expensive than most of them.  But I&#x27;m very happy with my choice.  It comes with a handy travel case.  The at home charger is a class cup that doesn&#x27;t need mounting anywhere.  The quadrant buzzer lets you know when it&#x27;s time to move on.  I love the diff options on the brush.  When my mouth is a bit irritated from the braces, I have the option of using sensitive.  It came with 2 diff size brush heads.  This allows me to share the toothbrush with &amp;#34;Mr.&amp;#34;  We are both very happy with the choice/purchase.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this toothbrush I felt like I was walking out of the dentists office. My teeth felt so clean. Thats how it is everytime with the Sonicare toothbrush. With most standard toothbrushes you just generally brush your teeth but with the timed sequences that the Sonicare uses each quadrant gets 30 seconds and makes your mouth much cleaner. I travel for a living so the travel case that charges the toothbrush is great if you are on the go a lot. Also the charger cup is really convenient as well for those at home time.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my dentist recommended I switch to the Sonicare line of products. I had never used an electric toothbrush before so the whole experience was new to me. This toothbrush has been wonderful, it is hard to quantify whether or not this brush (or any electric toothbrush) actually &amp;#34;removes more plaque&amp;#34; but I can say I notice a clean feeling every time I brush my teeth. My dentist has also noticed which makes the purchase worth it to me. Battery life is exceptional, I travel for work and usually go weeks in between charges. The charging glass is pretty neat, as others have said there are some features that I do not use (usb charging) but it is cool to know I have it if I do in fact ever need to use it. If you are new to the whole electric toothbrush scene as I was, give this a try and I can promise you will see a difference.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever! Cleanings at the dentist are over before they begin.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush, actually does what it promises.  Use it and whiter teeth will come!</li>
            <li> I bought this product July 2013. It is now dead and won&#x27;t work. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> purchased for a gift, the person very happy with it</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter and she loves it.  I tried it after my daughter raved about it and can attest it is an excellent toothbrush.  Really makes your teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Such toothbrush. Much clean.</li>
            <li> very nice philips sonicare toothbrush. you can feel the clean, as if you went to the doctor for cleaning session.</li>
            <li> I got it to my wife as a Xmax gift, however it arrived a worng item with in ... very upsad and need to get a replasement asap..</li>
            <li> Years ago, my periodontist recommended the Sonicare. Products eventually finish their useful life, and I am now using the Sonicare DiamondClean brush. Without telling either my regular dentist or my periodontist, I asked them how I was doing. They both said \\&quot;very good.\\&quot; I had long had periodontitis that eventually resulted in the \\&quot;flap procedure.\\&quot; Three weeks ago, my regular dentist volunteered that my gums were in tip-top shape. So, if you are wondering whether this technology is just hi-tech hype, I can tell you that it works and it is well worth the price. I have gone from 4 visits per year to 3. That basically pays for the Sonicare in one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product arrived just in time for Christmas as my older unit was on its last legs. I was pleased that the old brush heads that I knew Santa would put in my stocking would fit the new handle. The handle is elegant and avoids the criticisms I had for my earlier model. The single button is all you need. I especially like the basic charging stand. The glass that is provided is cool, but I&#x27;ll be using the simple base charger. To me, it takes up less space and fits into a corner better. The travel case is very nice, but it doesn&#x27;t include storage space for the charger. When I travel, I want to take the charger even if I think I will not need it. That said, the travel case is a charger that is USB compatible. So all you need is the short USB connecting cable (provided) and your laptop to charge the brush if you happen to run low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing is it truly will help your gum health. It&#x27;s also cool.</li>
            <li> It took a while to get use to how strong it was but I have been using it about three weeks and I love it. My teeth feel clean and I believe I can tell they are not as stained. I especially like the timer that is on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend this much money on an electric toothbrush but having used it for a couple of months now I can happily say it&#x27;s been a worth while investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I did not give it 5 stars:&lt;br /&gt;It has a super soft brushing action, ideal for sensitive gums or gum recession.&lt;br /&gt;USB charging, great for car camping, travelling, charge with your laptop etc..&lt;br /&gt;Now this one is smart, it&#x27;ll warm me after I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth with a gentle vibration and a light to say it needs charging.  No more being caught out with a flat toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I dislike&lt;br /&gt;USB charging usually means no bulky power leads or transformers, however in this case you have to insert the toothbrush base into a case which is unnecessarily bulky, so you still have considerable bulk to pack into your wash bag, having said that, it will easily last 2 weeks of brushing on a full charge so you may not need to take the USB case, just bear in mind that the battery capacity will decrease over time.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the toothbrush base is smooth, it&#x27;s not slipped out of my hands, but I would have liked a little grip for reassurance.</li>
            <li> What a huge improvement from the older models... this product is a design marvel withthe wireless charging and the quality of the product. Works flawlessly as expected. last model last me 10 years and I&#x27;m sure this one will last at least 10 years I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I bought the Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush.  Its the first electronic toothbrush for me so I have nothing to compare it to other than my previous regular brush.  It certainly cleans well and leaves teeth feeling clean and smooth.  I wonder about it&#x27;s ability to clean between teeth as the bristles seem short.  Also, its pretty powerful so I do not force it since the last thing you want to do is weaken or remove enamel.  With some folks commenting about shortness of toothbrush life, I wonder if they are pressing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;I am taking a star away because of the cost.  Competition may force Sonicare to reduce its price on this one.</li>
            <li> This thing not only has style but it cleans your teeth like a hygienist.  This was my first electric toothbrush so I can&#x27;t say how it compares to other electric brushes but I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This makes your teeth feel so good and clean, they feel like you have just come from the dentist.  I don&#x27;t know how I went this long without an electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but it gives you a cleaning that is simply awesome. Your teeth get whiter over time, it helps with plaque and limits tartar, and overll dental / oral health is promoted. It is not for the poor, I guess, but if you can afford a luxury, I recommend it. It is also very nicely designed and the appearance is clean &amp; modern.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase the DiamondClean because of several negative reviews. However, this is simply the best toothbrush I have ever used. The single button design is a non-issue, and easy to use despite what some have said.  The toothbrush and its case have a $150 &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; to it - very high quality materials with a sleek look. I agree with other reviewers that the DiamondClean is what Apple might design if they were in the toothbrush business.  The battery is as advertised and last many weeks. Overall, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I switched from a regular tooth brush. I used the Sonicare for a few days now. I love it. It tickles at first, but my teeth really do feel cleaner all the time now. I can tell.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was time to retire my older e/pre-e series brush.  I cant rave enough about it.  Works great and the sleek design is awesome!  I thought that the cup charger would be horrible because I had the stand before that left things nice and neat, but I have to say that I like it now after a few months of everyday use.  I&#x27;ve also taken it in the travel pack which I also thought would be bulky but I like that it keeps the thing protected in a suitcase separate from your toiletry kit.  I would strongly recommend the diamond clean for either an upgrade or first timer, you will not find better!  Only negative is that brush heads are expensive, but...you only have one set of teeth! take care of them!</li>
            <li> it is worth the money, best i ever used..nice design and material is top notch..i would recommend this to anyone..</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had and comes with great travel case. Quality is very good. Downfall, price is steep. If you have extra cash go head and pick this up, it&#x27;s worth it, but it&#x27;s not an impulse buy.</li>
            <li> This one is just gorgeous! My mom likes it so much. Very convenient to charge in the glass cup and box.</li>
            <li> like some of the others, my very expensive tooth brush is losing its vibration ability. not sure what Sonicare has changed from my previous model but this one seems to be causing problems. at nearly $200 I would not expect a need to scrimp on quality of the internal components. my attachment point for the brush head is moving up and down as if something has broken inside that needs to be attached to have the intensity as was there when new. very disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> I have used their earlier version for years and it finally gave up the ghost after more than 5 years.  I hope this lasts as long and serves me as well.</li>
            <li> It is the BEST toothbrush ever! The brush heads get between teeth - and you can feel the clean. It is heard to explain the technology - but in action, you just position the brush along the gum line and the bristles insert themselves between teeth. AMAZING! Plus, the charge lasts at least a week - perhaps more. BEST EVER!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this toothbrush to anyone in search of the absolute best. I thought my worn out elite was good until I received my diamondclean. Don&#x27;t look any further just buy it..</li>
            <li> I have owned a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for as long as they have been available.  This is version #3 for me.  I love the multiple settings.  My teeth and gums have never felt better.</li>
            <li> Far and above the best electric toothbrush we have ever used.  Well built and extremely effective.  I have had Brauns and there is no comparison.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a great brand and really stands behind their products.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to stand behind because the products really work.  They clean so well I feel as if I have just left the dentists office.&lt;br /&gt;Nice glass cup to store in is cool to.&lt;br /&gt;Can charge with usb port too if traveling!</li>
            <li> I was so worried about regretting this purchase but after a few years, I still feel confident about this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept on with sonicare brushes when my dentist was telling me how good of a job I was doing keeping my braces clean (ugh that was SO long ago!) and honestly I wasn&#x27;t putting in all that much effort!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the options you have with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;It could be handy to charge on your computer but I haven&#x27;t used that function once so that&#x27;s a give or take thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the storage box, it&#x27;s easy to change the heads and nice to have a place to put them when you but them.&lt;br /&gt;It does suck to pay 200 bucks for something you&#x27;ll still be paying for b/c of the replacement heads - something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t travel with the brush because I&#x27;m afraid of leaving it or losing it, this is only because of the brush price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cup doesn&#x27;t always charge right, so you have to make sure that it&#x27;s charging.&lt;br /&gt;The charger on it&#x27;s own (without the cup) make me feel like the brush will topple over...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cup really isn&#x27;t a double use either which I think was the idea behind it?&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t put water in here to rinse my mouth since it&#x27;s basically a dust and toothbrush butt holder xD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would buy this again and in black next time!</li>
            <li> Dropping it into the glass for charging is all this unit is about.  Other than that, they did a horrible job on software.  Software for a toothbrush?  You bet - terrible software programming.  It was performed by some engineer who probably never brushes his teeth anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs half-speed for 2 weeks, which you can turn off (and go to full speed).  But then half speed comes back.  Then you can&#x27;t shut off the brush by pushing the button - it just changes modes.  The only way to shut it off is to slop toothpaste all over the bathroom and put it back in it&#x27;s glass.  Then it&#x27;ll turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No way to update software.  No way to make materials stronger - again the Chinese have an insatiable hunger for anything plastic.  This unit should have been ceramic or even metal.  But cheap plastic from top to bottom?  Wait till you drop it on the tile floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the brush pops out from time to time, and since you can&#x27;t shut it off once it&#x27;s running you&#x27;ll have to wait 2 minutes till it shuts itself off, or do the in-the-glass thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also pauses every 30 seconds weather you like it or not - no software choices to turn yet another annoying feature off.  My old one used to have a setting for that, but not the new modern one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carrying case is stupid - brush just sits in there all day and grows bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a 1, but I&#x27;ll give it like 1/2 additional star for the glass/charging thing.  At least it is REAL glass and not plastic - so credit where credit is due.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just get one of the original models - they work great.  Had my first one for more than 3 years before it finally gave up.  This one won&#x27;t last much past July 4th IMHO</li>
            <li> I just upgraded from an OralB SonicCare, and this definitely gets deeper and leaves my teeth cleaner, especially the &amp;#34;Polish&amp;#34; cycle.  After every use it feels like I just came from a cleaning at the dentist.  I use &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; mode once or twice a week to get a little deeper, but otherwise stick with &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.  I did have some gum sensitivity at the beginning, but that went away.  The charging case was fun to use on a recent vacation - it worked just fine and looked good doing it.  It is approaching 3 months, and the indicator bristles on the brush head are definitely signaling that it is time to purchase some overpriced brush heads.  Supposedly my dental health is worth it.</li>
            <li> Dropped it ONCE and it broke.  Yes, it brushes teeth very well.  But you need to think about whether you feel comfortable spending $150 for a new one every year or two because that is the reality of ownership.  Not to mention the price of replacing brushes is  rather painful.  My first Sonicare toothbrush, bought years ago, was designed to last, with rubber on the housing to absorb the shock of a fall.  It  did, in fact, fall to the tiled floor on a number of occasions without causing damage.  Companies like Philips make me sick when they subsequently &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; the design, reengineering their products to fail regularly.  Consumers lose: more money for them.  Hopefully consumers will learn their lesson some day soon and close their pocketbooks to these companies.  Only then will they (the companies) learn.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.. I don&#x27;t think its waterproof?? I&#x27;ve used it for a year and it completely broke down. First the lights started to fade away so I would have to guess which settings it was on, and recently it would turn on/off randomly by itself. It finally broke and wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all except the bottom light in the settings on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush I&#x27;ve ever used! My teeth feel like I just came from a cleaning at the dentist. Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my husband.  I had tried to get him to try a battery operated toothbrush before, but he would not.&lt;br /&gt;NHow he loves the Phillips Sonicare Diamond Clean Rechargeable Electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this electric toothbrush! I have had many electric brushes, but this one is absolutely the best. I have sensitive teeth and this works wonderfully without making my teeth feel more sensitive. I also love that this brush does such a wonderful job of removing plaque, I rarely have to use my plaque scraper now. Great product, so worth the money!</li>
            <li> Everytime I brush my teeth, they feel like they do when I&#x27;ve gone to the dentist for a teeth-cleaning.  I&#x27;ve had several generations of electric toothbrushes.  This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare died, and for 3 weeks (before I got this one), I went back to a manual toothbrush. I happened to have a regular dental cleaning scheduled (by coincidence) near the end of the 3 weeks, and it took my hygienist at least twice as long as she usually takes for the appointment. I felt like my teeth weren&#x27;t getting as clean with the manual toothbrush, but she confirmed it. This is my 3rd Sonicare toothbrush in about 8 years, and I think they are definitely the best electric brushes on the market. I was torn between getting this model (DiamondClean) and the one a tier down in price (I forget what it&#x27;s called), as the the DiamondClean, great as it is, seems excessive. However, I went ahead with the Diamond, hoping that it will last as long as previous models have. It&#x27;s much lighter than the model I had before, which is nice for traveling, and feels very sleek in your hand. All the settings sometimes make it hard to turn off with one touch (the on/off button also cycles you through all the settings), but if you wait until the 2 min. mark, it automatically turns itself off. I&#x27;m not sure why Philips has dropped the accompanying UV cleaner, as I know a lot of people liked having that.  The glass charger seems kind of silly; it&#x27;s just as easy to put the brush on a plastic stand, and I&#x27;m worried about knocking the glass (which will definitely break) over on the granite counter in bathroom. However, it does come with a second charger (not glass), which should work if that happens.  When the price for this item comes down about $50, I think it&#x27;ll be the best Sonicare option on the market. It does make your teeth feel very clean. (I had to take off 1 star for being overpriced, but it&#x27;s a great product.)</li>
            <li> I bought this because my dentist recommended that I switch to an electric toothbrush to reduce gum line recession.  It takes a bit of getting used to, but the product works really well.  I have that &amp;#34;just cleaned&amp;#34; feeling on my teeth all year around now, not just after leaving the dentist&#x27;s office.  And when I went in for my cleaning last week, a new hygienist (who had never worked on my teeth) poked around for about 10 seconds and asked, &amp;#34;Do you use an electric toothbrush?&amp;#34;  I said that I did and she commented that it was obvious because my teeth were so clean.  She had to do very little picking and scraping as was very complimentary on the condition of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Amazing! i love it.  Feel clean and refreshed all day long, like a professional cleaning (xcept u r not going to gag becuz you r in charge).  Smooth n powerful, i find myself brushing longer than with any other brush incl standard Sonicare.  Love that it inclues &#x27;gum care&#x27;  (light massage) something which i need, but have not spent enough time on. Bravo Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li> DiamondClean toothbrush is way better than the old e-series!  Bought this to upgrade my e-series.  This toothbrush makes your teeth feel even cleaner than brushing with the e-series.  Gets between the teeth well.  Was a little discouraged by reading the negative feedback before purchasing but am glad I ordered this toothbrush.  I have been using sonicare for 10 years or so and this model surpassed my expectations.  However, I never tried the models between DiamondClean and e-series.  This toothbrush came with a glass charging disk and the charging glass...I just use the glass charging disk to charge the toothbrush and the charging glass for mouthwash.  One thing that disappointed me was that I bought a white toothbrush when I really wanted the black.  I was discouraged in buying the black because comments said the black toothbrush heads were more expensive and hard to get.  However, they are sold at a lot of places at the same price even at Costco.  sigh!</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush I ever bought! Feels like I just stepped out of a dentist every morning. Everyone should try it!</li>
            <li> I used my first Sonicare toothbrush for nearly a decade before it finally stopped working. I loved that toothbrush. I noticed--and so did my dentist--a dramatic improvement in the cleanliness of my teeth. So, of course I purchased the top-of-the-line model to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14 months later, I&#x27;m trying to decide if I should shell out more cash for this brush, or buy another model or brand. I have to agree with the other negative reviews on this site. Despite the fact that my teeth still get Sonicare clean, there are some major design flaws with this brush. I was hoping by the time I had to replace it, they would&#x27;ve been addressed, but my brush broke this morning and this model has not yet been redesigned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s beautiful. But as other reviewers have pointed out, it&#x27;s more than a little annoying that you can&#x27;t turn on the brush, or cycle through cleaning modes, without having it in your mouth already. It starts vibrating as soon as you push the button, and if it&#x27;s not in your mouth, you&#x27;re going to shower your face and bathroom with a fine mist of toothpaste. I got adept at putting the brush in my mouth, angling it so that I could see the lights in the mirror, and pressing the button until I reached the cleaning mode I wanted. Should I really have to do that with a top-of-the-line toothbrush? The brush can&#x27;t be turned off until it has been running for 10 seconds, so it&#x27;s not even possible to select the mode, turn it off, apply toothpaste and turn it on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush remembers the last cleaning mode used, which is also frustrating. If I knew that I had to press the button three times as soon as I turned it on to get to, say, \\&quot;whitening mode,\\&quot; then that would make a little more sense. As it is, if I used whitening mode the last time, I have to press the button several times to get it back into cleaning mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised someone approved this ridiculous design. Would it destroy the aesthetics of this brush so much if there were two simple buttons, one for \\&quot;power\\&quot; and one for \\&quot;cleaning mode?\\&quot; I appreciate the beautiful design, but I would rather have an ugly toothbrush and beautiful teeth. I don&#x27;t buy a toothbrush as a piece of art to display in my bathroom. In the case of this brush, design has taken priority over functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, as I was going through my usual routine of squinting in the mirror with the brush in my mouth, ready to hit the button several times to get into \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode, the brush slipped out of my hand and fell about three feet into the sink. Now it no longer works. I&#x27;m not a careless person -- but sometimes a toothbrush falls, especially when I&#x27;ve got to do minor gymnastics every morning just to use it. It didn&#x27;t fall far, and it didn&#x27;t fall hard, but now the brush head no longer vibrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to research other brands. I&#x27;m really disappointed in Phillips for not having designed this very expensive tool with more care for their customers. If it&#x27;s re-designed so that function takes priority, and with better materials, then I&#x27;ll buy a new one. If I decide that Sonicare is still the best brush for cleaning, I&#x27;ll buy a different model. This supposedly top-of-the-line brush is anything but. After over a decade of using Sonicare, I&#x27;m seriously considering purchasing the highly-rated Oral-B Professional toothbrush at nearly half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: March 27, 2014&lt;br /&gt;After doing my research, I had to (somewhat reluctantly) admit to myself that Sonicare still seems like the best way to take care of my teeth. So, I purchased the Flexcare model, which still uses the Diamond Clean brush heads, isn&#x27;t as sleek, but has TWO buttons -- a power button, and a mode-selection button. It also comes in a multi-pack, which at a \\&quot;big box\\&quot; store was cheaper than buying a single brush. The two brushes I now own were still less than half the price of the DiamondClean, and my teeth get just as clean. Hopefully it&#x27;ll last at least twice as long.g.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from my classic Sonicare solely because its aging battery no longer accepted a charge--about 10 years after purchasing it. All of that to say, this is a considerable upgrade. My teeth feel cleaner, I appreciate the charging glass for its practicality. Having recently traveled with the new brush, I can also say the USB charging case is incredibly practical. Amazon was the best price that I could find. If you need a new Sonicare, this is a great choice!</li>
            <li> First, let me talk about the design itself since this is pretty much what you will be paying for - The toothbrush does indeed look beautiful. The glass cup stand (combines as a charger) that comes with looks pretty slick. When people come into my restroom and I mention that the cup acts as a charger they are all amused and amazed... The travel case that it comes with is heavy duty and has an USB plug-in so you can charge it on the go without having an AC outlet. Sadly the aesthetics is the only the good thing about this device...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on button for this toothbrush is poorly constructed. If you like brushing your teeth in the SHOWER forget about it! This Sonicare has an open ring around the power button where if you get water in it will damage so you have to make sure you don&#x27;t get anything inside it. This is pretty much impossible to do since when you are brushing your teeth water and toothpaste is inevitably going to go down unless you keep your mouth shut closed completely while you are brushing your teeth. Other models have a rubberized button that overlays the button so this leakage doesn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had to replace this brush twice, and unfortunately the second time my warranty period was up and Sonicare offered me a 20%  discount. At $200+ retail you should be getting a product that is better constructed and functions well. I have then moved onto a competitors brand which doesn&#x27;t look as nice but feels and brushes a lot better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, it works, and it cleans! It cleans really well! What more do you want from a toothbrush? Five different cleaning modes? Oh, well, this has got it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want to take it around? The travel kit is pretty awesome, too. Battery lasts ~3 weeks from one charge. Whoa! You can even charge it straight from the travel case! Wait, whaaat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glass cup is cool, but I don&#x27;t use it. There&#x27;s a smaller, more compact stand, and it definitely looks better in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, there is one thing that I had trouble with. It was when I put the toothpaste on the brush head! Whenever I would turn it on, it would go cray and start vibrating like a maniac. The toothpaste would then either fall off or fling off everywhere little by little. I got it now, though. Mastered it. BAM!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li> This the first review I have ever written!  This toothbrush is fantastic! It lives up to the advertisement!</li>
            <li> My recommendation is that you do not purchase this product. The product offers a two year warranty. If the product fails after the warranty expires, the manufacturer of this product will do nothing to assist with repairs, or replacement. I find myself the unlucky owner of a $190 toothbrush that looks good, but can no longer be properly charged because the battery has quit working. The product has a nice look with the glass to be used for charging the product - but essentially the product design is flawed. The battery issue is a known issue with this particular product - but Philips will not acknowledge the problem after the two year warranty expires.</li>
            <li> This was an very good tooth brush...then it simply stopped working. Apparently there is a well documented issue wherein the shaft which vibrates the tooth brush head breaks. While this wouldn&#x27;t have been the end of the world if Phillips would replace a product I purchased only a year and a half ago which was dubber &amp;#34;their finest product&amp;#34;, they won&#x27;t (because they base the warranty from when the product was produced NOT from when I purchased it).&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, I can get a 10% discount off another Phillips product on their website, but their website doesn&#x27;t work properly so I can not even access this. Honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t give a company that has such poor customer service my money again. They should take better care of their customers and stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> Awesome Toothbrush, my mouth feels so much cleaner</li>
            <li> My wife and I each bought one of these and I loved mine for the first few months. It was the best toothbrush I have ever used in my life. It literally felt like going to the dentist after each brush.    Unfortunately, after six months my wife&#x27;s toothbrush stopped working and mine feels like it is fading. Her&#x27;s will turn on and vibrate a little, but it doesn&#x27;t clean teeth. We were very careful with them and used them normally. We are contacting Philips to see if they will send us new brushes, so we&#x27;ll see. If they send us new ones we&#x27;ll keep using them, but for a $200 we expected more.    EDIT  I just contacted Philips and they are sending two replacement handles after a fairly painless 10 minute online chat with a representative. I am changing my rating to 3 stars from 1 star due to their customer service. I would still hesitate to by this again though.</li>
            <li> Love it! Have it for almost 3 years now. It stoppped working twice, but the warranty is awesome, so it got replaced</li>
            <li> Feels like just home from the dentist after every brushing.  It is GREAT!! Have had other sonicare toothbrushes but this is the best!</li>
            <li> Quite, great design, thought through travel case, easy charging, glass cradle, various charging options, light. The best toothbrush I&#x27;ve had. Well done!</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I have never owned an electric toothbrush before this. I have always used regular/manual toothbrushes and figured that they work just as well.  I thought that electric toothbrushes are only good because you get to be lazy - I was wrong.  I bought this toothbrush about a month ago after a trip to the dentist and have absolutely fallen in love with it - although it does tickle the first few times because I wasn&#x27;t used to the vibration sensation.  But it leaves your teeth feeling amazingly clean (post-dentist clean even).  My girlfriend had been telling me that its only because I just went to the dentist - so I bought some extra tips and let her use it.  She now plans to buy herself one since she was so impressed by how clean her teeth feel.  I will say that I keep a regular toothbrush around for those random days where I am too lazy, late, or inebriated to spend a full two minutes brushing my teeth.  Then I settle for a normal and quick (but less perfect) toothbrushing.  I noticed in one review that people were disappointed that it did not come with a UV disinfecting light as some other models do.  My only response: really?  I have never in my life UV disinfected a manual toothbrush, so why would I have to disinfect this - it dries just as quickly as a normal toothbrush...  One odd thing about the travel case - it comes with a USB charger (as well as the USB adapter to plug into a normal outlet).  But I have to ask: why is it a USB charger at all?  I doubt that many people will be plugging this into their laptops while on the plane to recharge their toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t mind it, but I&#x27;m just slightly confused.  The only minor annoyance is that you cannot change the &#x27;setting&#x27; on the brush without turning it on - so you are forced to click through the different settings while it is vibrating.  You either have to turn it on and have water/toothpaste to splash everywhere, or put it in your mouth and cycle through while trying to look in a mirror(not easy).  But all in all - I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone and everyone I know who is in the market for a great (albeit expensive) toothbrush.</li>
            <li> nice sleek design, and improved over previous version because it doesn&#x27;t allow water to enter and get trapped into the assembly.</li>
            <li> The brush head (actual brushing end) is much smaller then my older sonicare. I feel like the cleaning area is much smaller..  The carrying case is cool but you can fit the charger in it so you end up carrying around a lot of extra bulk stuff. I wish I would have gotten the lesser model.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the reviews I read before I purchased this, but not with some others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush does not rip your gums apart.  A Sonicare requires that you grip it loosely and don&#x27;t press it against your gum line.  Let the brush do the work.  I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years now, so this seems like a no-brainer to me.  This one is no harsher than any I&#x27;ve used.  And I&#x27;ve had bad gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that the selection of five different settings can be a little hard to use.  You have to start it out in one setting and while brushing hit the button again until you get to the setting you want.  You can see in the mirror if it&#x27;s at the setting you want.  I love the &#x27;white&#x27; setting because it gives you an extra 30 seconds.  The clean setting is the normal 2 minutes.  I want to also try the gum care setting.  You can visibly feeling the change when you select a new setting.  It would be nice if you could select the setting you want before you turn it on.  Minor problem, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer didn&#x27;t like drinking out of the glass because of &#x27;sharp edges.&#x27;  He felt they were from the ones made in China.  Mine was made in China, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the glass.  It&#x27;s great having a glass in the bathroom for that last minute drink of water before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the travel case that plugs in.  I used to have a travel Sonicare that needed batteries.  I hauled around hybrid batteries and a charger.  Now I don&#x27;t need that.  I used this for a week and it did not need charging.  But I can imagine on a two-week trip, it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the little heads!  Love!  They fit in my mouth so much better than the old Sonicare did.  Easier to keep clean, too.  The bigger heads used to gunk up fairly rapidly, making me take special steps to keep them clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was definitely the perfect purchase for me.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  It seems I spend less time cleaning, but my teeth get 10 times more brushing coverage. I love that clean smooth feeling after brushing.  I get that same great feeling as I do when I get a cleaning at the dentist.  I am so impressed that I can brush twice a day for 2 months just on one charge. And all the settings it has is awesome. I have to admit, I only use 2 of the settings, clean and whitening, and haven&#x27;t used the others, but who cares, these 2 settings are great.  I love that each setting as it&#x27;s own timer, so I always get the same amount of cleaning time, no more, no less. I really do enjoy brushing my teeth now. It&#x27;s not a chore like it use to be.  It did take a couple of days when I first used this to get use to it.  It kind of tickled my gums, but I got use to it after a few days.  Who knew I had ticklish gums. I have been using this for 5 months now and am still using the original brush head, I haven&#x27;t had to change it yet.  If you are not hard on it, and just use it gently while you brush, you can get a lot of mileage out of it.  Because the brush heads are expensive.  SO wait for them to go on sale before buying any replacements.</li>
            <li> After tens of thousands spent on fillings, re-fillings, around 15 root canals and crowns, several re-canals and re-caps, and a couple of extractions, my new dentist strongly suggested I switch from manual brushing to a Sonicare and gave me a $10 store coupon. He explained that I may think that I&#x27;m brushing my teeth for the requisite two minutes but I&#x27;m really doing it for significantly less time. He explained that this product has a two-minute timer and he added that, \\&quot;How well you clean your teeth is more important than how often you brush them.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial thoughts: \\&quot;What&#x27;s in it for him from the manufacturer,\\&quot; not because I didn&#x27;t trust him otherwise, but because I bought an electric toothbrush 20 years ago; I won&#x27;t mention the brand--but I will say that it had a hose to squirt water between my teeth and made a mess from water squirting and leaking all over the place.  I stopped using it after a couple days and it became a crud-encrusted elephant taking over limited space on the bathroom counter-top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m thrilled with my purchase. The most distinctive feature is that the brush makes a sound every thirty seconds to remind you to switch to another quadrant of your mouth.  Looking back I was probably brushing for only 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer claims my gums will feel better after only a couple of weeks. I&#x27;ll see if this is true when I go back in 3 weeks for a cleaning. So far, my teeth feel so slick and glassy, and my breath minty fresh, that two minutes is worth it.  With root canals costing $1,400, crowns north of $2,000, and implants close to $4,000 ... this $185 might turn out to be a wonderful investment!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Teeth and mouth feel incredibly clean after using this brush.  Very cool magnetic charging base so, no charger to plug into the toothbrush to get messy/water damaged.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, but awful usability.  First, they don&#x27;t give you anywhere to securely place your toothbrush heads.  Unless you&#x27;re the only one using the toothbrush, you&#x27;ll be storing them someplace less than ideal, and they&#x27;ll probably fall down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, there&#x27;s no apparent way to color code your brushhead like the older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody in the Netherlands really messed up on this product.  This will be my last Phillips purchase.</li>
            <li> I would have written this review 2 weeks after I received the toothbrush, it probably would be a 4 stars. Now it has been a couple of months and I am very disappointed by the durability of the toothbrush. It lasted 1-2 months and now it wont recharge and wont turn on. There is no easy way to get an exchange (I did not keep the box not the warranty) and even via Amazon there is no exchange, so that is pretty disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about the product: it was my first electronic toothbrush, so I was really surprised about the feel of it. It felt so unnatural and abrupt on the teeth that I thought it was bad for my teeth! However my teeth felt so clean, my mouth so relaxed, and my gums day after day stronger, that I kept using it and started loving it. Now I miss it badly and really mad that the product is broken. At such a high price,  it should not be defectuous that fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a travel case, I fell for the usb charger... that I&#x27;ve never used once! It comes with two brushes, pretty neat, and the travel case is pretty. My husband is so into it that he used the tiny of the two brushes that came with it. However the glass that holds it looks kind of cheap: thick and heavy (so not very enjoyable to use). Retrospectively, I would probably try to get the same toothbrush but not with all these extra things that are not very useful.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised.  I haven&#x27;t tried the travel charger yet, but hope to in the near future.  I especially like the timer.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this toothbrush. I have never owned one and after getting used to the vibrating in my mouth and the small amount of toothpaste needed I will never go back to the normal brush. I love the design and feel of the brush. It does an excellent job of removing plaque from my teeth and makes them feel like glass once I am through. The glass that holds/charges the brush looks really cool on my counter and I&#x27;m 100% happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I know it is a bit expensive, however I really like all the features, the case, the multiple charging systems, the quality, the results, everything.  This is the third Sonicare that I have owned in probabaly 10 years and by far this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li> Love the design. Easy to clean but the brush is not much better than a baby&#x27;s first brush. My Oral B got tea stains off my teeth. Doesn&#x27;t clean like it should. Had an older model that was great. This one is a disappointment. Way too much money to spend and not get a good cleaning. If they had a better brush it would be great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working flawlessly ever since I purchased it: I think it&#x27;s been about two years.  I also bought one for my son, who has had his for over a year.  The replacement heads are expensive, though.  Especially if you buy the Compact Heads, which I do.  My dentist said they do a better job by reaching in smaller spaces, and I agree.  So does my son.</li>
            <li> The Diamond Clean has a more slender shape and smaller brushes so it is much more comfortable to use.  It does an excellent job of cleaning...after brushing your teeth feel &amp;#34;polished smooth&amp;#34; and really shine like they do when the dental hygienist cleans them.  Also, my teeth do not seem to build up as much staining.  It is a really great electric tooth brush and worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just come from the dentist every day I use this product. It&#x27;s the most amazing electric toothbrush I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> I have been using the sonicare for two months and I like it.  However, still having issues with plaque build up.  I bought the sonicare, becasue it advertises that removes up to 5x more plaque. It&#x27;s works fine, but not great.</li>
            <li> I think this must be the best electric toothbrush out there.  It gets your teeth whiter in as little as two weeks!  It helped me a lot when I found that my hand dexterity was not that great.  It&#x27;s also great for kids and teens.  My teenage daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very stylish and works great. (I don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s a minimum number of words required for these reviews...?)</li>
            <li> I have always used the \\&quot;best\\&quot; and most \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; Oral B brushes.  This diamond clean was my first sonicare purchase and I was skeptical of \\&quot;sonic vibration\\&quot;.  I thought yeah right.  But I love it!! It is the best oral care brush ever made.  I don&#x27;t know how I made it without it!  Thanks sonicare!! Best purchase, best value, superior cleaning!  Love it!</li>
            <li> The glass induction charging is unqiue, it also comes with a different less bulky glass stand. If you are a traveler... comes with a travel case (lime green inside, sturdy outside material) with a USB charger so you can plug into your wall or computer (like an iPhone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel off the tooth brush is matte feeling (similar to the feeling of the older black macbooks if you know what I mean!). Love how the lights show up whenever you push the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the Oral-B Triumph 9900 prior and I just personally wanted something a little more powerfull, less bulky, and more modern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush has a cycle that gets you warmed up to how powerfull it is... it gradually gets more powerful with each of the 1st 14 sessions that are 1+ min of the toothbrush being on. I believe the triumph had something similar but this tooth brush is more sleek, smaller brush head and way cooler looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the tooth brush and my teeth feel incredibally clean, I get excited to brush my teeth! I am the type of person that likes to have the BEST of everything with all of my electronics! (FYI) If it seems too expensive to you, consider the price per brush; divide total cost by how many times you use it. Is it worth a penny to have an incredible brushing expierence everytime and now you are removing up to 100% plaque? It is to me!</li>
            <li> Typical high-quality Philips product.  The angled tip was a little puzzling to me as to whether to have the tip pointing towards the gums or towards the tips of the teeth.  The manual was ambiguous on this issue.  I sent their tech support people an inquiry, and they said the tip should be pointed towards the gums with the flat side against the teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to drop the money on such an expensive toothbrush. Reading the reviews cinched it for us. Our teeth feel cleaner and they are really whiter! It is VERY powerful, so it did take some getting used to. The only fallback is the difficulty of the setting changes once it is turned on. It did lose it&#x27;s charge in a week as opposed to 3 weeks as stated in the directions. This could be that 3 people in the house are using it. Nice sleek design. Like the fact that it has the strip on the brush head to indicate when it is time to change to a new head. All in all we are very happy we purchased it!</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare in 2 years and the second one that broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first Sonicare had a battery that died 13 months after I purchased it. It was out of warranty and the battery is not replaceable. So, I was out $150. But I really liked the way the Sonicare cleaned my teeth, so I bought a the DiamondClean because it had a Lithium Ion battery and Lithium Ion batteries don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; problems of NiCad batteries (the first Sonicare had NiCad batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit lasted 11 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first issue is that the USB recharging case doesn&#x27;t actually recharge the toothbrush. It simply doesn&#x27;t work. On the other hand, the battery does last a week without a charge, so the inability to recharge on the road wasn&#x27;t a huge issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the motor got weaker. And weaker... to the point were it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I contacted Sonicare customer support and gave them all the model and serial number information I had. They refused to honor the warranty. They claimed they couldn&#x27;t find the model and serial number (and I think there&#x27;s a 0% possibility that Amazon sells gray market items).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m out my second $150 to Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a OralB toothbrush and it&#x27;s working well, although a little louder than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I really liked this toothbrush but after two years it stopped charging. This toothbrush is not cheap and I would expect it to last longer than it did. I miss it but don&#x27;t think its worth replacing at that price every two years. I also bought the electric flosser and that stopped charging after a year and a half. I would be very hesitant to buy Philips products again.</li>
            <li> Having owned a soniccare for over 10 years now I was super excited to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to this one.  Don&#x27;t do it, they suck to put it nicely.  Bought mine in 2012 and have had to have warranty replace it over 7 times!!!  On the phone they tell me to not get handle wet, ugh it&#x27;s a toothbrush?  The warranty will send you a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; refurbished one (that has been sent back because it had problems too).  And then eventually they will say sorry your replacement only lasted 3 months but you no longer qualify for a warranty covered brush.  I&#x27;m switching and I&#x27;m irritated- the diamond clean isn&#x27;t worth the almost $200 price tag.  I had to throw my glass cup charger out too that quit working after a year.  If you insist on Sonicare get an older version, not this POS!</li>
            <li> Lots of money but my wife loves it. I don&#x27;t care what those TV Dentists say about the electric brushes, my Wife&#x27;s a living example for them . Especially this one. She had an older model and when it broke I got this for her, and LO &amp; BEHOLD, her dentist and his Dental Hygenist both commented on the difference in her teeth!! She had issues when younger but ever since Sonicare she has needed no surgery, just goes in &amp; gets x-rays and cleanings. Been 20 years now.</li>
            <li> A friend told me how amazing his was and the level of clean.  I have to say he was absolutely correct.  I love it so much I later bought one for my girlfriend, and my my mother.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush a little over two weeks ago and so far I love it. I have never felt a clean feeling such as this one, besides a regular dental cleaning. What first caught my attention is the toothbrush design, modern and very nice to look at. The cleaning options light up when you hit the on button, or when you take it off the charger. I don&#x27;t understand why some people find the design not very thought out being you now use one button and all. It&#x27;s very simple, you put toothpaste on brush, put brush in mouth n hit the button. The option you used last will be the one that starts up. That&#x27;s if you let the cycle run its full course. There should be no reason why you would turn the brush off before its time is up. Very pointless, its timed for a reason. If you wish to do another option you just click the button to the setting you desire. There was also complaints that it you take brush out of your mouth toothpaste platters everywhere. If you need to pause the brush say to rinse or what not, you just hit the button and it stops it until you resume again (I think 30 seconds max) Very easy. The travel case and the fact thst you can charge with USB is also a huge plus. Everything now a days is USB charger friendly and now this is a lovely edition to the modern world of electronics. I do say that $220 full price for this toothbrush is a bit ridiculous, but amazon price is a little more reasonable. All in all this toothbrush is pretty great and I say give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have used Phillips sonicare brooshes for a number of years but this particular one is the best. I have seen the difference within a week. Its been already 3 months and I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After trying many different electric brushes from many brands I decided to buy this Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;The price is not very accesible but once you try it youll see quality.&lt;br /&gt;When you open the box the first impression is how sleek and modern it is . The different accesories are also nice.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a kids or small head and a regular head, a glass for charging , metal plate charger ,travel case ,usb cable for charging and a stand for the brush.&lt;br /&gt;The options for cleaning are just amazing, and the way the head of the brush is design is perfect. It reaches the back of the mollars, between the teeth and is super gentle with the gums.&lt;br /&gt;The timer helps you focus in the way you brush.&lt;br /&gt;Yo have to split your mouth in 4 ways and the brush it. Every 30 seconds it will vibrate to let you know that you have to move to the next part of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;In the different settings you can have more time or different brushing vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;If you travel the case is simple , elegant and perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Battery fully charged will last you for at least 3 weeks brushing 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall is a great product. Buy it , you wont regret.</li>
            <li> This sonicare is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. Outstanding quality and workmanship in every detail. My Dentist loves the results</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Sonicare we have bought but this model surpasses the previous versions. It is a great brush, works like it should, feels good in your hand and the indicators in the handle are terrific. The charging system is outstanding and very trick as is the carrying case which is also a charging base. How sweet is that?</li>
            <li> This brush was nice while it lasted. However, it did not last as long as I would have expected. The handle died 3 months after the warranty ran out. The thing makes a humming sound but stopped vibrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old sonicare brush lasted for years. I was disappointed how this one did not last very long.</li>
            <li> This was an upgrade for us from FlexCare.  We bought our FlexCare back in Apr 2011 and decided to splurge and made an upgrade purchase for DiamondClean in Jun 2013.  FlexCare still works like a charm.  In fact, we still use it when one of us goes on business trip. So none of us is without the Sonicare.    DiamondCare work as well as the FlexCare.  But I gotta tell you, if you&#x27;re about the look, then go ahead, make the splurge.  Buy the DiamondCare, you won&#x27;t regret it.    The rubber exterior on our FlexCare has gradually peeling after 3 years of use.  The DiamondClean on the other hand is made of plastic but good quality of plastic (feels like ceramic but it&#x27;s not).  It is clean and sleek.  No rubber parts on the handle so no peeling.  Easy to rinse off after brushing.  If you are switching from FlexCare to DiamondClean, you will have to get used to the button because there is only 1 button in DiamondClean to control.    The reason I&#x27;ve subtracted 1 star is today (Oct 10, 2014) the battery in my DiamondCare has just dropped dead.  Thank goodness it is still under 24 months warranty.  Philips has great customer service!  I was told they will replace the unit immediately.  All I have to is mail the defected one back in the pre-paid mailing label.    I read from another review that if you registered online with Philips, they will extend an additional 6 months.  I will be sure to register the replacement online just in case.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for awhile now, but this was worth the money for the upgrade! I am in love with this toothbrush! Holds charge for about a week. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This is my second one. The first wore out after years of use.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist tells me my teeth are in better shape than before, so I know it&#x27;s making a difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit and it worked fine for 2 1/2 years and then it topped working properly, as the metal shaft went loose.&lt;br /&gt;I was told that the warranty was only 2 years and that they would not do anything. On top of that Philips does not sell handles alone and therefore if I want a new handle I need to purchase the full kit.</li>
            <li> The item has a nice feel to the handle. Sturdy and smooth. One reviewer called it the Apple of toothbrushes and it reminds me of their products.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I go to the dentist EVERYDAY!! Easy to use, travel with, and charge! Recommend buying if you want a fantastic toothbrush!</li>
            <li> A whole new brushing experiance and leaves your mouth feeling amazinly different than using a manual brush.  Dont let the price deter you.  It is worth every penny if you can afford.  You can also register your two your warranty upon reciept if something happens to brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter who is a dental hygentist gave me this product for my birthday last year.  My teeth look and fell cleaner then my old sonicare brush.  I love the Diamond clean brushes that come with it.  I loved mine so much that I bought my husband one for Christmas this year.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with a product your dental hygenist recommends.</li>
            <li> I wanted to upgrade from my Sonic Essence toothbrush and so far I love this one!  I love the beeping feature that tells you it&#x27;s time to move from one section of your teeth to another.  Now it&#x27;s easy to brush my teeth for two minutes.  I charged it when I got it - the instuctions say you can brush for 3 weeks before recharging - and it has been 3 weeks and one day and I haven&#x27;t had to recharge.  Only downside is it&#x27;s pricy, but if it lasts, then it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> What a great product..always works with ease, changing the heads is simple and it is the best thing we as a family could have ever purchased !</li>
            <li> received as advertised, happy with purchase, fast delivery, I would buy from this seller if purchasing again in the future.  Diamond clean makes me feel like I just got back from the dentist clean</li>
            <li> Has a much more vigorous brushing action than previous models I have used. I do miss different buttons to turn on and adjust power.  If you want to turn off immediately after start, the single button steps down the power settings before turning off.  Overall it works really well if looking for a great cleaning action!  Amazon delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> worth the price - great options to charge and very reliable.  Great to go packaging as well.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase.</li>
            <li> So some background. I don&#x27;t remember ever owning a manual toothbrush. My parents started going with electric back when brookstone and sharper image mainly carried them. My last brush was an oral b 8000 series (older model) and lasted me for about 5 years. Got to a point where the battery wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge. So I started looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reports that say sonicares are better, I read the reports saying oral b brushes are better, and the reports that say any electric brush is better than manual. So I debated between getting another oral b or a sonicare. I looked at features and even add-ons.  It is a bit ridiculous but ultimately the reason for purchase of this over the 5000 series oral b was the &amp;#34;no touch&amp;#34; charger and the hard-plastic travel case with usb charging capabilities. The oral b would have been cheaper, however the cases never seem to look good to me (never tried them to be honest), and the timer/pressure/teeth cleaning sensor would be a waste of money where I wouldn&#x27;t even use it. I&#x27;d probably toss it as I have a clock on my nightstand, phone, watch, oven, microwave; I don&#x27;t need a time or clock and have been using electric toothbrushes long enough to know when I am pushing to hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to the pros, cons, and important stuff. I wanted to give this a few weeks before I wrote the review so I had everything in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important stuff: This brush cleans teeth well. I used a manual brush for a couple of days (disassembled the oral b early without thinking) and my teeth felt &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34;. The sonicare feels good. The brush handle is light in weight, grips well, and of course if you are new to electric brushes or have a tendency to push to hard, kind of hard for the brush head to move if it is jammed up against your teeth (head still vibrates but bristles don&#x27;t) where as with my oral b I could near brush away my gums if it came to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The base does not have to attach directly if you use the glass. Just put the brush in the glass and it starts charging. There is a little dip in the bottom of the glass so if you don&#x27;t pay attention you might not get the brush in all the way, but the only time I had a problem was when I put some floss sticks and my tongue scrapper in it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The charging case works. Though Phillips boasts a 3 week charge I feel better safe than sorry. Some people have complained about putting wet heads in the case. A quick shake of the head should make it dry enough and if not you can use a tissue to squeeze the head for excess. After I used the case for a few days I did take a damp cloth and did a once over the case and left it open to dry, but that&#x27;s it. I never understood the need for the UV cleaners so I don&#x27;t see the issue not having one or even the bacteria growth in between brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you don&#x27;t like the glass a little cover for the charger comes with it. The brush does stand up right in this base. I didn&#x27;t notice much brushing &amp;#34;crud&amp;#34; accumulate, but just keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Handle is relatively light in weight. I went to a store to compare both the 5000 and this one and the 5000 seemed to weigh far to much for me to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-It comes with two heads, one is the compact diamond brush and the other is the full size. I&#x27;m trying to wear down the compact brush so I can toss it because it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. The head size is just too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-There is no where to hide additional cable length. Luckily my brush is on the other side of the sink from the outlet, but if you had it near the outlet you would have this bundle of wire in the way. Unlike all other charging stations I&#x27;ve seen that have a cable wrap for management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The inside of the case is molded plastic of some sort. So at the crease where it bends I feel that after a while (could be a very long time or short) that tears and eventually breakage of that crease could occur. A worry more than a con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-There is no place to put the usb cable or charger. In theory you can charge off of a computer and I&#x27;m assuming most usb chargers with mini plugs. Would have been nice to at least have a place to store the cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It might have been the age of my oral b, but after the quad timer was done it would stay on. I liked having a few extra seconds to swipe around my mouth just in case. This brush shuts off after the time for your setting. So I just had to go to a setting with more time on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The heads are slightly more expensive than oral b heads and don&#x27;t have the range of options to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few thoughts on other reviews I have read&lt;br /&gt;-Many people say you can&#x27;t cycle through the settings you want without spraying everywhere. You can. Take the brush off the charger, cycle the power button till the setting you want comes up, and place the brush back in the charger. Brush turns off and in the handle it remembers the last setting, so now you can put toothpaste on the brush, water, and in the mouth without spraying. It&#x27;s 5 more seconds of your time if you really feel you need to change settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Like in my con section this brush turns off after the time setting you set. If you don&#x27;t like it change it. It seems after about a minute you can also press the button to shut it off, if you need to brush quickly for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Never owned a UV sanitizer, don&#x27;t see the point of them, never had any problems at the dentist, never had mold in an electric brush head, handle or charging station (both whatever model before my 8000 and my 8000), and this doesn&#x27;t come with one. So if that is a deal breaker for you, then this wont do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Price point is high at about any given time being roughly $65 more than the oral b 5000. I do think Phillips was trying to make a trendy toothbrush. Ultimately at this point in time I&#x27;m okay with the extra cost because I am using the things that came with the brush. That is also why I gave it 4 stars out of 5. Do I feel the cost was worth it? Not entirely. Not yet convinced.

            <li> I am a dental professional with more than 20 years experience.  I have recommended sonicare brushes for many years and will continue to do so because they are powerful and clean well, however, I cannot recommend this brush based on my personal experience.  First, I purchased the brush at a professional discount so I only paid $60 for this item.  Here is why I do not like this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The brush head separates while using the toothbrush and I&#x27;ve seen this in other reviews. Anyone who paid $200.00 for a brush should expect a better quality.  When I contacted sonicare they would not take back the brush because it was past 30 days, but could offer a 2 yr. warranty.  I do not want a brush that does not work well so this would make no sense, They also advised I try a new brush head (additional expense) which I have done and it did not resolve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The brush head itself wears too quickly.  It starts to flare within a month and once a brush flares it needs to be replaced.  Brush head replacements are expensive.  It also does not access all areas of my teeth as well as their older brush head models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  It does not clean my teeth as well as the older models.  I have a problem with tartar build up on my lower front teeth and got my teeth cleaned every 3 months until I started using sonicare.  I no longer had the buildup and even with 6 month cleanings there was no tartar build-up.  With this sonicare I can see the build-up again and have to spend time scaling my teeth myself every few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  I do not see the need for all of the different speed choices and truly question the efficacy of this.  Neither have I seen any journal articles comparing the different brushes which included this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use sonicare, however, I will throw this one out and purchase one of the older, less expensive models which for me last longer and do a better job cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, to be completely fairI need to also tell you that two co-workers bought theirs at the same time I bought mine and they like their brushes and are having no problem with them.  I think it depends on the individual mouth, not all are easily accessible although I believe mine is.  They may not build tartar as I do.  If you do decide to try this brush I would brush 3 or more x/day for the first 30 days just to see how it is working for you and if it is holding up.  If everything goes well great, if not, immediately (within the 30 days) contact sonicare and return&lt;br /&gt; it for a refund.  Also, amazon offers warranties by square trade which I believe are very good, but then after spending this much for a toothbrush, do you really want to spend more to warranty a toothbrush?</li>
            <li> I am a huge Sonicare supporter- normally. But this toothbrush is terrible. From the beginning, I have felt that this toothbrush didn&#x27;t clean as well as previous models; however, I second-guessed myself thinking &amp;#34;how could this be? This should be the best toothbrush ever purchased with this price tag!&amp;#34; Now, after owning it for six months, my toothbrush has a mind of its own. As if possessed by aliens, my toothbrush comes on in the middle of the night and scares me half to death. I get up to turn it off and it doesn&#x27;t stay off. The other night, I had a dinner party in our smallish but adorable apartment. Good food, great company and...what&#x27;s that sound? Oh, sorry, friends, that&#x27;s just my toothbrush vibrating extremely loudly on the porcelain counter in the bathroom. Yikes! I mean really Sonicare? Last night, I was awoken from a peaceful slumber by the dang toothbrush vibrating by itself in the bathroom...again. I wrapped it in a towel and put it in the living room, as it would not turn off. Still kept going and I could still hear it as I tried to fall back asleep.  I finally buried it under pillows on my couch and closed the door to the living room. Ah...peace. Now, I have a 2 children, people, I should not have to wake up extra times in the night by this toothbrush. Now today it is completely dead, no battery. Wonder why? Could it be because it was literally vibrating by itself the entire night, so much so that I had to wrap it in a towel and stuff it under 3 pillows in my living room in order to not hear it? Grrrrrr......!!!</li>
            <li> I have always loved Sonicare, read good reviews of this one and it was time to change my old one because after 4 years it stopped working, so I decided to go ahead and buy this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it! even my dentist is amazed with how clean my teeth are!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review this product from the perspective of someone who has used other Sonicare (or other brands of sonic) toothbrushes, but as someone who has been using different incarnations of Oral B electric toothbrushes for years, I&#x27;ll admit... I can&#x27;t believe I held off buying one of these suckers for so long, and especially on the idea that it was \\&quot;splurging\\&quot; to do so. It&#x27;s not splurging; for heaven&#x27;s sake, it&#x27;s a toothbrush, not a cosmetic gadget - how much time do -you- want to spend with your dentist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you own a product like one of the Clarisonic brushes you already know how much cleaner you feel than when you wash your face without; if you don&#x27;t, I can only tell you that the difference is worlds apart. The contrast I found between my old electric toothbrush and the Sonicare DiamondClean is the same - HUGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the toothbrush&#x27;s functions, I can tell you flossing isn&#x27;t nearly such an arduous chore, as the toothbrush is simply that effective; the &#x27;clean&#x27; setting does its job remarkably well... without my gums feeling like they&#x27;ve been given a once-over with a tiny cheese grater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging system is very simple and designed for convenience; it fits easily on my bathroom vanity (in a bathroom the size of a tiny walk-in closet, mind you), and the travel unit is great, despite the fact that I travel very little - I like the compact for storing pieces I want to keep out of the way, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also of note; for people with small mouths (like me): this compact head truly is compact! I had no problem using it, and I know I drive my dentist nuts with my juvenile-sized head, hah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all I heartily recommend this brush - I&#x27;ve had no problems with it, and the system in total has been great. Whether that remains to be the case... well, I&#x27;ll update if it gives me cause.</li>
            <li> really good product! I love this one. deep clean your teeth~~best gift ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months, and my teeth and gums look incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are different settings, and if you are sensitive, there is an option to ease into the full power for two weeks.  Read the manual to learn how to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hygienist cannot believe the change in my tartar levels.  Cleanings are now quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it! It saves so much time at the dentist!</li>
            <li> prior to purchasing the unit i had read that the diamondclean unit experiences quality problems and often fails within a year or two.  of course, one never thinks these things happen to them.  well, about 8 months after my purchase at amazon, it lost it&#x27;s cleaning power and stopped working.  this same progressive failure mode happened to me with the flexcare unit after 2.5 years, which was disappointing, but acceptable.  an 8 month lifespan under two uses per day, however, is unacceptable.  all to say, i now see the pattern that sonicare units experience low durability such that the premium price presents a poor value.  if i can find the time, i&#x27;ll send the unit in for a replacement, but i&#x27;m souring on these power toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Must have for oral care.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Exact kind of tooth brush I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is not a splurge.  This is an investment in dental care!  My teeth have never been so clean and white from any electric toothbrush.  Just travelled with it too!</li>
            <li> Takes very good care of me.</li>
            <li> Very good product. the cleaning in combination with the brush is fantastic. Cleaning effect is great and the design of the whole brush is great too</li>
            <li> Bought my wife one and loved it so much that bought myself one. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for the best-in-class electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time trying to figure out whether to get the diamond clean or stay with my &#x27;regular&#x27; Sonicare. I have the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus. I upgraded and compared and really found no difference. The regular type is so good, it is hard to improve on. I do not think it is worth the extra money. Also, skip the various UV cleaning functions. They have not worked for me, and you end up with a harzardous mercury laden bulb you have to dispose of responsibly.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Especially like the ramp up feature to help acclimate your teeth and gums to the brush. The glass charging cup is pretty nifty too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for years and been very happy with them. This one is the ultimate. My teeth feel cleaner than they do when I visit the dentist. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this is an amazing product and I feel compelled to share my thoughts. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months and my teeth have never felt so completely clean and smooth and my gums so healthy, with no bleeding at all, ever--and my gums sort of tingle for quite a while after brushing.  I also love the convenience of the charging glass which is a really neat idea that works perfectly.  You just put the toothbrush in the glass and the induction device at the bottom keeps it charged--its that simple!  The vibrations of the brush mechanism are not hard to get used to or unpleasant, but it is important to brush for 2 full minutes--it beeps every 30 seconds so you can keep track of the time.  I should add that I also use a water pic flosser before I brush which is not a full substitute for flossing but its amazing how much junk comes out when you use the water flosser. I&#x27;ve had ongoing gum issues for years but this method seems to have resolved them and my dentist concurs. There are several types of Sonicare brushes and this one is the most expensive, but this model is well worth the extra cost--you get a better brush mechanism and the very cool charging glass as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. Ive had a Sonicare before and it was good ,but this model is excellent .</li>
            <li> this product works as advertised it really helps you to keep your mouth clean and healthy your gums refreshed.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with this toothbrush.  Battery lasts 2-3weeks between charges (using twice a day) which is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus,  great battery, great charging solutions with the travel case and the cup.  Really great looking brush. And of course it works really well. quieter than older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only cons: Form factor is kind of slippery, looks really cool, but need a good grip as apposed to the older models which had rubber handles.  I wish it had an On/off button separate from mode selection.  If you turn this on and after about a min press the main button it will turn off... which is good.  But if you turn it on and turn it off after a few seconds it does not turn off but rather cycles through the various settings so you have to press the button 5 times to turn it off, which is annoying as I like to turn the brush on for a few seconds after rinsing it off to shake out excess water.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush,one charge will last me 10 days, my gums are in better condition so says my hygieneist.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this higher priced model for the travel case, I think some of the models below this one would do about the same with brushing.&lt;br /&gt;livefree</li>
            <li> This is my first automatic toothbrush and I&#x27;m impressed.  Functionally, it works great and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in cleaning from that of a manual toothbrush.  It charges through induction - a glass sits on the charger and the toothbrush sits in the glass charging.  I&#x27;ve yet to try USB charging, but the case has been useful when traveling.  One feature that would be great to see would be an app that tracks how often its used and how long, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see that with this particular model - maybe in the future.</li>
            <li> Although quite pricey , the product cleans very well and the battery life is excellent. The design is quite contemporary and the  unit cleans up very nicely after brushing. The travel case and charger are very small, easy to pack for travel. I have used this product for over a month with no problems.</li>
            <li> I had a periodontist&#x27;s nightmare as far as my teeth were concerned. After having my tootsies deep cleaned, I purchased the snooker  and have been using it ever since. It&#x27;s now been nine months. My periodontist says my teeth are immaculate and incredibly maintained. My last cleaning took less than 20 minutes because there was nothing to clean. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used a Philips Sonicare for years but thought I would like the newer one even better.  It is nice, but it has more settings than what I feel are necessary such as for polishing, sensitive gums, etc.  I just use the regular cleaning setting and the results are not all that different than the cheaper model which my husband inherited from me when I got this one.</li>
            <li> brush three times daily and use two complete cycles each time</li>
            <li> I love this brush  my teeth love it to my mouth feel fresh they look whiter and my check will be better than the pass ones.</li>
            <li> Am I the only person who has had a terrible experience with the Sonic DiamondClean? I&#x27;ve owned it for a year and have been shocked to find it the worst toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It&#x27;s even worse than manual brushing.  I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth for almost 50 years and this is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever used that actually leaves food between my teeth when I&#x27;m done.  Only occasionally, mind you, but with every other toothbrush in my life, that has happened exactly NEVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a Crest SpinBrush for a decade prior to opting for the outrageously priced &#x27;sonic&#x27; option.  I purchased this product specifically because of reviews that said it was a better option for those who don&#x27;t floss religiously.  &#x27;The power of a sonic toothbrush forces water between the teeth and under the gums, improving gum health for those who don&#x27;t floss on a regular basis.&#x27;  And that was me, so I thought it might be a good investment for my long-term dental health.  My bad.  Though it looks, sounds, and feels great, within one month I had my first experience of finding my teeth still dirty after brushing.  WTF?? So I went online, and I wasn&#x27;t the only one who had encountered this, apparently. I was following the instructions in the paperwork included with the brush, but I found something online that said also to tilt the tip of the brush toward the teeth slightly, if you encountered this, to enable the bristles to reach between teeth better.  Hmmm.  Never required this much instruction to clean my teeth before, but okay.  And still...  It&#x27;s happened at least half a dozen times in the last year.  Food in my teeth AFTER brushing with my $200 toothbrush. Kinda makes me think it&#x27;s not super scouring my gums all those other times, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And today it happened again, so I&#x27;m writing the DiamondClean off as a bad investment. I&#x27;m about to go play the market, though.  I&#x27;m going to go invest in a SpinBrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.  I&#x27;m giving it two stars only because it was probably better than not brushing at all.</li>
            <li> I had the older model  this brush is lighter l has a square shaped handle, and is easy to hold.  the replacement brushes are very expensive, the only reason I bought this is that my old model stopped working.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush does an excellent job of cleaning, whiting, gum massage and keeping the tartar build up nearly non existant. Like the options to hold the brush and the fact you can charge from the clear stand, glass, or in compact carrying case(which is awesome for travel).  I would make the purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is easy to use and my mouth, gums, &amp; teeth feel really healthy &amp; clean after use.i use the gum care setting and am looking forward to my next checkup.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few months ago. I was using a manual toothbrush prior to this. I have noticed an extreme difference in the health of my gums and my teeth appear more white. I am undergoing Invisalign treatment and this works great to clean my aligners. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush! I have only tried one or two of the settings, but the ones I have work very well.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! I know that it is a lot of money to spend on a toothbrush, but it does an incredible job and your teeth should be an investment! The way it charges is so cool and i&#x27;m going on a week on one charge and it hasn&#x27;t lost any power.</li>
            <li> This really gets your teeth clean.  Great for kids too, when they have difficulty getting their teeth clean.  Good for all ages.  Love the timer.</li>
            <li> Love love love this toothbrush. It&#x27;s flawless finish and its ability to make my teeth feel anew. My husband and I both have one and it&#x27;s one of our best purchases!</li>
            <li> This is my second set of Sonicare toothbrushes I have purchased for myself and my spouse. The first set lasted over 7 years. My only complaint is the price of the replacement heads. It seems like $30 is an exorbident price to pay for two heads.</li>
            <li> After one year an a half the brush started to turn on by itself (the same problem as with my previous Phillips brush), likely i had a warranty - they gonna send me a replacement in 7 days. POOR QUALITY product</li>
            <li> Ok first let me start by saying I thought I had issue with my unit and contacted Phillips and they replaced right away issue was the plug I had it in wasn&#x27;t charging the unit properly which I&#x27;m quite embarrassed about.&lt;br /&gt;the charge last for about 4-5 days with regular use before you get the blinking orange light which means its running low&lt;br /&gt;now when its running low you can still get about 15 more minutes of use before it completely dies.&lt;br /&gt;This brush has a few settings depending on your mouth clean , polish , whitening , sensitive and gum I really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between all of them clean and sensitive has the most difference to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the good things about this is the stylish design the power button screams of another stylish electronic that&#x27;s quite popular&lt;br /&gt;the charging base is very unique also and you get excellent travel case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only bad is the price its quite expensive! but in my opinion worth it as the quality is very good and feels good to use&lt;br /&gt;I find my self brushing way longer than usual as the experience is more enjoyable as weird as that may be&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall if you can get a good deal I would recommend but even if not its a very sharp product good job Phillips</li>
            <li> The sleek design of this product makes it easy to clean and the travel case is VERY convenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have been quite impressed by how long a single charge lasts (about 2 weeks).</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush 5 months ago.  Worked great at the beginning.  It has a very powerful cleaning and gum massaging action.  Problem is that the handle began pulsing recently and stopped working.  Call Philips and they replace it, with several legitimate and relevant questions asked.  Here&#x27;s the catch----I am currently living overseas, after purchasing it in USA.  I needed to have a USA ship address, and then arrange for shipping FEDEX from USA to my current residence.  That, for a $220 unit, 5 months old.  You would think an international company, Philips would be able to handle the exchange locally overseas.  When I called the Netherlands, Philips, world headquarters, I was told to phone USA.  In sum, friends of mine, who lived in U.K. and purchased three of the DiamondClean over the past few years have had similar problems, and threw out the broken units.  I guess U.K. call centers are less user friendly than the USA.  But, better quality at the get-go would eliminate this, on an expensive home appliance.  I am told Braun products have leap frogged Philips in quality recently</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these, one for my wife and one for me.&lt;br /&gt;Great toothbrush that will get you in the habit of brushing for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice toothbrush. As other reviewers noted, using it feels good -- you really feel it working to remove the stuff that shouldn&#x27;t be there. More importantly perhaps, after a week or two you can observe a noticeable difference -- the teeth look whiter and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;The additional stuff is mostly a gimmick -- the glass is unnecessary, as is the carrying pack (when I travel for a few days I can use a regular toothbrush). I note this in particular, because this toothbrush is very expensive, and part of this extra cost is due to these unnecessary additions.&lt;br /&gt;I just bough a set of two of the more basic Philips Sonicare (Philips Sonicare Elite Rechargeable Premium Edition Toothbrush) for $70 at Costco for my parents. In hindsight I would definitely go for one of the cheaper options.</li>
            <li> Works great, and perfect for travel</li>
            <li> My dental cleanings take only 10 minutes every 6 months because I started using the sonicare.  My dentist is impressed with how much I have improved my oral health and how pink and healthy my gums are!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I have had an electric toothbrush for years, but this item exceeded my expectations taking a daily chore to a new level.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this since it is so cool looking!  I had the Philips Sonicare HX6972/30 Flexcare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for 3 years and loved it.  So I figured bigger must be better... Not so much!  The travel case and the charging stand are really neat features but the lack of a charge level and the two buttons is a very big trade down.  I liked the 3 lights for your charge and then when it was almost dead would go orange and buzz.  This one goes from green to orange but you never even knew you were getting low meaning you must always have a charger where ever you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and get the regular one.</li>
            <li> Now that I have my first Sonicare electric toothbrush, I don&#x27;t know why it has taken so long to acquire a Sonicare electric toothbrush. Liking  gadgets, this model Sonicare appealed to my geek side. In addition to being beneficial and useful to the user, the toothbrush offered features that will no doubt be standard on future models. I love this Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Feels great in my hand (that&#x27;s what she said), brushes well, and is exactly what I was looking for. I have owned multiple Sonicare models and keep coming back because of the cleaning level, design, and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my first Sonicare, it&#x27;s gorgeous looking, easy to use and leave my teeth super clean.  I really like the travel case and the timer is very helpful. Sleek and well made!</li>
            <li> I bought this item on June 11, 2012 from amazon. and after one year of use, i cannot charge anymore....now it basically a normal toothbrush for me now....</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush.  It helped improve the health of my gums %100.  It is a bit intense until you get used to it, but in just 4 weeks my gums are far healthier and no longer bleeding when I floss.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but works really well and it is well tolerated by kids greatly improving the brushing effectiveness</li>
            <li> Really bad experience  with this machine, I bought 2 via Amazon, 1 via direct from boots pharmacy London, all of them after few months  not power on. No agency in my country kw for repair</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare. My first one lasted about 6 years before it died a quick death.  I bought my first one on the recommendation of my dentist. I have a number of crowns and permanent bridges and he said that the Sonicare would be best at keeping the margins clean.  Given the success of my checkups since then I have to agree with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very attractive toothbrush and works just as well or better than my old Sonicare.  My old one, sorry I don&#x27;t know the model, had a UV brush head sanitizer on the charging base that I never used.  For the past few years I kept the big unattractive charger for my old brush in the vanity and only pulled it out when I needed a charge; I simply didn&#x27;t have the space on the counter for it.  With this brush I replaced my glass with theirs and my brush rests in it and charges without taking up any additional space.  My only complaint is that the blinking green charging light is very dim.</li>
            <li> CLEANS MY TEETH just like the dentist, several power choice and is quiet. I went from Sonicare to Oral as my old one broke, and Oral care brand just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me, so I found this beauty, and again , you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s prices, I got it and loving it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price. Best sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for over two years and I love this.  I only want a new one because they didn&#x27;t have the black model when I purchased mine.  I won&#x27;t brush with anything else.  The are multiple modes and the battery life is amazing. Very powerful but not harsh.  I&#x27;ve been using sonic care products for years, don&#x27;t know why everyone wouldn&#x27;t.  The few times I&#x27;ve had to use a manual toothbrush, I felt like I didn&#x27;t even brush at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and at a very competitive price.</li>
            <li> Very good quality brush that helped with Dental health. Overall, I really like Sonicare brushes. However, I will note that after purchasing the DiamondClean power head in April 2012, it just died yesterday (less than 3 years later). This may not seem a big deal, but it was only 6 mos out of warranty. In contrast, my last Sonicare power head lasted about 4.5 years. I only deducted one star for this, and I will let everyone know that I am re-purchasing this model (although in the black) this afternoon because 3 years is still a great run for something that gets dunked in water every morning and evening to clean, vibrates over 39k times/minute, for about 6 minutes per day, over about 985 days. I think that&#x27;s pretty durable, overall, and certainly my mouth is healthier now than it was 3 years ago, with less stains than with the old sonicare.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is outstanding. The programable power feature is easy to use and the battery life is excelllent. It&#x27;s so good I&#x27;m going to but another one for my wife.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best Sonicare product yet. Compared to the FlexCare, it has a slightly thicker diameter but is overall a bit more ergonomic. Some reviewers think the finish is too slippery. I disagree. It has a matt, eggshell-like finish and is easy to hold onto. Other reviewers have complained that they must cycle through the mode menu in order to turn off the device. Not true, as long as it runs for more than 5 seconds. Then, one press of the on/off and it stops. Because it has only one button and a relatively unbroken, uniform surface, it is easier to keep clean. As for the brush head, I find the DimondClean superior to the older ProResults syle. So, if you can manage the extra cost, my choice is the DiamondClean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an earlier model Sonicare toothbrush for several years and found it to be a very good product. My dentist recommended it and noted that my periodic checkups were better (vs. manual brushing). After a number of years, the old Sonicare was showing signs of wear, although it was still working well. A friend told me about the new version, and noted that the travel case was also a charger, powered  through a mini-USB port. I was sold!  I also like the new at-home charger base for this model. It is much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Awesome cleaning tool!</li>
            <li> The teethbrush itself is very good, but I only use it abot three month, suddunly it does not work now. I try to reture or replace but it no long available because It has more than one month. I do not know how to treat with this kind of issue.</li>
            <li> Combined with regular oil pulling, there is nothing better. I have had this toothbrush for over two years and shudder to think what I will do when it no longer works; it is a \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; item for me and I love it! Bought the basic for my kids when my dentist said their teeth weren&#x27;t getting clean enough, and eventually got this one for myself, and I couldnt be more pleased. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. Expensive, yes.  Money well spent!  Love the Sonicare, as I believe it does a great job with the dental hygiene that is so important to me.  At 51 yrs of age, I still get out of the dentist chair in less than 45 mins, cleaning, check-up and all!  I did have to send in the original unit to Philips as it quit working after about 1 year for no apparent reason.  Luckily, I had registered my unit and they replaced it with no questions asked!  I like throwing in the glass to charge.  So stylish looking sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li> I have not had this long enough to comment on the durability of the product and battery. I got it to help do a better job of brushing my developmentally disabled daughter&#x27;s teeth. It is difficult to brush someone else&#x27;s teeth, especially when they are not entirely cooperative with the process. You need a way to get in there, do the job, and get out! Several things that I like about this brush are that it is quiet and easy to hold. The brush head is small and easy to maneuver in tight places (I do not know why they make so many toothbrushes as big as push brooms!) We were going to a special needs dental clinic but then they lost their hygenist and my daughter&#x27;s teeth cleaning had to be delayed for several months and as of yet is still not rescheduled. While this toothbrush may seem expensive to some, I am looking at it as an investment to effectively clean her teeth (in the absence of a regular professional cleaning) and hopefully prevent her needing expensive fillings and the accompanying pain and discomfort and risk of her needing to be sedated for a procedure. So far I am very impressed! After just a few days of brushing her teeth it looked like there was less buildup on her teeth. She does not like the vibration that occurs when the quadpacer pause occurs but we may get used to that in time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about three weeks now. I switched from a manual toothbrush. It does take a bit of getting used to, but it has a mode that helps ease the transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the clean design of the toothbrush. The best word I can think of is elegant. It feels sturdy and solid in your hand. Even though it is plastic, it doesn&#x27;t feel like cheap plastic at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the most important thing is how it works. My dentist says my teeth and gums are noticeably better. She saw a big improvement. I didn&#x27;t tell her until after her comments what toothbrush I was using. She wasn&#x27;t at all surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a glass that I don&#x27;t use that can be used for charging. I just use the supplied charging base. It uses induction charging, so you don&#x27;t plug the brush into anything specifically. I think it&#x27;s a magnetic field that charges the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for almost three weeks, twice a day, off the first charge. It has a very nice travel case and combination charger. It&#x27;s a very solid design all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth aren&#x27;t pretty, but they&#x27;re healthy and I want to keep them. I also want to minimize the amount of work my dentist has to do and I think it&#x27;s going to work for that purpose. So this was a very good purchase.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to receive HX9332-05 model as described. However, I received HX9381/05 with no warranty and for distribution to dental, that is %50 less price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a Birthday gift.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned the Sonicare Tooth Brush myself for a long time&lt;br /&gt;and have given it for gifts. Love this, so does my dentist.</li>
            <li> I really like the features and the glass charging glass is really cool. Carrying case is really useful and cool. I am trying to get use to the brush timer..</li>
            <li> Our family thoroughly enjoys the Sonicare. They say it&#x27;s the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made, and that&#x27;s saying a lot. Love it, buy it, it&#x27;s the best !!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had! I just had my first check up after 6 months of using this device and my teeth have improved immensely. Hardly any need for the scaler tool at my check up and my gums are in better condition as well. Hardly ever sensitive now! So happy to have this device.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my third Philips Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush in the last 5 years and I have used two other Philips Sonicare toothbrush models before the DiamondClean line of products. I absolutely love using the brush, as it cleans my teeth so well and really does give you that &amp;#34;just-after-the-dentist&amp;#34; feeling. The handle, glass charging station, and travel case are elegant and sophisticated. This model offers an upgrade over older models in that it does not let any liquids (water, toothpaste, spit) into the handle or under the brush head attachment. A full charge can provide a few weeks of use, but the battery does begin to die more quickly the longer you use the brush (after 1 year). Also, a battery that is not fully or near-fully charged seems to provide weaker power to the brush head, so I prefer to charge mine at least once every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are that these handles are not made to last. As I stated, I am now on my third DiamondClean brush in 5 years. The top metal shaft that holds the brush head attachment and causes the brush to vibrate became loose over time on the first two handles that I have used. On the first handle, the entire metal shaft detached from the base and because it was 25 months old and outside of the 24-month warranty, Philips customer support refused to fix it or send me a new one. I purchased another one and after 11 months of use the metal shaft started to wiggle and the brush head barely vibrated or moved at all. This time, because I was inside the 24-month warranty period, Philips customer support sent me a new (it appears to be refurbished instead of actually new) handle, which was great, but makes me worry about its longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still enjoy using the brush and it provides exceptional performance over manual toothbrushes, but I am disappointed that the handles do not last for very long in my experience.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well for a little more than two years.  Then - an unusual sound and vibration performance reduction, and some brown substance oozing from around the button - yuck.&lt;br /&gt;I guess, this is the end of the lifespan of the brush...</li>
            <li> Worth EVERY... PENNY!!</li>
            <li> the best performing electric toothbrush out there - pricey but worth it.  Recommended by my dentist and she was right</li>
            <li> Everyone should own one of these!</li>
            <li> My dentist encouraged me to buy my last Sonicare which I enjoyed for years. A great product and this new one is even better. Thank you for providing a great product.</li>
            <li> The motor broke after about 3 weeks of use. Ordered a new handle from Phillips- however that one broke after 6 months. This shouldn&#x27;t happen with a $200 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a year and I find that I don&#x27;t need to have my teeth cleaned every six months as before using it. My dentist couldn&#x27;t believe the difference! It does a remarkable job keeping the buildup of tartar down and if used regularly twice a day with a whitening toothpaste, it does lighten your teeth.</li>
            <li> I love my new Sonicare toothbrush! This is my third Sonicare, and they just get better and better!&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job cleaning teeth with it&#x27;s powerful brushing motion, is easy to recharge by placing it in the provided glass cup, and it&#x27;s sleek design stays cleaner than the models I had before. It comes with a  travel case with a built-in charger which I used on a recent trip. Will not leave without it! It is a very &amp;#34;well-thought-through&amp;#34; product!</li>
            <li> My wife and I LOVE this toothbrush! My teeth are much whiter and feel so much cleaner after using this brush for the past few weeks. I also suffered from teeth sensitivity which has gone away completely since switching to this brush. It was recommended by my Dentist and I could not be happier. We recently took a week long vacation and the charging travel case worked perfectly for us. I understand it is a lot of money to throw down on a toothbrush, but I can assure you that it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> best electric toothbrush other hands down!!</li>
            <li> I have been a user of the Oral-B Professional Care by BRAUN Rechargeable Toothbrush SmartSeries 5000 for a while. Not being entirely satisfied with the Braun I decided to try out the DiamondClean. After just ONE brush my teeth felt like I had just came back from having them polished at the dentist. I am not going to go into detail about the features &amp; what it can &amp; cant do as there is enough written about this in other reviews. All I can say is this is a GREAT toothbrush that cleans so well you will be pleased you bought it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Why mess up something that was freat.  I have been using the advanced care for the past year and it was one of the toothbrushes i have used for the longest time.  I decided to purchase the diamond clean because of the travel case and the premium look.  I much prefer the selection button and the on and off button to be seperate rather than having to cycle through the whole brush style to turn off the tooth brush.  I use a crest total care tooth paste that has a white and blue color.  The coating of the toothbrush has absirbed the color and turned to a pale blue color.  After usage the power and the selection button have become very sensative and turn on and off by itself, just by shaking the unit.  Very disapointing product, since then have swiched back to the advanced care and just bought a brown to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best&lt;br /&gt;Hamad</li>
            <li> I own an older model of the Sonicare and I think this is head and shoulders above the last model I owned.  The toothbrush works the same basically except it does have a sensitive setting which helps you get used to it, whitening setting is the BOMB!  The glass to hold the unit is EASY to clean and it never falls off or out of it!  The whole unit is sleek and updated in its feel and design.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the travel case you can plug into your computer for charging for long business trips!  That was just a genius move on their part.  Every aspect of this product has been well thought out and executed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads for the Diamond really do a better job on my teeth and the extra setting gives me more options.  The fact that you can get this with FREE shipping and another rebate in the box at the time I purchased leaves me very happy I chose Amazon to purchase the unit from.  Yes, I paid a bit more for this model and the fact is I am happy I did not settle for the old models like some of the reviews suggested I should.  Just the fact that it charges in the little sleek glass sealed the deal for me the little blocks the other sat on was just tedious to deal with and clean.  Amazon did me right again and all the reviews really helped me make up my mind on a purchase that was not inexpensive.  Thanks Amazon and thanks to those of you leaving feed back it helped me make a good decision once again! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short as there are plenty of reviews for this product that describe the features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this toothbrush, its my first professional electric (had a cheap Oral-B battery operated one for under $10 but not very good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is to point out an issue I had the Customer Service that went with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my product a few days after ordering (Prime) and promptly followed directions to charge it.  After 24 hours was up I attempted to turn it on, but no luck...the light was flashing meaning it was still charging but wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  After 3 days of this I finally went to Phillips Sonicare&#x27;s website and couldn&#x27;t find help on my issue.  They had a nice Chat feature so I contacted support, I believe on a Sunday even.  After the usual rundown they said they&#x27;d send me a replacement....in a few weeks!  I was livid, and told the rep that I didn&#x27;t think it was fair to have one DOA, spend nearly $200 on a toothbrush and to wait 2 weeks.  With this, he authorized a 2 day shipping and I had my product within 4 (Sunday to Wednesday).  Moral of the story, it is possible to spend big money on a simple product and still have it DOA...if you do not get the answer you like, ask for a better answer.  I was polite the whole time (absolute best way to deal with customer service reps) and finally got my issue resolved.  Now I&#x27;m using my new product without issue and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend</li>
            <li> It would not recharge.  It was after the 30 days for an Amazon return.  Philips has agreed to replace it but it is on backorder.  I would look for another brand.</li>
            <li> This sonic brush makes my teeth feel like I just had a cleaning at the dentist and my gums which have been a problem appear to be firming up around the tooth roots.</li>
            <li> I have own&#x27;d sonicare products in the past and honestly I love them. My teeth have never felt cleaner in my life than using this toothbrush. I&#x27;d buy it for my whole family if i could afford. But frankly theirs way too many of them.</li>
            <li> First let me say that the ordering and shipping were handled flawlessly, I received the Philips Sonicare very quickly. When I was initially comparing prices on numerous sites on the Internet, I finally settled on buying through Amazon because it was the best price, but also because I felt secure about the purchase knowing their history of customer service was so good.&lt;br /&gt;I had heard through my son that the Sonicare was an amazing electric toothbrush, so when I dropped and broke my regular electric toothbrush, I knew that I wanted to replace it with the Sonicare. The first time I used it was quite a surprise. This toothbrush vibrates very fast and it took a couple of days to get used to the tickling sensation of the vibration , but after a couple of days, you don&#x27;t even notice it anymore. I swear that you cannot get your teeth any cleaner feeling than with any other electronic toothbrush. the Sonicare, when you get used to the tickles in your mouth is a gentle, thorough cleaning and it leaves your mouth feeling like you just came from your dental hygienists office. Well  worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a noticable improvement over earlier models. There is nowhere for mold/mildew stains to grow and it just feels fantastic in action.</li>
            <li> This is literally the best toothbrush ever. It leaves your mouth feeling very clean. It&#x27;s pricey, but definitely worth it. One charge lasts me up to 3 weeks of brushing. My last Sonicare brush had to be constantly charged, so it wasn&#x27;t easy to travel with - luckily that is fixed in this model. I literally charge it once every three weeks. I would definitely recommend this and I would totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> Its expensive but really cool!</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush! I have had two before but they acted up or stopped after using a couple of years or less. I hope this one holds up because it is the best one out yet I have used other Sonicare toothbrushes that were very good but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B and found I didn&#x27;t use it.  It didn&#x27;t give the satisfaction of &#x27;BRUSHING.&#x27;  But I tried this.  It has replaced the old brush.  It gives a tingle on the lips which I had to get used to (easy enough) and does a thorough job.  It&#x27;s very nicely made and runs a couple weeks on a charge.  The storage glass and charger are neat.  Pricey.</li>
            <li> I was told my gums were in trouble.  I was going to have to go to a specialist.  I am diabetic and have had trouble before.  With this toothbrush I can already tell a big difference.  I have a dental appointment with my regular dentist.  I bet I won&#x27;t have to go to the specialist.</li>
            <li> after using this, my teeth felt like i had a professional cleaning.  it&#x27;s a surprisingly good tooth brush, i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have just ordered the 3rd replacement of our defective DiamondClean unit. Before that we had FlexCare+, which we also had to have replaced numerous times. All and all they seem to all break the same way... the vibration stops working effectively. While I think Philips has designed the nicest product out there for brushing teeth, I wish they would use components that don&#x27;t break so quickly. It&#x27;s a lot of time spent on the phone with costumer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue could really be one of two things (or in this case both)... terrible quality control at Philips; or, defective replacement units. I have never had good luck with the \\&quot;refurbished\\&quot; product sent after a product fails. I now read \\&quot;refurbished\\&quot; as \\&quot;made improperly, &amp; will never function correctly\\&quot;. Either way Philips should know better/have a higher standard. For instance, I&#x27;m sure the defective unit I send them will be patched up &amp; sent out to replace someone else&#x27;s mis-functioning unit, only to stop working a short time thereafter. And the cycle goes on and on and on. The best war to guard against this is to get a good warranty from the store you buy it from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> Teeth \\&quot;shine\\&quot; after using the Sonicare. I gave only 4 stars because the charging base is not stable.  It has a small round base with the cord that plugs in to the wall.  The hand piece sits in a second clear disk that nests on top of the base with the cord.  You have to be careful not to knock it over.&lt;br /&gt;However, a small unconvince for the quality cleaning of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Pricey and one of the best purchase I have ever made. Whiter teeth in a week, less gum problems, easy to maneuver. Travels delightfully well with case and usb charger built into its travel case. A great investment in your oral healthcare.</li>
            <li> Works very well with the glass charger.  Cleans thoroughly with no fuss and charged and ready to go each time.</li>
            <li> Whats not to like about Sonicare.  Good brush, good price, good all around. My local club store had different models at lower cost but this one can&#x27;t be beat .  I would highly recommend ....</li>
            <li> Clearly there are already numerous reviews.  I work with several dentists and they all recommend Sonicare.  I know it sounds like a commercial, but they really work.  I&#x27;ve had numerous hygenists tell me they can tell when a patient uses one of these.  I finally caved in and got one.  I could tell my teeth were cleaner after the first use.  This toothbrush could save you a lot of headaches at your dental exams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is this is an expensive toothbrush.  Not sure we needed one this expensive, but I don&#x27;t regret it and we got a good price.  It is high quality, easy to clean, has a nice feel, and is easy to change heads.  The travel case is convenient.  I do like the induction charger with the glass...very convenient.  No real negatives at this point.  Need to do some research for the best price on replacement heads.</li>
            <li> love it!!!  lasts well</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife, because it is what she wanted. I think that it is over priced but she loves it.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve only had it for a little while I don&#x27;t want to jump the gun and give it 5 stars.  Plus this thing was pretty expensive.  I was using a braun one for quite a while and felt like my teeth weren&#x27;t being properly cleaned.  This sonicare definitely makes me feel like my teeth are getting a proper cleaning.  I like it a lot so far.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  As a matter of fact, I use it everyday and have had it for three weeks.  I&#x27;ve only charged it once so far.  I like that the charge is lasting so long.</li>
            <li> Did a lot of research on this and this turned out to be everything as described and as almost all ratings had sad.  No down side.  Consider ebay and find the one&#x27;s they give/sell to dentists they&#x27;re much cheaper just w/o the glass, otherwise exactly the same and same warranty.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this toothbrush.  It looks great, works flawlessly, and has the coolest charging/carrying case I&#x27;ve ever seen.  It is soooo perfect for home and travel.  I love that you can charge it in the case via USB.  That is the coolest!  My husband and I both have the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I first got this toothbrush at a steep discount when I was new to non-traditional toothbrushes.  I was pretty skeptical, but after using this one for a few weeks, I can&#x27;t go back.  It makes a huge difference.  I tended to get harder bristled standard toothbrushes and really scour my teeth to try to get them as clean as possible, which I understood was not good for them.  But I didn&#x27;t really care, I just wanted to get them as clean as possible.  But when I tried this one, it simply gets my teeth so much cleaner than I could ever get them before, and without the abrasive scrubbing.  I eventually lost my first DiamondClean after about a year.  It was holding up just as well as the first day I got it.  But I went ahead and purchased a replacement at full price, knowing it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> This was actually a present, but I do have one.  This is a great personal care item.  An electric toothbrush makes your teeth &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; clean, and that is certainly worth the effort and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of electronic tooth brushes and this is the one I like the best. My teeth do seem whiter.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works really well.  The design is well thought out, and for travelling it works great.  Being able to charge it from a USB port is very nice since i dont have to carry an additional charger with me.  The only problem with it is the price (-1 star for being so expensive).  But if you can handle the cost, it is a very nice brush.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. The toothbrush does all it&#x27;s said to do and does it very well.</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for 5 months.  I am greatly disappointed.  The brush goes on and off intermittently every time I use it.  I have used little pressure, great pressure, medium pressure, checked the fit of the brush on the handle, etc, etc.  It worked well for about 2 weeks and then the trouble started.  I have purchased new brush heads to no avail.  I would NOT recommend the product at all.  I am ready to switch to another brand.  If only I could make this sad news a \\&quot;fun\\&quot; review.</li>
            <li> Love it my old 1 burnt in a house fire and i am so happy to have my toothbrush back it is truly the lil things ya miss when it all goes up in smoke...</li>
            <li> I loving it, i never feel clean like this and it is very confortbal !&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it !</li>
            <li> I placed the brush on the stand alone charger to initially charge for 24 hours as suggested, but after the time realized the charger wasn&#x27;t working.  It is a good thing that this comes with the travel charger, so was able to charge and use the brush.  Aside from the charger issue, very good product and happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! Very powerful, has whitened my teeth ! I loved my old Sonicare but this one is way more powerful.  It has many settings such as clean,  whiten,  polish,  even gentle!</li>
            <li> Helped my son&#x27;s gingivitis within one week. He loves it and we are so grateful. Awesome product! Thank you Sonicare</li>
            <li> got it as a gift... I hope she returns the favor!&lt;br /&gt;she says her teeth feel nice and clean. success!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable quality from this product, real dentist-quality cleaning with little effort. Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough, one of the best toothbrushes I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Sonicare toothbrush and the battery went dead after 5 years.  I was going to replace it with the same kind but saw the DiamondClean.  It is fantastic.  I feel like my teeth were cleaned by the dentist every day.  I would recommend this to anyone.  The price is pretty steep but well worth it.  When you figure the costs if you use generic brush heads it is not much more than it would cost to buy a good toothbrush every three months.</li>
            <li> I recently got this to replace my Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush which was getting old.  To be honest, in terms of cleaning my teeth, I don&#x27;t think that this toothbrush is significantly better than my old Sonicare.  Where I do think there is a huge improvement over the last model is in the charging options while traveling.  With the new HX9332, you can use the included case to charge your toothbrush if you&#x27;re away from home on a longer vacation which is a very nice touch as you don&#x27;t need to bring an extra charging base with you.  I also like the included charging base glass which I find very useful for those times I wake up at night to get a quick drink from the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, based on the charging options alone I highly recommend this over the older FlexCare model.  If the charging options while traveling and glass induction charger don&#x27;t interest you though, save the $$ and get the FlexCare as I really don&#x27;t feel much of a difference in the cleaning of the toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> Bad Reliability of this product. Completely stopped working after 6 months. This was our 2nd DiamondClean model purchase. Customer Service over the phone was very rude. Would not send replacement brush. Purchased product via Sonicare website directly.  Registered product at Sonicare website, received confirmation email for it, and yet Customer service was having hard time to find me in their database. The fix was moving onto fine German engineering, Oral B 7000 model. Will stop buying Sonicare products. Sonicare Quality department did not call me within 48 hrs window promised by Customer service. Did not receive a call after 96 hrs either. Therefore, Sonicare does not stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare products exclusively for years but this new product is by far significantly improved. I love it!!</li>
            <li> All the different settings work great and gives you the clean feeling like you just left the dentist. The vibrating takes a little getting used to but the sensitive setting works great to ease you into it</li>
            <li> This product will not treat you wrong.  It is like a massage for your teeth and mouth.  I cannot recommend this product enough. I guarantee that you will not regret buying this product.  You may be able to get it cheaper through your dentist :)</li>
            <li> I really like the toothbrush - 5 speed head.&lt;br /&gt;Recalls last setting if used for a few seconds each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rechargable battery will be charged standing up in one stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with drinking glass - for rinsing after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Glass is heavy and well made - 4 sided - with proper lip for easy of rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A well made case - with well designed texture for gripping when wet.&lt;br /&gt;Holds two heads - so can travel with one and have a spare if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case will charge with one charger - the toothbrush stand has yet another charger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parts of the tooth brush do not allow the internals to get dirty - easily cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best electric toothbrush I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owned other Sonicare toothbrushes that permitted gunk to accumulate in the handles - really hard to clean out.&lt;br /&gt;This one does NOT have that problem.  You get what you pay for in this case.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I was happy with flexicare.  This one is very hard to control, a simple touch makes it start and spread the toothpaste all over the bathroom, the mess it makes cannot be described.  To choose a cycle, one has to press the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button while it&#x27;s on, which makes it rather to stop..but it might start by itself once you place it back in its place.  don&#x27;t be fooled by little, good to nothing ads on, the same glass could be bought from other stores at much cheaper price and the support doesn&#x27;t keep your sink cleaner, just ads more cleaning work. All in all, the price is not justified neither by results, nor by making brushing more comfortable or pleasant.  I hate it and I am done with sonicare and, moreover, with any other Philips product, they aren&#x27;t what they used to be anymore.</li>
            <li> Small confession, I have poor enamel.  I have tried to care for my teeth properly over the years, but ended up with 3 root canals by 30.  I purchased this moments after getting out of the chair for my third root canal, and have not had a cavity in the three years I have been using it.  My teeth feel cleaner, the hygienist doesn&#x27;t need as long for cleanings, and my dentist says my teeth are in the best shape in years. Highly recommended.  It will pay for itself in dentist bills.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that it my Sonicare DiamondClean electric toothbrush does seem to clean well. I had been using Oral B electric toothbrushes before getting this one. I switched because although my first Oral B took many years before the battery stopped recharging, the second one I bought only lasted less than 3 years, which made me want to switch.  I had also heard that Sonicare did a better job at cleaning teeth. I chose the DiamondClean model based on Sonicare&#x27;s website.  It was the only one that said it cleaned plaque better than a manual toothbrush.  I was surprised it was the only model that said that! I figured all of their electric toothbrushes ought to do that, but I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so this toothbrush has a great tendency to splatter/spray toothpaste out of my mouth to surrounding areas like my arm, hair, mirror, countertop, everywhere! It&#x27;s very annoying and gross. I think I brush my teeth with it best while in the shower because I am not trying to be careful to make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen, so I can focus on cleaning my teeth more. I&#x27;m constantly putting my hand over my mouth to try and block any potential spray, or trying to keep my mouth as closed as possible. But it is very hard to try to keep my mouth closed while brushing the back teeth, the front teeth or tongue. Every time I use it I end up spraying wet toothpaste somewhere around me, and it&#x27;s very annoying. The different settings on the brush are all the same power level so none of them are better at preventing this than the others. The only difference on the settings is the time that I can tell.  Also, you can&#x27;t turn off the toothbrush on one click most of the time. Usually you have to go through all the settings to be able to get it to shut off because the shut off button is the same button for the settings. I&#x27;ve noticed through trial and error that if I have the brush pressed against my teeth enough that hitting the settings/on/off button will turn it off on the first try, but ifthe brush senses no pressure then you have to keep pressing the button about 4 times or so (advancing through every cleaning setting) before it shuts off, very annoying! If I had known all this I would not have asked for it as a Christmas present like I did.</li>
            <li> I have said it before in other reviews (written when I bought my last Philips Sonicare toothbrush)....this is a wonderful device!  I love it!  It gets my teeth (and gums) clean and they FEEL clean!  It is transportable and holds a charge for a good long time (up to a week)!  My old Sonicare just died after about 6 years, I think...but it could have been a little longer!  I do not want to be without my Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Wrote Philips as positive before against another brand toothbrush (when mine was you know, working) but will have to recant that statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I bought through Amazon as well so that it would show verified purchase...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had for slightly over a year.&lt;br /&gt;One day the thing just died..then a few days later started working again but only sporadically for 20 seconds and dying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pull the toothbrush head off to find the rubber gasket between the toothbrush head and the handle partially eroded.&lt;br /&gt;Not something that should happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this model bc it was supposedly the best of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Philips, they said the best they can do is give me a code for 15% off a new one from their site (which lists for $220 there, instead of 180 here) since mine is &#x27;out of warranty&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Then the agent ended the convo and asked me to take a customer satisfaction survey...&lt;br /&gt;Umm these things aren&#x27;t cheap. They should last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be buying this or their brand again anytime soon.</li>
            <li> This is very expensive, but I have to honestly say I love it.  It really gets your teeth clean. My dentist hygienist cannot believe how great my teeth look since I purchased this brush.  There is an internal timer that buzzes in your mouth when it&#x27;s time to rotate the brush to another quadrant in your mouth.  It ensures you spend enough time on each area of you mouth.  The brushes are awesome and it comes in a great travel kit with chargers and all.  If you can afford it, this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> excellent product - hope battery life is more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! My wife uses the small brush head and I use the other, larger one. Use this brush after a water pick nightly if you want healthy, white teeth and dentist-shockingly clean, pink gums. I have heard that super clean gums will lengthen your life; so, use if you want to live longer (alright, over the top.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product a couple of days, so I&#x27;ve only brushed with it a few times.  So far I&#x27;ve been very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;d like to use this review to comment on Phillip&#x27;s customer service.  The package I received came with everything expected.  However, the chrome charging base had a minor cosmetic defect; the chrome had a small gouge in it.  The defect was purely cosmetic and did not affect charging the toothbrush or placement of the glass or holder on top of it.  I debated just living with it (which I considered somewhat annoying on a premium product), or returning the order to Amazon for an exchange.  I decided to just call Phillip&#x27;s customer support to see what they would suggest.  The lady I talked to was friendly and professional and was set to send me a replacement charging base.  Unfortunately, the system didn&#x27;t allow her to select and send only the charging base, so she ended up sending me a full replacement kit and had me swap the base and send it back using the prepaid return label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m impressed with the great product and great support.  I&#x27;ll be updating my razor soon and will certainly shop Phillip&#x27;s products first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these units since late 2012. Overall I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; About a week ago it stopped charging fully and now, not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Sonicare web site I learned that this has a 2-year warranty so I called them. Customer service was pleasant (and located in Oklahoma).  Absolutely no question about coverage.  They&#x27;re sending me a new one by FedEx and are including a label to send the old one back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t ask for a better response than that.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare HealthyWhite model prior to purchasing the DiamondClean. I had this model for about four years, before it finally failed. My primary complaint with the old brush was where the brush head slid down onto the post getting moldy with the toothpaste buildup. To remedy this, I would remove the head at every charge cycle and use a q-tip to clean the inside and around the post on the toothbrush itself. After doing this for a few months, the shaft eventually broke, the the toothbrush head would just flex all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a coupon, sale and rebate from another vendor, off I went to buy a new Sonicare. I cannot imagine being without some form of Sonicare for the dentist clean teeth feeling everyday. I really liked the matte black model so that&#x27;s what I picked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off to charge it for the first time. Gone is the white and blue charging stand, replaced by a cup. Nifty idea, but your toothbrush gets set down on the sink, where all kinds of other stuff live. So the cup is pretty much useless unless you wipe down the brush prior to charging. The cup system takes more space than the original base as well. The toothbrush also comes with a micro USB charging system, which went right into my travel bag, and it hasn&#x27;t seen the light of day yet, even though I have traveled once. I ended up using a conventional toothbrush for the trip. It is a nice storage case with space for an extra head which does come with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting the device charge, usability is much like any other Sonicare, multiple button pushes change the brushing mode. There is one model which I believe has a separate button for this task, and if you prefer to change options frequently, I highly suggest you opt for that model. Otherwise you need to cycle through the modes with the brush on. Do it without any toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere along the line, I read that this new model will hold a charge for two weeks. I brush with the Sonicare twice daily on the whitening cycle, and that gives me 8 days worth of brushing. This is a one day improvement over my old unit, which also had the same whitening cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you feel a difference with the Diamondclean head? Yes. A bit. Enough to upgrade? No. You can use the head on some other model brushes, and I believe they all advertise 31,000 strokes per minute or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell if the head will break on this model as well due to the cleaning routine I utilize. With online registration, they do push the warranty to 2.5 years, which is pretty nice. The head does remove easier so I&#x27;m hopeful it will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly wouldn&#x27;t replace a functioning Sonicare with this model. If you find the right sale, coupon and or rebate, it&#x27;s a worthy model replacement option.the whitening cycle, and that gives me 8 days worth of brushing.

            <li> Great item, very easy to use. Just guide it around your teeth and gums and it does all the work. No force required.</li>
            <li> Purchased to place my Rodent toothbrush, which I have had since my dental braces. This was my second Sonicare brush and I had forgotten the wonderful experience that Sonicare. It left my mouth feel like I had been to the dentist. The first use removed a lot of plaque that my manual and Rodent didn&#x27;t seem to reach. I am glad that the purchase was made.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome!! Easy and convient to travel with and charge. Instant results after using it just one time!</li>
            <li> it is surprising how well this works, my gums feel better and my teeth feel clean....and even my dentist noticed how much healthier my gums were</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean after using this brush. I was surprised by how small the actual brush was and it took some getting used to. I like using it on the gum care setting.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in excellent condition, It works wonderfully.  Teeth feel as though professionally cleaned each time you use it.  love it.</li>
            <li> I felt like I just left the dentist office after having my teeth cleaned.  I wish I had purchased months ago.</li>
            <li> Wow! The best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve suffered for years with gum recession and I&#x27;ve been through several different types of toothbrushes and toothpastes. I used this brush for 3 months prior to my most recent Dentist visit and the Dentist asked &amp;#34;Wow, what did you change? You&#x27;re gums look great!&amp;#34; After 10 years of hearing about more and more recession it was a shock to the system to hear such positive feedback from the Dentist. This thing was a game-changer for me!</li>
            <li> I will most likely not purchase another Sonicare Toothbrush again.  My original brush of this model eventually stopped &amp;#34;giggling&amp;#34; the brush head which rendered it useless.  I did contact customer service and they replaced my handle as it was within the two year warranty.  Unfortunately, the replacement handle began to have the same issue, and when I re-contacted customer service, my original brush&#x27;s warranty was up and they would not do anything.  I also asked them to help me locate a vendor that could repair it for me and they said there are no repair locations.  So now I&#x27;m stuck with my nearly $200 toothbrush that&#x27;s useless.  Think again before purchasing this model and beware that outside of your warranty, if you have issues with the brush, nothing can be done.  What a shame, Phillips Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Little hard to figure out how the charging works, but was able to set it up and get it working.</li>
            <li> Love the feature that notifies you when you have brushed 30 seconds and it&#x27;s time to move to the next quarter of your mouth!!!</li>
            <li> It works about as well as the rest of the Sonic care line. The glass charger is cute, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it three months it is already not charging properly. I called to get a replacement and after a 20 minute wait and conversation, they agreed to send me a new handle.  I waited, waited, waited.  I called back two weeks later...they had no record of our conversation.  (They did not offer me a confirmation number the first time.)  I&#x27;d read on-line reviews that this had happened to others but had dismissed it...dumb me.  They have now agreed to send it by 2 day express.  I had a dental visit today and mentioned it to the staff.  They laughed and said that they recommended Oral B to their clients.</li>
            <li> After ordering, I was advised by email that the item could not be delivered. No explanation was given. Credit for my purchase was provided, but since this was a US $ purchase I lost out on the different exchange rate in versus out.</li>
            <li> first came from a higher end oral-b electric toothbrush. I recently had oral surgery and beforehand had a special cleaning with a ultrasonic-esque pick. Afterwards my mouth felt more clean than it ever has even after prior dental cleanings and thus began my hunt for a brush that could come close to that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my friends has been a longtime user of the diamond clean after receiving it as a gift and raved about it(not knowing it was the top model at the time). I purchased it that night and figured worst case scenario I can return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy cow I have had it for a week and my teeth have never felt cleaner. I usually gate brushing my teeth because my teeth never really feel all that clean after. Now I find myself brushing 3 times a day. After a week I can already see a difference in how white my teeth are as can my friends and girlfriend. There is an introductory setting that can be turned off if you are familiar with electric toothbrushes or kept on if your aren&#x27;t used to the \\&quot;tickle\\&quot; of the brush. There are multiple settings that change the length of brushing and based on the sound of the toothbrush, the frequency in which it moves. I prefer the whitening mode. I never thought of adjusting the mode mid brush. I tend to change to my desired mode before I stay brushing and just turn the brush off before applying tooth paste and thus eliminating the toothpaste all over the mirror. Why would you even consider putting toothpaste on an electric brush and turning it on when it isn&#x27;t in your mouth anyway? Rookie mistake. Regardless, my parents used to rave about their top model oral b until one visit I picked up some standard sonicare brush heads to they could try my toothbrush. After using oral b for over 12 years they could not believe how much better their mouths felt after using the sonicare diamond so they decided to make the jump. I personally love the glass. I have a lot of counter space and the ability to just set it in the cup to chargeand not have to make sure is in the correct way is fantastic, besides, who doesn&#x27;t like to rinse after they clean. During the summer I enjoy going camping. I just came back from my first tenting trip of the season and the charging case was fantastic. Even though I gave up electricity for a long weekend, I was able to keep my brush charged in the case so I could still have a clean mouth and still feel civilized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to trying some additional whitening strips as I now feel my brush can finally keep my teeth clean and white. I have not tried lower end sonicare models but I can tell you that this model won&#x27;t disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t try to charge it on a metal surface as it won&#x27;t charge. I won&#x27;t go into the science regarding why but you have a better chance of keeping the water flowing from your faucet by blocking it with your finger.</li>
            <li> If you care anything about your smile or if you have spent a fortune on your dental care like I have, this item is a must.  My teeth feel great and my confidence has jumped considerable after only a week of using this product.  You can feel the difference it makes in your brushing and overall dental hygiene. Great investment!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this toothbrush for the last two years: my teeth were minty clean, no grimy buildup throughout the day (and even prevented it overnight); my breath was fresh for the rest of the day, and charges lasted for 2 weeks at a time so that was all great. However, this model is very poorly designed - the metal rod on which the toothbrush head is placed became loose and completely stripped the metal around it from the vibration. Toothbrush heads no longer stay, they pop right off as soon as I power on the toothbrush. I thought of trying to use some JB Weld or superglue gel to keep the metal rod in place but figured it would destroy the mechanics anyway, and could potentially damage my teeth. For almost $200, a freaking toothbrush shouldn&#x27;t die so quickly from something preventable! Additionally, the cheapest I could find the toothbrush heads for was $19 for a two-pack on eBay; ridiculous!!! They only last about 2 months so having to spend $60 a year on toothbrush heads alone is absolutely insane. I am now looking into Oral B/Braun since I don&#x27;t want to risk blowing a huge amount of money on another Philips sonic toothbrush, only to have it conveniently break shortly after the warranty expires :(</li>
            <li> Ok so this thing is totally legit! Teeth are whiter, feel cleaner and look better. It really helps the gums and stuff. It does not replace flossing so keep that up but definitely does a good job. My only beef with this nifty piece of equipment is that there are NO INSTRUCTIONS!! I am a bit old school and read directions about how things works and don&#x27;t want to go online all day. I went to the Dentist and they had to tell me how to use it and how to hold the brush, etc. Philips, I do not have time to go online and look something up every time I do not understand something. I paid almost $200 for this piece of equipment. Please include some tips and instructions. It would help everyone...and don&#x27;t charge extra money either. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have used. The cleanness you can clearly felt right away. .</li>
            <li> This is pricy, over-designed, but the brushing works well.  My dentist once told me that teeth are supposed to be smooth like porcelain and I didn&#x27;t believe him until I got this toothbrush.  While the brushing works, the whole thing is over-accessorized, over-designed, and indeed expensive.  I have had this for more than two years and the cost of the replacement heads does add up.  As for the design, I can&#x27;t see or change the setting without the brush being active, and yes, finding that out was messy.  Perhaps that&#x27;s why I almost never change the setting.  The many bits and pieces that came with the unit are not really needed either.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It felt like I received a professional cleaning from my dentist on the first brushing!  It is very easy to use and just works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> We had the Oral-B toothbrush, which worked well, but my hygenist has been recommending this brush so we decided to give it a try. It really is a fantastic toothbrush, and is a much different experience. I don&#x27;t love the glass for charging, but it also includes a regular stand-up base that you can use instead. I could already start feeling a difference in my gums after just a few times using this toothbrush, and I look forward to seeing if my hygenist notices a difference next time I go in for a visit.</li>
            <li> Like going to the dentist every single day!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Teeth feel so clean and dual voltage is a plus for traveling!</li>
            <li> Have had this about two weeks and am pretty impressed. My teeth are whiter and I know my dental hygienist is going to pleased on my next visit. Nice charging options.</li>
            <li> My experience (and yours may of course vary) was that this was an excellent toothbrush provided one did not expect it to last more than a year. Phillips replaced my first brush that I had owned just under a year when it stopped working. Then the replacement lasted around a year before the on-off button stopped working, causing the brush to run continuously until exhausting its charge--then being unable to turn on again. A very nice product, but replacing it once a year means the cost, not including replacement heads, is around $15-$16/mo. Too costly and inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare back in the 90&#x27;s that was my favorite toothbrush and kept my gums healthy. I floss daily, but was always getting compliments from hygienists/dentists. When it finally died, I tried Braun a couple of times, but the small head really made it feel like the cleaning power just wasn&#x27;t there. When the most recent one died after 9 months, I decided to go back to Sonicare - so glad I did! Yes, it was a little more expensive, as are the replacement heads, but it works well and I love the cup charger.</li>
            <li> I have owned a couple of Sonicare&#x27;s and have been happy with them all. They were recommended by my Dentist and definitely do a better job of cleaning your teeth and reducing plaque. I bought this model to eliminate the need to share one with my wife and I am very happy I did. It is a step up from our other model, quieter and more versatile for traveling and charging. It is quiet and the grip is very comfortable. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> my best toothbrush ever!! love the feeling of polish teeth, without too uch work or having to hurt your gums you know?</li>
            <li> Update 2/16/15.  Well, as of 2/15/15 the toothbrush went crazy.  It&#x27;s making strange noises along with sounding like an airplance is landing and at a crazy speed.  Amazon doesn&#x27;t take back these type of items with it being 45 days old (their policy 30 days).  So, I&#x27;m stuck with a very expensive electric toothbrush which \\&quot;I\\&quot; (not Amazon) will have to deal with the manufacturer to get it hopefully replaced ...especially how darn expensive it was.  I feel let down after all that I have bought from Amazon.  ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________    This is a great electric toothbrush and much more! My teeth look so shiny white and it cleans like nothing else. But the BIG plus is the \\&quot;gum\\&quot; setting. My gums started receding as I hit my mid-sixties. The instrumental is wonderful in how it slowly but surely is helping my problem. I do like all the settings (wow, it can do everything)! Very easy to use (I never had used an electric one) and so easy to clean after use. I really like that it holds a 3 week charge, too! I would \\&quot;highly recommend\\&quot; to anyone. I&#x27;m going to keep using this product and when it wears out, I&#x27;ll even replace with same product . . .it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel as if I just left the dentist office. I think my teeth also are whiter.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny! The best tooth brush hands down I have ever owned.  I get a dentist clean with every use. The battery lasted 3 weeks with one charge! The shipment came earlier then expected. The box was a little bagged up, nothing inside was damaged at all.  personally I have trouble receiving packages through The Post Office for some unexplainable reason, So I&#x27;d prefer that this and all items came/come from UPS instead (Also UPS has better tracking options) but other than that I have no problems with this supplier and will be continuously doing business with this supplier in the future.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a sonic toothbrush and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it so far. I tend to brush very hard when I use manual toothbrushes, to the point of making my gums bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare broke me of that habit while leaving my teeth feeling cleaner than they were before. You end up with a milder version of that \\&quot;from the dentist\\&quot; feeling every morning. It&#x27;s not a true dental instrument, but I&#x27;m hoping that it will help loosen plaque and whiten my teeth over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the short term, the Sonicare has made my daily routine relaxing and fun, making me more inclined to brush. The timer makes me brush thoroughly every time, breaking years of bad habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d purchased one of these years ago. Would have saved me a fortune in professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d look forward to brushing my teeth, but WOW! They feeling and results simply can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my older Sonicare. I like this, but I find it more difficult to grip than the flex+ and since there is only one button, sometimes instead of turning off it switches modes. It still does clean just as well.</li>
            <li> Received it right before Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Electric toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is a little expensive, but totally worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> If you can afford it, this is as nice a brush as you can buy it today.  Well built, excellent design and it holds charges for weeks.  The case with the USB charge is thoughtful design element. The hold thing make it discreet for traveling.  I highly recommend this items for most of the geeks out there.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare tooth brushes since they first came out, this is my 4th.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the carrying case although I&#x27;m not quite sold on the value of USB (a minor point though as you can still use a wall adapter).&lt;br /&gt;I like the prop stand to support the brush upright.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure that the settings on the brush do anything other than extend the time of brushing.  They could just list them as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is on par with my last brush, I like how sleek and clean the connection between the brush tip and the body of the brush is.&lt;br /&gt;The glass to drop the brush in is just silly.&lt;br /&gt;Would love to see a better power cord.  These thick cords don&#x27;t bend well which means it&#x27;s gonna hang in my sink with the way my bathroom is designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really like the brush and I agree that it&#x27;s hard to improve on a product that was already so good.  The updates are thoughtful. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The DiamondClean replaced my SonicCare e-series, which I wore out.  The SonicCare was good, the DiamondClean is great!  If you have the money and three minutes a day times two, you may never have a breath, gum, or dental problem again.  Noticeable difference over the SonicCare, I can&#x27;t imagine how much difference this would make over a manual brush!</li>
            <li> Its a great toothbrush when it works. A little after the 2-year warranty expired my DiamondClean developed a problem with the shaft. When I put normal pressure on it to brush, it has no power. If I manually push it the other way it is fine. No way to disassemble and fix means I have to buy a new one. ~$200 for 24 months is not a great value.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  It works great and I like the different options you are able to select by just pushing the button.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush after my hygienist &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34; it (my regular tooth brush and technique weren&#x27;t cutting it).  Although a bit pricey, I am happy to say that it&#x27;s worth every penny.  I&#x27;ve noticed how much cleaner my teeth are and more importantly, so has my hygienist.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with this purchase. After much research online I decided this would be the best toothbrush for me and haven&#x27;t been disappointed. Gives your teeth a really good clean although the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as claimed.</li>
            <li> i was hesitant to use an electric toothbrush, remembering the old one my dad used to use, so loud and messy (and ugly on the countertop), but after using the DiamondClean for about a month, I&#x27;m very happy with its results. its claims to whiten teeth after 1 week was true in my case (but i also cut out common staining consumables like teas and coffee). the DiamondClean has a mode to get you used to the ultrasonic vibrations, but i bypassed that. it did tickle one area at first, but after 2 days, i got used to it. there are five brushing modes, but i don&#x27;t use all of them (only Clean and Gum Care). it has 2 brushing heads: 1 standard and 1 compact head. i rated it 4/5 stars only cuz even though i feel the brush head against the surfaces of my teeth and gum line, i still miss a few spots, but just in tiny crevices, so i think i&#x27;ll be buying the sensitive brush heads since they&#x27;re softer and can navigate around curves better IMO. overall, it really does leave my teeth smooth like having come from the dentist. highly recommended!</li>
            <li> love it the best toothbrush available</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is not worth the $200 retail price.  My husband is finishing out dental school so got a special discount on two of these.  I was thrilled because I was still using my old OralB from 8 years ago and was ready to try something new.  This brush was great for about 1 year.  Then the button got really hard to press - when running hot water over it brown gunk started coming out.  I was disgusted, I am a freak and take the brush head off and rinse both pieces individually then dry them both after EVERY brushing.  Then about 2 weeks later the brush started turning on by itself in the middle of the night, then it went dead and stopped working altogether.  At the exact same time (about 1 year) my husbands just stopped working at all.  We contacted customer service and although they are replacing the brushes, they were absolutely HORRIBLE to work with.  Do NOT waste your money - if I could get a refund, I would buy a new OralB.  I will never spend another cent on a Sonicare</li>
            <li> We had been wanting to try this toothbrush for a while and finally got one.  We have been using it now for several years and still really love the product.  If you are ready to invest in a good electric toothbrush I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Wow, sonic is an understatement.  This thing is intense.  It&#x27;s fantastic.  Expensive too.  But not having teeth sucks, I think.  I don&#x27;t want to find out.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare Elite, and ever since they started selling Sonicare at Walmart, the product has gone wayyyyy downhill.  The battery barely lasted a year.  Once it died I didn&#x27;t bother with the warranty, I upgraded.  This brush scrubs your teeth way better and leaves you feeling like you did when you first experienced Sonicare.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist. She did not specifically recommend the diamond. After using it for three weeks, I think I could have easily purchased the less expensive model and have been equally satisfied.</li>
            <li> This new model has a change in design. It has thinner better shape. Has innovatibe charging capability through computer USB port (which I haven&#x27;t used yet). It holds the charge nicely and I have used it on short travels of 3 to 4 days without any probem.&lt;br /&gt;1 star less...it pricy.</li>
            <li> I read those reviews about the look &amp; functionality of this model, and after 4 months using this I agree with most of those who said this is an &amp;#34;apple&amp;#34; type toothbrush. It&#x27;s good-looking, and I like the weight it feels when I&#x27;m holding it. It&#x27;s almost ceramic-feeling. And the charging method is also fancy enough for people who like pretty, modern design. As for it&#x27;s functionality... It&#x27;s been my first electronic toothbrush, and I have to admit that it&#x27;s far much better than common plastic toothbrushes. My teeth have never feel so clean. I normally use the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; mode which provide two more rounds in brushing. Not really bleaching your teeth, of course, but I do feel cleaner by brushing for slightly more time. I have been traveling for a month, and the recharger works just fine in different countries. All you need is an adaptor; or you can charge it on the computer. As a first-time user of Philip&#x27;s Sonicare series, I&#x27;m happy with this toothbrush, but I&#x27;m not sure if I want to spend so much money again when I need to buy my next electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> One of my best friends ranted and raved over this brush.  It was recommended to him by a close friend who works as a dental hygenist who was emphatic that this brush is a must. She recommends them to all her clients.  I was a little hesitant because of the price.  Our family is on a tight budget and I really didn&#x27;t want to waste money on a product that wasn&#x27;t truly worth it.  However, since having a baby my gums felt horrible.  I knew I had deep pockets and while pregnant I could barely tolerate keeping up with my normal regimen of cleaning.  Post baby hasn&#x27;t been much better as I have been absolutely sleep deprived.  It had gotten to the point that certain areas were pretty painful to floss or water pik and I knew they must be getting really bad and felt just hopeless since I could barely tolerate trying to clean these areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two days I observed a noticeable decrease in pain! The first day I used the brush three times.  I noticed one of the worst areas of my mouth was slightly inflammed but the next day it felt much better. Also, when I flossed, I had such a noticeable decrease of any plaque.  I had no idea how poorly my manual brushing had done.  I just thought that it was normal.  The next day I used the brush five times, basically after eating each time, flossing and water piking as well.  I just can&#x27;t get over how dramatically the pain has decreased in my mouth after TWO DAYS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel very hopeful about at least stemming the tide of any damage my mouth has experienced, I have a dramatic decrease in pain after only two days.  I love the sensation of this toothbrush as I clean, it is like having your mouth lovingly massaged.  I will never go back to a manual toothbrush again.  I actually look forward to brushing my mouth.  My mouth feels so clean, soothed and refreshed that I find myself brushing after I eat to maintain that clean feeling. I only wish I had known this years ago because I would be a lot better off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it with a grain of salt, this is coming from someone who used a manual and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s part of it.  Are there cheaper electronic toothbrushes that work as well, perhaps. The design is very sleek and modern.  Is that reason enough to invest this kind of money? That&#x27;s up to you.  I purchased this mainly because of how emphatic my friend&#x27;s friend, a dental hygenist, was about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like some other reviewers mentioned, I wish that you could shift modes before turning it on.  I noticed now it seems to stay in the mode you left off at. It&#x27;s not a horrible inconvenience, I can definitely live with it.  Also having a way to code the heads for multiple users would be nice as well.  I&#x27;ve just taken to using the compact head so that solves that for me.</li>
            <li> been using sonicare through their first generation models and this one has improved, as it should! i really dig the matte finish on the body for more of a grip when wet. the different modes are a plus, and the 3 week battery life is superb. i simply wished the brush heads it came with are slightly larger. the travel case is very nice!</li>
            <li> SATISFIED SO FAR&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS PRODUCT FROM SONICARE. HAD AN EARLIER VERSION OF A SONICARE BUT IT HAD ONLY ONE SETTING THAT WAS TOO HARSE ON MY SENSITIVE TEETH. LOVE THIS MODEL. ALITTLE ON THE EXPENSIVE SIDE BUT WELL WORTH IT TO ME. THIS ONE HAS A SENSITIVE SETTING WHICH I ONLY USE EACH TIME I BRUSH. I ORDERED ALSO THE ULTRA SENSITIVE BRUSH HEADS 3 IN A PACK TO GO ALONG WITH IT FOR MY NEEDS. VERY SATISFIED WITH BOTH PRODUCTS SO FAR.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive, but feels like the dentist just cleaned your teeth every day.  I have not had it long enough to judge the reliability yet.  Also, the directions do not make it clear what the difference is between the different operating modes.</li>
            <li> This broke after a little over 24 months of use. Very expensive toothbrush with poor reliability.</li>
            <li> This was an eye opener for me.  My teeth feel as smooth and clean as just having been to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Much better than standard electric brush.</li>
            <li> LOVE my sonicare toothbrush....very sleek and clean, brushes well, and notifies you when it needs to be recharged. Travels well too!</li>
            <li> has been using ORAL B in the past 10 years, I usually buy a new set within 2 years and spent averagely 150-200 for the each Oral B,, I did like then , the feel the built quanlity and the floss action brush head are the reasons, well after my last Oral b triumph stopped working after I dropped it, I decided try someting else, there are not many options -- Oral B or Philips, after few days of search I bought a HX9332-- the retail vision not the one in the white box, however after I opened the box I found on the brush handel it says HX9340(a Canadian vision？） after first few days of  use, I really liked it, the handel feels good even better than my old Triumph,  it gives milder cleaning than the Triumph,Philips dose not provides  floss action with their&#x60;s brush heads which I liked very much,  about 8days after first 24 hours fully charged the yellow led started flash, I brush twice--4 mins in total a day, manul says it should last around 3 weeks per charge, even my two years old Triumph can still gives a little more two weeks of brush after a fully charge,it gives me 7 days on the second charge,  third charge  only gives me 5 days of use before the yellow LED flashs again,I like the way it cleans and how the handel feels in hand, but the battery life is way to short.  and the brush heads are expensive. I think I probably will go back to Oral B due to the short battery life.    Update, they send me a brand new unit after I called Philips, and a prepaid waybill inside the box as well, how great is that, much better customer service than Oral B, thanks Philips</li>
            <li> This one is hard to give appropriate stars for. It is an absolutely fabulous toothbrush. It does a great job! But this will be our third one in four years. They keep dying. So five stars for being a great power brush. And one star for longevity.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is far better than my 10 year old Sonicare, which finality stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with it although it takes a little time getting used to the faster head rotation.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it was a good decision and purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I wash my hair and I love the way oil feels in hair..</li>
            <li> Great but expensive. $$$</li>
            <li> Notice, the is not glass in the set!</li>
            <li> I likley spent too much on this but in the quest to replace my old sonicare this seemed to be the likley successor. What I like is this model collects less gunk at the base of the brush, the glass is easier to keep clean and the travel charger/case has eliminated the need to invest in battery operated models for travel. I do find the tilted angle of the brush while charging a bit off putting but in the end it does not get in the way. The controls can be a bit aggravating/messy if you switch gears. Also the new brushes while giving an excetional cleaning do wear out a bit quicker. Overall I do not regret my investment.</li>
            <li> I love it and so does my dentist. Great for home and travel use. I highly recommend this product for anyone that travels for a living like me. Holds a charge for a really long time and gets your teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> The quality is very poor.Bought not long before, the base is broken.Very disappointing.The quality is very poor.Bought not long before, the base is broken.Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now had seven of these toothbrushes trying to get one with a battery lasting anything close to the claimed life. Three of the seven came from Amazon, the other four came from Philips directly. The batery life I got from these seven brushes was typically 6 days. The life ranged from 5-10 days, but was usually 6 days--that&#x27;s only 12 uses!--nowhere near the 21 days they boldly advertise. Combined with the other flaws I mentioned below and the price of this product, I now give it one star. $180 for a six-day battery in a slippery toothbrush is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last brush is going back to Philips. We&#x27;ll see if they honor their \\&quot;money back guarantee\\&quot; or not. I can say their Customer Service was always friendly and willing to keep trying to solve the inherent design flaws of this product. Replacements did not always arrive quickly, but they were always friendly on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans well but there are design and production problems with this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it is slippery. There are no rubber areas to help grip, and the shape is also not helpful for holding. Easy to have it slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switching modes using the power button is only good if you never witch modes. It you do want to switch, you need to push the power button to turn on the brush, count the number of pushed required to get to the mode you want and push that many times. Ridiculous. There should be two buttons like there are on the kids Sonicare--one for power, one for mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My battery last eight days. Fortunately I reported it to Amazon within the 30 day period and so am getting a refund. If you get one, be sure to thoroughly check your right away!</li>
            <li> Just like the professional cleaning or a little better as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Love the long charge that it holds!.  All the different settings are great!</li>
            <li> Awesome brush, make sure you utilize the diamond brushing heads.  This product will make your dentist happy!</li>
            <li> This is my second sonicare &amp; I am very pleased.  The 1 st one I owned was effective, but I did not like how stuff would get in between the base &amp; heads.  So I bought the more up to date styles where there was a smaller chance of that happening.</li>
            <li> Maybe overkill in the cost and quality for the task but can you really overspend on hygiene?  Love the travel case.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  My dentist recommended for me.  I think it&#x27;s fabulous and cleans better than any toothbrush I used.  EVER!</li>
            <li> the best tooth brush ever made #LOVE</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this toothbrush, which was recommended to me by my dentist. It looks great and the charging case is pretty cool. Feels nice in the hand. Unfortunately, it just stops charging after a few minutes and I have to lift it and resume the charge. You&#x27;re supposed to charge it for 24 continuous hours before using it. I&#x27;ve had this on the charger for six days straight and it is still charging, because of the constant stalls. For a $200 toothbrush, this is unacceptable. I see from comments online that this is a very common problem with this device. I&#x27;m returning mine.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these about 3 months apart, one for work and one at home. For the one year they both worked, they were great. However, the motor mechanisms on both failed after about a year. For the price, I was hoping for something that would last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using various models of this toothbrush since the late 80&#x27;s.  I would not  use any other toothbrush.  It gets your teeth beyond clean and removes tartar most effectively.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but then, so are bad teeth.  My dental hygienist is always amazed at how little tartar build-up is on my teeth.  I recommend this toothbrush to everyone..</li>
            <li> Does a great job!! Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has a few cool features and upgrades, including a setting selection template that is lit from within, a slimmer handle, and a metal base that resists mildew. I love it!</li>
            <li> No more Sonicare for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their brushes work well, but they stop working within a year or or year and a half in our experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s far too much to pay for a toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t last, and that has a built-in battery that when it dies you can&#x27;t replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We actually never even got around to using all of the three toothbrush heads we bought before the last one broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we did some research and switched to much less expensive basic models from Oral-B.  (Oral-B is made in Germany, not China like Sonicare is.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had very few complaints with the Sonicare and did see an improvement at the dentist -- until they all stopped working in a very short period of time relative to the expense of buying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the improvement over using a manual toothbrush is minimal if you set a timer and do a full two minutes with the manual.  The UV-sanitizer sold with some models is also a gimmick, and doesn&#x27;t really do what&#x27;s claimed according to my research.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is great but mine broke after 6 months. Luckily it was under warranty and phillips has a great process to repair / replace these things... 2-3 days later I had a new brush that worked great... That said I am worried it will break down again after warranty... If it does I&#x27;ll update this review...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for a little over a year and has has half the regular use  (only use it for travel).  Now, the metal connector on the brush has broke and it completly worthless.</li>
            <li> My sister highly recommended this product so I bit the bullet and spent the money. Its great. Feels like I just had my teeth professionally cleaned every time I use it.</li>
            <li> My dentist could see improvement after only thee months. Love it</li>
            <li> great! i love it... the toothbrush heads are a bit pricey, but well worth it in my opinion. really gets your teeth clean</li>
            <li> I had the earlier version of the sonicare brush and it was great until i broke it. Went back to a manual for 2 months and will never do that again. This Diamondclean brush is the REAL DEAL! a little on the expensive side but if you want your mouth clean, this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s deal with the elephant in the room first - this is a very expensive toothbrush.  There are plenty of cheaper options (including other Sonicares) that will be just as effective in cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why did I rate this 5 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Charging case.  I used to travel extensively and still travel occasionally so minimizing what I need to carry when traveling is always a good thing.  All I need to bring is an appropriate USB cable (I use only that is only 6\\&quot; long instead of the supplied one).  Just plug it into my laptop to avoid needing to carry the AC adapter.  That might not sound like a big deal but I&#x27;ve had problems with old electric toothbrushes not lasting the whole trip and my work backpack already weighs nearly 30 lbs so any time I can carry less I&#x27;m all for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Charging cup.  Charging stands waste space in small bathrooms. I need a cup in the bathroom anyway so it&#x27;s quite convenient to have it pull double duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are those two features worth paying double for a basic Sonicare? For me they are.  Your mileage may vary ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the white one for about 3 years, and recently purchased the pink one that I gave as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;If I could change ONE THING it would be that the travel case uses a _mini-USB port_ INSTEAD of the more universal _micro-USB port.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I bought mine 3 years ago the package came with both the mouthwash glass charger and the plastic stand.  The pink one I purchased as a gift did not have the plastic stand, which is nice because it takes up less counter space.</li>
            <li> This thing literally gets in the smallest crevices of your teeth! I felt a difference IMMEDIATELY and will never go back to using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to using boring tooth brushes! I love my sonicare Diamond toothbrush! I just got braces too and they work really good at getting all the yuckies out! I recommend this product to everyone! Well worth my money!</li>
            <li> great toothbrush. its a bit pricey but once you see it in person you know you have received a great product. its just true that you get what you pay for. bought this after being told by the dentist (first visit in a decade) that i have advanced periodontal disease and really need to up my game in home dental care. they recommended soniccare. decided to buy this top of the line one after looking at the great price on amazon. i love the charger. its so convenient to just have it charge in the cup holder. the travel case is brilliant. well built case with the charging outlet included. the charge lasts us 15-20 at least with me and my wife using it (different tips of course :) ) twice a day. so i would say it lasts a long time. i know i am not going back to a manual toothbrush after this.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered promptly in a well protected package.  The Sonicare performs as advertised.  Its as if you have just come from the dentist.  Does a great job of stimulating your gums.</li>
            <li> No, it did not meet my expectation though it works good and gives good result, but its battery life is short. I have it for less than a year but the battery is dead and not recharging any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like its cleaning result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because of the battery</li>
            <li> Dropped my first one once and it broke. Had It warrantied through bestbuy. Received a replacement brush and the same thing happened. I have had sonicare toothbrushes for over 10 years and the quality of this model is the worst ever.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the best purchase I have made in my lifetime, not an exaggeration. If you do not have a Sonicare DiamondClean, or at the very least some other electronic toothbrush, you are living in the Paleolithic Era of dental hygiene. With the DiamondClean I legitimately look forward to brushing my teeth - three times a day - because of how fresh and clean my mouth feels after use. It is literally like a miniature personal dentist. Its streamlined features make it cool to look at and almost mistakable as an Apple product. Its ease of use and futuristic look are only exceeded by its effectiveness, and I have and will continue to recommend to anyone and everyone that will listen.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality product. Would recommend This toothbrush to anyone. I like the feel of the finish on the powerhead and the charging unit is awesome</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it it so much that I look forward to brushing my teeth everyday!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using philips sonicare for many years now and nothing compares.  This model is very nice and looks to be made better than the last model.  The charger is pretty interesting as well.</li>
            <li> Makes my entire mouth feel clean great toothbrush. Has several settings and recharges by sitting in a cup which is cool.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare was getting old and the battery would not hold a charge for more than a couple of uses which made it difficult on a trip.  The old one must have been 20-years old so I upgrade to the DiamondClean.  The smaller heads are nice.  It is easier to get to the teeth way in the back.  It seems to work a aggressively as the earlier model.  I like it.</li>
            <li> second one bought, last one wore out after many years of use, good bit of kit</li>
            <li> Great product. Cleans my teeth perfectly. Wish i had bought this product long time ago, only problem is charge doesnt go 3 weeks as advertised, mine only goes like 4-5 days with  2-3 times brushing a day. Also fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Using this regularly is probably the single best thing I&#x27;ve ever done for my dental health. My dentist noticed a substantial reduction in mineral deposits, and my gums got a good deal more healthy. Not as good as flossing, but the results were pretty impressive! The biggest challenge was getting into the habit of using it every single day.</li>
            <li> Love it! I also love the travel case!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums, and this toothbrush seems more gentle than the Oral B I previously used.  It also is closer to the way one would brush with a manual with its up and down, as opposed to spinning motion.  The aesthetics are also very nice--beautiful glass charger cup, which is easy to clean, and a small, light handle.  The other electric tooth brush chargers I have had collect residue and must be disassembled and are difficult to clean.I must say, however, that the Oral B does seem to clean a bit better, although I didn&#x27;t often use it because it felt rather rough.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these as a gift at Christmas because they were on sale here and it was a good value.  Having bought Philips Sonicare electric toothbrushes in the past,  I was confident in the product line.  It arrived on time and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I had to replace the last of my Ultrasonex II&#x27;s, because they are no longer available and my wife has laid claim to our last spare once hers dies.  The older battery/charging mechanism deteriorated to the point that the toothbrush no longer functioned at an acceptable level.  While not a match for an Ultrasonex in working order, this Sonicare is a very good toothbrush --- probably the best of those now available.  At the highest setting the brushing action is vigorous, just short of being unpleasant, and as a result it seems to be nearly as effective as the Ultrasonex in getting one&#x27;s teeth clean.  So, for that alone, four stars.  It has a variety of lesser (selectable) cleaning cycles, but I don&#x27;t use anything but the maximum.  Minor aggravations include the tiny brush head, which is OK for cleaning around one&#x27;s teeth but makes &amp;#34;whole mouth&amp;#34; brushing tedious.  Also, the side to side vibration is vigorous, and one quickly learns to brush with one&#x27;s lips together to keep from splattering toothpaste droplets all over the bathroom.  That, I suppose, comes with the territory.  On the bright side, the battery technology is modern, and with luck should last significantly longer before it deteriorates to the point of replacement.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law has the Sonicare and described it as giving your teeth \\&quot;a whole other level of clean...,\\&quot; so I decided to give it a try.  I got the DiamondClean, since it seemed to be the latest-and-greatest.  I got it while I was traveling on business and started using it on my trip.  I must say, from the vert first use, my teeth felt much cleaner than with regular brushing or with any old-fashioned electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.  It took one or two brushings to get over the ticklish feeling, and to stop whacking my teeth with the brush, but it wasn&#x27;t a hard adjustment at all.  I also found the travel box to be very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew my teeth felt cleaner, and I thought they looked brighter, but thought perhaps it was my imagination; however, when I got home, my husband commented on how bright my smile was.  I am not sure whether over the long term they will continue to get cleaner and whiter (I&#x27;ve only been using it for just under two weeks), but there was a noticeable difference in the first week.  My husband had scoffed at the idea of buying the Sonicare.  He hadn&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush for decades, and thought they were not any better than brushing by hand.  But, after noticing how clean my teeth were, he gave it a try and was also impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how the Sonicare will perform long term, but I&#x27;m very pleased with how it is working so far!</li>
            <li> Set Came complete and on time. Works great. Love the travel case. My teeth feel so much cleaner and love the different timer settings</li>
            <li> Super ergonomic features and smart buttons makes it very simple to use.  The carrying case is great and the charging lasts much longer than you would ever have a need to worry about while using it at home near a charging station.</li>
            <li> Second sonicare toothbrush and it works great.  Has multiple settings and the charging glass is a nice accessory.  Also the travel case that is charged with a USB cable.</li>
            <li> Excellnet toothbrush...Amazing...Many wonder if it works on 220-240 Voltage, and yes it works (also on 110 V, USA). It can also be charged on USB (electric and from any other devices such as your laptop etc). So happy with this investment</li>
            <li> I have been using sonicare since the first generation came out. Bought this last year and within 3 months the charger broke and I just rely on the travel case charger! The toothbrush also started to have problem last month just 1 year and now completely not working even though the battery indicator shows it is fully charged.  Not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I bought this one 2year and 8 month ago, Now it doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t the reason. I just use it as usual.</li>
            <li> ive had this tooth brush for a year on the same battery and it works grate it will last for ever it a grate low price thank you</li>
            <li> it is good and works as stated. I have owned 4 different soniccare brushes and this one is the best</li>
            <li> My dad wanted this, so I got it for him. I assume since it was so much more than a double pack at Costco, that it&#x27;s better? Who knows. It&#x27;s a toothbrush. It cleans your teeth. I use one every day. I still don&#x27;t floss, cause flossing sucks.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> Best looking toothbrush ever!!! the only one I am proud of having in my bathroom&lt;br /&gt;The magic backlighting, the ceramic finish, the minimal conductive glass.&lt;br /&gt;The integrated timer is really nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative point : not easy to change modes, you have to go through every modes to go back to the previous...you obviously need a mirror to know which one you are using...</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush!  I&#x27;ve been using an electric toothbrush for many years, but never wanted to spend the extra money for one as sophisticated as the DiamondClean.  After wanting it for several months I just couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about it so I finally decided to take the plunge and figured if I was going to invest that much in a toothbrush then I was going to buy the very best one because my teeth are worth it and boy am I glad I did.  My previous electronic toothbrushes don&#x27;t even compare to this one and now I&#x27;m hooked and even the feeling afterward is different than any I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  Not only do my teeth and gums feel super clean, but they feel healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it for just under a month and haven&#x27;t even tested all the settings, but I&#x27;m a Diet Coke drinker so I plan to start using the whitening setting this week.  Another FABULOUS thing about this toothbrush is that it keeps a charge for 3 weeks which was like an answer to my prayers because I have 3 items on my bathroom sink (including my toothbrush) that have to stay plugged in so being able to eliminate an extra cord really made a difference in the neatness.  Also, the noise with my previous toothbrush was very loud and if a family member was trying to talk to me while I was brushing my teeth the noise was so distracting that I couldn&#x27;t even pay attention or could barely hear what they were saying so they had to wait until I finished.  However, the DiamondClean is a completely different story because it&#x27;s so quiet that I can hear conversations without any distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the beeps that prompt you to move to another quadrant so I&#x27;m not constantly looking at the clock to see when 30 seconds are up.  I also love all the charging options.  The one for travel is awesome because I travel a bit then there are 2 options for charging at home and in all honesty I think the little glass idea is too cute!  If you are in the market for a new toothbrush Ihighly recommend this one.  I mean if you&#x27;re going to spend over $100 for a brush you may as well purchase the best one for your money.  Seriously this toothbrush has opened a whole new world of oral care for me and I will never go back.  I&#x27;m just sorry I didn&#x27;t do it much sooner!</li>
            <li> Best Sonicare there is!</li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing machine that removes plaque and leaves your teeth smooth and shining.  You&#x27;ll immediately notice the difference.  It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I owned a Flexcare system for 3 years and it started flaking out - power switch became erratic.  But that had gotten a lot of use - 3 times a day at least.  Before the Flexcare, I used the cheap models from the grocery store and those failed so quickly I could have paid for a Flexcare with what I spent on them - you get what you pay for in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is more aggressive / powerful than the Flexcare - I don&#x27;t know how it compares to the Flexcare+. The brush seems stiffer too - I like it better for those reasons.  But there are a few negatives as well - there&#x27;s no rubber grip and the single power button / function button is not as handy as two buttons were.  When turning it off, if too soon after turning it on, it will cycle through all the functions rather than turning off - which is sometimes what I want and sometimes not - seems like a form over function design decision. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- powerful&lt;br /&gt;- brush seems stiff enough to work well&lt;br /&gt;- charging setup with included &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34; is pretty slick&lt;br /&gt;- carrying case with integrated USB charger - charge while in case - nice&lt;br /&gt;- it looks nice - beautifully designed (even if slightly unhandy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- no grip, which may look sleek, but makes it difficult to keep the thing from slipping through your hand while brushing - I may get some sort of grip tape for it.&lt;br /&gt;- single button control for power and functions; makes quick on/off difficult as it will cycle through the settings rather than power off - not the best design&lt;br /&gt;- no UV brush sterilizing system like the Flexcare has - I never used it that much, but liked having it integrated into the charger - now I have to keep the old charger setup as well since it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip issue and power button are why I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars - otherwise it is a very satisfying brush.  Not sure if it is worth the price difference in the Flexcare+ since I have not tried one.  Either is probably a great toothbrush and even the less expensive models are very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, it is essential to read the instructions and follow the usage guidelines for these Sonicare brushes to be effective.  They don&#x27;t work like a normal &amp;#34;hand scrub&amp;#34; toothbrush, but once you get used to it, they are so much better.</li>
            <li> I am so unhappy with this product. For months now the head of the tooth brush pops off every time I brush my teeth. I cannot believe the amount of money I paid to have a defective tooth brush. I used both brushes that came with the device. I&#x27;m back to using my 10 year told tooth brush since this one was such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference immediately.  So glad I bought this</li>
            <li> I thought I would like this better than the Oral-B toothbrushes, but I don&#x27;t.  Even my dental hygienist recommended this over the Oral-B, so I decided to try it.  I don&#x27;t feel any difference in the cleanliness of my teeth using this over the Oral-B and it was way more expensive.  Also, the way it vibrates tickles my mouth in an uncomfortable way, so I don&#x27;t use it for the full time.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an older model, Sonicare Healthy White.  This is such a huge improvement over that model my only regret is not buying this sooner. After 2 uses my coffee stains were almost gone! I really hope that this model will have an improved lifespan over the Healthy White model .</li>
            <li> Great device, best toothbrush I have ever used....and I have tried many.  Teeth feel very clean after usage and can notice they are whiter.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I threw my old oralb immediately.......</li>
            <li> Planned obsolescence best describes this expensive disposable toothbrush. Count on the battery dying months after the 2 year warranty expires. Has happened to me twice. My wife&#x27;s Braun Oral B toothbrush going on 5 years and no problems. Philips knows they created a problem, but apparently customer loyalty is not important to them. Hope this helps others avoid the frustration.</li>
            <li> It cleans very good, my teeth are white. All family use it and everybody love it. And this perfect Ida with the glass :-)</li>
            <li> I am very particular about my teeth and from now on I won&#x27;t use anything else.  I have noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best product on the market for those with recession of the gums. It cleans without any abrasion and meets all the expectations set by the manufacturer. While expensive, it is a perfect example of the view that &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I previously had the &amp;#34;Healthy White&amp;#34; toothbrush. It broke while travelling but was under warranty, so Sonicare sent me a new Diamond Clean brush. The annoying part is that I was forced to buy a new charger, however this toothbrush is better than any other Sonicare I&#x27;ve owned before. It got rid of those long standing coffee stains on the sides of my teeth and people have really begun to notice my smile. If I had to, I would 100% buy this again.</li>
            <li> There is nothing about this model that I do not like except the price. The charging cup seems to be an unnecessary piece to me but takes nothing away from the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like getting your teeth cleaned by the dentist every day. Well worth the cost. It also travels very easy with you</li>
            <li> Sonicare was recommended by my dentist over manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can go for a less expensive model if you want to use the Diamond Clean head replacements. (You don&#x27;t need this DiamondClean model to use them).  Some other compatible models: flexcare, healthywhite, and easyclean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model basically has a &amp;#34;coolness&amp;#34; factor to it (Apple-ish), with the glass cup recharger and ceramic feeling handle (it&#x27;s actually quality hard plastic).  I consider it a splurge purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this model 5-stars if not for the ironic flaw where one of the selling features, the ceramic-feeling handle, actually makes it hard to grip sometimes when brushing.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind some small rubber pieces of grip here and there but I guess they didn&#x27;t want to ruin the aesthetics of it.  I almost dropped it a couple of times when brushing.</li>
            <li> This is personally my fourth Sonicare and is the 10th in my immediate family. This model won several design awards... It is just my opinion, but I suspect whoever bestowed those awards never actually used this brush. My first challenge is in the finish and lack of contours on the handle. When wet, the brush becomes very slippery and difficult to hold. Bear in mind I&#x27;m a middle aged man that works with hand tools all the time and has great hand/forearm strength. That said, if it&#x27;s a challenge for me, anyone with grip strength challenges probably won&#x27;t like this or it&#x27;ll break after being dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second issue with this brush is the elimination of the separate button for cycle selection. As others have previously mentioned, this is a big inconvenience and nuisance and tends to make quite a mess if you try to see what you are changing. There is a way to preset a favorite setting, but that is very easily erased and you&#x27;re back to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have also commented about the charging system. The travel case with a USB connection to charge is brilliant! The home charger base using a drinking glass - is &amp;#34;Home &amp; Garden&amp;#34; beautiful but not very practical nor sanitary. Speaking of, my last two (top of the line when purchased) brushes both came with UV sanitizers but that &amp;#34;option&amp;#34; seems to be left to lesser brushes at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short Story long, after using this brush almost two years, I&#x27;d recommend a step &amp;#34;down&amp;#34; to the &amp;#34;Flexcare +&amp;#34; model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Sonicare for about a month now. Should have gotten one years ago.. I like the way it leaves my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;I find myself brushing much more frequently , which is a good thing.  It does have the issue with the power button getting pressed by accident. Maybe the button should be on the bottom where your hands wont hit it so easily. I have changed the way I hold it to avoid the nuisance, which is a little awkward. Still will use it and like it..</li>
            <li> Love it except that you can&#x27;t see the options (clean, massage gums etc.) unless the toothbrush is on.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, love the glass, charger and travel charger along with 3 week charge.</li>
            <li> Really well packaged product! I only wish the brusheads were cheaper :)</li>
            <li> design look nice and feel quality and comfortable to hold. nice features to chose for different function to clean, polish or whiten. get two for me and my wife to keep our teeth health.</li>
            <li> Love love love this toothbrush. Ever since I&#x27;ve started using it, I feel like I&#x27;ve had a cleaning from the dentist every day! The charge is supposed to be for 3 weeks, but so far has lasted me a month. Awesome product and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Saved my gums.  Teeth are super clean.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> This is the best Sonicare tooth brush I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> I had to laugh when I read the review that called this the Apple toothbrush. I had the same thought, though I also thought it bears a bit of a Cuisinart style as well. But it is not just about style. It works beautifully. It takes some getting used to if you&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush. My dental hygienist gave me some tips. The charge works a long time. Five stars!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to buy this but the charging glass..really..so gross..destroys the great look of the brush. Who wants a glass to collect crap and clutter up the counter top. Very disappointing, go back to the drawing board and hire a new design team. One step forward 5 steps back for Sonicare design.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.  Totally happy with how it performs.  I like the style and brushing options.  Replacement heads are a little expensive and my battery appears to be losing its charge quicker than it should.  Those are the only reasons I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  Best brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have got my order but it was missing parts. It came without brush heads, I do not know how I suppose to use it without any heads. I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> At approximately one foot away from the toothbrush, I measure 100 milli-gausse of AC EMF. This implies that were my gauss meter capable of measuring greater levels, closer distances would yield substantially higher measurements. As the product is only used 4 minutes per day, some users may feel comfortable with this toothbrush. However, I am returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make sure current users do not become overly worried by this post:  The radiation from this type of appliance is extremely low frequency and is in no way comparable to radiation from nuclear power or x-rays. This low frequency radiation is non-ionizing. Studies do not reveal exactly what the effect, either positive or negative, of EMF radiation is on humans. However, it seems plausible that there may be some effect through a mechanism such as the interaction of the electro-magnetic force on the iron within cells.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant after reading the one star reviews but old sonic care was in need of an update. after getting the tooth brush I didn&#x27;t quite understand all the gripes since everything was self explanatory and easy to use. a little pricy but if you can afford it I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed, both with this product&#x27;s obvious quality as well as its operation.  It comes with both portable and bathroom outlet charging capabilities.  My previous toothbrush was the battery operated Colgate Sonic brand.  Usage tests have shown that high speed brush movement is most effective for plaque control.  But, you&#x27;ve got to learn technique to avoid vibration irritation during use.  So, if you can get past the buzz in your mouth, this is the best product for the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just learning to use it, but I love it. I like it better each day, I strongly suggest it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best toothbrush I ever had. You can charge it in the cup when you&#x27;re at home or charge it in the case if you&#x27;re traveling.</li>
            <li> I kinda feel ripped off!  It&#x27;s a prime example of style over substance.  The handle of this toothbrush looks kinda snazzy, but it feels lighter than previous models and I am afraid that if I dropped it, it would be done.  Also, there is no rubber stopper on the end, so it rolls into my sink all the time.  For the price differential, I think this offers a lot in the way of cosmetics and gimmicks, but nothing that merits such a significant increase in price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a few Electric dental systems in the past and always felt like my teeth were going to be knocked out.  Then the amount of hardware on bathroom sink did not make me happy.  This is so cool with the glass as the charger. The vibration feels good and the darn things actually works cleaning my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, my original Sonicare toothbrush died.  I thought I would just revert to a manual toothbrush because, I thought, &amp;#34;what&#x27;s the big deal?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t order a new Sonicare fast enough!  No matter how many times I brushed each day, my teeth just didn&#x27;t feel clean to me.  It was as if there were a film across my teeth, and even the most expensive manual toothbrush couldn&#x27;t do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the DiamondClean today, and I heaved a hugh sigh of relief!  I couldn&#x27;t even wait for the full 24-hour charge; I just brushed my teeth after four hours on the charger, and it was pure heaven.  My teeth feel and look cleaner after just one brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about the Sonicare line, don&#x27;t be.  This is, hands down, the best rechargeable electric toothbrush on the market - and regardless of which model you choose, I doubt you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  I love my new DiamondClean toothbrush, partially because I love technology and gadgets, so I couldn&#x27;t resist investing in this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invest in yourself - and good oral hygiene.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD BETTER CHECKUPS, CLEANINGS AT MY DENTIST SINCE USING THIS BURSH.  MY TARTER IS LESS, MY MOUTH FEELS CLEANER.  BETTER RESULTS THAN I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush before (as I was a college student and could not afford it) and decided to finally get one. It makes my mouth feel incredibly clean. My teeth haven&#x27;t looked this white in a really long time. I am absolutely in love with this product. It comes with a travel case that you can plug a micro-usb into and have it charge while in the case. It also comes with a charging glass or stand. I chose to use the charging stand over the glass as it fit better in my medicine cabinet. I haven&#x27;t tried all of the settings but the sensitive, clean, and polish settings are great.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare electric toothbrushes for years.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is pricey.  The replacement brushes are expensive too.&lt;br /&gt;However, I think it is the best toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought this product Sept of 2013 and it is now not working. To pay $220 dollars for a product that last less than 2 years is completely unacceptable.    UPDATED:  I went to the Philips site and called customer support. The representative was fantastic, walked through several possible fixes and in the end they are sending us a new handle. So I have upgraded my rating from 1 star to 2, as I would rather that the product just continue to work rather than have to call support, but their support deserves 10 stars.    As an FYI, if your sonic care seems to lose its vibrating power, try pressing and holding the on/off button while in the charger (plugged in of course) until it beeps.</li>
            <li> The whitening setting brings results faster than estimated in the instructions. The timer is helpful and the cleaning is thorough.</li>
            <li> June 2015 update: The toothbrush has died after 2 1/2 years. If Sonicare would sell just the handle for less cost and provide warranty, then I would consider that option. I don&#x27;t want to purchase the entire kit all over, because I don&#x27;t need the entire kit. I have replaced it with the Sonicare Flexcare+ model since it uses the same brush heads, and am liking the rubber grip and light feel. My sister is not happy because it doesn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; modes. She was not amused at my offer to re-label some of the available modes to those.  A bit slippery to hold. Splatters quite a bit. I have to do my best to close my lips around it to try and contain the splattering. Else no complaints, but I&#x27;m not particularly demanding on this product. My sister uses just about all of the settings. I only use the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; setting. Replacement heads are easy to find at various local stores. We&#x27;ve had it for over two years. It was an upgrade from an older model for the added features; there was nothing wrong with the older model either, which is still working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for over a year now and love it.  There has been no issues of any sort with it. It works smoothly and really well.  It has a number of different modes for different types of cleaning. I&#x27;m not sure if the actual vibration changes or not (I didn&#x27;t pay it particular attention), but it definitely has different timing associated with each type of cleaning,  which I find very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it made a significant impact on my dental health. Before using it I was never a believer that an electric tooth brush makes much difference as oppose to a regular one. But since I&#x27;ve been using this brush I can definitely feel it does much better job at cleaning the teeth.  Not only that, it has SIGNIFICANTLY improved the health of my gums.  My gums used to bleed almost every time I brushed. I heard that proper gum massage can really improve the issue, which is why I got this brush. It even has a special mode for gum care.  Since I started using this brush for teeth cleaning as well as gum massage - I almost never get bleeding gums again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course the design is superb! The brush itself is very slick. It is easy to hold and has excellent grip. And all the accessories it comes with are equally slick, but also well thought through.  Both charging stations and the case work just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy using it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Too expensive. A lot of extra money for a glass!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing. My teeth have never felt so clean, just like a professional cleaning! I was hesitant to purchase this toothbrush because of the price, but after glowing recommendations from friends, I had to do it, and I have absolutely no regrets. The carrying case is super nice and comes in handy for overnight trips. I will never use a regular toothbrush again!</li>
            <li> I absoluetly love my new toothbrush. I noticed my canine teeth were starting to show signs of stains. I am allergic to Sodium Hydroxide ( I know weird), after discussing with my dentist I found out the onlyoption for me is Zoom. But the $500 pricetage for &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; results just doesn&#x27;t sit right. I purchased the Philips DiamondClean, here on Amazon (cheaper here than the 3 other locations I looked btw), I ordered on Tuesday and it arrived on my doorstep Thursday! I have used it twice a day for the past two weeks and I have already noticed the difference!!! When I smile in pictures it&#x27;s a full row of beautiful teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids think I&#x27;m corny for being excited about a toothbrush, but why wouldn&#x27;t I be. :D</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.  After hours and days of research about electric toothbrushes, I found this product with high positive reviews. I was hesitant to buy it at first due to some reviewers not being happy with one switch mode, but I did not find it annoying or difficult at all. I absolutely love it, and plan to buy it as a gift for my mom and mother- inlaw. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> The DiamondClean toothbrush really performs well. My mouth really does feel cleaner than with manual brushing. The charging systems are pretty neat too. Just set it in the glass and it charges - or use the USB cord when you travel. I charged it once and have been using it every day for over two weeks now and it is still going strong. You won&#x27;t have to take a charger when you travel for less than three weeks. The package says one compact head and one regular head is included, but both heads in the package seem to be identical. Replacement DiamondClean brush heads are expensive. The best deal I could find was at Costco but they are still around $10 a piece.</li>
            <li> After the first try, I hated it. I felt like I would be sitting in the dentist chair. After several weeks I decided to keep it, though I do not see any difference in the cleaning using the regular toothbrush and this one.</li>
            <li> Feels incredible. Easy and convient to charge and transport. Almost immediate results after using just a couple of times. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I love it at first sight and first use!!!I used to use several model of O&#x27;s toothbrushes and they are not as good as advertised I am so disappointed with O.So I decided to use other brand which is Sonicare and diamond care is the highest model!This is less nosier than O and feel so comfortable. The design is not only  simple  but also luxury.It makes my teeth brighter and whiter ever and the battery last average 3weeks which is so powerful(I had to charge O&#x27;s brush all the time which was so bother me!) Also the charging glass and charging case are so cool and convenient to use!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it soooooooo much and already recommend it to most of my friends and now recommend to you guys!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promise you will love it like me and it wroth every penny!</li>
            <li> So far I love the toothbrush!!  After hearing about reports of it&#x27;s durability/reliability it is too early to tell and I will let you know more after using it for some time.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years now. Just bought my second for my second home, though I take it everywhere on vacations. I use it as my primary toothbrush and it travels quite well.</li>
            <li> I recently had a bout of gum disease and went through aggressive treatment. My hygenist suggested I invest in a GOOD toothbrush and get the Phillips Sonicare &amp; said it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it. You should be able to get a good deal on Amazon. So I did. AMAZING TOOTHBRUSH. Worth every penny. I use the mulitple settings to clean, whiten &amp; care for my gums.</li>
            <li> This product costs almost $200 and I can&#x27;t tell the difference between it and the less expesive models I have owned and used before. Lots of gimicks with the various vibration modes, but doubt they really do anything different from one mode to the other. Also, get a Waterpic and use it everyday / night and you will never need to floss or see a dentist again! The Waterpic is actually a better tool than ANY toothbrush.</li>
            <li> best investment we&#x27;ve ever made, love to use it and have that fresh from the dentist clean feeling. thank you</li>
            <li> This is the best tooth brush I have ever had.  I like the selection choices and the maneuverability of it.</li>
            <li> This is an investment in my book, teeth feel as good as walking out of the dentist just having your teeth cleaned. The Travel case is awesome and looks very stylish and great size, the glass charger is also a great feature i travel a lot reason i spent a little more and got this one. Highly recommended to anyone that is looking at there first electric toothbrush or anyone looking for a more modern upgrade.</li>
