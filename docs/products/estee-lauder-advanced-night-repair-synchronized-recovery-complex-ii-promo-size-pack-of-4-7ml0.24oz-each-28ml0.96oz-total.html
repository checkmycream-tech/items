            <li>This product really helps that area; noticeably and keeps the rest of my skin in great shape.  </li>
            <li>and I have many people tell me that I have lovely skin.</li>
            <li>I travel a great deal and this size is very convenient.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better since I started using Advanced Night Repair serum every night!</li>
            <li>my skins softer and looks more youthful.</li>
            <li>These are free samples that you can get at any Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder bay, trust me!</li>
            <li>My favorite night serum</li>
            <li>I love all the ANR Estee Lauder products, and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am trying it, I hope it is as good as I read about.</li>
            <li>And contrary to one other comment, I have NEVER been able to get a sample bottle of this wonderful product from a department store counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for travel, but feel I&#x27;m leaving too much in the bottle</li>
            <li>and I love this products it has improved my skin tremendously</li>
            <li>Great seller and prices, will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>and this is the one serum I have found that is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Worked great, just like the big bottle &amp; visible softening of lines after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Product comes from free samples, not for sale.</li>
            <li>course, I wish it was free shipping, because when you add shipping and tax it starts to feel a bit pricey.  </li>
            <li>Yes sometimes they are free with purchase</li>
            <li>Worth the investment :)</li>
            <li>Ordered this product and I LOVE the complex, just wasn&#x27;t very happy with the size.  </li>
            <li>, ONE WAS COMPLETELY FULL.</li>
            <li>I know the fragrance of Estee Advanced Night Repair, and the luxurious feel of it when it&#x27;s fresh -</li>
            <li>I received my items quickly and were as described...</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the perfect product for your facial skin, look no further.</li>
            <li>So finding a seller that was selling this product at a reasonable price, I had to buy it!!  </li>
            <li>Not as good as expected</li>
            <li>you really want good skin go for french pharmacy products.</li>
            <li>I have loved this product for many years - and I was not surprised to see that it was featured as one of the 25 most loved beauty products of all time, in this past month&#x27;s Real Simple magazine.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>When the small sizes are bundled together and shipped as one, the value for this great product cannot be surpassed.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks), I do see a great improvement in my overall skin texture, pigment, and glow.</li>
            <li>Hope I can get more of the same.</li>
            <li>Please continue to make these offers available.  </li>
            <li>This product has been named #1 in many different magazines.</li>
            <li>I use different skin products so now sure of how helpful it is</li>
            <li>I was happy to find the small sizes, very helpful for traveling.</li>
            <li>I will know better next time.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I used this as well as a synegistic combination of other products, and I finally acheived GREAT skin.</li>
            <li>and I certainly don&#x27;t want to display the aftereffects of that vice.</li>
            <li>brand new!!  </li>
            <li>and this is so much cheaper than the large size that one would purchase in store.</li>
            <li>even gave some to my mother, and she really like it.</li>
            <li>Very softening for your skin.  </li>
            <li>and it really does what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li>Very nice&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use this product every night and really feel that it helps my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>But in reality, it&#x27;s far better than not having it at all, when purchase of an entire bottle is out of the question.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product, thanks to the multiple sample sizes (which I love when testing out a new product!) and would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>3 OF THESE BOTTLES WERE ONLY HALF FULL!!!</li>
            <li>Fast, professional transaction, thank you!</li>
            <li>Not all satisfied not sure if it was the original because i had bought it before at a big chain store</li>
            <li>These bottles arrived half full!</li>
            <li>But I was getting near the bottom of the bottle!  </li>
            <li>smells like it is old product</li>
            <li>yet I can professionally recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 58 yrs old</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s now almost half full.  </li>
            <li>Why would you ever pay this much for such a small quantity of product that you can receive at a counter free of charge?</li>
            <li>I do not know why this product is so hyped up and getting sold for such a high price.</li>
            <li>Yes these are small bottles, but it is a great product that you only need a small amount of.  </li>
            <li>but it has got a light texture, but bottle are half empty even at tiny size.</li>
            <li>The product at least whet I had received did not feel any special on the skin.</li>
            <li>One day I will purchase the full size amount, but considering I only use a slightly  larger than pea size amount at night, I&#x27;ll stick with the small sample.</li>
            <li>so, not being in a position to buy a whole bottle, I browsed Amazon and found these 4 little bottles.  </li>
            <li>This Estee Lauder Advanced Night Synchronized Recovery Complex 11 Promo may work as expected, I just haven&#x27;t used it enough to rate it</li>

            <li> Only use at night when skin replenishes its self and it can last for a very long time while still benefitting your complection, just have a low cost product for day use prefrably a protectant sun block and  serum.</li>
            <li> So far my skin feels softer and wrinkles seem less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> and now I have 4 bottles that will last me a very long time!!!  </li>
            <li> Expiration date is unknown, quality is unknown.</li>
            <li> I am 63 yrs old and my skin around my mouth is showing signs of wear and tear and &amp;#34;sagging&amp;#34; probably due to all that talking when I was in retail!!!!  </li>
            <li> and I like that I can open and use a small supply at a time.  </li>
            <li> so I prefer the small ones to one larger size bottle.  </li>
            <li> I use the Recovery Complex regularly, so I&#x27;m commenting on the packing.</li>
            <li> Much to my delight, my son brought a bottle to me from France a year or so ago, and I had rationed my use of it, because I know that it is relatively expensive.  </li>
            <li> I am a previous skin care specialist and never worked for Estee, btw  </li>
            <li> Two of the 4 bottles are not full.</li>
            <li> Tight on money?</li>
            <li> Little bottles for sailboat trip.  </li>
            <li> I poured these little bottles into my almost-empty bottle, and to my delight</li>
            <li> Just my way of saving a little money and if you don&#x27;t , ind a few little bottles instead of one.</li>
            <li> I being using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> The size was too small that I returned them.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be the same size as the one&#x27;s you get at estee lauder  when you get a gift, but i was wrong, because they&#x27;re tinny.</li>
            <li> It plainly states on the bottles NOT FOR RESALE!  </li>
            <li> Bottles are very small.</li>
            <li> Well they&#x27;re very small</li>
            <li> Little expensive.</li>
            <li> At least try the sample for one week and see the results!</li>
            <li> and while I don&#x27;t see a DRAMATIC difference (mind you</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry, and I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> Buy with confidence - you will not be disappointed!</li>

            <li> Bottles are very small. Good for travel, but feel I&#x27;m leaving too much in the bottle</li>
            <li> I use the Recovery Complex regularly, so I&#x27;m commenting on the packing. It is a perfect size for travel. The price was great. Hope I can get more of the same.</li>
            <li> These sample like bottles worked for me big time!&lt;br /&gt;I even gave some to my mother, and she really like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face and neck for years. I use it 5-6 nights per week but not if I use retinol cream, which I use only 1-2 x per week. I like the smaller bottles. I get many compliments on my skin. I am 50 and people always say I don&#x27;t look it.</li>
            <li> This Estee Lauder Advanced Night Synchronized Recovery Complex 11 Promo may work as expected, I just haven&#x27;t used it enough to rate it but I have relatives that use it, and their face looks really nice, thank you amazon!</li>

            <li> It okay, did not see any improvement in the wrinkles. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> So far my skin feels softer and wrinkles seem less noticeable.  I haven&#x27;t seen any firming or lifting after 3 weeks.  It may take longer.</li>
            <li> Please continue to make these offers available.  When the small sizes are bundled together and shipped as one, the value for this great product cannot be surpassed.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like this product. Plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> This is a free sample that you can receive from any Estee Lauder counter!! DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!! I know because I work for Estee Lauder!!!</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> bottles toosmall.  smells like it is old product</li>
            <li> I had already used this product prior to purchasing it so I knew I would be extremely satisfied. So finding a seller that was selling this product at a reasonable price, I had to buy it!!  I received my items quickly and were as described...brand new!!  Great seller and prices, will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Very softening for your skin.  i use it nightly.</li>
            <li> Great product...does wonders to my skin!</li>
            <li> Received order quickly, I love this product!  I have been using for a while now and it really does what it claims to do.  I would 110% recommend.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and great deal!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the perfect product for your facial skin, look no further. Estee Lauder is absolutely amazing and results-oriented will appear immediately.  I recommend that you give this product a chance. You will not be sorry, and I have tried them all. This is a very good deal. At least try the sample for one week and see the results!</li>
            <li> good stuff, good price</li>
            <li> when used just one night!  I am a previous skin care specialist and never worked for Estee, btw  yet I can professionally recommend this product.  I am 63 yrs old and my skin around my mouth is showing signs of wear and tear and &amp;#34;sagging&amp;#34; probably due to all that talking when I was in retail!!!!  This product really helps that area; noticeably and keeps the rest of my skin in great shape.  These bottles have been taken from GWP&#x27;s and sold as a set.  There is a generous am&#x27;t in each bottle and this is so much cheaper than the large size that one would purchase in store.</li>
            <li> This is the best night serum I have ever used! The reason I didn&#x27;t buy the $100 bottle is because I can get 4 promo sizes for $28 and it ends up being the same amount of product. Just my way of saving a little money and if you don&#x27;t , ind a few little bottles instead of one.</li>
            <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;I really like this, it is very good, all 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. Wake up to smoother younger skin. Use under makeup to keep benefits and a matte complexion. Tight on money? Only use at night when skin replenishes its self and it can last for a very long time while still benefitting your complection, just have a low cost product for day use prefrably a protectant sun block and  serum.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and in good condition.  I use this product every night and really feel that it helps my skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make any difference at all</li>
            <li> THE MONEY I SAVED BY BUYING IT THIS WAY IS A BIG DIFFERENCE THEN BUYING FROM ESTEE LAUDER THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE PRODUCT JUST A SMALLER BOTTLE</li>
            <li> This is an excellent serum. I purchased from Estee Lauder for $62.00. I was in a panic when I found I was almost out and then along came Amazon to the rescue. I have extremely sensitive skin and this is the one serum I have found that is fragrance free. It has made a difference and I have many people tell me that I have lovely skin. I put this on before my EB5 moisturizer and my skin feels good day and night. I would say to anyone--try it.</li>
            <li> I work for Estee Lauder and we hand out sample size bottles like these all the time. We even can take hand fulls for ourselves to take home. Why would you ever pay this much for such a small quantity of product that you can receive at a counter free of charge?</li>
            <li> This product has been named #1 in many different magazines. This is the first time I am trying it, I hope it is as good as I read about.</li>
            <li> The size was too small that I returned them.</li>
            <li> I use different skin products so now sure of how helpful it is but it has got a light texture, but bottle are half empty even at tiny size.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is one of the best skin serums. I was happy to find the small sizes, very helpful for traveling. I travel a great deal and this size is very convenient. The price was right.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better since I started using Advanced Night Repair serum every night!</li>
            <li> I am 58 yrs old and I love this products it has improved my skin tremendously my skins softer and looks more youthful. I being using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> Little bottles for sailboat trip.  Worked great, just like the big bottle &amp; visible softening of lines after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE!! These are free samples that you can get at any Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder bay, trust me! I used to work for Est&amp;eacute;e!</li>
            <li> Product comes from free samples, not for sale. I regret I bought it. Expiration date is unknown, quality is unknown.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for many years and thought this was a good buy until I received my order. 3 OF THESE BOTTLES WERE ONLY HALF FULL!!!, ONE WAS COMPLETELY FULL.</li>
            <li> Not as good as expected</li>
            <li> Ordered this product and I LOVE the complex, just wasn&#x27;t very happy with the size.  For the price I paid, I could have gotten 1 big bottle.  It plainly states on the bottles NOT FOR RESALE!  All I should have had to pay for was shipping.  I will know better next time.</li>
            <li> This gives my skin a nice even glow, and balances any imperfections. Will definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> Seller went beyond expectations. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> These bottles arrived half full! What gives??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and while I don&#x27;t see a DRAMATIC difference (mind you it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks), I do see a great improvement in my overall skin texture, pigment, and glow. I will continue to use this product, thanks to the multiple sample sizes (which I love when testing out a new product!) and would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Arrived perfect timing...Little expensive.</li>
            <li> Not all satisfied not sure if it was the original because i had bought it before at a big chain store and i saw the difference .</li>
            <li> I purchased the samples of these. I skimp on sleep A LOT...and I certainly don&#x27;t want to display the aftereffects of that vice. One day I looked at my hyperpignmentation prone skin and it was flawless...No makeup flawless. I used this as well as a synegistic combination of other products, and I finally acheived GREAT skin. One day I will purchase the full size amount, but considering I only use a slightly  larger than pea size amount at night, I&#x27;ll stick with the small sample.</li>
            <li> I have loved this product for many years - and I was not surprised to see that it was featured as one of the 25 most loved beauty products of all time, in this past month&#x27;s Real Simple magazine. Much to my delight, my son brought a bottle to me from France a year or so ago, and I had rationed my use of it, because I know that it is relatively expensive.  But I was getting near the bottom of the bottle!  Heaven forbid! And contrary to one other comment, I have NEVER been able to get a sample bottle of this wonderful product from a department store counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so, not being in a position to buy a whole bottle, I browsed Amazon and found these 4 little bottles.  They arrived in perfect condition, with ultra fast shipping.  I know the fragrance of Estee Advanced Night Repair, and the luxurious feel of it when it&#x27;s fresh - and this shipment was perfect!  I poured these little bottles into my almost-empty bottle, and to my delight, it&#x27;s now almost half full.  At this price I don&#x27;t think I have to ration anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I wish it was free shipping, because when you add shipping and tax it starts to feel a bit pricey.  But in reality, it&#x27;s far better than not having it at all, when purchase of an entire bottle is out of the question.  I will buy again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Fast, professional transaction, thank you!</li>
            <li> My favorite night serum</li>
            <li> Yes these are small bottles, but it is a great product that you only need a small amount of.  Yes sometimes they are free with purchase but I didn&#x27;t want to wait on Estee&#x27;s next promotion and now I have 4 bottles that will last me a very long time!!!  Good buy.</li>
            <li> Every night, lips and jawline.  You&#x27;ll thank Estee.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks</li>
            <li> great product, great price</li>
            <li> I love all the ANR Estee Lauder products, and this is no exception. Buy with confidence - you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Product arrived as scheduled and as it is promoted</li>
            <li> Well they&#x27;re very small I thought they would be the same size as the one&#x27;s you get at estee lauder  when you get a gift, but i was wrong, because they&#x27;re tinny. So i don&#x27;t know if I buy this again.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product !!! Worth the investment :)</li>
            <li> I do not know why this product is so hyped up and getting sold for such a high price. The product at least whet I had received did not feel any special on the skin. It feels just the same as clinic repairwear serum.&lt;br /&gt;If you really want good skin go for french pharmacy products.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and I like that I can open and use a small supply at a time.  Seems to me the liquid would stay fresher in an unopened bottle so I prefer the small ones to one larger size bottle.  I had gotten a sample with an order of cosmetics about a year ago and wanted to order this for continued use.</li>
