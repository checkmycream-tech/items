            <li>Color was gorgeous and lasted a while</li>
            <li>and my hair is in good condition</li>
            <li>this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;No smell and good coverage</li>
            <li>I would recommend using a good color saving shampoo and conditioner with this.</li>
            <li>I love this product, the color is beautiful.</li>
            <li>After giving up, I was pleasantly surprised and greatly relieved when my sister (nurse) told me about Naturtint -- and even gave me literature about this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I repeat</li>
            <li>and so glad I found it!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very nice color.  </li>
            <li>The color covers amazingly and it lasts.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not chemical free, but I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li>My hair is about 50% gray and this did a nice job of covering it.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice color for me and colored my gray well.  </li>
            <li>and nobody can believe that I color my own hair.  </li>
            <li>After reading wonderful reviews on how natural and good this product is I decided to use it on my hair.</li>
            <li>Very easy.</li>
            <li>I have developed a severe allergy to PPD, and thought this was the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing in more ways than one.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair color I have used in the 10+ years I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair.</li>
            <li>OMG I love this color</li>
            <li>Love the conditioner that comes with this hair color..</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair seems to be in even better condition than it was before it was colored-</li>
            <li>My favorite hair color.  </li>
            <li>No awful smells.</li>
            <li>And  after I was done  brush had more then a handful of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Going</li>
            <li>We love the product from the stores, but the ones we got from Amazon&#x27;s supplier were beyond the expiration date.</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my hair feeling</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner included in the box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better color coverage than any I&#x27;ve tried and there is NO STING OR SMELL...</li>
            <li>Product is very good, pure plant, I like very much, will continue to buy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as great as the henna I used to use from LUSH</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s ammonia free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for covering stubborn grey hair, and it doesn&#x27;t stink or burn like most hair coloring, which is great because I have super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Saving tons of money, but more excited about using a product that isn&#x27;t harmful.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased (no itchy scalp) with the results and found Naturtint&#x27;s website very informative with their FAQ&#x27;s, How to Apply and Our Models sections.</li>
            <li>The color stays true after many shampoos.</li>
            <li>It is the best hair coloring product I have ever used (a previous Henna user for over 20 years).  </li>
            <li>My hair is left sleek and shiny, very healthy looking!</li>
            <li>I was greatly blessed that my younger sister, a registered nurse, had found this product and was using, and told me about it.  </li>
            <li>My hair became silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Two different colors, both came out great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally fantastic.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how good the coverage was.</li>
            <li>I tried henna and it wasn&#x27;t a good experience, so this stuff was my next choice, and I really do love it.</li>
            <li>This product is so user friendly...</li>
            <li>(I do not use any special shampoos for color treated hair, and I am in the sun</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Plus the smell isn&#x27;t totally noxious, as most hair dye is!</li>
            <li>I love this color, it&#x27;s the closest I have found to my natural color.</li>
            <li>It is worth the time to order on line as the store-bought items cannot compare to Naturtint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth</li>
            <li>Love this all natural product.  </li>
            <li>Looks more natural than any product at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>and it looks more natural.</li>
            <li>reliably consistent in color though fades pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a good hair color brand and less toxic than those manufactured in America.</li>
            <li>so I am able to split the contents and make each box last for two hair colorings.</li>
            <li>(as was written in my first commentary)</li>
            <li>and it REALLY covers grays!  </li>
            <li>I tried two different cheap, popular brands last year to try to cover them and they didn&#x27;t do the job-</li>
            <li>I use a coloring brush to apply and separate the hair sections, applying to roots first.</li>
            <li>Many non-natural dyes cause irritation, but Naturtint actually improve my scalp and hair condition.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep our eyes peeled for a review in Terracotta Blonde! :)</li>
            <li>Originally found this hair color on clearance at a natural foods store, and I decided to try it since we were moving to another state, and I was leaving my hair dresser of 10+ years.  </li>
            <li>I felt like the multiplier that comes in the box (which is like a conditioner) really softened my hair, as it was kind of rough after rinsing out the color.  </li>
            <li>Great hair color, hair is shiny and natural looking, has body without looking dried out.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for the 40 minutes to make sure the grey takes the color.  </li>
            <li>My salon color is 6, which should be lighter than this product at 5, but possibly because the Naturtint isn&#x27;t as strong, it was an acceptable match.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work.  </li>
            <li>I cannot tolerate the smell of ammonia, and I wanted a gentle product that covers</li>
            <li>But roots would not get colored as much as the rest of the hair.</li>
            <li>This REALLY covers gray, it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water or my head burn.</li>
            <li>For a natural hair color product it produced more fumes than the regular ones.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and really covers grey.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out super soft and I&#x27;ll never go back to the super market hair color</li>
            <li>This is a much quicker alternative with decent results.  </li>
            <li>no harsh chemicals, color is always consistent and it makes hair very shiny!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light golden chestnut brought out the natural red highlights and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering going lighter as it makes the bottom half of my hair much darker than the top,</li>
            <li>For me, next time will be in about 4-6 weeks, depending on how quickly my hair grows.</li>
            <li>Better than other natural hair dyes.</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice herbal shampoo and a really thick conditioner to use after processing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to mix, mix only what you need and save the rest for next time.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and vibrant after the treatment.  </li>
            <li>Then, rinse until water runs clear, shampoo and rinse with the product included and I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>My hair is completely fried.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate that it&#x27;s a fairly natural product.</li>
            <li>I really really want to try Terracotta Blonde...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff - I got tired of paying so much to cover my gray hair and so saw this on Amazon so tried it.  </li>
            <li>harsh, no strong smell, no burning and a beautiful color that covers the grey!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Some may find it disturbing that this is only available on-line (not in the stores), but if shopping with Amazon and spending $35, one can receive free shipping as I do.  </li>
            <li>I like this, but it tends to fade fast and the actual color is never the same.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a subtle difference, but there&#x27;s more red in it</li>
            <li>The only slight issue is that my hair is very slightly lighter at the roots (as color develops faster here because the scalp is warm)</li>
            <li>plus they left my hair a brassy color, despite them saying &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; and me choosing medium browns (which is my natural haircolor).  </li>
            <li>Cortizone cream is barely controlling the itching.</li>
            <li>In fact, there&#x27;s barely a smell.</li>
            <li>It is far less harmful to the hair than other home color options and has no awful smells from harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable and after all, I did chose a golden color.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> For a natural hair color product it produced more fumes than the regular ones. I like the color but I only left it on for 20 minutes, if I had done the recommended 30 it would have been very dark, too dark. I used this to cover red so I&#x27;m not sure if the warmness of the color is due to that or part of this product. It&#x27;s what I wanted but I don&#x27;t know if another user will get the same result. I&#x27;m disappointed with how dry my hair is after use with a product without all those harsh chemicals. I&#x27;m not likely to use Naturtint again</li>
            <li> I have been buying and using Naturtint for over a year now.  I have alot of gray and this product covers it extremely well. The monthly salon visits were getting expensive (my hair grows fast) and since I&#x27;m retired I am watching my budget.  I also wanted to get away from the peroxide based hair products that my salon was using that made my scalp burn and itch during the entire time it was processing.  I am very pleased (no itchy scalp) with the results and found Naturtint&#x27;s website very informative with their FAQ&#x27;s, How to Apply and Our Models sections. I am currently combining 2 oz of the Naturtint 5N and 5G for medium brown with reddish gold highlights. My hair is medium length so I am able to split the contents and make each box last for two hair colorings.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work.  I have developed a severe allergy to PPD, and thought this was the perfect solution.  Color was gorgeous and lasted a while however I had a horrible reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this color I have medium brown hair and this did two shades lighter with red tones in it. Auburn color. So beautiful. Better than other natural hair dyes. It&#x27;s like a stain and it covered my 30% grays. Luv luv. BTW my hair dresser did it.</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner that comes with this hair color..</li>
            <li> Love this product. Always use it</li>
            <li> I love this color, it&#x27;s the closest I have found to my natural color.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have rated this product.  It is the best hair coloring product I have ever used (a previous Henna user for over 20 years).  I was greatly blessed that my younger sister, a registered nurse, had found this product and was using, and told me about it.  I had attempted a few times with previous colorings to change over from Henna -- which had over time hurt my hair -- but, when reading directions in other hair colors, did not use, except one which I found very hurtful.  After giving up, I was pleasantly surprised and greatly relieved when my sister (nurse) told me about Naturtint -- and even gave me literature about this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I repeat (as was written in my first commentary) -- this is the BEST hair color product I have ever used.  It does not burn and I hardly lose any hair when using it -- as was true with other products. Of course, it does wash out over time but that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may find it disturbing that this is only available on-line (not in the stores), but if shopping with Amazon and spending $35, one can receive free shipping as I do.  It is worth the time to order on line as the store-bought items cannot compare to Naturtint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please continue to sell this wonderful, outstanding, BEST product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for allowing this commentary and thank you for this outstanding product and your excellent service!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking forward to coloring my hair as I&#x27;ve always hated the strong smells and damage colorants leave behind but when I noticed a few gray hairs starting to grow, I decided to start coloring.  This product is amazing in more ways than one.  It doesn&#x27;t have that awful ammonia smell that others do and it REALLY covers grays!  I tried two different cheap, popular brands last year to try to cover them and they didn&#x27;t do the job- plus they left my hair a brassy color, despite them saying &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; and me choosing medium browns (which is my natural haircolor).  Also, my hair seems to be in even better condition than it was before it was colored- it&#x27;s shinier &amp; smoother!  I felt like the multiplier that comes in the box (which is like a conditioner) really softened my hair, as it was kind of rough after rinsing out the color.  It&#x27;s been two weeks and my hair is in good condition and I don&#x27;t see any gray hairs around!  The only slight issue is that my hair is very slightly lighter at the roots (as color develops faster here because the scalp is warm) but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable and after all, I did chose a golden color.  Next time I may go for an Ash, if they have one but if not, this shade is just as good! Naturtint is more expensive than the store brands but it is definitely worth it- it&#x27;s a keeper!! Thank you, Naturtint.</li>
            <li> Love this all natural product.  I have gray in the front and it did a great job covering it up. My hair was soft and vibrant after the treatment.  I recommend doing the strand test.  For me I colored for 40 minutes instead of 30 so my grays could be covered.</li>
            <li> Looks more natural than any product at the grocery store.  Covers the gray perfectly.  Easy to use and less nasty chemicals to worry about.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair color.  Nothing harsh, no strong smell, no burning and a beautiful color that covers the grey!</li>
            <li> If you are going grey like me and don&#x27;t want to use the awful chemicals that come in regular hair dye this is a good choice.  It&#x27;s not as great as the henna I used to use from LUSH but that was so time consuming and messy.  This is a much quicker alternative with decent results.  I&#x27;m considering going lighter as it makes the bottom half of my hair much darker than the top, a typical quirk of do it yourself hair dye.</li>
            <li> I cannot tolerate the smell of ammonia, and I wanted a gentle product that covers grey.&lt;br /&gt;No smell and good coverage</li>
            <li> My favorite...doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> My hair is about 50% gray and this did a nice job of covering it.  The light golden chestnut brought out the natural red highlights and I was pleasantly surprised.  It has started to fade a bit after about 7 shampoos, but I only need to wash my hair every other day.  I would recommend using a good color saving shampoo and conditioner with this.</li>
            <li> This product is so user friendly...no harsh chemicals, color is always consistent and it makes hair very shiny!&lt;br /&gt;Using the shampoo and conditioner also help color to last longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair color I have used in the 10+ years I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair. All other hair colors give me a headache and slightly sting ~ even at the salon. This one does not. It is mixed and used just like any other boxed hair color. Very easy. No awful smells. It is more expensive than what you&#x27;ll find in your local store, but WAY less expensive than the salon. It is the only color I use now.</li>
            <li> This is a good hair color brand and less toxic than those manufactured in America.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to hair dyes so I bought this product to try. I took it to my hair dresser who used a plastic cap and pulled some hair out to add low lights. The dye itself never touched my skin.  I had the worst reaction I&#x27;ve ever had from a hair product. It blistered my forhead and caused scabs and oozing.  I have blisters all over my head.  Don&#x27;t even think about using this product if you have allergies.  Cortizone cream is barely controlling the itching. I may have to go in for a Cortizone shot. Most unfortunate.</li>
            <li> This product is really no different than other brands like L&#x27;oreal.  It is a nice color for me and colored my gray well.  However, my head is itchy and 24 hours later, still itchy.</li>
            <li> I purchased from Amazon as it is significantly less expensive than the retail outlets that carry the product. I&#x27;ve used it before, purchasing the N series to cover the grey. It&#x27;s easy to mix, mix only what you need and save the rest for next time. For me, next time will be in about 4-6 weeks, depending on how quickly my hair grows. Wipe up spills within  5-15 mins. I use a coloring brush to apply and separate the hair sections, applying to roots first. Found me, I leave the color in for approximately 30 mins. after I finish applying. Then, rinse until water runs clear, shampoo and rinse with the product included and I&#x27;m done. The only times I&#x27;ve not had total grey coverage is when it missed treating the roots in an area. Blind spots. However, no problem because I&#x27;ve had the leftover ingredients. I quickly mixed the ingredients and completed the coloring.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is all I use now.  No harmful chemicals, predictable color and nobody can believe that I color my own hair.  Saving tons of money, but more excited about using a product that isn&#x27;t harmful.</li>
            <li> After reading wonderful reviews on how natural and good this product is I decided to use it on my hair. For over a year I&#x27;ve been using henna only. My hair became silky and smooth. But roots would not get colored as much as the rest of the hair. I decided- for fist time to apply mix all over the hair. And then whenever it is needed to apply just to  the roots. And continue to use henna.  Well, what can I say?  After rinsing die of my hair (just after 15 minutes of having a die on  )  my scalp started burning.  It has been 6 hours after and scalp is still itching and burning. My hair is completely fried.  Brushing  is painful . And  after I was done  brush had more then a handful of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Going back to my henna and in addition to an intensive treatments of what is left .</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - I got tired of paying so much to cover my gray hair and so saw this on Amazon so tried it.  It works SO well - and it smells good!  I love it so much and so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> This is my third time using this brand to dye my hair. Two different colors, both came out great. I love that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients. I also love that it&#x27;s ammonia free. When I used dye with ammonia in the past, my eyes would burn and scalp would itch and burn. This does not occur with Naturtint. In fact, there&#x27;s barely a smell. Also, before using this hair dye, any other hair dye I used caused me to get split ends and made my hair very dry. I don&#x27;t see any split ends or dryness after using this product. My hair is left sleek and shiny, very healthy looking! The color covers amazingly and it lasts.</li>
            <li> We love the product from the stores, but the ones we got from Amazon&#x27;s supplier were beyond the expiration date. We returned them.</li>
            <li> Product is very good, pure plant, I like very much, will continue to buy</li>
            <li> The product is just that I was looking for, does not smell and does not have dangerous ingredients. Also arrived on time</li>
            <li> Great product, works well</li>
            <li> I like this, but it tends to fade fast and the actual color is never the same.  It is ridiculous</li>
            <li> Great hair color, hair is shiny and natural looking, has body without looking dried out.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to cover grey in between salon visits. I don&#x27;t think there is any such thing as chemical-free permanent color, but this gets a 2 from the EWG (Environmental Working Group) website, as opposed to the other color I ordered from Amazon, Garnier Nutrisse, which received an 8; an 8 comes in a red circle, meaning dangerous overall levels. I left the Naturtint  on for 40 minutes. It has virtually no smell. I was surprised at how good the coverage was. My salon color is 6, which should be lighter than this product at 5, but possibly because the Naturtint isn&#x27;t as strong, it was an acceptable match. I&#x27;m going to order it again.</li>
            <li> reliably consistent in color though fades pretty quickly.  Will cover the grey.  It is far less harmful to the hair than other home color options and has no awful smells from harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really covers grey. Plus the smell isn&#x27;t totally noxious, as most hair dye is! I appreciate that it&#x27;s a fairly natural product. I tried henna and it wasn&#x27;t a good experience, so this stuff was my next choice, and I really do love it. The color results are darker than what is pictured, but I&#x27;ve used 3 or 4 colors and never had a bad result.</li>
            <li> Originally found this hair color on clearance at a natural foods store, and I decided to try it since we were moving to another state, and I was leaving my hair dresser of 10+ years.  The color matched my natural hair really well, while giving a little warmth with some slight reddish under tones.  The color goes on pretty dark, but starts to lighten a little after 2-3 weeks (I do not use any special shampoos for color treated hair, and I am in the sun A LOT).  It&#x27;s perfect for covering stubborn grey hair, and it doesn&#x27;t stink or burn like most hair coloring, which is great because I have super sensitive skin.  I leave it on for the 40 minutes to make sure the grey takes the color.  It comes with a nice herbal shampoo and a really thick conditioner to use after processing.  I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> The item arrived damaged, so there is no way for me to review it.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived like I was told. Thank you</li>
            <li> I always have trouble finding my color locally so I will order from Amazon in the future. This is a great product and it does not damage my hair or skin. The color stays true after many shampoos.</li>
            <li> Many non-natural dyes cause irritation, but Naturtint actually improve my scalp and hair condition.&lt;br /&gt;The color is beautiful as well, and works great on gray hair.</li>
            <li> coverage is great, and it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch like hair color containing ammonia.</li>
            <li> seems like a negative review, right - but the 5 stars are intended. I wayn to warn you that this is dark, but I knew it was going to be dark, but it&#x27;s lighter than the golden chestnut I had been using. It&#x27;s a subtle difference, but there&#x27;s more red in it and it looks more natural. I love the way it leaves my hair feeling and I think I&#x27;m going to pick up the separate conditioner you get in the box. It&#x27;s totally fantastic. This REALLY covers gray, it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water or my head burn. I know it&#x27;s not chemical free, but I&#x27;m happy with it and I&#x27;m not going to stop coloring my hair - so there you have it. I really really want to try Terracotta Blonde...I think the name intrigues me and the idea of drastically changing my color does, too. Keep our eyes peeled for a review in Terracotta Blonde! :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very nice color.  Love the shampoo and conditioner included in the box.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been using over the counter hair color like I have for years, and have hated the stink, ammonia smell and the chemicals leaving your scalp a little sensitive once you&#x27;re done covering the grays... TRY THIS STUFF IT\\&quot;S WONDERFUL. It&#x27;s better color coverage than any I&#x27;ve tried and there is NO STING OR SMELL... My hair comes out super soft and I&#x27;ll never go back to the super market hair color again.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
