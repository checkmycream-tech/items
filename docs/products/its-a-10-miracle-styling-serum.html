            <li>Great serum to be used before you blow dry your hair to make it easier to style and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Protecting your hair from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was that good compared to other brand serum use for my hair.</li>
            <li>This product seems to work best if you use it on wet hair and then let it dry.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>Used again today and so far looks good, humidity low today, again used hair spray.  </li>
            <li>both depending which one I buy when I go shopping) are all incredible products and they really help your hair stay straight and less frizzy and soft and shinny!</li>
            <li>The shipping was quite fast too!</li>
            <li>love the its a ten miracle shine spray!</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they say.  </li>
            <li>so I am till undecided on whether to get another bottle after I have finished the first.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this serum by my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>I love the mastercuts miracle mositure shampoo and conditioners and the mastercuts brand flat iron spray!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>Lasts forever and can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li>so we need different products than those with fine, straighter hair.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and seriously smells so great!!</li>
            <li>It feels silky smooth on my hands before I run it through my wet hair, but don&#x27;t use too much!!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t provide that much a of a shine.</li>
            <li>I really like his serum</li>
            <li>The shipper for this product was fast service &amp; no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I have really curly, breakage prone hair.</li>
            <li>I really do love this product - I put it on when my hair is 1/2-3/4 dry, and it not only smooths my hair, it also makes it so very easy for a flat iron to do its job.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and use one pump but have used more and it really does not weight it down nor make it greasy.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this serum wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and would give me a more polished look.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this serum, it works wonders on my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>, there was little humidity in the air at that time, I did top hair off w/hair spray.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 years old with shoulder length fairly straight hair.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to straighten my hair, and it makes it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I like this serum on the rare days I would flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new serum for a while.</li>
            <li>Be careful, it&#x27;s easy to use just a little too much and end up with greasy looking hair, but if you use the correct amount, this product works quite well to increase shine and calm flyaways.</li>
            <li>I used a little too much the first time, make sure to only use a tiny pea sized amount or hair will not be manageable.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m addicted to Deva products, I try not to straighten it as much, but if I&#x27;m in a pinch to get out the door with wet hair, this works great to keep it from being overly frizzy.  </li>
            <li>but It&#x27;s a ten never fails me.</li>
            <li>It is a nice smelling oil that makes my frizzy hair less dry.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who has 100% human hair and wants a natural look or finish</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soft already</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy, greasy serum as some can be, leaving you with dirtier looking hair than you started with.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my natural curly and frizz prone hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and provides some styling hold without being sticky or crunchy.</li>
            <li>It did not work for me as far as a styling agent.  </li>
            <li>I was able to buy this for at least 1/10th of the cost of getting it at my hair salon.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that is silky by nature but somehow still full of flyaways and frizz at the same time.  </li>
            <li>The bottle will last at least 6 months or more.  </li>
            <li>My hair has just enough natural wave to make it unruly; the Miracle Styling Serum tames my hair and allows me to do &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; with it.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend the its a ten product line for your hair esp if your a flat ironer as I am.</li>
            <li>I have natural, yet blonde colored African- American hair.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I burned my hair when I dried it after applying the serum.  </li>
            <li>I like to read reviews (good and bad)</li>

            <li> It is a nice smelling oil that makes my frizzy hair less dry.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has 100% human hair and wants a natural look or finish</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s soft already</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a heavy, greasy serum as some can be, leaving you with dirtier looking hair than you started with.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my natural curly and frizz prone hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and provides some styling hold without being sticky or crunchy.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me as far as a styling agent.  </li>
            <li> I was able to buy this for at least 1/10th of the cost of getting it at my hair salon.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is silky by nature but somehow still full of flyaways and frizz at the same time.  </li>
            <li> The bottle will last at least 6 months or more.  </li>
            <li> My hair has just enough natural wave to make it unruly; the Miracle Styling Serum tames my hair and allows me to do &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; with it.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend the its a ten product line for your hair esp if your a flat ironer as I am.</li>
            <li> I have natural, yet blonde colored African- American hair.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I burned my hair when I dried it after applying the serum.  </li>
            <li> I like to read reviews (good and bad)</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, beaded, curly, frizzy long hair.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this product contain alcohol, which tends to dry out the hair, it was no miracle as the name indicates.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to dry out my hair even further the day after I have used it.</li>
            <li> You only use a little drop and you don&#x27;t have to get your hair wet and blow dry it first, like you did with the other stuff.</li>
            <li> I would simply say this is serum and not really much else.</li>
            <li> I color my hair blonde and due touch ups every 3/4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Will buy as Long as this product is for sale!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, it falls to my waist line.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair has become very dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Then I had a bonus reward of $30 on my order for the amazon rewards card, which made 3 bottles only a few cents total plus my shipping charge of a little over $3.</li>
            <li> Because I am an international buyer, shipping for this is not cheap</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any of the shampoos or conditioners yet just because they are SO expensive, but the price of the serum is definitely worth it</li>
            <li> Love this product, sadly it&#x27;s very expensive, so not really worth the price.  </li>
            <li> The ends are dry and frizzy; so, I need a quality product to moisturize and weight down my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it lasts a loooooooong time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and this little bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I plan on trying other products in this line.  </li>
            <li> I bought this the other day, when they had run out of some other stuff I used in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried other salon products</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is wet, then I apply a small amount after I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tame the frizz as well when you apply it directly to dry hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe it ways my hair down a bit?</li>
            <li> and am looking for a product that will help retain the moisture without weighting the hair down.  </li>
            <li> This serum makes my hair shiny and tames the frizzies without weighing down my hair or making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> When you use it just for split ends or to make your hair less frizzy, it works.</li>
            <li> Hair is still a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I like the product other than the lack of volume.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, one little drop, and I thought it was a rip off until I worked it into my hair and then styled it.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels silky like when I was a little girl.  </li>
            <li> wear just a bit otherwise gets heavy on hair.</li>
            <li> and i feel that this helps tame and benefit it.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my hair and they Always leaves my hair greasy looking limp dull or even make my hair gather lint.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a cap and its expensive!</li>
            <li> My hair frizzed out badly in an area which was alarming and why I thought it was burned as in fried..  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it made my hair look worse than when I use nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every expensive product on the market and nothing was helping to get rid of the dryness.  </li>
            <li> Sadly it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I still had frizz, not as much as I usually have, but I still got the frizz which I hate.</li>
            <li> I apply it after using It&#x27;s a 10 shampoo and conditioner in a desperate attempt to improve my hair conditions.</li>
            <li> It was a drizzly, nasty day out</li>

            <li> I got this free from my hair dresser with a cut and color deal. It feels silky smooth on my hands before I run it through my wet hair, but don&#x27;t use too much!! My hair became shiny and controlled the frizzy fly-aways, however I didn&#x27;t get the volume I&#x27;m used to. Maybe it ways my hair down a bit? I&#x27;m not sure, but I like the product other than the lack of volume.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, I really love it. It smells great, I like how it makes my hair feel and look.  I plan on trying other products in this line.  The price was by far the best price I have found for this serum. Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> I have natural, yet blonde colored African- American hair. It make my hair shine.. Also, adds moisture...a must buy, but also not used alone. Must use Shea butter or hair grease with combination of Algon oil.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; - buy this!! It&#x27;s so awesome for my wavy hair - either to straighten or leave wavy. And I love the smell! Everyone I know uses this and loves it. I&#x27;ll just keep promoting how awesome it is :)  Oh! And it does a pretty good job in the humidity. I bring this every year to the Caribbean and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far to alleviate humidity frizz.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward for this product after I heard about it from my hair designer  it was perfect choice,  Try! and you will b happy with your decision :)</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  It&#x27;s great to use before styling or using any kind of heat procedures on your hair.</li>
            <li> Be careful, it&#x27;s easy to use just a little too much and end up with greasy looking hair, but if you use the correct amount, this product works quite well to increase shine and calm flyaways. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair has become very dry and brittle.  It&#x27;s very fine and I color it often.  I have tried every expensive product on the market and nothing was helping to get rid of the dryness.  I tried this product, one little drop, and I thought it was a rip off until I worked it into my hair and then styled it.  For the first time in years my hair has shine, it&#x27;s silky, has body and is in much better condition.  I think this stuff is holy water!  Honestly I cannot believe the difference.  I went back online and ordered the daily conditioner, deep conditioner and leave in condition with keratin and I love them all.  My hair feels silky like when I was a little girl.  I use this on my son&#x27;s hair and it makes it silky.  It does not make your hair greasy at all.  I have shoulder length hair and use one pump but have used more and it really does not weight it down nor make it greasy.  I would give this product 10 stars if I could!!  Excellent!!</li>
            <li> good for lace wigs and natural hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has 100% human hair and wants a natural look or finish</li>
            <li> Great Serum! I used a little too much the first time, make sure to only use a tiny pea sized amount or hair will not be manageable. My hair dresser used this on my hair at an appointment and I was glad to find here on Amazon at a better price than the salon.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful and tames my frizz.  I use it when my hair is wet, then I apply a small amount after I blow dry.  It lasts a long time and seriously smells so great!!</li>
            <li> Hair feels great and i see it benefiting my hair as well. I color my hair blonde and due touch ups every 3/4 weeks. i have frizzy wavy hair and i feel that this helps tame and benefit it.</li>
            <li> I bought this from my hairdresser and I am here to buy more. I am 60 years old with shoulder length fairly straight hair. Recently my hair has started changing texture and getting frizzy. I have tried a number of products that helped but this is the best I have tried. It makes my hair look more shiny and never looks greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this the other day, when they had run out of some other stuff I used in my hair. I asked for something I could use to help with the frizz and that I straighten my hair and she recommended this. This stuff is great! You only use a little drop and you don&#x27;t have to get your hair wet and blow dry it first, like you did with the other stuff. It makes it so much easier to straighten my hair, and it makes it soft and shiny. My hair would always have some frizz after straightening my hair, however I don&#x27;t with this stuff! The only problem I have is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a cap and its expensive!</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would help with my frizzy hair. Sadly it didn&#x27;t. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, sadly it&#x27;s very expensive, so not really worth the price.  I&#x27;d go with a cheaper version from Walmart,.</li>
            <li> Product name says it all, it is a 10!  My hair has just enough natural wave to make it unruly; the Miracle Styling Serum tames my hair and allows me to do &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; with it.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist uses this on my hair and I could not find it anywhere without paying quite a bit of money for it.  I found it (like most items) on amazon at the best price!  The shipping was quite fast too!</li>
            <li> Great serum to be used before you blow dry your hair to make it easier to style and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Protecting your hair from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, beaded, curly, frizzy long hair.  This was put in my hair by my hair dresser last time I was there.  It was a drizzly, nasty day out and my hair DID NOT frizz. I put about 3 diff. products on my hair and top it off w/a stong hair spray she only used this product I thought I had found the perfect item for no frizz hair.  Am only rating it 3 stars because I&#x27;ve used this 2x&#x27;s since I&#x27;ve gotten it and the 1st time my hair frizzed out, there was little humidity in the air at that time, I did top hair off w/hair spray.  Used again today and so far looks good, humidity low today, again used hair spray.  I let my hair air dry.  Will update as I use this more.&lt;br /&gt;10/10/13 - have used for awhile now and does not work!!!  Hair is still a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever and can&#x27;t live without it!! Has lasted 3 years!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product out since I&#x27;d heard a lot about the &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; line.  I have long hair that is silky by nature but somehow still full of flyaways and frizz at the same time.  I was hoping this serum wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and would give me a more polished look.  Unfortunately, it made my hair look worse than when I use nothing at all.  Yes, it softened my hair but it&#x27;s soft already so I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  It did manage to give me more flyaways and frizz and make it look like I air-dryed my hair on a humid summer day.  I didn&#x27;t want to give up hope immediately so I continued applying the serum every morning before blow drying.  After a week I made my final decision - this stuff isn&#x27;t for my hair.  I ended up giving it to my friend and she didn&#x27;t have much better results.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend full price to try this stuff out - even at my local beauty discount store it was double the price.</li>
            <li> I like this serum on the rare days I would flat iron my hair.  Now that I&#x27;m addicted to Deva products, I try not to straighten it as much, but if I&#x27;m in a pinch to get out the door with wet hair, this works great to keep it from being overly frizzy.  It&#x27;s not a heavy, greasy serum as some can be, leaving you with dirtier looking hair than you started with.  It&#x27;s light, absorbs nicely and works well.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle though...but I have coarse, curly hair so we need different products than those with fine, straighter hair.  My hair is extremely healthy so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m slapping on a quick-fix and hoping for a miracle.  I&#x27;ve just learned that those of us with curlier hair need a different type of product.</li>
            <li> love the its a ten miracle shine spray! All the its a ten products such as its a ten miracle spray witth kertain, its a ten hair serum with and without jertain(use both depending which one I buy when I go shopping) are all incredible products and they really help your hair stay straight and less frizzy and soft and shinny! I would highly reccomend the its a ten product line for your hair esp if your a flat ironer as I am. I love the mastercuts miracle mositure shampoo and conditioners and the mastercuts brand flat iron spray!</li>
            <li> The product is light weight and good for daily use.  It would have received 5 starsj;however it doesn&#x27;t provide that much a of a shine. Overall very good and I will buy again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It makes my hair shiny and soft. I use it everyday, and it smells great, too!!</li>
            <li> I love it, this product makes my hair feel so soft and silky</li>
            <li> I simply love this product. does what it claims. wear just a bit otherwise gets heavy on hair. good product overall.</li>
            <li> I really do love this product - I put it on when my hair is 1/2-3/4 dry, and it not only smooths my hair, it also makes it so very easy for a flat iron to do its job. With this, even if I don&#x27;t use an iron, my hair looks smooth and shiny - and not at all greasy. A little goes a long way, so it lasts a loooooooong time. 😊👍</li>
            <li> I like to read reviews (good and bad) before I purchase any product, but this time I found all these recommendations to be an overrated review.  Not only does this product contain alcohol, which tends to dry out the hair, it was no miracle as the name indicates.  I have fine curly hair (also known as “moisture hog”)...and am looking for a product that will help retain the moisture without weighting the hair down.  This was just not it for me.  good luck.</li>
            <li> Great to use to control  frizz with the blow dryer and to add shine when hair is dry. This product really works to smooth and add shine.</li>
            <li> I would simply say this is serum and not really much else. When you use it just for split ends or to make your hair less frizzy, it works. However I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s by any means a heat protectant. It also seems to dry out my hair even further the day after I have used it. All and all - I just use it on special occasions. Save your money and get serum from your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> I love all &#x27;its a 10&#x27; products. They do exactly what they say.  No bells and whistles, just a solid product.  No frizzies and nice soft hair that is easy to style.  Even when my hair gets damp, it is easy to restyle!</li>
            <li> This is a good product and the price is just right! This product seems to work best if you use it on wet hair and then let it dry. It doesn&#x27;t tame the frizz as well when you apply it directly to dry hair. It is not greasy and leaves a nice shine on your hair. It shipped pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum, it works wonders on my hair without weighing it down. I use all the Its a 10 Products and think they are \\&quot;a 20\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, it falls to my waist line.The ends are dry and frizzy; so, I need a quality product to moisturize and weight down my hair. I really like his serum; however, it does not do the trick on its own, I mix it with oil. I use different oils for my face and hair, oil itself does not do the trick either but in combination with this serum the result is lovely!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my natural curly and frizz prone hair. I didn&#x27;t think it was that good compared to other brand serum use for my hair. I still had frizz, not as much as I usually have, but I still got the frizz which I hate.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft! Does just what it says! Will buy as Long as this product is for sale!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Makes my hair feel soft and provides some styling hold without being sticky or crunchy.</li>
            <li> Works fine for my frizzy hair but does not work like a magic to smoothen out my hair. I apply it after using It&#x27;s a 10 shampoo and conditioner in a desperate attempt to improve my hair conditions. It is a nice smelling oil that makes my frizzy hair less dry. Because I am an international buyer, shipping for this is not cheap so I am till undecided on whether to get another bottle after I have finished the first.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair product. I was first introduced to this serum by my hairdresser.  My hair is colored and somewhat coarse  Just a bit of this serum and my hair is soft and has a great shine.  Her salon no longer had any in stock so I looked into Amazon.  two-thirds the price.  The bottle will last at least 6 months or more.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Best product of its kind.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR HAIR.  LOVE THE WAY IT TAMES MY HAIR AFTER I WASH IT.  i HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS....</li>
            <li> It did not work for me as far as a styling agent.  At first I thought I burned my hair when I dried it after applying the serum.  My hair frizzed out badly in an area which was alarming and why I thought it was burned as in fried..  I haven&#x27;t tried to use it since but still may.  Jury is still out.  Perhaps a better explaination of the Its a 10 Miracle Products should be with the items for sale on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was able to buy this for at least 1/10th of the cost of getting it at my hair salon. Then I had a bonus reward of $30 on my order for the amazon rewards card, which made 3 bottles only a few cents total plus my shipping charge of a little over $3. I have used this product for years &amp; love it- leaves hair soft &amp; still styled nicely. And it smells good! The shipper for this product was fast service &amp; no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new serum for a while. I used to use biosilk but this is a much better product in my opinion. Leaves my hair silky smooth without being oily</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE it&#x27;s a 10!!! This serum makes my hair shiny and tames the frizzies without weighing down my hair or making it look greasy. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the shampoos or conditioners yet just because they are SO expensive, but the price of the serum is definitely worth it and this little bottle lasts a long time (I&#x27;d estimate appx 2-3 months for shoulder length hair)</li>
            <li> I use Miracle 10 everything. I have tried other salon products but It&#x27;s a ten never fails me. I have really curly, breakage prone hair. It&#x27;s nice that I can smooth this on and have my hair look so healthy and not greasy. You do not need to use a lot to see the effects of this miracle product.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my hair and they Always leaves my hair greasy looking limp dull or even make my hair gather lint. This product makes my hair shiny and makes it look fresh and healthy</li>
            <li> Works to help me style my curly hair to a smooth shiny manageable look. Best price at Amazon!</li>
