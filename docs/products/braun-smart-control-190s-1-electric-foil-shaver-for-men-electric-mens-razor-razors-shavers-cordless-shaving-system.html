            <li>If you have to trim a mustache, best shaver on the market, bar none, period.  </li>
            <li>This 190s-1 replaces a WONDERFUL Panasonic ES-SA40 that I&#x27;ve had for 5 - 7 years but whose battery is failing...</li>
            <li>Still works great though !!</li>
            <li>So consider this shaver the perfect gift for either a college grad or a retiree, but no one in between.</li>

            <li>Good Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>It shaves well, is easy to hold and use, and is very good quality.  </li>
            <li>The chipping was quite quick which was great!</li>
            <li>I am 100 percent happy and satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>So, I decided to purchase this newer replacement model, the 190s-1, and am also very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It is not the top of the line model, but I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with my cordless shaver.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a &#x27;perfect&#x27; shave, you&#x27;ll need to plan on using a manual razor to get the neck done right.  </li>
            <li>Good product, very easy to use .Excellent for someone with disabilities.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said i love this shaver!</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a Braun 1000 series that served me amazingly well for probably 9 years.  </li>
            <li>This excellent shaver produces a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Seems as good or better than the Braun 1775 that it is replacing</li>
            <li>The charge lasts more than a week - good for travel - and you can shave with it</li>
            <li>The trimmer is handy for side burns (for ears too).</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>nice and compact.</li>
            <li>This razor holds its own but in my opinion it does not surpass the Braun 3612.</li>
            <li>I get a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>GREATEST SHAVER EVER MADE VERY CLOSE SHAVE</li>
            <li>Great economical shaver!</li>
            <li>Excellent replacement for older Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>Good package,quick shipping,brand new.&lt;br /&gt;You can shave easily and safety.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see it as professional tool for grown men, but for teens it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>I use this shaver every day and it works very fine for me.</li>
            <li>It works almost as good as my original Braun  </li>
            <li>I like being able to stick it under the faucet to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend it!!</li>
            <li>it charges very fast and is great  to take on trips and use at home too.</li>
            <li>, Panasonic discontinued a good product and gave us a &#x27;pot full&#x27; of multi screened razors that I don&#x27;t want.  </li>
            <li>Good for travel, fast charging, comfortable grip, excellent cutter head shape and useful trim blade.</li>
            <li>It seems to recharge fairly quickly and held the one charge that I gave it before I returned it for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and arrived with good packaging and just as if I had gone to department store and bought it (except I didn&#x27;t have to leave the house).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>This is a good shaver and does a more than adequate job.  </li>
            <li>The best for trimming by your lips and above.</li>
            <li>It works better than my rotary.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than a Remington...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been &#x27;OK&#x27; with the brand...</li>
            <li>They DO know better.)</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the product and would recommend it to family and friends.                                                                                             </li>
            <li>We like the size and it seems to be working well for now :-)</li>
            <li>Therefore, if you&#x27;re shaving with it plugged into the outlet, make sure the battery is not already charged.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I was able to get another one for $28 from another seller.</li>
            <li>Able to rinse the head under running water.  </li>
            <li>Mostly concerned about the shelf life of the battery.</li>
            <li>However, this shaver does not do that much better.</li>
            <li>With so many options I wasn&#x27;t sure which way to turn.  </li>
            <li>They last and give a great shave!</li>
            <li>Got this because so many others have changed the &amp;#34;angle&amp;#34; of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>ok, but for a close shave, it has a way to go.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied and would buy again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his favorite</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for about 50 years and NONE has done a better job than this one.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to give electric shaving another try, I thought maybe a more name brand shaver like Braun might give me a better chance of switching to electric.  </li>
            <li>The price of some electric razors, from many manufacturers including Braun, are way overpriced in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>so much better shaver than the 150</li>
            <li>many electric shavers</li>
            <li>that I have for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>The shave is better than acceptable.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it and that is what matters! :)</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.</li>
            <li>Used to love this razor.</li>
            <li>(this has happened with more than one of these razors).  </li>
            <li>spots more than once).  </li>
            <li>and I was pleased with it for the purpose.</li>
            <li>It works ok for my face</li>
            <li>Really love the shave it gives me.</li>
            <li>Trimmer works ok but quickly get quite warm.</li>
            <li>i found it to be very light weight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>but it was a good first razor for my son.</li>
            <li>I switched to Braun because Remington replaced its excellent cutter replacements for its SP-62 shavers with cutters that take a long time to cut.</li>
            <li>he first got it, charged it overnight, then used it, he said he&#x27;d forgotten how close and good</li>
            <li>The foil is great as it allows really fine cuts and, as a result, my neck is cleaned-up and my skin is very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Any kind of pressure and quick movement causes the head assembly to pop off and</li>
            <li>I love the rinseable feature, and how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>got what i paid for.cheap price cheap shaver will spend more to get more</li>
            <li>shaver is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned is the Remington MS3-3700, Remington always made the best shavers until they moved to the big black ones, they just suck in my opinion now.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it was still good quality, just like the older model.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything works good, I like the larger style beard trimmer on this unit and its good for travel as well, even though this is my primary shaver at home too.</li>
            <li>Bought this off the shelf in a shop because it looked as good as the others,  the write up and comparison looked favourable,  and it was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Good product fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much better a razor could be; it is light, compact and easy to handle, it shaves close to the skin and fully recharges in thirty minutes or so.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, rechargeable, and works for my teens faces.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It also takes many &#x27;passes&#x27; to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>It is OK, but not as good as my 4 year old Norelco.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to handle, holds</li>
            <li>the micro screen tears too easily, thus slicing the face</li>
            <li>It goes on strong until the 25 minute mark.</li>
            <li>Plug it in the outlet and it will work better than a full charged battery.</li>
            <li>It works fine for me.</li>
            <li>At my age it is fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>Great shave simple and easy.</li>
            <li>I have used the older model 1775, Free Control 1000 series for years and have been very pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>Ergonomically sound, but the build quality is trash.</li>
            <li>Comfortable fit for my hand, with a slip resistance texture.</li>
            <li>No replacement blades/screen still available.  </li>
            <li>It may not shave as close as some(?), but it is COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li>I wanted a cheap version for my workout bag</li>
            <li>Great, my last one lasted for over 8 years!</li>
            <li>I have always shaved with cheap shick or gilette disposable razors.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and service.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shaver for the price and this one replaces one that was dropped on a recent trip which ripped the screen.</li>
            <li>I am happy with it overall</li>
            <li>and this will last forever being a great shaver and trimmer (beard/sideburns).</li>
            <li>The shave is not close and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Shaved clean and easy for me.</li>
            <li>I shave lightly 2-3 times each week.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price and the shave is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to note that longer hairs will not be caught by the foil, so use the cutter to get them to a manageable size and then the foil will take care of them with no problem.</li>
            <li>, it fits comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH NO RAZOR BURN CLOSE LIKE A BLADE</li>
            <li>Even though it is inexpensive, my 6-year old shaver was just as good.</li>
            <li>Had it a month and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is very useful for sideburns, mustaches and beards.</li>
            <li>, i have too pass this shaver on the same point too many times to get best results, and this make my shave experience too slow, otherwise good quality built and design.</li>
            <li>It inexpensively does a great job, in some ways possibly better than the previous Braun model t replaces.</li>
            <li>Use the trimmer first in order to get most of the beard out.</li>
            <li>do like that it is shower/faucet friendly.</li>
            <li>but if it lasts anywhere as long  I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with the old shaver.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with my old which lasted 6+ years.  </li>
            <li>Gets a clean shave</li>
            <li>Great economical shaver, especially for travel.</li>
            <li>I use this shaver to clean up my lower neck</li>
            <li>Other than that it has a very nice comfortable  handle</li>
            <li>I was very glad to see Braun still making this model available when my last unit gave up.</li>
            <li>Great for travel, great for touchups after work, and just enough oomph to take care of the mornings (though you might have to pass over trouble</li>
            <li>mostly rotary types but, really?</li>
            <li>I thought I would step up and get a Braun, after all its German so it must be good.</li>
            <li>Then I proceeded to shave after the full charge.</li>
            <li>Construction good, seems solid and well made.</li>
            <li>I find the straight blade trimmers easier and more flexible to use.</li>
            <li>good shape &amp; low price .</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>Battery shaver is good for my daughter that has visual problems.</li>
            <li>The price is not bad.</li>
            <li>things considered, it&#x27;s not a bad razor per se, however, it doesn&#x27;t fulfill the specialty category that it purports to.</li>
            <li>Price not bad compared to some others.</li>
            <li>This is a good cordless razor that holds a charge for a long time and delivers a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of the old single bladed Braun that I always thought was the best they ever made.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy either with the brush, or under hot water.</li>
            <li>For a great shave, I still use a straight razor, but for a quick shave that&#x27;s decent, it works well, plus it saves me $$ on having to buy straight replacement blades all the time.</li>
            <li>Product is ok, but I will stick with the better models next time.</li>
            <li>Its lightweight - I use with shaving cream as its water proof if need super close shave as well.  </li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s quick</li>
            <li>Shaves well; lasts for years, charges quickly and holds charge for 8 days.</li>
            <li>easy to clean and very ergonomic.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and will run for about 45 minutes after fully charged.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly and shaves well.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a cost effective on the go shaver with a broad shaving surface this is it.</li>
            <li>No Frills just get it done with a very reasonable price point!</li>
            <li>Great value for the money works better than much more expensive models .</li>
            <li>Long story short, I found this model and I am completely happy with this baby!</li>
            <li>Buying the more affordable model is another mistake that costs more in the long run.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m an easy customer to please but trust me, pay more and get a better model, the time you will waste every morning with this thing will add up.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that the charging light goes out when the shaver is fully recharged (a real convenience), is quiet in operation, and being washable, is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I liked it because the single screen is a nice big curve and slides over my skin smoothly.  </li>
            <li>lightweight, fast charging time for a cheap price and convenient to carry when traveling.</li>
            <li>Fast smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Good quality as one expects of German products, at reasonable price</li>
            <li>Probably a better choice, if you don&#x27;t shave every day, is the Braun Series 3-340 which is close to the same price and seems to handle older growth much better.</li>
            <li>Takes a good bit longer to shave a 2-3 day beard than my older basic model braun.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as some of the other Braun shavers</li>
            <li>Some things Braun got right.  </li>
            <li>This thing is priced on Amazon right now for under $40.  </li>
            <li>I liked it enough to purchase it again after I had to retire my first one which lasted about 5 years.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to switch from shaver to trimmer and back.  </li>
            <li>Use it primarily for the chin and upper lip area seems to need a couple passes but does a fine job and  right price</li>
            <li>This razor is better as a secondary travel razor more than it is as a primary one.</li>
            <li>They charge nicely, the battery works for almost a week on one charge, and the shaver lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Looked to Amazon and found this at a very reasonable price (as these things go) and ordered right away.</li>
            <li>The product is a great value, and it should last for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clif</li>
            <li>It did take me a few passes to get a good shave, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>I then purchased the double head Braun 7-720 which is a far superior razor.</li>
            <li>If, on the other hand, you&#x27;ld rather get a good shave and save some money, the Braun Smart Control 190s-1 is for you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, seems to take forever to shave and doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.  </li>
            <li>Every shaver requires you to go over the same area with more than one swipe.</li>
            <li>He had enjoyed that one for many years and was afraid he wouldn&#x27;t get another he liked as well.</li>
            <li>So if you shave pretty often this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>too light for an adult beard.</li>
            <li>this my second one and I like better than my series 3 .</li>
            <li>first one I have had for over 7 years and is still running good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>bought this last one to be sure I had plenty before they change the style.</li>
            <li>This shaver actually shaves closer than my manual blades have been able to.</li>
            <li>The batteries recharge in just a few minutes, and are good for 5-7 days of shaving.  </li>
            <li>It handles my heavy beard easily and gets most everything on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>It has a new designed shaving head which seems to shave better than the old design.</li>
            <li>The new one has even better features than the old one.</li>
            <li>If you do not have the wild stubble that I do, I would actually recommend this razor as it is a cost effective choice among cordless razors, but then again, you probably wouldn&#x27;t be looking at this &amp;#34;specialty&amp;#34; razor in the first place, were that the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old one with a nearly drained batter cuts better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not worth that kind of money.  </li>
            <li>The Braun Smart Control 190s-1 arrived new and sealed, but the cap on the oil bottle wasn&#x27;t securely on and more than half of the oil had leaked out into the accessories box and onto the literature.</li>
            <li>I have had the 3 head rotary style shaver which got most but not all of the errant hairs leaving me to dry shave with a safety razor</li>
            <li>Not as nice as previous 190 but runs longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basic, easy to use and maintain, and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Braun Smart Control 190s-1 Cordless Shaver 1 Count&lt;br /&gt;Iv&#x27;e had this shaver before</li>
            <li>I have been an user of the Braun Smart Shaver series 1 for over 20 years now.</li>
            <li>This was to replace a Braun Smart Control I had for about 7 years.  </li>
            <li>She says that it does not pull her fine hair that grows under and around her upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it daily and said it was a great little shaver.</li>
            <li>Gives a good, close shave; However the foil can pop out if you press the razor too hard against your face.</li>
            <li>I have only had it for a few days, but it works great even on the neck areas.</li>
            <li>I decided to check here on Amazon for another Braun, since I have grown very fond of the quality.</li>
            <li>It much louder and doesn&#x27;t shave as close.  </li>
            <li>Still shaves very well</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li>The trimmer pops up straight and the blade is straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the pop-up trimmers that are not straight.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why some people complain about the straight pop-up trimmers and blade.</li>
            <li>The blade is gentle.</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li>and it worked really well</li>
            <li>Not rife with bells and whistles but, in it&#x27;s purest for, it really doesn&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li>I realized that my rotary style shaver was finally ready for retirement when it received</li>
            <li>It made cleaning much easier.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 3 months now and really like it.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer slides straight up, which is what he wanted.</li>
            <li>shaves very well and close without burning.</li>
            <li>Maybe more shaver than expected for the price.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, simple to use and charge.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I just don&#x27;t like electric shaves, but this didn&#x27;t seem to work very well at all.  </li>
            <li>Replacement screens and cutters are available at  a very low price, too.</li>
            <li>PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-It provides a very close shave for an electric razor (see caveat</li>
            <li>If you are considering a purchanse, do not hesitate it works really well.</li>
            <li>it would really cut great.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and very well built.</li>
            <li>recommend it for people with not too much or condensed hair.</li>
            <li>For my light growth the battery easily last over a week.</li>
            <li>Really tempted to order another one just in case</li>
            <li>(In the most recent one, the motor completely stopped working, and would not even take a charge, after just 5 months.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to using the old shaver, which works better despite a worn-out cutter.</li>
            <li>For a daily shave it is quick and shaves pretty good, though it&#x27;s hard work under the chin -</li>
            <li>Great for my teenager with fine, thin, newly growing facial hair.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Relatively small unit, very portable.</li>
            <li>Cheap, battery runs long</li>
            <li>I have had it for a few months now and find I am  wet shaving more and more because the Braun just does not do the job.  </li>
            <li>Definitely needs more power for that Tuesday morning after a long weekend, though, even if you use that robust trimmer first.</li>
            <li>My previous shaver (Remington) didn&#x27;t require so many passes...</li>
            <li>I cannot see a reason to pay more as I don&#x27;t know how much better the expensive ones could be.</li>
            <li>However, it still gives me a decent line up.</li>
            <li>It is just like the older model.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a replacement for my guy&#x27;s older Braun.</li>
            <li>I am struggling to have this issue solved via Amazon and Braun.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver head with its blade costs 1/4 of the entire shaver unit, so I refuse to buy a replacement blade.&lt;br /&gt;Braun lost a loyal customer here.&lt;br /&gt;Bye</li>
            <li>My model #1775, the older version of this one, gave up after 20 years.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older model my husband owned.</li>
            <li>This shaver replaces an older Braun model whose battery would no longer recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brauns are far superior than Remmington brands which I had used 10 yrs prior they and have poor screens which bends and breaks too easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned an older model Braun for years.</li>
            <li>This Braun is a single screen but NOT quite as &#x27;smooth&#x27; as I&#x27;m use to.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;After a completely charge,it can work for a long time.</li>
            <li>I will likely buy a third in the future as it works so well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Got it freshman year of high school</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing this Braun Smart Control 190s-1 is old stock</li>
            <li>We could have replaced just that, but for a little more we purchased another razor.</li>
            <li>Your face is covered with skin--not concrete.</li>
            <li>This one only has one shaving head and  leaves many long hairs.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I guess it was a success because I got a big thank you for sending it.</li>
            <li>The old single unit one worked fine.</li>
            <li>If only they had given the thing a strong enough motor to shave.  </li>
            <li>A lot of people buy these shavers without knowing how to use them properly in order to get the right result.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s first social security check in the mail.</li>
            <li>Most of my shaves are done with the trimmer part because I usually let my beard grow for more than a few days.</li>
            <li>This shaver is a new step up for me.</li>
            <li>My Remington needed new blades.</li>
            <li>But as the shaver is no longer being mfg I couldnt get new blades.</li>
            <li>but it simply wont get as good a shave as my Remington even with the dull blades.</li>
            <li>This is nearly identical to the older 1775 model, but the new head assembly is a disaster.</li>
            <li>My oldest son said it didn&#x27;t work on his coarse beard very well, but it was a quick &#x27;trial&#x27; before teaching his younger brother how to use a razor.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s performing like the older version.</li>
            <li>Needed new foil and cutter on old 5 year old razor so for a few dollars more I could get a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li>The things that I love about this one is that you can charge it while using it at the same time, it doesn&#x27;t take too long to charge or clean, when charged it lasts a long time, and it shaves off facial hair with ease!</li>
            <li>This shaver offers one heck of a bang for your buck!</li>
            <li>Powerful and the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It gives me a sharp clean shave.</li>
            <li>The newer version has a better trimmer than the old,  other than that, it&#x27;s about the same.  </li>
            <li>Im going to try to find a new old stock shaver like the one I had</li>
            <li>Because presumably you don&#x27;t have a job to get to or any other pressing, time sensitive engagement that requires a quick shave.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave and long battery life would highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, the outside of the box was dated 2011, which could make it as much as four years old.</li>
            <li>Completely died after 3 uses.</li>
            <li>Once the green light turns off, unplug it in order to avoid overcharging the battery.</li>
            <li>I guess the soft, tender stubble of my 20&#x27;s is no match for the burly five o&#x27;clock shadow of my 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It also misses softer longer hairs completely, necessitating using the trimmer too often.  </li>
            <li>the old cord-electric-plug-in-the-wall electric shave back...!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just like my old one that lasted 8 years.</li>
            <li>Although our old Braun cordless razer was still working after 6 years, we still use it when guests need one..</li>
            <li>my old norelgo cuts closer.</li>
            <li>I must saw that I have been very pleasantly surprised by this budget shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few of these--only because they&#x27;re cheap--but the quality of the most recent ones has been extremely poor, and even the earlier ones weren&#x27;t particularly good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little louder than the original</li>
            <li>If you feel you get a better shave, or are in some other way enhanced by using an expensive razor, you are most welcomed to do so.  </li>
            <li>this results in catching hairs that grow in defferent angles that a screen with only small round holes miss and need to go over the same area several times to get most of the hairs.this  model with</li>
            <li>Rechargeable, no more double A&#x27;s, charges in a very brief amount of time, lasts about a week or more on a charge, is very ergonomic and rubber coated so it won&#x27;t slip out of my hand onto the floor again.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and can use with the cord (unlike my previous Cruzers).  </li>
            <li>reminds me of an older model that I have this my third braun shaver</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this to replace the older model that lasted about 8 years.</li>
            <li>Further, although they work pretty well during the first few uses, very soon you find yourself having to go over the same patch of your face over and over from every angle just to get the appearance of a shave.</li>
            <li>Purchase this to replace the 1775 older model which was used for travel and finally gave up on me after 5 yrs.</li>
            <li>If the 190s-1 works even half as long as my previous Braun, I will still consider it a good value.</li>
            <li>I have 3 other Brauns with the separate power buttons for on and off and this has only a single switch, more practical.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It charges fast and once charged, it lasts relatively long.</li>
            <li>In my two most recent ones, the motors simply died after a few months.</li>
            <li>Its been several years since I had new ones.</li>
            <li>I have used Remington shavers for years, but a few years ago, they started making them cheaply and of low quality.  </li>
            <li>this does not keep happening as without the trimmer its difficult to get a good shave unless one shaves daily.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer is a push up, like most, but the cutter is at the very end, rather at a 90° angle, which makes it difficult to use.</li>
            <li>Its single head shaver and head design really give me a close shave.  </li>
            <li>What a major difference.  </li>
            <li>The original cutter and foil usually needs to be replaced after 12-18 months depending on the frequency of use.</li>
            <li>Bought this shaver to replace an older Braun 3612 (a similar basic foil shaver model that has been discontinued).</li>
            <li>The Braun Smart Control 190s is a small, lightweight shaver with a really robust trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Battery charge does not last as long as my old Remington, does not shave as close as the older Braun series.</li>
            <li>For weeks thereafter I struggled every morning trying to hold the batteries intact while shaving, finally coming to the realization that it was time to retire old faithful.</li>
            <li>Even day old stubble growth took multiple passes.  </li>
            <li>so thought I would give this a go again after my old Norelco finally gave out.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice stragglers that got missed several days in a row anymore, like I did with my old razor.  </li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews on this razor, I bought one to replace an old double head Braun</li>
            <li>Back to the old razor blade.</li>
            <li>It is an exact replacement for my previous Braun shaver, FreeControl model 5729, and the parts are interchangeable.</li>
            <li>Very surprised it&#x27;s lasted this long.</li>
            <li>just hope the foil and cutter will last long as they cost half the price of the shaver and they become discontinued very fast to make you buy a new shaver, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The batteries will accept a charge even after several years of use, although the shaver works directly from house current also.  </li>
            <li>I can only give this razor two stars as it leaves more hair behind than the rotary style.</li>
            <li>I can make the line-up look sharper when I spend few extra minutes on it by using the head foil to clean around the line-up carefully.</li>
            <li>As quick shaves go, the Braun Smart Control 190s-1 fails to deliver.  </li>
            <li>Very noisy and very little actual shaving action going on despite trying every which way.</li>
            <li>Shaving after a days growth is hard work (at least for my wiry pepper beard) and beyond that you need to wet-razor shave first and then clean up with this shaver.</li>
            <li>This could be due to the new hole pattern in the foil guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have people mention to me how smooth a shave I have, it gets all the tough areas on my face and no five o&#x27;clock shadows.</li>
            <li>My experience is that the shaver does fine on day old beard (at least mine), but it does have trouble with a couple of days growth.</li>

            <li> Best electric shaver ever!</li>
            <li> If you have to trim a mustache, best shaver on the market, bar none, period.  </li>
            <li> This 190s-1 replaces a WONDERFUL Panasonic ES-SA40 that I&#x27;ve had for 5 - 7 years but whose battery is failing...</li>
            <li> Still works great though !!</li>
            <li> So consider this shaver the perfect gift for either a college grad or a retiree, but no one in between.</li>

            <li> Good Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> It shaves well, is easy to hold and use, and is very good quality.  </li>
            <li> The chipping was quite quick which was great!</li>
            <li> I am 100 percent happy and satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> So, I decided to purchase this newer replacement model, the 190s-1, and am also very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I did.  </li>
            <li> It is not the top of the line model, but I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my cordless shaver.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a &#x27;perfect&#x27; shave, you&#x27;ll need to plan on using a manual razor to get the neck done right.  </li>
            <li> Good product, very easy to use .Excellent for someone with disabilities.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said i love this shaver!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Braun 1000 series that served me amazingly well for probably 9 years.  </li>
            <li> This excellent shaver produces a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> Seems as good or better than the Braun 1775 that it is replacing</li>
            <li> The charge lasts more than a week - good for travel - and you can shave with it</li>
            <li> The trimmer is handy for side burns (for ears too).</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> nice and compact.</li>
            <li> This razor holds its own but in my opinion it does not surpass the Braun 3612.</li>
            <li> I get a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> GREATEST SHAVER EVER MADE VERY CLOSE SHAVE</li>
            <li> Great economical shaver!</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for older Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Good package,quick shipping,brand new.&lt;br /&gt;You can shave easily and safety.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see it as professional tool for grown men, but for teens it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I use this shaver every day and it works very fine for me.</li>
            <li> It works almost as good as my original Braun  </li>
            <li> I like being able to stick it under the faucet to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend it!!</li>
            <li> it charges very fast and is great  to take on trips and use at home too.</li>
            <li> , Panasonic discontinued a good product and gave us a &#x27;pot full&#x27; of multi screened razors that I don&#x27;t want.  </li>
            <li> Good for travel, fast charging, comfortable grip, excellent cutter head shape and useful trim blade.</li>
            <li> It seems to recharge fairly quickly and held the one charge that I gave it before I returned it for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and arrived with good packaging and just as if I had gone to department store and bought it (except I didn&#x27;t have to leave the house).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver and does a more than adequate job.  </li>
            <li> The best for trimming by your lips and above.</li>
            <li> It works better than my rotary.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than a Remington...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been &#x27;OK&#x27; with the brand...</li>
            <li> They DO know better.)</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the product and would recommend it to family and friends.                                                                                             </li>
            <li> We like the size and it seems to be working well for now :-)</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you&#x27;re shaving with it plugged into the outlet, make sure the battery is not already charged.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I was able to get another one for $28 from another seller.</li>
            <li> Able to rinse the head under running water.  </li>
            <li> Mostly concerned about the shelf life of the battery.</li>
            <li> However, this shaver does not do that much better.</li>
            <li> With so many options I wasn&#x27;t sure which way to turn.  </li>
            <li> They last and give a great shave!</li>
            <li> Got this because so many others have changed the &amp;#34;angle&amp;#34; of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> ok, but for a close shave, it has a way to go.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied and would buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s his favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for about 50 years and NONE has done a better job than this one.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to give electric shaving another try, I thought maybe a more name brand shaver like Braun might give me a better chance of switching to electric.  </li>
            <li> The price of some electric razors, from many manufacturers including Braun, are way overpriced in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> so much better shaver than the 150</li>
            <li> many electric shavers</li>
            <li> that I have for many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> The shave is better than acceptable.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and that is what matters! :)</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.</li>
            <li> Used to love this razor.</li>
            <li> (this has happened with more than one of these razors).  </li>
            <li> spots more than once).  </li>
            <li> and I was pleased with it for the purpose.</li>
            <li> It works ok for my face</li>
            <li> Really love the shave it gives me.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works ok but quickly get quite warm.</li>
            <li> i found it to be very light weight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> but it was a good first razor for my son.</li>
            <li> I switched to Braun because Remington replaced its excellent cutter replacements for its SP-62 shavers with cutters that take a long time to cut.</li>
            <li> he first got it, charged it overnight, then used it, he said he&#x27;d forgotten how close and good</li>
            <li> The foil is great as it allows really fine cuts and, as a result, my neck is cleaned-up and my skin is very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Any kind of pressure and quick movement causes the head assembly to pop off and</li>
            <li> I love the rinseable feature, and how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> got what i paid for.cheap price cheap shaver will spend more to get more</li>
            <li> shaver is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned is the Remington MS3-3700, Remington always made the best shavers until they moved to the big black ones, they just suck in my opinion now.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find it was still good quality, just like the older model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything works good, I like the larger style beard trimmer on this unit and its good for travel as well, even though this is my primary shaver at home too.</li>
            <li> Bought this off the shelf in a shop because it looked as good as the others,  the write up and comparison looked favourable,  and it was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Good product fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much better a razor could be; it is light, compact and easy to handle, it shaves close to the skin and fully recharges in thirty minutes or so.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, rechargeable, and works for my teens faces.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It also takes many &#x27;passes&#x27; to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> It is OK, but not as good as my 4 year old Norelco.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to handle, holds</li>
            <li> the micro screen tears too easily, thus slicing the face</li>
            <li> It goes on strong until the 25 minute mark.</li>
            <li> Plug it in the outlet and it will work better than a full charged battery.</li>
            <li> It works fine for me.</li>
            <li> At my age it is fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> Great shave simple and easy.</li>
            <li> I have used the older model 1775, Free Control 1000 series for years and have been very pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li> Ergonomically sound, but the build quality is trash.</li>
            <li> Comfortable fit for my hand, with a slip resistance texture.</li>
            <li> No replacement blades/screen still available.  </li>
            <li> It may not shave as close as some(?), but it is COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li> I wanted a cheap version for my workout bag</li>
            <li> Great, my last one lasted for over 8 years!</li>
            <li> I have always shaved with cheap shick or gilette disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver for the price and this one replaces one that was dropped on a recent trip which ripped the screen.</li>
            <li> I am happy with it overall</li>
            <li> and this will last forever being a great shaver and trimmer (beard/sideburns).</li>
            <li> The shave is not close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Shaved clean and easy for me.</li>
            <li> I shave lightly 2-3 times each week.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and the shave is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to note that longer hairs will not be caught by the foil, so use the cutter to get them to a manageable size and then the foil will take care of them with no problem.</li>
            <li> , it fits comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH NO RAZOR BURN CLOSE LIKE A BLADE</li>
            <li> Even though it is inexpensive, my 6-year old shaver was just as good.</li>
            <li> Had it a month and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is very useful for sideburns, mustaches and beards.</li>
            <li> , i have too pass this shaver on the same point too many times to get best results, and this make my shave experience too slow, otherwise good quality built and design.</li>
            <li> It inexpensively does a great job, in some ways possibly better than the previous Braun model t replaces.</li>
            <li> Use the trimmer first in order to get most of the beard out.</li>
            <li> do like that it is shower/faucet friendly.</li>
            <li> but if it lasts anywhere as long  I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the old shaver.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with my old which lasted 6+ years.  </li>
            <li> Gets a clean shave</li>
            <li> Great economical shaver, especially for travel.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver to clean up my lower neck</li>
            <li> Other than that it has a very nice comfortable  handle</li>
            <li> I was very glad to see Braun still making this model available when my last unit gave up.</li>
            <li> Great for travel, great for touchups after work, and just enough oomph to take care of the mornings (though you might have to pass over trouble</li>
            <li> mostly rotary types but, really?</li>
            <li> I thought I would step up and get a Braun, after all its German so it must be good.</li>
            <li> Then I proceeded to shave after the full charge.</li>
            <li> Construction good, seems solid and well made.</li>
            <li> I find the straight blade trimmers easier and more flexible to use.</li>
            <li> good shape &amp; low price .</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> Battery shaver is good for my daughter that has visual problems.</li>
            <li> The price is not bad.</li>
            <li> things considered, it&#x27;s not a bad razor per se, however, it doesn&#x27;t fulfill the specialty category that it purports to.</li>
            <li> Price not bad compared to some others.</li>
            <li> This is a good cordless razor that holds a charge for a long time and delivers a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of the old single bladed Braun that I always thought was the best they ever made.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy either with the brush, or under hot water.</li>
            <li> For a great shave, I still use a straight razor, but for a quick shave that&#x27;s decent, it works well, plus it saves me $$ on having to buy straight replacement blades all the time.</li>
            <li> Product is ok, but I will stick with the better models next time.</li>
            <li> Its lightweight - I use with shaving cream as its water proof if need super close shave as well.  </li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s quick</li>
            <li> Shaves well; lasts for years, charges quickly and holds charge for 8 days.</li>
            <li> easy to clean and very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and will run for about 45 minutes after fully charged.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly and shaves well.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cost effective on the go shaver with a broad shaving surface this is it.</li>
            <li> No Frills just get it done with a very reasonable price point!</li>
            <li> Great value for the money works better than much more expensive models .</li>
            <li> Long story short, I found this model and I am completely happy with this baby!</li>
            <li> Buying the more affordable model is another mistake that costs more in the long run.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m an easy customer to please but trust me, pay more and get a better model, the time you will waste every morning with this thing will add up.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that the charging light goes out when the shaver is fully recharged (a real convenience), is quiet in operation, and being washable, is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I liked it because the single screen is a nice big curve and slides over my skin smoothly.  </li>
            <li> lightweight, fast charging time for a cheap price and convenient to carry when traveling.</li>
            <li> Fast smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Good quality as one expects of German products, at reasonable price</li>
            <li> Probably a better choice, if you don&#x27;t shave every day, is the Braun Series 3-340 which is close to the same price and seems to handle older growth much better.</li>
            <li> Takes a good bit longer to shave a 2-3 day beard than my older basic model braun.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as some of the other Braun shavers</li>
            <li> Some things Braun got right.  </li>
            <li> This thing is priced on Amazon right now for under $40.  </li>
            <li> I liked it enough to purchase it again after I had to retire my first one which lasted about 5 years.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to switch from shaver to trimmer and back.  </li>
            <li> Use it primarily for the chin and upper lip area seems to need a couple passes but does a fine job and  right price</li>
            <li> This razor is better as a secondary travel razor more than it is as a primary one.</li>
            <li> They charge nicely, the battery works for almost a week on one charge, and the shaver lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Looked to Amazon and found this at a very reasonable price (as these things go) and ordered right away.</li>
            <li> The product is a great value, and it should last for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clif</li>
            <li> It did take me a few passes to get a good shave, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I then purchased the double head Braun 7-720 which is a far superior razor.</li>
            <li> If, on the other hand, you&#x27;ld rather get a good shave and save some money, the Braun Smart Control 190s-1 is for you.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, seems to take forever to shave and doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.  </li>
            <li> Every shaver requires you to go over the same area with more than one swipe.</li>
            <li> He had enjoyed that one for many years and was afraid he wouldn&#x27;t get another he liked as well.</li>
            <li> So if you shave pretty often this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> too light for an adult beard.</li>
            <li> this my second one and I like better than my series 3 .</li>
            <li> first one I have had for over 7 years and is still running good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> bought this last one to be sure I had plenty before they change the style.</li>
            <li> This shaver actually shaves closer than my manual blades have been able to.</li>
            <li> The batteries recharge in just a few minutes, and are good for 5-7 days of shaving.  </li>
            <li> It handles my heavy beard easily and gets most everything on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> It has a new designed shaving head which seems to shave better than the old design.</li>
            <li> The new one has even better features than the old one.</li>
            <li> If you do not have the wild stubble that I do, I would actually recommend this razor as it is a cost effective choice among cordless razors, but then again, you probably wouldn&#x27;t be looking at this &amp;#34;specialty&amp;#34; razor in the first place, were that the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old one with a nearly drained batter cuts better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth that kind of money.  </li>
            <li> The Braun Smart Control 190s-1 arrived new and sealed, but the cap on the oil bottle wasn&#x27;t securely on and more than half of the oil had leaked out into the accessories box and onto the literature.</li>
            <li> I have had the 3 head rotary style shaver which got most but not all of the errant hairs leaving me to dry shave with a safety razor</li>
            <li> Not as nice as previous 190 but runs longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basic, easy to use and maintain, and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Braun Smart Control 190s-1 Cordless Shaver 1 Count&lt;br /&gt;Iv&#x27;e had this shaver before</li>
            <li> I have been an user of the Braun Smart Shaver series 1 for over 20 years now.</li>
            <li> This was to replace a Braun Smart Control I had for about 7 years.  </li>
            <li> She says that it does not pull her fine hair that grows under and around her upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it daily and said it was a great little shaver.</li>
            <li> Gives a good, close shave; However the foil can pop out if you press the razor too hard against your face.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a few days, but it works great even on the neck areas.</li>
            <li> I decided to check here on Amazon for another Braun, since I have grown very fond of the quality.</li>
            <li> It much louder and doesn&#x27;t shave as close.  </li>
            <li> Still shaves very well</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> The trimmer pops up straight and the blade is straight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the pop-up trimmers that are not straight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why some people complain about the straight pop-up trimmers and blade.</li>
            <li> The blade is gentle.</li>
            <li> Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> and it worked really well</li>
            <li> Not rife with bells and whistles but, in it&#x27;s purest for, it really doesn&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> I realized that my rotary style shaver was finally ready for retirement when it received</li>
            <li> It made cleaning much easier.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months now and really like it.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer slides straight up, which is what he wanted.</li>
            <li> shaves very well and close without burning.</li>
            <li> Maybe more shaver than expected for the price.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, simple to use and charge.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t like electric shaves, but this didn&#x27;t seem to work very well at all.  </li>
            <li> Replacement screens and cutters are available at  a very low price, too.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-It provides a very close shave for an electric razor (see caveat</li>
            <li> If you are considering a purchanse, do not hesitate it works really well.</li>
            <li> it would really cut great.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and very well built.</li>
            <li> recommend it for people with not too much or condensed hair.</li>
            <li> For my light growth the battery easily last over a week.</li>
            <li> Really tempted to order another one just in case</li>
            <li> (In the most recent one, the motor completely stopped working, and would not even take a charge, after just 5 months.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to using the old shaver, which works better despite a worn-out cutter.</li>
            <li> For a daily shave it is quick and shaves pretty good, though it&#x27;s hard work under the chin -</li>
            <li> Great for my teenager with fine, thin, newly growing facial hair.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Relatively small unit, very portable.</li>
            <li> Cheap, battery runs long</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few months now and find I am  wet shaving more and more because the Braun just does not do the job.  </li>
            <li> Definitely needs more power for that Tuesday morning after a long weekend, though, even if you use that robust trimmer first.</li>
            <li> My previous shaver (Remington) didn&#x27;t require so many passes...</li>
            <li> I cannot see a reason to pay more as I don&#x27;t know how much better the expensive ones could be.</li>
            <li> However, it still gives me a decent line up.</li>
            <li> It is just like the older model.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for my guy&#x27;s older Braun.</li>
            <li> I am struggling to have this issue solved via Amazon and Braun.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver head with its blade costs 1/4 of the entire shaver unit, so I refuse to buy a replacement blade.&lt;br /&gt;Braun lost a loyal customer here.&lt;br /&gt;Bye</li>
            <li> My model #1775, the older version of this one, gave up after 20 years.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older model my husband owned.</li>
            <li> This shaver replaces an older Braun model whose battery would no longer recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brauns are far superior than Remmington brands which I had used 10 yrs prior they and have poor screens which bends and breaks too easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned an older model Braun for years.</li>
            <li> This Braun is a single screen but NOT quite as &#x27;smooth&#x27; as I&#x27;m use to.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;After a completely charge,it can work for a long time.</li>
            <li> I will likely buy a third in the future as it works so well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Got it freshman year of high school</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this Braun Smart Control 190s-1 is old stock</li>
            <li> We could have replaced just that, but for a little more we purchased another razor.</li>
            <li> Your face is covered with skin--not concrete.</li>
            <li> This one only has one shaving head and  leaves many long hairs.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I guess it was a success because I got a big thank you for sending it.</li>
            <li> The old single unit one worked fine.</li>
            <li> If only they had given the thing a strong enough motor to shave.  </li>
            <li> A lot of people buy these shavers without knowing how to use them properly in order to get the right result.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s first social security check in the mail.</li>
            <li> Most of my shaves are done with the trimmer part because I usually let my beard grow for more than a few days.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a new step up for me.</li>
            <li> My Remington needed new blades.</li>
            <li> But as the shaver is no longer being mfg I couldnt get new blades.</li>
            <li> but it simply wont get as good a shave as my Remington even with the dull blades.</li>
            <li> This is nearly identical to the older 1775 model, but the new head assembly is a disaster.</li>
            <li> My oldest son said it didn&#x27;t work on his coarse beard very well, but it was a quick &#x27;trial&#x27; before teaching his younger brother how to use a razor.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s performing like the older version.</li>
            <li> Needed new foil and cutter on old 5 year old razor so for a few dollars more I could get a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> The things that I love about this one is that you can charge it while using it at the same time, it doesn&#x27;t take too long to charge or clean, when charged it lasts a long time, and it shaves off facial hair with ease!</li>
            <li> This shaver offers one heck of a bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> Powerful and the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It gives me a sharp clean shave.</li>
            <li> The newer version has a better trimmer than the old,  other than that, it&#x27;s about the same.  </li>
            <li> Im going to try to find a new old stock shaver like the one I had</li>
            <li> Because presumably you don&#x27;t have a job to get to or any other pressing, time sensitive engagement that requires a quick shave.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave and long battery life would highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , the outside of the box was dated 2011, which could make it as much as four years old.</li>
            <li> Completely died after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Once the green light turns off, unplug it in order to avoid overcharging the battery.</li>
            <li> I guess the soft, tender stubble of my 20&#x27;s is no match for the burly five o&#x27;clock shadow of my 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It also misses softer longer hairs completely, necessitating using the trimmer too often.  </li>
            <li> the old cord-electric-plug-in-the-wall electric shave back...!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just like my old one that lasted 8 years.</li>
            <li> Although our old Braun cordless razer was still working after 6 years, we still use it when guests need one..</li>
            <li> my old norelgo cuts closer.</li>
            <li> I must saw that I have been very pleasantly surprised by this budget shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few of these--only because they&#x27;re cheap--but the quality of the most recent ones has been extremely poor, and even the earlier ones weren&#x27;t particularly good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little louder than the original</li>
            <li> If you feel you get a better shave, or are in some other way enhanced by using an expensive razor, you are most welcomed to do so.  </li>
            <li> this results in catching hairs that grow in defferent angles that a screen with only small round holes miss and need to go over the same area several times to get most of the hairs.this  model with</li>
            <li> Rechargeable, no more double A&#x27;s, charges in a very brief amount of time, lasts about a week or more on a charge, is very ergonomic and rubber coated so it won&#x27;t slip out of my hand onto the floor again.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and can use with the cord (unlike my previous Cruzers).  </li>
            <li> reminds me of an older model that I have this my third braun shaver</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this to replace the older model that lasted about 8 years.</li>
            <li> Further, although they work pretty well during the first few uses, very soon you find yourself having to go over the same patch of your face over and over from every angle just to get the appearance of a shave.</li>
            <li> Purchase this to replace the 1775 older model which was used for travel and finally gave up on me after 5 yrs.</li>
            <li> If the 190s-1 works even half as long as my previous Braun, I will still consider it a good value.</li>
            <li> I have 3 other Brauns with the separate power buttons for on and off and this has only a single switch, more practical.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It charges fast and once charged, it lasts relatively long.</li>
            <li> In my two most recent ones, the motors simply died after a few months.</li>
            <li> Its been several years since I had new ones.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington shavers for years, but a few years ago, they started making them cheaply and of low quality.  </li>
            <li> this does not keep happening as without the trimmer its difficult to get a good shave unless one shaves daily.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is a push up, like most, but the cutter is at the very end, rather at a 90° angle, which makes it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Its single head shaver and head design really give me a close shave.  </li>
            <li> What a major difference.  </li>
            <li> The original cutter and foil usually needs to be replaced after 12-18 months depending on the frequency of use.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver to replace an older Braun 3612 (a similar basic foil shaver model that has been discontinued).</li>
            <li> The Braun Smart Control 190s is a small, lightweight shaver with a really robust trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Battery charge does not last as long as my old Remington, does not shave as close as the older Braun series.</li>
            <li> For weeks thereafter I struggled every morning trying to hold the batteries intact while shaving, finally coming to the realization that it was time to retire old faithful.</li>
            <li> Even day old stubble growth took multiple passes.  </li>
            <li> so thought I would give this a go again after my old Norelco finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice stragglers that got missed several days in a row anymore, like I did with my old razor.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews on this razor, I bought one to replace an old double head Braun</li>
            <li> Back to the old razor blade.</li>
            <li> It is an exact replacement for my previous Braun shaver, FreeControl model 5729, and the parts are interchangeable.</li>
            <li> Very surprised it&#x27;s lasted this long.</li>
            <li> just hope the foil and cutter will last long as they cost half the price of the shaver and they become discontinued very fast to make you buy a new shaver, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The batteries will accept a charge even after several years of use, although the shaver works directly from house current also.  </li>
            <li> I can only give this razor two stars as it leaves more hair behind than the rotary style.</li>
            <li> I can make the line-up look sharper when I spend few extra minutes on it by using the head foil to clean around the line-up carefully.</li>
            <li> As quick shaves go, the Braun Smart Control 190s-1 fails to deliver.  </li>
            <li> Very noisy and very little actual shaving action going on despite trying every which way.</li>
            <li> Shaving after a days growth is hard work (at least for my wiry pepper beard) and beyond that you need to wet-razor shave first and then clean up with this shaver.</li>
            <li> This could be due to the new hole pattern in the foil guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have people mention to me how smooth a shave I have, it gets all the tough areas on my face and no five o&#x27;clock shadows.</li>
            <li> My experience is that the shaver does fine on day old beard (at least mine), but it does have trouble with a couple of days growth.</li>
            <li> As with the previous model, it&#x27;s made with quality materials and manufactured to a high standard.</li>
            <li> I do not doubt their assessments, my last one did not last long enough to make that judgment.</li>
            <li> a very close shave is possible if you spend a few extra minutes using the pop-up trimmer and foil head carefully.  </li>
            <li> I can drag this thing over my cheeks and chin all day and barely get any results.</li>
            <li> charge is long lasting and charges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on all the other copy cats!</li>
            <li> The recharging time is less than an hour, and that after nearly a week of use.</li>
            <li> It is tough for me to justify spending any additional money for any of the higher priced models out in the market!</li>
            <li> It worked fine but the replacement blade and foil packs eventually became too expensive when I could find them.</li>
            <li> I have an older, top-of-the-line Braun, but this one shaves as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> When my old faithful Braun, battery powered foil head razor fell on the bathroom floor and cracked the battery housing, I knew I was in trouble.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather buy a newer model and hope it lasts as long.</li>
            <li> Takes me twice as long to shave.  </li>
            <li> Much earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> This is probably because it only has the foil cutters and not the additional center strip to handle longer hairs.</li>
            <li> I still take just as long to shave as before, although this shaver is quieter.</li>
            <li> Give a GOOD PRODUCT, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you plug it OR NOT.&lt;br /&gt;These products are crap.</li>
            <li> It has only recently started to break down.</li>
            <li> No oil, no small case - just the razor, power cord, and small brush.  </li>
            <li> bought a second due to</li>
            <li> It has an option for cleaning out the shaver with running water, but that requires leaving shaver parts out loose for long periods of time, where I fear they could get damaged.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was great; however, the actual shaver vibrated terribly and was only an average shave.</li>
            <li> I prefer single blade shaver, and thank goodness Braun still produces single blade shavers.</li>
            <li> The 1 series has a single shaving head, which IMHO is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Others have complained about it not having enough power or retaining enough charge to deliver a proper shave.  </li>
            <li> When the ld one got dropped and a piece broke off leaving the trimmer loose, I saw an opportunity to replace the shaver.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s down from the earlier garbage disposal</li>
            <li> Pulled, rather then cut hair sometimes, couldn&#x27;t get near a close shave, and was unable to get decent lines for sideburns.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I can see by doing this is the razor does get a little warmer after using it for that long of a time.</li>
            <li> i highly reccomend this model over any other shavers with only small round holes that severl other brands use.</li>
            <li> this shaver replaces my older braun model the the screen had small round holes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor on April 16th, order was expected to be delivered between April 26th to the 29th.</li>
            <li> I have since used the razor quite a few times before the next charge was needed.</li>
            <li> This product has a few different features.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy another one of these even if the price sinks to $10.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have a heavy facial hair growth.  </li>
            <li> afterwords (a very manly, ergo, stupid pass time not unlike drinking hot sauce or holding your hand over a candle.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The 190s-1 performs much worse than my old shaver, requiring three or four passes where previously I needed only one.</li>
            <li> Over the past several years I&#x27;ve been using Braun.</li>
            <li> Small and simple to use and maintain.</li>
            <li> In other words, I have to finish shaving with the shaver plugged in.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it won&#x27;t cut you like those sharp trimmers or barber blades.</li>
            <li> The other trimmer limits your view because of the 90 degree angle blade.</li>
            <li> But it is due to its lack of shaving ability that I give this product two stars.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to shave and still have to use a razor to finish up a few areas.</li>
            <li> Also other reviewers answered my inquiry which was this shaver can be washed under water which I then purchased based on their answers.</li>
            <li> You have to use this very slowly with only moderate pressure.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t discover this until I looked at the half empty bottle and then noticed it was on my hands along with everything I touched after unboxing it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone that prefers electric over conventional shaving.</li>
            <li> It is less bulky than the other Braun series.</li>
            <li> However, this is a cord-less shaver and after the shaver is on for 20-25 minutes I noticed that the motor slows down.</li>
            <li> Lightweight as compared to previous ones I have owned.  </li>
            <li> Even after going over and over the same areas many times the results are awful.</li>
            <li> , I shave in half the time</li>
            <li> Braun 190s-1 is an improvement over my previous Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Today, its quality is cheap: (1) the head assembly is unstable and will not stay on the razor, (2)</li>
            <li> No wimpy little &amp;#34;ladies shaver&amp;#34</li>
            <li> but you need to run it over a few times.</li>
            <li> I just used it a few times and seems to work</li>
            <li> Even if the battery is completely dead.</li>
            <li> its random size and shape holes result in getting all hairs with far fewer strokes.</li>
            <li> It bogs down terribly on battery power, and isn&#x27;t much better when used corded.  </li>
            <li> and I dropped it on the floor screen first!  :(  </li>
            <li> (By condensed beard I mean beard with hairs too close one to the other.)</li>
            <li> Well, the blades get dull and not worth just replacing just the blade.  </li>
            <li> You end up with raw skin and a crummy shave.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it is priced at 50 dollars.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase one every year or so, why?  </li>
            <li> After searching in vain all of the usual stores that sell electric razors ($200 + ??</li>
            <li> I usually touch up with a razor in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Braun in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the usual disposable razors and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It is definitely cheaper than the expensive Braun shavers.  </li>
            <li> Works well tho in the past the trimmer gives out for unclear reasons.</li>
            <li> Then, use the head foil to get rid of the small hairs in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> However, this is the first time I got really disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I have owned 3 of these units over the last 15 years and for the cost it is a very tough shaver to beat.</li>
            <li> I would shy away from this for anyone with tough and heavy facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this razor, at least for those without a very heavy beard.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press to hard on it or scrape your face off.</li>
            <li> but, maybe cause i have a lot and hard beard</li>
            <li> even with dull blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a clue how bad my old shaver had gotten at shaving until I received this one.  </li>
            <li> It shaves but the cut is not a close shave--at least not on my face.</li>
            <li> but I can tell you it was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Will not own another.  </li>
            <li> I have quite a hard raspy stubble and despite going over again and again and again it still feels raspy,  and it has taken ages to do a poor job.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes of teaching my growing teens how to shave without cutting themselves with sharp razors.</li>
            <li> The motor is WEAK...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does shave close enough, but am disappointed in the power.</li>
            <li> Tough to beat for the price.</li>
            <li> worse piece of garbage ever made</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased the expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> Expensive for this type of shaver.</li>
            <li> (read 1890&#x27;s era tattoo machine), I tended to shy away from them altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just shaved this morning with it and am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> However, I must admit when I am wrong.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> #34;wild stubble&amp;#34; to find their way into the cutting area.</li>
            <li> you end up mashing the cutting blades into your face.</li>
            <li> Purchased at the airport in a hurry and what a disappointment it is.</li>
            <li> I am so frustrated by the design that I decided to get a separate, dedicated beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed in the shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Try this and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The shape of the shaver makes it very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> If you have any length of beard at all it is worthless.</li>
            <li> The trimmers with the &#x27;claw-like blade&#x27; or 90 degree angles are horrible.</li>
            <li> my husband says this is the worst Braun shaver he has ever owned</li>

            <li> If you are looking for a cost effective on the go shaver with a broad shaving surface this is it. I have owned 3 of these units over the last 15 years and for the cost it is a very tough shaver to beat. I have tried, (you name the manufacturer) and none have worked as well as this shaver! I was very glad to see Braun still making this model available when my last unit gave up. I have people mention to me how smooth a shave I have, it gets all the tough areas on my face and no five o&#x27;clock shadows. This shaver offers one heck of a bang for your buck! It is tough for me to justify spending any additional money for any of the higher priced models out in the market! No Frills just get it done with a very reasonable price point! These days I am all over that!</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver ever! Do not waste your money on all the other copy cats! The things that I love about this one is that you can charge it while using it at the same time, it doesn&#x27;t take too long to charge or clean, when charged it lasts a long time, and it shaves off facial hair with ease! I have tried remington and norelco and they suck!</li>
            <li> This excellent shaver produces a very close shave.  It is an exact replacement for my previous Braun shaver, FreeControl model 5729, and the parts are interchangeable. The product is a great value, and it should last for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clif Jacobs</li>
            <li> Completely died after 3 uses. Not sure why it is priced at 50 dollars. Ergonomically sound, but the build quality is trash.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.  Holds a charge for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Does a great job. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I just tossed a  POCKETGO 370 from braun that had enough after a couple of years for this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is bigger, so Its a different feel, but it worked well.  I bought separately, two replacement foils that should probably last the lifetime of my unit ( I&#x27;m not hairy ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything works good, I like the larger style beard trimmer on this unit and its good for travel as well, even though this is my primary shaver at home too.</li>
            <li> worse piece of garbage ever made</li>
            <li> If you have to trim a mustache, best shaver on the market, bar none, period.  Nothing comes close.  The best for trimming by your lips and above.</li>
            <li> Works good. Gets a clean shave but you need to run it over a few times. It does the job. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. It works better than my rotary. I is my second of this #190. I will likely buy a third in the future as it works so well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Good quality as one expects of German products, at reasonable price</li>
            <li> Lightweight as compared to previous ones I have owned.  I usually purchase one every year or so, why?  Well, the blades get dull and not worth just replacing just the blade.  This model is very basic.  No oil, no small case - just the razor, power cord, and small brush.  I just used it a few times and seems to work okay.  Charges quickly and can use with the cord (unlike my previous Cruzers).  For about 30 bucks...it&#x27;s better than a Remington...so far....but still made in China.</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift, and they loved it!</li>
            <li> Over the past several years I&#x27;ve been using Braun. This shaver is a new step up for me. Comfortable fit for my hand, with a slip resistance texture. Though watch out for the side burn trimmer it can dig into your skin, especially when you&#x27;re not expecting it. All in all I&#x27;d recommend it to my friends and anyone looking for a good shaver.</li>
            <li> Seems as good or better than the Braun 1775 that it is replacing</li>
            <li> The trimmer was great; however, the actual shaver vibrated terribly and was only an average shave. Even though it is inexpensive, my 6-year old shaver was just as good.</li>
            <li> When my old faithful Braun, battery powered foil head razor fell on the bathroom floor and cracked the battery housing, I knew I was in trouble. For weeks thereafter I struggled every morning trying to hold the batteries intact while shaving, finally coming to the realization that it was time to retire old faithful. After searching in vain all of the usual stores that sell electric razors ($200 + ?? mostly rotary types but, really? $200 and up???) I decided to check here on Amazon for another Braun, since I have grown very fond of the quality. Long story short, I found this model and I am completely happy with this baby! Rechargeable, no more double A&#x27;s, charges in a very brief amount of time, lasts about a week or more on a charge, is very ergonomic and rubber coated so it won&#x27;t slip out of my hand onto the floor again. The sideburn trimmer works great, and if it made coffee and scrambled eggs as well I would be in heaven. Then there&#x27;s the price, it is a steal compared to the Ferrari priced competitors. Buy this, you can&#x27;t lose!!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  I bought it on sale at Ross and have used it for years. Very surprised it&#x27;s lasted this long. It has only recently started to break down. I could order replacement parts but I&#x27;d rather buy a newer model and hope it lasts as long.</li>
            <li> The shaver was for my son and he says it works great. He researched it online before we purchased it and it stands up to its ratings. We got a great deal buying online as well</li>
            <li> had for 4 months. will not saave close. got what i paid for.cheap price cheap shaver will spend more to get more</li>
            <li> My dad could not find a replacement for his shaver until I found this product.  He loves the way it shaves</li>
            <li> This is a good value shaver. For a daily shave it is quick and shaves pretty good, though it&#x27;s hard work under the chin - I usually touch up with a razor in the shower. The charge lasts more than a week - good for travel - and you can shave with it plugged in if it is drained. Shaving after a days growth is hard work (at least for my wiry pepper beard) and beyond that you need to wet-razor shave first and then clean up with this shaver. The trimmer is handy for side burns (for ears too). Good value for $40.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, seems to take forever to shave and doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.  The best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned is the Remington MS3-3700, Remington always made the best shavers until they moved to the big black ones, they just suck in my opinion now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much better a razor could be; it is light, compact and easy to handle, it shaves close to the skin and fully recharges in thirty minutes or so. I cannot see a reason to pay more as I don&#x27;t know how much better the expensive ones could be.</li>
            <li> This 190s-1 replaces a WONDERFUL Panasonic ES-SA40 that I&#x27;ve had for 5 - 7 years but whose battery is failing... and I dropped it on the floor screen first!  :(  It&#x27;s &#x27;history&#x27;.  No replacement blades/screen still available.  The model is discontinued.  I liked it because the single screen is a nice big curve and slides over my skin smoothly.  It may not shave as close as some(?), but it is COMFORTABLE, i.e. it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s scraping whiskers off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, Panasonic discontinued a good product and gave us a &#x27;pot full&#x27; of multi screened razors that I don&#x27;t want.  I actually have a Panasonic ES3831 travel razor (AA operated) that I would use all the time IF it had a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Braun in the past.  I&#x27;ve been &#x27;OK&#x27; with the brand...good quality, shaves whiskers... what else would you want?  This Braun is a single screen but NOT quite as &#x27;smooth&#x27; as I&#x27;m use to.  The motor is WEAK... It gets the job done, but on chin &amp; mustache areas it&#x27;s like a low powered lawn mower in tall grass.  You have to work at it and take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does shave close enough, but am disappointed in the power. (Shame on Braun! They DO know better.)</li>
            <li> Small and simple to use and maintain. I have an older, top-of-the-line Braun, but this one shaves as well, if not better. I like being able to stick it under the faucet to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend it!!</li>
            <li> My Remington needed new blades. Its been several years since I had new ones. But as the shaver is no longer being mfg I couldnt get new blades. I thought I would step up and get a Braun, after all its German so it must be good. I was wrong. It doesnt hurt my face but it simply wont get as good a shave as my Remington even with the dull blades. Im going to try to find a new old stock shaver like the one I had so Im returning this one.</li>
            <li> I used a Braun shaver years ago. It worked fine but the replacement blade and foil packs eventually became too expensive when I could find them. I have been using the usual disposable razors and shaving cream. When I saw this Braun on Amazon with all of the plus ratings I had to take a chance on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The multiple head shavers seemed like overkill to me. The old single unit one worked fine. This one does too. No complaints at all. I have only had it for a few days, but it works great even on the neck areas. The only weakness is the sideburns trimmer. It took a while to get it to trim close. Now it works great when I do my part. Not enough to knock a star off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big plus, no wall wart charging unit. Plug it into the socket and the razor and charge it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you want a great shaver that isn&#x27;t in the Bentley class this could be what you want. It works fine for me. I will soon order the replacement blade and foil pack for whenever this one needs replacement. Great shaver. I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I have used a Braun shaver all my life.  I have always purchased the expensive ones.  I wanted a cheap version for my workout bag so I bought this one.  It is definitely cheaper than the expensive Braun shavers.  It much louder and doesn&#x27;t shave as close.  Takes me twice as long to shave.  Product is ok, but I will stick with the better models next time.</li>
            <li> Works well tho in the past the trimmer gives out for unclear reasons. I wonder why? Hope this does not keep happening as without the trimmer its difficult to get a good shave unless one shaves daily.</li>
            <li> Bought this for teenage son hoping he would eventually trim off 5 one inch chin hairs.  One day they were gone, wahoo worked.</li>
            <li> Cheap, battery runs long and I&#x27;ve been using it well since I got it.&lt;br /&gt;The grip is great and the product seems durable.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor on April 16th, order was expected to be delivered between April 26th to the 29th. I received my package on the 23rd. Much earlier than expected. After opening the package and reading the directions for charging, (which was 4 hrs.) I charged it. Then I proceeded to shave after the full charge. It did take me a few passes to get a good shave, but it was well worth it. I have since used the razor quite a few times before the next charge was needed. The second charge took about 30 minutes as the instructions said it would. Cleaning is easy either with the brush, or under hot water. I am completely satisfied with the product and would recommend it to family and friends.                                                                                             ADDITIONAL REVIEW (10-19-2014): After having this razor now for over 5 months, I have had no problems with it what so ever. Still shaves very well, I do not need to shave every day though either. Most of my shaves are done with the trimmer part because I usually let my beard grow for more than a few days. The trimmer has no problems getting my beard close enough for me to use the razor part itself. The only problem I can see by doing this is the razor does get a little warmer after using it for that long of a time. Still works great though !!</li>
            <li> Battery charge does not last as long as my old Remington, does not shave as close as the older Braun series. Construction good, seems solid and well made. Expensive for this type of shaver.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t have any complaints. Tough to beat for the price. Does a good job. For a great shave, I still use a straight razor, but for a quick shave that&#x27;s decent, it works well, plus it saves me $$ on having to buy straight replacement blades all the time.</li>
            <li> I have 3 other Brauns with the separate power buttons for on and off and this has only a single switch, more practical.&lt;br /&gt;Also it is lighter and smaller.  I prefer the 190.</li>
            <li> Great, my last one lasted for over 8 years!</li>
            <li> Some reviews of this shaver pointed out that it just doesn&#x27;t cut all the whiskers. My experience is that the shaver does fine on day old beard (at least mine), but it does have trouble with a couple of days growth. This is probably because it only has the foil cutters and not the additional center strip to handle longer hairs. Probably a better choice, if you don&#x27;t shave every day, is the Braun Series 3-340 which is close to the same price and seems to handle older growth much better.</li>
            <li> I have always shaved with cheap shick or gilette disposable razors. I decided to try this electric razor instead. I can drag this thing over my cheeks and chin all day and barely get any results. If you have any length of beard at all it is worthless. And the trimmer cut my lip.</li>
            <li> Great for my teenager with fine, thin, newly growing facial hair. My oldest son said it didn&#x27;t work on his coarse beard very well, but it was a quick &#x27;trial&#x27; before teaching his younger brother how to use a razor. We like the size and it seems to be working well for now :-)</li>
            <li> The shaver itself works well. However, this is a cord-less shaver and after the shaver is on for 20-25 minutes I noticed that the motor slows down. I plug the shaver back in and the shaver goes up to &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; speed. In other words, I have to finish shaving with the shaver plugged in.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. You can get a close shave with it (no shadow)...a very close shave is possible if you spend a few extra minutes using the pop-up trimmer and foil head carefully.  A lot of people buy these shavers without knowing how to use them properly in order to get the right result. Use the trimmer first in order to get most of the beard out. Then, use the head foil to get rid of the small hairs in a circular motion. Don&#x27;t press to hard on it or scrape your face off. Your face is covered with skin--not concrete. Apply just enough pressure to get the job done. People also expect to get all the hair off with one swipe. It&#x27;s not going to happen. Every shaver requires you to go over the same area with more than one swipe. You must also consider your beard type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POP-UP TRIMMER:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pop-up trimmer. The trimmer pops up straight and the blade is straight. This is great if you&#x27;re trying to clean-up your line-up/sideburns. It&#x27;s better than the pop-up trimmers that are not straight. The trimmers with the &#x27;claw-like blade&#x27; or 90 degree angles are horrible. I don&#x27;t know why some people complain about the straight pop-up trimmers and blade. I cut my own hair. I find the straight blade trimmers easier and more flexible to use. The blade is gentle. Therefore, it won&#x27;t cut you like those sharp trimmers or barber blades. However, it still gives me a decent line up. I can make the line-up look sharper when I spend few extra minutes on it by using the head foil to clean around the line-up carefully. You can adjust your hand in order to actually see the trimmer blade on the hair before you cut it. The other trimmer limits your view because of the 90 degree angle blade. The shaver will get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery will give you a 30 to 45 minute shave. It goes on strong until the 25 minute mark. However, the great thing about this trimmer is the plug-in option. You can plug it into the wall outlet and shave with it as it charges the battery! Even if the battery is completely dead. Plug it in the outlet and it will work better than a full charged battery. Once the green light turns off, unplug it in order to avoid overcharging the battery. Do not overcharge the battery! It will diminish the battery life. Therefore, if you&#x27;re shaving with it plugged into the outlet, make sure the battery is not already charged.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is also very easy to clean. The price is not bad. I was able to get another one for $28 from another seller.</li>
            <li> I am already using the same product over ten years. I am 100 percent happy and satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes of teaching my growing teens how to shave without cutting themselves with sharp razors. Mission accomplished. Easy to use, rechargeable, and works for my teens faces. I can&#x27;t see it as professional tool for grown men, but for teens it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Why a retiree?  Because presumably you don&#x27;t have a job to get to or any other pressing, time sensitive engagement that requires a quick shave.  As quick shaves go, the Braun Smart Control 190s-1 fails to deliver.  It gets the job done, eventually, after a dozen or so passes across the same spot.  Even day old stubble growth took multiple passes.  2-3 days of weekend growth...?  Plan on camping out in front of the bathroom mirror for a while.  I had a similar Braun model in college and it worked really well so thought I would give this a go again after my old Norelco finally gave out.  I guess the soft, tender stubble of my 20&#x27;s is no match for the burly five o&#x27;clock shadow of my 40&#x27;s.  Either that or they just don&#x27;t make Braun&#x27;s like they used to.  So consider this shaver the perfect gift for either a college grad or a retiree, but no one in between.</li>
            <li> My son likes it a lot</li>
            <li> Some things Braun got right.  The ergonomics are great.  The on/off is in a perfect place.  It is very easy to switch from shaver to trimmer and back.  If only they had given the thing a strong enough motor to shave.  It bogs down terribly on battery power, and isn&#x27;t much better when used corded.  It also misses softer longer hairs completely, necessitating using the trimmer too often.  I consider this unacceptable for a shaver, and at age 63, I&#x27;ve some experience on the matter.  I will be sending the shaver back for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a comparison, read my review on the Wahl 7367-200.  The ergonomics of the Wahl suck, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Not as good as some of the other Braun shavers but it was a good first razor for my son.</li>
            <li> Good, close shave.  Great price!  Cordless. Able to rinse the head under running water.  Can shave while charging.  All good.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Braun 1000 series that served me amazingly well for probably 9 years.  I&#x27;m guessing this Braun Smart Control 190s-1 is old stock, the outside of the box was dated 2011, which could make it as much as four years old. Mostly concerned about the shelf life of the battery. The Braun Smart Control 190s-1 arrived new and sealed, but the cap on the oil bottle wasn&#x27;t securely on and more than half of the oil had leaked out into the accessories box and onto the literature. Didn&#x27;t discover this until I looked at the half empty bottle and then noticed it was on my hands along with everything I touched after unboxing it.  If the 190s-1 works even half as long as my previous Braun, I will still consider it a good value.</li>
            <li> Not rife with bells and whistles but, in it&#x27;s purest for, it really doesn&#x27;t need them. It inexpensively does a great job, in some ways possibly better than the previous Braun model t replaces.</li>
            <li> I switched to Braun because Remington replaced its excellent cutter replacements for its SP-62 shavers with cutters that take a long time to cut. However, this shaver does not do that much better. I still take just as long to shave as before, although this shaver is quieter. It has an option for cleaning out the shaver with running water, but that requires leaving shaver parts out loose for long periods of time, where I fear they could get damaged. Charges lasting a week is an improvement on earlier shavers. But it is due to its lack of shaving ability that I give this product two stars.</li>
            <li> Gives a good, close shave; However the foil can pop out if you press the razor too hard against your face.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and it wasent very good. It did not get close at all. It leaves his face still scruffy looking.</li>
            <li> I realized that my rotary style shaver was finally ready for retirement when it received it&#x27;s first social security check in the mail. My... things have changed in the last 15 years. With so many options I wasn&#x27;t sure which way to turn.  I had tried the foil style razor before but it didn&#x27;t do as well as the rotary style and since the foils were noisier anyway (read 1890&#x27;s era tattoo machine), I tended to shy away from them altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I  was drawn in again by the &amp;#34;Smart Screen Technology&amp;#34; i.e. the geometrically diverse openings in the foil that allow hairs that point in different directions or &amp;#34;wild stubble&amp;#34; to find their way into the cutting area. This is the problem I deal with. I have had the 3 head rotary style shaver which got most but not all of the errant hairs leaving me to dry shave with a safety razor afterwords (a very manly, ergo, stupid pass time not unlike drinking hot sauce or holding your hand over a candle.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it is shower/faucet friendly. It made cleaning much easier. It is lightweight and easy to handle. It seems to recharge fairly quickly and held the one charge that I gave it before I returned it for a good amount of time. It is still noisier than the rotary shavers but it&#x27;s down from the earlier garbage disposal levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, it&#x27;s not a bad razor per se, however, it doesn&#x27;t fulfill the specialty category that it purports to. If you do not have the wild stubble that I do, I would actually recommend this razor as it is a cost effective choice among cordless razors, but then again, you probably wouldn&#x27;t be looking at this &amp;#34;specialty&amp;#34; razor in the first place, were that the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To that end I can only give this razor two stars as it leaves more hair behind than the rotary style.</li>
            <li> I like Braum shaver and the price of fantistic. I use this shaver every day and it works very fine for me.</li>
            <li> my husband says this is the worst Braun shaver he has ever owned it is being sent back asap  beware</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works well. Received it on time and was packaged well. My husband uses it daily and said it was a great little shaver.</li>
            <li> Quality is good.  Does the job</li>
            <li> Great no nonsense electric. I prefer a safety razor on a day to day basis but when running late this thing has saved me more than a few minutes. Easy to clean and service.</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed in the shaving experience. Takes a long time to shave and still have to use a razor to finish up a few areas.</li>
            <li> Braun Smart Control 190s-1 Cordless Shaver 1 Count&lt;br /&gt;Iv&#x27;e had this shaver before and I really like it.  This shaver gives you a good close shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months now and really like it.  It handles my heavy beard easily and gets most everything on the first pass.  I don&#x27;t notice stragglers that got missed several days in a row anymore, like I did with my old razor.  Also, it appears to have a great battery because i can go weeks between charges.</li>
            <li> Takes a good bit longer to shave a 2-3 day beard than my older basic model braun.  Battery lasts well.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one we&#x27;ve purchased. It&#x27;s a great shaver for the price and this one replaces one that was dropped on a recent trip which ripped the screen. We could have replaced just that, but for a little more we purchased another razor. They last and give a great shave!</li>
            <li> It works perfectly just like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I gave this Shaver to my Grandchild.&lt;br /&gt;Let him use it, he might like it. But it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> Not the closest of shaves. Got this because so many others have changed the &amp;#34;angle&amp;#34; of the trimmer. This trimmer slides straight up, which is what he wanted. However, he always needs to touch up with a regular razor and that&#x27;s a hassle.</li>
            <li> Please people from Braun, I beg you, I want the old cord-electric-plug-in-the-wall electric shave back...!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need &amp;#34;cordless&amp;#34; electric shaver ..!!! I don&#x27;t shave in the park, nor in the Sahara desert. I shave in my bath room,&lt;br /&gt;at home. Give a GOOD PRODUCT, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you plug it OR NOT.&lt;br /&gt;These products are crap. No precision, no power, no nothing...!</li>
            <li> Súper buy !! Very Good!!</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews on this razor, I bought one to replace an old double head Braun I&#x27;d owned for years.  This one only has one shaving head and  leaves many long hairs.  It also takes many &#x27;passes&#x27; to get a clean shave.  I tried to return it but couldn&#x27;t because I&#x27;d owned it over a month.  I then purchased the double head Braun 7-720 which is a far superior razor.</li>
            <li> Bought this off the shelf in a shop because it looked as good as the others,  the write up and comparison looked favourable,  and it was reasonably priced.  I have had it for a few months now and find I am  wet shaving more and more because the Braun just does not do the job.  Just shaved this morning with it and am not impressed.  I have quite a hard raspy stubble and despite going over again and again and again it still feels raspy,  and it has taken ages to do a poor job.  Not recommended and I shall be looking for a replacement.  Buying the more affordable model is another mistake that costs more in the long run.</li>
            <li> Shaver works great.  I have used the older model 1775, Free Control 1000 series for years and have been very pleased with its performance.  So, I decided to purchase this newer replacement model, the 190s-1, and am also very pleased with it.  It is just like the older model.  It shaves well, is easy to hold and use, and is very good quality.  I bought two additional ones so I have one in my RV/Travel Trailer and one at the beach condo.  I recommend this razor, at least for those without a very heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I have been using the series one (1) Braun Shaver for over twenty years. I have been using the replacement parts every 18 months. I have replaced the shaver itself only one time. So yes, there is something to be said for German Engineering.&lt;br /&gt;  If you are in need of an electric razor, this is the one you need to have.  kh.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a clue how bad my old shaver had gotten at shaving until I received this one.  What a major difference.  this is one really good shaver at a great price.  Buy it.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> i wish i would have purchased on Amazon ha i got mine at Wally World for 10.oo more.&lt;br /&gt;That said i love this shaver! Its single head shaver and head design really give me a close shave.  Its lightweight - I use with shaving cream as its water proof if need super close shave as well.  I am happy with it overall</li>
            <li> Great razor. It&#x27;s not as close of cut as a stick razor is and It&#x27;s quick</li>
            <li> For the price...ok, but for a close shave, it has a way to go.  At my age it is fine.</li>
            <li> It is OK, but not as good as my 4 year old Norelco. The Norelco shaves closer and is a LOT quieter</li>
            <li> This product has a few different features. Nevertheless, I did not give the close shave that I was expecting it would give.</li>
            <li> Excellent choice.  Shaves well; lasts for years, charges quickly and holds charge for 8 days.</li>
            <li> nice and compact. i found it to be very light weight and easy to hold. it charges very fast and is great  to take on trips and use at home too. easy to clean and very ergonomic. shaves very well and close without burning.</li>
            <li> This is the third one I have purchased, all work well.They charge in 30 minutes and the charge last several days up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This was a gift &amp; I guess it was a success because I got a big thank you for sending it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Recharges in one hour.  Needed new foil and cutter on old 5 year old razor so for a few dollars more I could get a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> Good razor for the money</li>
            <li> Good shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> This is nearly identical to the older 1775 model, but the new head assembly is a disaster. Any kind of pressure and quick movement causes the head assembly to pop off and you end up mashing the cutting blades into your face. And yes, they do cut. You have to use this very slowly with only moderate pressure. Can&#x27;t believe this passed safety testing.</li>
            <li> For an electric, reasonably quiet. Shaves well, cleans easily.&lt;br /&gt;Love the LED indicator when charging.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money works better than much more expensive models . Very close shave and long battery life would highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My husband seems to like it.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues with it and we&#x27;ve had it almost 2 months.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for my guy&#x27;s older Braun. He had enjoyed that one for many years and was afraid he wouldn&#x27;t get another he liked as well. When the ld one got dropped and a piece broke off leaving the trimmer loose, I saw an opportunity to replace the shaver. Looked to Amazon and found this at a very reasonable price (as these things go) and ordered right away. Shipped quickly and arrived with good packaging and just as if I had gone to department store and bought it (except I didn&#x27;t have to leave the house).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he first got it, charged it overnight, then used it, he said he&#x27;d forgotten how close and good a shave he used to get!  This thing is great and he&#x27;s totally happy with it. I also told him we can get replacement heads when needed (he forgot about that) and this will last forever being a great shaver and trimmer (beard/sideburns).</li>
            <li> I have used Remington shavers for years, but a few years ago, they started making them cheaply and of low quality.  So, I decided to try the Braun.  I&#x27;m very glad I did.  It is not the top of the line model, but I&#x27;m happy with it.  It shaves fairly close, seems well constructed, and operates as advertised.  I&#x27;m satisfied and would buy again.</li>
            <li> The boy loves it! He says it&#x27;s the closest shave he&#x27;s ever had! It&#x27;s his favorite and we would definitely buy another one to replace it when he finally breaks it. The chipping was quite quick which was great! I did a lot of research prior to making the purchase. So if you shave pretty often this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t give me a close enough shave. The chargers connector is bulky.  Other than that it has a very nice comfortable  handle</li>
            <li> i have used Braun oscillating shavers for years, and I have always been happy them.  They charge nicely, the battery works for almost a week on one charge, and the shaver lasts for a long time.  The batteries will accept a charge even after several years of use, although the shaver works directly from house current also.  The screen would need to be replaced every two years or so.</li>
            <li> Not as nice as previous 190 but runs longer. Trimmer works ok but quickly get quite warm. Maybe more shaver than expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, but, maybe cause i have a lot and hard beard, i have too pass this shaver on the same point too many times to get best results, and this make my shave experience too slow, otherwise good quality built and design.</li>
            <li> excellent shaver.recharge is better than advertised</li>
            <li> NO COMPLAINTS. I&#x27;M USING THE RAZOR.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU,&lt;br /&gt;ROGER</li>
            <li> this shaver replaces my older braun model the the screen had small round holes. this shaver the screen has a patern om different shape hole in arandom pattern. this results in catching hairs that grow in defferent angles that a screen with only small round holes miss and need to go over the same area several times to get most of the hairs.this  model with its random size and shape holes result in getting all hairs with far fewer strokes. i highly reccomend this model over any other shavers with only small round holes that severl other brands use.</li>
            <li> Just like my old one that lasted 8 years. Its all good</li>
            <li> I like it.  It has a new designed shaving head which seems to shave better than the old design. I&#x27;v been using Braun for years and I like the idea that it is washable. Price not bad compared to some others.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor for the money.  It charges quickly and will run for about 45 minutes after fully charged.  I use it also to trim my neck.  I would recommend this razor to anyone that prefers electric over conventional shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a good cordless razor that holds a charge for a long time and delivers a comfortable shave.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The shape of the shaver makes it very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Great shave simple and easy. No problems. 2nd braun I&#x27;ve owned. last one lasted over 10 years. The best brand out there.</li>
            <li> Purchased at the airport in a hurry and what a disappointment it is. Very noisy and very little actual shaving action going on despite trying every which way. Even after going over and over the same areas many times the results are awful.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver made!</li>
            <li> This thing is priced on Amazon right now for under $40.  I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for about 50 years and NONE has done a better job than this one.  It is light weight, simple to use and charge.  Great price, great shaver.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> I have been an user of the Braun Smart Shaver series 1 for over 20 years now. This is the fifth consecutive unit I buy. However, this is the first time I got really disappointed with the product. The blade is coming off from its holder during the shaving process what is unacceptable. I am struggling to have this issue solved via Amazon and Braun.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver head with its blade costs 1/4 of the entire shaver unit, so I refuse to buy a replacement blade.&lt;br /&gt;Braun lost a loyal customer here.&lt;br /&gt;Bye</li>
            <li> Great shaver for the price!</li>
            <li> good shape &amp; low price .</li>
            <li> Great economical shaver! Compact and reliable.</li>
            <li> Great economical shaver, especially for travel. The original cutter and foil usually needs to be replaced after 12-18 months depending on the frequency of use. The trimmer is very useful for sideburns, mustaches and beards. The battery holds enough charge for about 14 days of use.</li>
            <li> Got it because the hubby wanted to try it.  He loved it.  Try this and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Protective foil broke and had to return it.  Good battery life.</li>
            <li> For the price a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> Wanted to give electric shaving another try, I thought maybe a more name brand shaver like Braun might give me a better chance of switching to electric.  Maybe I just don&#x27;t like electric shaves, but this didn&#x27;t seem to work very well at all.  Pulled, rather then cut hair sometimes, couldn&#x27;t get near a close shave, and was unable to get decent lines for sideburns.  Back to the old razor blade.</li>
            <li> I liked it enough to purchase it again after I had to retire my first one which lasted about 5 years.  It&#x27;s basic, easy to use and maintain, and gets the job done.  It won&#x27;t be the closest shave you can possibly get but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> too light for an adult beard.</li>
            <li> Shaving is OK, although I was surprised that the curved body shape can be somewhat awkward to hold. The beard trimmer is a push up, like most, but the cutter is at the very end, rather at a 90° angle, which makes it difficult to use. I am so frustrated by the design that I decided to get a separate, dedicated beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Had it a month and so far so good.  Use it primarily for the chin and upper lip area seems to need a couple passes but does a fine job and  right price</li>
            <li> My model #1775, the older version of this one, gave up after 20 years. The battery capacity was nil and the blade and foil needed replacement , so for about the same cost as these repairs I purchased the 190s-1. So far it&#x27;s performing like the older version. It&#x27;s a little louder than the original but if it lasts anywhere as long  I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> The price of some electric razors, from many manufacturers including Braun, are way overpriced in my opinion.  If you feel you get a better shave, or are in some other way enhanced by using an expensive razor, you are most welcomed to do so.  If, on the other hand, you&#x27;ld rather get a good shave and save some money, the Braun Smart Control 190s-1 is for you.  It charges quickly and shaves well.  I recommend it.  The good shave coupled with Amazon&#x27;s excellent price make it an outstanding buy.</li>
            <li> Great electric shaver!</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement for older Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Although our old Braun cordless razer was still working after 6 years, we still use it when guests need one.. The new one has even better features than the old one. Works excellent.  You can&#x27;t beat German products. 100% satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Good package,quick shipping,brand new.&lt;br /&gt;You can shave easily and safety.And it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;After a completely charge,it can work for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace a decade-old Braun series 1/190. I was very satisfied with the old shaver. This one appears to be essentially the same shaver. The batteries recharge in just a few minutes, and are good for 5-7 days of shaving.  Replacement screens and cutters are available at  a very low price, too.</li>
            <li> The shave is not close and comfortable. It doesn&#x27;t shave as I thought it would be.Not worth that kind of money.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my friend.</li>
            <li> lightweight, fast charging time for a cheap price and convenient to carry when traveling. overseas with&lt;br /&gt;its 110/220v power plug.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> this my second one and I like better than my series 3 . so I got 2 series 1 shaver and  I like it.</li>
            <li> Powerful and the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have owned!</li>
            <li> so much better shaver than the 150, I shave in half the time</li>
            <li> This razor holds its own but in my opinion it does not surpass the Braun 3612. It shaves but the cut is not a close shave--at least not on my face. This razor is better as a secondary travel razor more than it is as a primary one. That&#x27;s my opinion, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.</li>
            <li> For the money, this is a good shaver.  Third one I&#x27;ve owned in 15 years. Figure it will last you about 5-7 years with daily use and one change of blades.</li>
            <li> Shaved clean and easy for me.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-It provides a very close shave for an electric razor (see caveat below).&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;-The charge is long lasting and charges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-My shaver leaks shavings when I use it...looks like I&#x27;ve sprinkled cinnamon on the counter when I&#x27;m done shaving.  Disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;-To achieve the close shave, it requires several passes over each area of the face. My previous shaver (Remington) didn&#x27;t require so many passes...even with dull blades.&lt;br /&gt;-Like many electric shavers, it often misses spots on the neck even after multiple passes....if you&#x27;re looking for a &#x27;perfect&#x27; shave, you&#x27;ll need to plan on using a manual razor to get the neck done right.  If you&#x27;re not a perfectionist, it will suffice.</li>
            <li> This is my third one.&lt;br /&gt;The first one I have had for over 7 years and is still running good.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second due to it being so close to the price of just the head &amp; screen.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this last one to be sure I had plenty before they change the style.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older model my husband owned. I was pleased to find it was still good quality, just like the older model.</li>
            <li> great it  gives me the shave I like reminds me of an older model that I have this my third braun shaver</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this to replace the older model that lasted about 8 years. This razor is EXCELLENT. I cannot beleive how close the shave is. For the money it cannot be beat. I love the rinseable feature, and how easy it is to use. If you are considering a purchanse, do not hesitate it works really well.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my cordless shaver. It works almost as good as my original Braun  that I have for many years. Great price too!!</li>
            <li> It gives me a sharp clean shave. It is easy to handle, holds it&#x27;s charge well. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver and does a more than adequate job.  I still have to use a blade under my neck.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun very similar to this.  I was very satisfied with my old which lasted 6+ years.  This one is great too!</li>
            <li> Great razor for beginners. Got it freshman year of high school and it died my senior year of college.</li>
            <li> After having another Braun elect shaver I bought this one but I can tell you it was a big disappointment. My old one with a nearly drained batter cuts better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-single cuter head which limits surface contact on your face.&lt;br /&gt;-Multiple passes must be made and even then some facial hair remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an easy customer to please but trust me, pay more and get a better model, the time you will waste every morning with this thing will add up. I am thinking of selling mine on Ebay.</li>
            <li> Came in good time @ a good price! Came in a sealed box w/ protective cap, oil &amp; a brush.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  I shave lightly 2-3 times each week.  At $40, it should come with a carrying case.  There is a removeable plastic cover to protect the shave head.  There is also a brush and a tiny bottle of lubricant for the shave head.  I like the sleek design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few of these--only because they&#x27;re cheap--but the quality of the most recent ones has been extremely poor, and even the earlier ones weren&#x27;t particularly good. In my two most recent ones, the motors simply died after a few months. (In the most recent one, the motor completely stopped working, and would not even take a charge, after just 5 months.) Further, although they work pretty well during the first few uses, very soon you find yourself having to go over the same patch of your face over and over from every angle just to get the appearance of a shave. You end up with raw skin and a crummy shave. I won&#x27;t buy another one of these even if the price sinks to $10.</li>
            <li> this is the 2nd Braun shaver I owned and it is a very  good shaver for the price</li>
            <li> This was to replace a Braun Smart Control I had for about 7 years.  The newer version has a better trimmer than the old,  other than that, it&#x27;s about the same.  I prefer single blade shaver, and thank goodness Braun still produces single blade shavers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK i thought because it&#x27;s a braun it would really cut great.&lt;br /&gt;But my old norelgo cuts closer.</li>
            <li> This shaver replaces an older Braun model whose battery would no longer recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 190s-1 is an improvement over my previous Braun shaver. The recharging time is less than an hour, and that after nearly a week of use. The shave is better than acceptable. As with the previous model, it&#x27;s made with quality materials and manufactured to a high standard. I also appreciate that the charging light goes out when the shaver is fully recharged (a real convenience), is quiet in operation, and being washable, is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I must saw that I have been very pleasantly surprised by this budget shaver. I have been a manual shaver for years because my wife likes a close shave on me. However, I must admit when I am wrong. This shaver actually shaves closer than my manual blades have been able to. My wife loves it and that is what matters! :) Solidly built, I have had several shaves on one charge. Love this shaver. Can&#x27;t beat the price and the shave is fantastic. It&#x27;s important to note that longer hairs will not be caught by the foil, so use the cutter to get them to a manageable size and then the foil will take care of them with no problem.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. It works well without pulling and gets the job done. No wimpy little &amp;#34;ladies shaver&amp;#34; this is men&#x27;s strength, but still works on tender skin.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the old single bladed Braun that I always thought was the best they ever made. It is a great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> Good service. Best price. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Good product fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Used to love this razor. Today, its quality is cheap: (1) the head assembly is unstable and will not stay on the razor, (2) the micro screen tears too easily, thus slicing the face (this has happened with more than one of these razors).  Will not own another.  Others have complained about it not having enough power or retaining enough charge to deliver a proper shave.  I do not doubt their assessments, my last one did not last long enough to make that judgment.</li>
            <li> The Braun Smart Control 190s is a small, lightweight shaver with a really robust trimmer.  Great for travel, great for touchups after work, and just enough oomph to take care of the mornings (though you might have to pass over trouble spots more than once).  By itself, it&#x27;s a solid 3 star product.  Definitely needs more power for that Tuesday morning after a long weekend, though, even if you use that robust trimmer first.</li>
            <li> This is perfect! Being a female and usually smaller hands than men, it fits comfortable in my hand. I get a nice close shave. I shaved my head in March and this gives me the closest shave I can get at home. Easy to clean too. Some reviews have said it&#x27;ll last for 45 minutes after being charged and used. I find it lasts longer than that.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver to clean up my lower neck and I was pleased with it for the purpose. The foil is great as it allows really fine cuts and, as a result, my neck is cleaned-up and my skin is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it with or without the electrical cord (110/220 V). It charges fast and once charged, it lasts relatively long. It is less bulky than the other Braun series. It&#x27;s sturdy and very well built. The 1 series has a single shaving head, which IMHO is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope the foil and cutter will last long as they cost half the price of the shaver and they become discontinued very fast to make you buy a new shaver, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for people with not too much or condensed hair. For others (with condensed beards), I can&#x27;t tell although I don&#x27;t believe that electrical shavers are made for condensed beards... but YMMV. (By condensed beard I mean beard with hairs too close one to the other.)</li>
            <li> It works ok for my face but I don&#x27;t have a heavy facial hair growth.  I would shy away from this for anyone with tough and heavy facial hair.  For my light growth the battery easily last over a week.</li>
            <li> I liked it. Nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Relatively small unit, very portable.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver to replace an older Braun 3612 (a similar basic foil shaver model that has been discontinued). The 190s-1 performs much worse than my old shaver, requiring three or four passes where previously I needed only one. This could be due to the new hole pattern in the foil guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to using the old shaver, which works better despite a worn-out cutter.</li>
            <li> Still the best. Good for travel, fast charging, comfortable grip, excellent cutter head shape and useful trim blade. Simply does what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Fast smooth shave. About 1 week of daily shaves per battery charge.&lt;br /&gt;30 minutes battery recharge. Low price.</li>
            <li> GREATEST SHAVER EVER MADE VERY CLOSE SHAVE SMOOTH NO RAZOR BURN CLOSE LIKE A BLADE</li>
            <li> Good Braun shaver. Purchase this to replace the 1775 older model which was used for travel and finally gave up on me after 5 yrs. I have always used Braun shavers and have the 300 series.  Also other reviewers answered my inquiry which was this shaver can be washed under water which I then purchased based on their answers. Brauns are far superior than Remmington brands which I had used 10 yrs prior they and have poor screens which bends and breaks too easily.  Recommed for purchase and use.</li>
            <li> Battery shaver is good for my daughter that has visual problems. She says that it does not pull her fine hair that grows under and around her upper lip and chin. She cannot do under her arms. She has help to do that with another device. Good product, very easy to use .Excellent for someone with disabilities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned an older model Braun for years. Ordered this one for my backup. Really love the shave it gives me.Really tempted to order another one just in case I lose this one.</li>
