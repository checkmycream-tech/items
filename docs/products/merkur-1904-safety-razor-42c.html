            <li>had excellent shaves with a 4-bladed something or nother, but the price-per-shave was astronomical.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>

            <li>Beautiful perfect construction, perfect blade alignment, very smooth shaving.</li>
            <li>but it gave me a great shave with no nicks on my medium beard.  </li>

            <li>I am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>it gives a great shave.  </li>
            <li>For shaving technique here is a great link for a tutorial:</li>
            <li>Great razor.</li>
            <li>Feels great in the hand.</li>
            <li>For the price this is a great razor.</li>
            <li>Very nice piece.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice razor.</li>
            <li>but it is very effective.  </li>
            <li>Works great and looks good.</li>
            <li>He is so glad to know he can save money and have the best shave .</li>
            <li>All i can say is &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; havent got this good of a shave since being shaved at a barber shop.</li>
            <li>So he tried it and he liked that you can get a great shave for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>The angle is good and again, it&#x27;s not too aggressive.</li>
            <li>For a smooth, close shave, Merkur is best!</li>
            <li>the cornered handle is good for added grip</li>
            <li>good is the shave?</li>
            <li>To test the Merkur, I got my good soap (Col. Conk), a badger brush,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Razor is gorgeous and so well balanced.</li>
            <li>I continue to search for good razor blades, cream and brush, as I adjust to making the switch from 3 or 4 bladed cartridges.</li>
            <li>The weight is great and the length (shorter than my first \\&quot;trial\\&quot; razor) is perfect.</li>
            <li>Combine the razor with Merkur Super Platinum blades and you arguably have the best shaving system on the planet, without all the high-priced, multi-blade,  cartridge nonsense.</li>
            <li>The chrome finish on the Merkur is not quite as fine as the finish on the EJ, although it is of very good quality.  </li>
            <li>Smooth brilliant razor.</li>
            <li>Lovely design, great weight and balance.</li>
            <li>Great Size, Smooth Shave!</li>
            <li>But whatever, that&#x27;s no biggie, the fact that it&#x27;s made of metal gives it a good weight and the design is nice looking.</li>
            <li>This is the first Merkur that I have owned and I am very impressed with the quality.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty awesome; once you learn to use it.&lt;br /&gt;PS not all blades work on all faces.</li>
            <li>best shave the first time or two around, but you get the hang of it</li>
            <li>best shave the first time or two around, but you get the hang of it</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend&#x27;s favorite razor!</li>
            <li>But it shaves amazing.</li>
            <li>the Merkur brand blades was of course just as amazing as the razor itself.</li>
            <li>Amazing razor.  </li>
            <li>Nice weight and balance</li>
            <li>weight is perfect for me, and I really like the design.</li>
            <li>not that I can go by much honestly).</li>
            <li>Pick up a badger hair brush, some nice blades and a shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Pairs up nicely with Feather blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice way to try BOTH if you want.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>In my reading I&#x27;ve heard many say Merkur made good beginner razor, so I knew I had to try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks now, shaving almost every day with it, and I&#x27;ve still got a lot to learn about my own face.</li>
            <li>I get with it, the easier it will become to use it just as effectively as the multi-blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best perk of all is that you save so much money.</li>
            <li>It has nice weight and balance to it.  </li>
            <li>The weight is nice.</li>
            <li>Pair this with the 100 blade sampler and a nice shave soap and you are in business.</li>
            <li>Best New DE Razor out there for the money.</li>
            <li>Good, solid razor best shave ive had.</li>
            <li>The stainless is flawless after many uses.</li>
            <li>This Merkur is a GREAT razor for someone who wants to break from the&lt;br /&gt;plastic-shaver scene but it skittish about the shavette/straight razor approach.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My search for a perfect razor began and ended with this Merkur; I&#x27;m very pleased with it and intend to keep it for a long time.</li>
            <li>I think the Nickel finish is more elegant than the chrome -- and the handle design, in addition to giving this razor a nice look, is quite functional.</li>
            <li>OK, I was all excited to ditch the overpriced multi-blade razor cartridges and get into some good, old-school shaving.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for my older busted-up hands to comfortably grip and maneuver.</li>
            <li>Even if you have no experience with safety razor shaving, Go for this, Also good beginner blades are Shark Super Chromes.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>This razor is fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>All you need is a soap and brush and mug and favorite blade.</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing, NO irritation, Baby butt smooth shave, And no cuts.</li>
            <li>But Personna Lab Blues is a smoother shave for about 3 more dollars for 100 pack over the sharks.</li>
            <li>Although the best blade for your skin might be different than mine</li>
            <li>It was as if it was connected to the top by</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding razor.</li>
            <li>The is the best double edge razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Clearly MUCH better than &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>ENJOY! :-)</li>
            <li>Perfect actually.</li>
            <li>I love the stubby handle, perfect weight in (my) hand, and overall style.</li>
            <li>Almost the head is more curved than with my EJ</li>
            <li>which for me gives me a better shave.</li>
            <li>The finish was perfect looks like something that was made to last 100 years ago not like the throwaways of today.</li>
            <li>Both lined up perfectly without any extra effort on my part.</li>
            <li>I have read many of reviews praising the Merkur brand</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>Most Merkur razors are aggressive even their Futur and Progress adjustables.</li>
            <li>this is a fantastic razor!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I could find &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m guessing it would be a marginal improvement at best&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Incredible design has also allowed me to adapt to this style of shaving much more seamlessly.</li>
            <li>handle is the perfect shape, with the lengthwise flats, the perfect weight, and the key overall IMHO - the handle length.</li>
            <li>bought this razor because I thought it seemed elegant looking and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that the longer that I use it and the better</li>
            <li>Also just remember, Now when you go to the store to buy more razors, you&#x27;re looking at about 3 dollars tops for 10 razors, compared to $20 for 4 proglides.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s still cheaper when you consider how many blades you&#x27;re getting in a cartridge of proglides.</li>
            <li>The blades you will be buying from now on are at most 30 cents a blade.</li>
            <li>This razor is a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>but I find that it allows you more manueverability.</li>
            <li>Never thought to buy one of these before instead of razors all the time, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it, high quality and great shave.</li>
            <li>I can find no fault with the shave from this razor and would highly recommend it for newbie and experienced shaver alike.</li>
            <li>Seems good quality at first.</li>
            <li>I have finally found the perfect size and weight safety razor for my face, and more importantly,</li>
            <li>The weight of this razor is good, the grip is very usable, and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very nice, high quality safety razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, it&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve gotten for a very long time.</li>
            <li>REALLY quickly--much more so than a Shavette.&lt;br /&gt;Get a good soap and brush, and go to town.</li>
            <li>REALLY quickly--much more so than a Shavette.&lt;br /&gt;Get a good soap and brush, and go to town.</li>
            <li>It is definitely shorter than disposables which takes some getting used to, but looks great and is nice and balanced.</li>
            <li>He is very satisfied with it and likes it better than the more modern electric or multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li>A straight razor would be the perfect shaving tool for me, if I were brave enough to learn to use one and were willing to put up with the sharpening routine --</li>
            <li>Shorter handle to better fit her hands</li>
            <li>Great old school look.  </li>
            <li>Saves lots of money and gets his face silky smooth :)</li>
            <li>always end up irritated, have to put some kind of lotion or vaseline and face is still irritated and can hardly smile and touch my face with out irritation.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and navigate with and have had great shaves with it, thus far.  </li>
            <li>This razor is very well made and gives you a very nice clean smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed how easy it was to rinse the shaving soap off this after every pass.</li>
            <li>The whole length of this razor from the very top to bottom is about 3&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>Anyways I still kept at it because despite the bent corner it still shaved fine.</li>
            <li>The razor works fine.</li>
            <li>Overall I got to say that for my first safety razor I am impressed (</li>
            <li>This razor is well made and is a good tradeoff between too small and too large, perfect for at home or travel.</li>
            <li>easy to clean, easy to use, and sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, it has a good, solid weight, and the angle of the shave is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the razor: fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth</li>
            <li>Overall quality is great.</li>
            <li>This razor is very well constructed and feels nice in the hand</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean, preferred over disposable ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a short handle, with some great detail.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re careful, use a good lather, you&#x27;re going to get a nice shave.</li>
            <li>It works great and is perfect for those beginning wet shaving or the experienced wet shaver looking for a razor that will last a life time.</li>
            <li>I wish I had switched years ago and if you love nostalgia as mush as I then this is right up your alley.</li>
            <li>It has a nice classic look to it, a la</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed by this Merkur.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for your first or tenth DE safety razor this one is quite appropriate.</li>
            <li>The vintage design, since she&#x27;s into most things vintage (as am I ;)</li>
            <li>The fact this is based on the original gillette and nickel plated, I couldn&#x27;t say no.</li>
            <li>So far Amazon reviews give it a top rating and I have found the reviews to be very credible.</li>
            <li>nice and heavy in the hand, and shaves great (as long as you use good blades).</li>
            <li>While I love it, it is a lot more work as far as maintenance and shave technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not long ago I ditched those crappy plastic cartridge razors for good, and went with an all-metal Parker Shavette.&lt;br /&gt;Shavettes</li>
            <li>but if thats fine its worth</li>
            <li>so you will certainly need to buy more.</li>
            <li>If you have to have the latest, greatest, most expensive fad safety razor made, go waste your $$$ and be happy with your purchase.</li>
            <li>only way I think this razor could be improved was if it was made in the USA, but Solingen Germany has had a long history of making great knives and blades for many different purposes and Merkur has produced a great replica razor that I will enjoy using for years to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I bought 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades  here on Amazon for $11 and will try them out.</li>
            <li>Paired with Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades</li>
            <li>Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]]</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s plenty good enough for me.</li>
            <li>absolutely not a bad choice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super sweet and BA razor.  </li>
            <li>The design: super cool.</li>
            <li>Mild and well built.</li>
            <li>and it will essentially last forever and give you the best possible shave.  </li>
            <li>quickly, and it felts like a million bucks.</li>
            <li>quickly, and it felts like a million bucks.</li>
            <li>Unlike most other razors it&#x27;s nickel rather than chrome plated, which gives it a nice, old-timey look.</li>
            <li>At first I was perplexed at how I was going to use a shorter handle.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li>This replica of the original mass production razor from 1904 is nickel plated, which makes it nice and heavy making it very smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>It gave a clean, close, comfortable shave at a reasonable price time after time.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s become my new favorite razor for my head and face.</li>
            <li>As a first double edge it is good, cuts close even with one pass and is forgiving to a beginner.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was advertised!</li>
            <li>This is a great little razor, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The Merkur 1904 is a good razor for beginners, good quality, sturdy, heavy enough.</li>
            <li>It feels very solid, and is sure to last dozens of years of good shaves.</li>
            <li>Well worth your consideration</li>
            <li>I decided because I need to shave more frequently now</li>
            <li>Picked this one because I liked the look, the reviews were solid, and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quality of the Merkur is outstanding compared to my old razor.</li>
            <li>fun, yes, but tricky.</li>
            <li>Overall this thing is a good buy if you are thinking about making the switch from the modern 4 or 5 blade</li>
            <li>I believe I bought my brother the 30C model or something similar, but those seemed to be the popular ones because they were out of stock.</li>
            <li>But after you shave with it, I swear, it is a good feeling knowing that you don&#x27;t need the expensive razors to get a good shave, and you feel rather manly at that point.</li>
            <li>This one is worth every penny for face, body and head.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is making sure the blade is perfectly aligned.</li>
            <li>But at this price it&#x27;s worth getting used to.</li>
            <li>A good quality made razor but a little mild.  </li>
            <li>I like the short handle which is very easy to hold on to.  </li>
            <li>high dollar items are not always the best way to go, and in the long run, does it matter what someone else thinks of your personal effects, really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quality product, has good weight to it and is definetly something i can pass down to my son when the time comes.  </li>
            <li>With a little more growth, it was even better.</li>
            <li>With a little more growth, it was even better.</li>
            <li>With little or no &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34;, I went from $20 razor refills, to $0.45 refills, and am getting a closer shave, and a more enjoyable shaving experience.</li>
            <li>The six flat sides give it a nice positive feel in your hand.    </li>
            <li>I may buy a second one if Amazon offers one at a good price.  </li>
            <li>Definitely nicked myself along the jaw line, and I will say - shaving your chin is much trickier with this kind of razor.</li>
            <li>Do this before you load up on bulk amounts of blades of a single kind.</li>
            <li>Its smaller size also makes it slightly more suitable for travel although neither razor is that big.  </li>
            <li>I found that heating it up in hot water prior to using it improves its hair shaving ability.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to a five blade razor are even a 3 blade razor, this is far superior.  </li>
            <li>The length and angles are set up very, very well.</li>
            <li>After decades of using Atra type cartridge razors I wanted to try a more traditional razor again.</li>
            <li>And it works well with many different brands of blades.</li>
            <li>This was my first razor.</li>
            <li>First I dropped it on my sink.</li>
            <li>About 2 more drops later the head of the razor FELL OFF.</li>
            <li>They sell a number of different models many of which can be found here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>They do have some more \\&quot;exotic\\&quot; models: adjustables, \\&quot;slants\\&quot;, open comb, etc.</li>
            <li>Although you can never have too many razors, get the simple one to start with.</li>
            <li>and it was like getting back on that favorite bicycle you had as a kid.</li>
            <li>Used this razor for the first time yesterday amazed at the lack of irritation.</li>
            <li>My concern was soon laid to rest as the Amazon customer reviews were not wrong.</li>
            <li>Lesser weight for better balance while shaving in the tub&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided after over a year using a safety razor I would invest in a higher end razor.</li>
            <li>the weight is perfect for such a small razor, the handle length preferable.</li>
            <li>If you need an adjustable double edge razor get a Gillette Slim or Fatboy Adjustable on eBay, it&#x27;s an even better shave!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>For me, the longer my growth, the better the shave.&lt;br /&gt;Too short, and I&#x27;m hurting, and I look terrible--rashy and torn up.</li>
            <li>I love the heft, the look, and especially the function.</li>
            <li>Love the finish of the product and it feels solid in your had when in use.  </li>
            <li>(once I am sure I am practiced enough to handle it)</li>
            <li>and he seemed to like it, so Merkur was the first name I looked at.</li>
            <li>I installed the Merkur blade that comes with the razor and gave it its first tryout yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are still in the first year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Husband saw no benefit to the 4 and 5 blade heads and when the most recent of his replaceable head razors stopped making the 4 blades in favor of 5 forcing us to buy yet another two razors (home and travel), it made us say wait.</li>
            <li>I got this as my first DE safety razor.</li>
            <li>I just finished my second shave and have never had a shave as good as this, not a single nick or irritation</li>
            <li>On the whole, I&#x27;d recommend this razor to experienced wet shavers considering it as a replacement or addition (since these really don&#x27;t wear out) or to new wet shavers, since it&#x27;s very easy to use in terms of blade angle.</li>
            <li>but those are more specialized and if you are looking for a second (or third) razor they might very well be appropriate for you.    </li>
            <li>As I said above it will give you a shaving experience as good as many more expensive Merkurs without any extraneous features/frills/gimmicks (however you want to characterize them) and at a lower cost than all but one ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Gives great feedback, I can hear the blade cutting more than with my EJ.</li>
            <li>A classic and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Beginning to really like the open comb razors that are more aggressive.</li>
            <li>However this became a surprisingly positive trait.</li>
            <li>However, I have found in my older age, wisdom comes with experience, and experience comes right after you need it......</li>
            <li>I bought this razor thinking it was going to be same great design as the other merkurs ive had.</li>
            <li>The design and weight of this particular Merkur also makes it more likely to be dropped when combined with lather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the pieces fit together very well, the blades sit right where they are supposed to with no tweaking, the overall fit-and-finish</li>
            <li>You will save $$$$ on razor blades and this will be the last razor you will ever buy, not bad for $30!</li>
            <li>However, he prefers the shave he gets from this kind of razor to his previous brands.</li>
            <li>Easy to change blades (simply unscrew the handle from the two-piece head).</li>
            <li>In my case milder is not bad since I feel that as an everyday razor the Merkur is better than the Edwin Jagger.  </li>
            <li>The handle is a lot shorter than I expected, but if you alter your shaving technique it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>a decent first razor.</li>
            <li>The razor is not that heavy, which is a great, if not necessary, plus for a razor.    </li>
            <li>It gets such a close smooth shave that my legs are silky for days.</li>
            <li>I was tied of spending so much on disposable razor heads</li>
            <li>I tried a straight razor for a while.</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even much happier with</li>
            <li>Most of those models, even those costing quite a bit more than this one, use the same head geometry so they will all give you essentially the same performance.</li>
            <li>The weight of this razor is - almost - light enough for my taste.  </li>
            <li>I have a Feather TTO and it shaves well, but the head is much thicker in profile than this one.  </li>
            <li>Seemed very well built but something about it wouldn&#x27;t let the blade touch my beard.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother with cheap Chinese imitations--get a Merkur</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very hand that way.</li>
            <li>The Mrs. tried it, and now she wants one&lt;</li>
            <li>The Mrs. tried it, and now she wants one&lt;</li>
            <li>Any assistance would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li>I really like the weight and finish on the 1904.</li>
            <li>Lastly, this isn&#x27;t just for men with light beards.</li>
            <li>Just seems short to me compared to cheap plastic razors.</li>
            <li>This has NEVER happened to my current Gillette Superspeed despite being more than 40 years old and that I have owned for 3 years now.</li>
            <li>I use this to shave both my face and entire head, and so far I am really enjoying the closeness of the shave I am getting with it.  </li>
            <li>It offers close and smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t cut his skin like the old razor did.</li>
            <li>Very well made, high quality metal components throughout.</li>
            <li>In addition, I purchased a variety pack of double edge razors to try and so far I love all that I&#x27;ve used so far, as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of the rising cost of cartridges the quality kept going down.</li>
            <li>AND... it is cheaper for his annual shaving costs by more than half from what we can see...</li>
            <li>The handle makes it look like a classic.</li>
            <li>Better than some of the more expensive Merkur.</li>
            <li>After I used up my last proglide razor, I was so set on not buying anymore of the expensive refills that I just stopped shaving altogether and grew a wicked awesome beard.</li>
            <li>but it is a high quality finish.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended after all it is a copy of Gillette&#x27;s 1904.  </li>
            <li>Understand that this is high end product which does have a learning curve.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone looking to get into the safety razor arena, I highly recommend this handle.  </li>
            <li>The EJ looks a little more...</li>
            <li>Merkur is a killer little unit, and I love it, and you will too.</li>
            <li>If you end up not liking the razor, then you&#x27;ve got an interesting little trinket either way.</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor, and after some major research I went with this Merkur 1904.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a heavy little razor, but it shaves beautifully.</li>
            <li>If you are new to wetshaving, this is a decent place to start.</li>
            <li>The finish looks great and for 26 dollars you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li>I rarely do anything to it except use it daily.  </li>
            <li>Normally, that is a recipe for a lot of pain.</li>
            <li>Normally, that is a recipe for a lot of pain.</li>
            <li>Anyway it&#x27;s not a big deal because I still love it and plan to keep using it as long as I can.</li>
            <li>I got it, I noticed right off the bat that it was smaller than I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>This is the very first safety razor I bought and the only one I&#x27;ve sued so far.</li>
            <li>and I bought it..very convenient especially the small handle gives you good control navigating through sensitive spots in your face and avoid cuts</li>
            <li>new to this.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review.</li>
            <li>A brand new razor with vintage style.    </li>
            <li>I clearly need practise using it, but it did do a fairly decent job on my face...though i cant say 100% until i learn the techniques of shaing  with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>Old timey and classic.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband to replace a very old one.  </li>
            <li>My big hands have no real trouble holding it, but it just feels kind of odd.  </li>
            <li>(P.S. I&#x27;m the only person I know that is a DE shaver and also a straight razor and at 16 at that!</li>
            <li>Gives a pretty close shave, beard prep obviously has a hand in that to.  </li>
            <li>I did return my first Merkur due to questionable finishing; my second one was perfect.  </li>
            <li>For first time users or for those like myself or recently returned to this type of shaving, let the weight of the razor do the work.</li>
            <li>no matter if you are new to DE safety razor shaving or if you are an old hand.    </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found most high end razors to be a little short for my hands.</li>
            <li>This razor is easy to use - in a week, I have yet to so much as knick myself, which is more than I can say for cartridges, and a single pass is all it takes, so there&#x27;s very little razor burn - even less than high end multi-blade cartridges.</li>
            <li>You definitely must lather on an adequate amount of shaving cream prior to using this razor.</li>
            <li>Either razor is worth every penny a true value and will last several life times with careful use.</li>
            <li>Also a little heavier than a cheap plastic razor</li>
            <li>maybe in the future I might try to find a more &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; safety razor that will cut a little closer to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have a beard and mustache, but with clear cheeks.  </li>
            <li>it arrived I was surprised at just how short the handle really is, but I figured that was something I&#x27;d get used to.  </li>
            <li>Forget those Chinese made ones, and get a real razor.</li>
            <li>No problems with it so far.</li>
            <li>Slippery grip easily fixed by rubber bands, just like my grandpa&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got two shaves done with it so far using the Merkur blade included with it and haven&#x27;t nicked myself yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loaded two blades so far - the one that comes with the razor, and one replacement.</li>
            <li>the old-fashioned look adds to the revivification of an old tradition of shaving.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s my 67 year old face with crevices and dents, or which sags and bags from being about 80 pounds overweight, that seems to get in the way of the Merkur family of razors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep my review concise....</li>
            <li>This razor is short and beefy.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor in early October and have been using it for about 10 weeks now.  </li>
            <li>It allows multiple grip/finger configurations which head shavers will find very assuring.</li>
            <li>A bit more expensive, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Most of my razors had 3 or 4 blades and shaving was always missing spots especially under my nose.</li>
            <li>Was really looking forward to my first Merkur but was let down by this one.</li>
            <li>I also looked at several other brands, but overall the reviews are better for the Merkur razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The closed comb is the right choice if you just started DE shaving.</li>
            <li>A little on the small side, but good value for what I paid.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes shaving seem less a chore and more like a hobby, especially when used with shaving brush and soap.</li>
            <li>I was not sure about its design but found that it is fine, no problems.  </li>
            <li>This was my first safety razor, and it was not completely horrible, but not perfect either.     </li>
            <li>I purchased a Merkur Classic \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Safety Razor 42C awhile back</li>
            <li>Hadle is a little short but easy to work with.</li>
            <li>B0009IIBFE Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight]]) which is usually about the same price as this one, sometimes a dollar more sometimes a dollar less.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a step down from my Edwin Jagger, but this razor is well worth the money for $26.</li>
            <li>Being new to traditional wet shaving, this is my first DE safety razor.</li>
            <li>Since new blades for one of these can be had for cents rather than dollars, it&#x27;s actually a bargain.</li>
            <li>thats half the fun.</li>
            <li>I do not have large hands but find it a little difficult to keep a good grip on the handle during shaving.  </li>
            <li>The only thing about this particular razor is the handle is a bit short.</li>
            <li>Great razor bad toothbrush</li>
            <li>but it is quite apparent in person.</li>
            <li>The aggressiveness of the Edwin Jagger makes my skin sensitive if I use it every day for several consecutive days.  </li>
            <li>but I think it actually allows for a more delicate touch when using a double edge razor.  </li>
            <li>If you are just starting out DE shaving, I highly recommend this razor over the more expensive options (Futur, for example).</li>
            <li>After an extensive search for the right safety razor for her, I decided on the Merkur 1904 for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I lather up and go over my entire face with the razor twice, but at a couple spots there always seems to be a bit of stubble that is more noticeable than anything my 5 blade cartridge ever left behind.  </li>
            <li>We noticed the cost was half again as much for the 5-blade replacement heads for adding a blade with no actual benefit or improved shave.</li>
            <li>I can now just put a new blade on and other people in my family can use it.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to go slow and take little bites, and take your time.</li>

            <li> I am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> it gives a great shave.  </li>
            <li> For shaving technique here is a great link for a tutorial:</li>
            <li> Great razor.</li>
            <li> Feels great in the hand.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a great razor.</li>
            <li> Very nice piece.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice razor.</li>
            <li> but it is very effective.  </li>
            <li> Works great and looks good.</li>
            <li> He is so glad to know he can save money and have the best shave .</li>
            <li> All i can say is &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; havent got this good of a shave since being shaved at a barber shop.</li>
            <li> So he tried it and he liked that you can get a great shave for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> The angle is good and again, it&#x27;s not too aggressive.</li>
            <li> For a smooth, close shave, Merkur is best!</li>
            <li> the cornered handle is good for added grip</li>
            <li> good is the shave?</li>
            <li> To test the Merkur, I got my good soap (Col. Conk), a badger brush,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Razor is gorgeous and so well balanced.</li>
            <li> I continue to search for good razor blades, cream and brush, as I adjust to making the switch from 3 or 4 bladed cartridges.</li>
            <li> The weight is great and the length (shorter than my first \\&quot;trial\\&quot; razor) is perfect.</li>
            <li> Combine the razor with Merkur Super Platinum blades and you arguably have the best shaving system on the planet, without all the high-priced, multi-blade,  cartridge nonsense.</li>
            <li> The chrome finish on the Merkur is not quite as fine as the finish on the EJ, although it is of very good quality.  </li>
            <li> Smooth brilliant razor.</li>
            <li> Lovely design, great weight and balance.</li>
            <li> Great Size, Smooth Shave!</li>
            <li> But whatever, that&#x27;s no biggie, the fact that it&#x27;s made of metal gives it a good weight and the design is nice looking.</li>
            <li> This is the first Merkur that I have owned and I am very impressed with the quality.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty awesome; once you learn to use it.&lt;br /&gt;PS not all blades work on all faces.</li>
            <li> best shave the first time or two around, but you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> best shave the first time or two around, but you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s favorite razor!</li>
            <li> But it shaves amazing.</li>
            <li> the Merkur brand blades was of course just as amazing as the razor itself.</li>
            <li> Amazing razor.  </li>
            <li> Nice weight and balance</li>
            <li> weight is perfect for me, and I really like the design.</li>
            <li> not that I can go by much honestly).</li>
            <li> Pick up a badger hair brush, some nice blades and a shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Pairs up nicely with Feather blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice way to try BOTH if you want.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> In my reading I&#x27;ve heard many say Merkur made good beginner razor, so I knew I had to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks now, shaving almost every day with it, and I&#x27;ve still got a lot to learn about my own face.</li>
            <li> I get with it, the easier it will become to use it just as effectively as the multi-blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best perk of all is that you save so much money.</li>
            <li> It has nice weight and balance to it.  </li>
            <li> The weight is nice.</li>
            <li> Pair this with the 100 blade sampler and a nice shave soap and you are in business.</li>
            <li> Best New DE Razor out there for the money.</li>
            <li> Good, solid razor best shave ive had.</li>
            <li> The stainless is flawless after many uses.</li>
            <li> This Merkur is a GREAT razor for someone who wants to break from the&lt;br /&gt;plastic-shaver scene but it skittish about the shavette/straight razor approach.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My search for a perfect razor began and ended with this Merkur; I&#x27;m very pleased with it and intend to keep it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I think the Nickel finish is more elegant than the chrome -- and the handle design, in addition to giving this razor a nice look, is quite functional.</li>
            <li> OK, I was all excited to ditch the overpriced multi-blade razor cartridges and get into some good, old-school shaving.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect for my older busted-up hands to comfortably grip and maneuver.</li>
            <li> Even if you have no experience with safety razor shaving, Go for this, Also good beginner blades are Shark Super Chromes.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> This razor is fantastic!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> All you need is a soap and brush and mug and favorite blade.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing, NO irritation, Baby butt smooth shave, And no cuts.</li>
            <li> But Personna Lab Blues is a smoother shave for about 3 more dollars for 100 pack over the sharks.</li>
            <li> Although the best blade for your skin might be different than mine</li>
            <li> It was as if it was connected to the top by</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding razor.</li>
            <li> The is the best double edge razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Clearly MUCH better than &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> ENJOY! :-)</li>
            <li> Perfect actually.</li>
            <li> I love the stubby handle, perfect weight in (my) hand, and overall style.</li>
            <li> Almost the head is more curved than with my EJ</li>
            <li> which for me gives me a better shave.</li>
            <li> The finish was perfect looks like something that was made to last 100 years ago not like the throwaways of today.</li>
            <li> Both lined up perfectly without any extra effort on my part.</li>
            <li> I have read many of reviews praising the Merkur brand</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> Most Merkur razors are aggressive even their Futur and Progress adjustables.</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic razor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I could find &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m guessing it would be a marginal improvement at best&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Incredible design has also allowed me to adapt to this style of shaving much more seamlessly.</li>
            <li> handle is the perfect shape, with the lengthwise flats, the perfect weight, and the key overall IMHO - the handle length.</li>
            <li> bought this razor because I thought it seemed elegant looking and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that the longer that I use it and the better</li>
            <li> Also just remember, Now when you go to the store to buy more razors, you&#x27;re looking at about 3 dollars tops for 10 razors, compared to $20 for 4 proglides.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s still cheaper when you consider how many blades you&#x27;re getting in a cartridge of proglides.</li>
            <li> The blades you will be buying from now on are at most 30 cents a blade.</li>
            <li> This razor is a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> but I find that it allows you more manueverability.</li>
            <li> Never thought to buy one of these before instead of razors all the time, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it, high quality and great shave.</li>
            <li> I can find no fault with the shave from this razor and would highly recommend it for newbie and experienced shaver alike.</li>
            <li> Seems good quality at first.</li>
            <li> I have finally found the perfect size and weight safety razor for my face, and more importantly,</li>
            <li> The weight of this razor is good, the grip is very usable, and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very nice, high quality safety razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, it&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve gotten for a very long time.</li>
            <li> REALLY quickly--much more so than a Shavette.&lt;br /&gt;Get a good soap and brush, and go to town.</li>
            <li> REALLY quickly--much more so than a Shavette.&lt;br /&gt;Get a good soap and brush, and go to town.</li>
            <li> It is definitely shorter than disposables which takes some getting used to, but looks great and is nice and balanced.</li>
            <li> He is very satisfied with it and likes it better than the more modern electric or multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> A straight razor would be the perfect shaving tool for me, if I were brave enough to learn to use one and were willing to put up with the sharpening routine --</li>
            <li> Shorter handle to better fit her hands</li>
            <li> Great old school look.  </li>
            <li> Saves lots of money and gets his face silky smooth :)</li>
            <li> always end up irritated, have to put some kind of lotion or vaseline and face is still irritated and can hardly smile and touch my face with out irritation.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and navigate with and have had great shaves with it, thus far.  </li>
            <li> This razor is very well made and gives you a very nice clean smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed how easy it was to rinse the shaving soap off this after every pass.</li>
            <li> The whole length of this razor from the very top to bottom is about 3&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> Anyways I still kept at it because despite the bent corner it still shaved fine.</li>
            <li> The razor works fine.</li>
            <li> Overall I got to say that for my first safety razor I am impressed (</li>
            <li> This razor is well made and is a good tradeoff between too small and too large, perfect for at home or travel.</li>
            <li> easy to clean, easy to use, and sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, it has a good, solid weight, and the angle of the shave is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the razor: fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth</li>
            <li> Overall quality is great.</li>
            <li> This razor is very well constructed and feels nice in the hand</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean, preferred over disposable ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a short handle, with some great detail.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful, use a good lather, you&#x27;re going to get a nice shave.</li>
            <li> It works great and is perfect for those beginning wet shaving or the experienced wet shaver looking for a razor that will last a life time.</li>
            <li> I wish I had switched years ago and if you love nostalgia as mush as I then this is right up your alley.</li>
            <li> It has a nice classic look to it, a la</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed by this Merkur.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for your first or tenth DE safety razor this one is quite appropriate.</li>
            <li> The vintage design, since she&#x27;s into most things vintage (as am I ;)</li>
            <li> The fact this is based on the original gillette and nickel plated, I couldn&#x27;t say no.</li>
            <li> So far Amazon reviews give it a top rating and I have found the reviews to be very credible.</li>
            <li> nice and heavy in the hand, and shaves great (as long as you use good blades).</li>
            <li> While I love it, it is a lot more work as far as maintenance and shave technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not long ago I ditched those crappy plastic cartridge razors for good, and went with an all-metal Parker Shavette.&lt;br /&gt;Shavettes</li>
            <li> but if thats fine its worth</li>
            <li> so you will certainly need to buy more.</li>
            <li> If you have to have the latest, greatest, most expensive fad safety razor made, go waste your $$$ and be happy with your purchase.</li>
            <li> only way I think this razor could be improved was if it was made in the USA, but Solingen Germany has had a long history of making great knives and blades for many different purposes and Merkur has produced a great replica razor that I will enjoy using for years to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I bought 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades  here on Amazon for $11 and will try them out.</li>
            <li> Paired with Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades</li>
            <li> Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]]</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s plenty good enough for me.</li>
            <li> absolutely not a bad choice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super sweet and BA razor.  </li>
            <li> The design: super cool.</li>
            <li> Mild and well built.</li>
            <li> and it will essentially last forever and give you the best possible shave.  </li>
            <li> quickly, and it felts like a million bucks.</li>
            <li> quickly, and it felts like a million bucks.</li>
            <li> Unlike most other razors it&#x27;s nickel rather than chrome plated, which gives it a nice, old-timey look.</li>
            <li> At first I was perplexed at how I was going to use a shorter handle.</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li> This replica of the original mass production razor from 1904 is nickel plated, which makes it nice and heavy making it very smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> It gave a clean, close, comfortable shave at a reasonable price time after time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s become my new favorite razor for my head and face.</li>
            <li> As a first double edge it is good, cuts close even with one pass and is forgiving to a beginner.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was advertised!</li>
            <li> This is a great little razor, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The Merkur 1904 is a good razor for beginners, good quality, sturdy, heavy enough.</li>
            <li> It feels very solid, and is sure to last dozens of years of good shaves.</li>
            <li> Well worth your consideration</li>
            <li> I decided because I need to shave more frequently now</li>
            <li> Picked this one because I liked the look, the reviews were solid, and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quality of the Merkur is outstanding compared to my old razor.</li>
            <li> fun, yes, but tricky.</li>
            <li> Overall this thing is a good buy if you are thinking about making the switch from the modern 4 or 5 blade</li>
            <li> I believe I bought my brother the 30C model or something similar, but those seemed to be the popular ones because they were out of stock.</li>
            <li> But after you shave with it, I swear, it is a good feeling knowing that you don&#x27;t need the expensive razors to get a good shave, and you feel rather manly at that point.</li>
            <li> This one is worth every penny for face, body and head.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is making sure the blade is perfectly aligned.</li>
            <li> But at this price it&#x27;s worth getting used to.</li>
            <li> A good quality made razor but a little mild.  </li>
            <li> I like the short handle which is very easy to hold on to.  </li>
            <li> high dollar items are not always the best way to go, and in the long run, does it matter what someone else thinks of your personal effects, really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quality product, has good weight to it and is definetly something i can pass down to my son when the time comes.  </li>
            <li> With a little more growth, it was even better.</li>
            <li> With a little more growth, it was even better.</li>
            <li> With little or no &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34;, I went from $20 razor refills, to $0.45 refills, and am getting a closer shave, and a more enjoyable shaving experience.</li>
            <li> The six flat sides give it a nice positive feel in your hand.    </li>
            <li> I may buy a second one if Amazon offers one at a good price.  </li>
            <li> Definitely nicked myself along the jaw line, and I will say - shaving your chin is much trickier with this kind of razor.</li>
            <li> Do this before you load up on bulk amounts of blades of a single kind.</li>
            <li> Its smaller size also makes it slightly more suitable for travel although neither razor is that big.  </li>
            <li> I found that heating it up in hot water prior to using it improves its hair shaving ability.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to a five blade razor are even a 3 blade razor, this is far superior.  </li>
            <li> The length and angles are set up very, very well.</li>
            <li> After decades of using Atra type cartridge razors I wanted to try a more traditional razor again.</li>
            <li> And it works well with many different brands of blades.</li>
            <li> This was my first razor.</li>
            <li> First I dropped it on my sink.</li>
            <li> About 2 more drops later the head of the razor FELL OFF.</li>
            <li> They sell a number of different models many of which can be found here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> They do have some more \\&quot;exotic\\&quot; models: adjustables, \\&quot;slants\\&quot;, open comb, etc.</li>
            <li> Although you can never have too many razors, get the simple one to start with.</li>
            <li> and it was like getting back on that favorite bicycle you had as a kid.</li>
            <li> Used this razor for the first time yesterday amazed at the lack of irritation.</li>
            <li> My concern was soon laid to rest as the Amazon customer reviews were not wrong.</li>
            <li> Lesser weight for better balance while shaving in the tub&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided after over a year using a safety razor I would invest in a higher end razor.</li>
            <li> the weight is perfect for such a small razor, the handle length preferable.</li>
            <li> If you need an adjustable double edge razor get a Gillette Slim or Fatboy Adjustable on eBay, it&#x27;s an even better shave!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> For me, the longer my growth, the better the shave.&lt;br /&gt;Too short, and I&#x27;m hurting, and I look terrible--rashy and torn up.</li>
            <li> I love the heft, the look, and especially the function.</li>
            <li> Love the finish of the product and it feels solid in your had when in use.  </li>
            <li> (once I am sure I am practiced enough to handle it)</li>
            <li> and he seemed to like it, so Merkur was the first name I looked at.</li>
            <li> I installed the Merkur blade that comes with the razor and gave it its first tryout yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are still in the first year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Husband saw no benefit to the 4 and 5 blade heads and when the most recent of his replaceable head razors stopped making the 4 blades in favor of 5 forcing us to buy yet another two razors (home and travel), it made us say wait.</li>
            <li> I got this as my first DE safety razor.</li>
            <li> I just finished my second shave and have never had a shave as good as this, not a single nick or irritation</li>
            <li> On the whole, I&#x27;d recommend this razor to experienced wet shavers considering it as a replacement or addition (since these really don&#x27;t wear out) or to new wet shavers, since it&#x27;s very easy to use in terms of blade angle.</li>
            <li> but those are more specialized and if you are looking for a second (or third) razor they might very well be appropriate for you.    </li>
            <li> As I said above it will give you a shaving experience as good as many more expensive Merkurs without any extraneous features/frills/gimmicks (however you want to characterize them) and at a lower cost than all but one ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Gives great feedback, I can hear the blade cutting more than with my EJ.</li>
            <li> A classic and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Beginning to really like the open comb razors that are more aggressive.</li>
            <li> However this became a surprisingly positive trait.</li>
            <li> However, I have found in my older age, wisdom comes with experience, and experience comes right after you need it......</li>
            <li> I bought this razor thinking it was going to be same great design as the other merkurs ive had.</li>
            <li> The design and weight of this particular Merkur also makes it more likely to be dropped when combined with lather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the pieces fit together very well, the blades sit right where they are supposed to with no tweaking, the overall fit-and-finish</li>
            <li> You will save $$$$ on razor blades and this will be the last razor you will ever buy, not bad for $30!</li>
            <li> However, he prefers the shave he gets from this kind of razor to his previous brands.</li>
            <li> Easy to change blades (simply unscrew the handle from the two-piece head).</li>
            <li> In my case milder is not bad since I feel that as an everyday razor the Merkur is better than the Edwin Jagger.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a lot shorter than I expected, but if you alter your shaving technique it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> a decent first razor.</li>
            <li> The razor is not that heavy, which is a great, if not necessary, plus for a razor.    </li>
            <li> It gets such a close smooth shave that my legs are silky for days.</li>
            <li> I was tied of spending so much on disposable razor heads</li>
            <li> I tried a straight razor for a while.</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even much happier with</li>
            <li> Most of those models, even those costing quite a bit more than this one, use the same head geometry so they will all give you essentially the same performance.</li>
            <li> The weight of this razor is - almost - light enough for my taste.  </li>
            <li> I have a Feather TTO and it shaves well, but the head is much thicker in profile than this one.  </li>
            <li> Seemed very well built but something about it wouldn&#x27;t let the blade touch my beard.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with cheap Chinese imitations--get a Merkur</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very hand that way.</li>
            <li> The Mrs. tried it, and now she wants one&lt;</li>
            <li> The Mrs. tried it, and now she wants one&lt;</li>
            <li> Any assistance would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I really like the weight and finish on the 1904.</li>
            <li> Lastly, this isn&#x27;t just for men with light beards.</li>
            <li> Just seems short to me compared to cheap plastic razors.</li>
            <li> This has NEVER happened to my current Gillette Superspeed despite being more than 40 years old and that I have owned for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave both my face and entire head, and so far I am really enjoying the closeness of the shave I am getting with it.  </li>
            <li> It offers close and smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t cut his skin like the old razor did.</li>
            <li> Very well made, high quality metal components throughout.</li>
            <li> In addition, I purchased a variety pack of double edge razors to try and so far I love all that I&#x27;ve used so far, as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On top of the rising cost of cartridges the quality kept going down.</li>
            <li> AND... it is cheaper for his annual shaving costs by more than half from what we can see...</li>
            <li> The handle makes it look like a classic.</li>
            <li> Better than some of the more expensive Merkur.</li>
            <li> After I used up my last proglide razor, I was so set on not buying anymore of the expensive refills that I just stopped shaving altogether and grew a wicked awesome beard.</li>
            <li> but it is a high quality finish.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended after all it is a copy of Gillette&#x27;s 1904.  </li>
            <li> Understand that this is high end product which does have a learning curve.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone looking to get into the safety razor arena, I highly recommend this handle.  </li>
            <li> The EJ looks a little more...</li>
            <li> Merkur is a killer little unit, and I love it, and you will too.</li>
            <li> If you end up not liking the razor, then you&#x27;ve got an interesting little trinket either way.</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor, and after some major research I went with this Merkur 1904.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy little razor, but it shaves beautifully.</li>
            <li> If you are new to wetshaving, this is a decent place to start.</li>
            <li> The finish looks great and for 26 dollars you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> I rarely do anything to it except use it daily.  </li>
            <li> Normally, that is a recipe for a lot of pain.</li>
            <li> Normally, that is a recipe for a lot of pain.</li>
            <li> Anyway it&#x27;s not a big deal because I still love it and plan to keep using it as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I got it, I noticed right off the bat that it was smaller than I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> This is the very first safety razor I bought and the only one I&#x27;ve sued so far.</li>
            <li> and I bought it..very convenient especially the small handle gives you good control navigating through sensitive spots in your face and avoid cuts</li>
            <li> new to this.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review.</li>
            <li> A brand new razor with vintage style.    </li>
            <li> I clearly need practise using it, but it did do a fairly decent job on my face...though i cant say 100% until i learn the techniques of shaing  with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Old timey and classic.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to replace a very old one.  </li>
            <li> My big hands have no real trouble holding it, but it just feels kind of odd.  </li>
            <li> (P.S. I&#x27;m the only person I know that is a DE shaver and also a straight razor and at 16 at that!</li>
            <li> Gives a pretty close shave, beard prep obviously has a hand in that to.  </li>
            <li> I did return my first Merkur due to questionable finishing; my second one was perfect.  </li>
            <li> For first time users or for those like myself or recently returned to this type of shaving, let the weight of the razor do the work.</li>
            <li> no matter if you are new to DE safety razor shaving or if you are an old hand.    </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found most high end razors to be a little short for my hands.</li>
            <li> This razor is easy to use - in a week, I have yet to so much as knick myself, which is more than I can say for cartridges, and a single pass is all it takes, so there&#x27;s very little razor burn - even less than high end multi-blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> You definitely must lather on an adequate amount of shaving cream prior to using this razor.</li>
            <li> Either razor is worth every penny a true value and will last several life times with careful use.</li>
            <li> Also a little heavier than a cheap plastic razor</li>
            <li> maybe in the future I might try to find a more &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; safety razor that will cut a little closer to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have a beard and mustache, but with clear cheeks.  </li>
            <li> it arrived I was surprised at just how short the handle really is, but I figured that was something I&#x27;d get used to.  </li>
            <li> Forget those Chinese made ones, and get a real razor.</li>
            <li> No problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> Slippery grip easily fixed by rubber bands, just like my grandpa&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got two shaves done with it so far using the Merkur blade included with it and haven&#x27;t nicked myself yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loaded two blades so far - the one that comes with the razor, and one replacement.</li>
            <li> the old-fashioned look adds to the revivification of an old tradition of shaving.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s my 67 year old face with crevices and dents, or which sags and bags from being about 80 pounds overweight, that seems to get in the way of the Merkur family of razors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep my review concise....</li>
            <li> This razor is short and beefy.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in early October and have been using it for about 10 weeks now.  </li>
            <li> It allows multiple grip/finger configurations which head shavers will find very assuring.</li>
            <li> A bit more expensive, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Most of my razors had 3 or 4 blades and shaving was always missing spots especially under my nose.</li>
            <li> Was really looking forward to my first Merkur but was let down by this one.</li>
            <li> I also looked at several other brands, but overall the reviews are better for the Merkur razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The closed comb is the right choice if you just started DE shaving.</li>
            <li> A little on the small side, but good value for what I paid.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes shaving seem less a chore and more like a hobby, especially when used with shaving brush and soap.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about its design but found that it is fine, no problems.  </li>
            <li> This was my first safety razor, and it was not completely horrible, but not perfect either.     </li>
            <li> I purchased a Merkur Classic \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Safety Razor 42C awhile back</li>
            <li> Hadle is a little short but easy to work with.</li>
            <li> B0009IIBFE Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight]]) which is usually about the same price as this one, sometimes a dollar more sometimes a dollar less.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a step down from my Edwin Jagger, but this razor is well worth the money for $26.</li>
            <li> Being new to traditional wet shaving, this is my first DE safety razor.</li>
            <li> Since new blades for one of these can be had for cents rather than dollars, it&#x27;s actually a bargain.</li>
            <li> thats half the fun.</li>
            <li> I do not have large hands but find it a little difficult to keep a good grip on the handle during shaving.  </li>
            <li> The only thing about this particular razor is the handle is a bit short.</li>
            <li> Great razor bad toothbrush</li>
            <li> but it is quite apparent in person.</li>
            <li> The aggressiveness of the Edwin Jagger makes my skin sensitive if I use it every day for several consecutive days.  </li>
            <li> but I think it actually allows for a more delicate touch when using a double edge razor.  </li>
            <li> If you are just starting out DE shaving, I highly recommend this razor over the more expensive options (Futur, for example).</li>
            <li> After an extensive search for the right safety razor for her, I decided on the Merkur 1904 for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I lather up and go over my entire face with the razor twice, but at a couple spots there always seems to be a bit of stubble that is more noticeable than anything my 5 blade cartridge ever left behind.  </li>
            <li> We noticed the cost was half again as much for the 5-blade replacement heads for adding a blade with no actual benefit or improved shave.</li>
            <li> I can now just put a new blade on and other people in my family can use it.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to go slow and take little bites, and take your time.</li>
            <li> , we all know there are more expensive, highly machined adjustable \\&quot;razor(s) of the day\\&quot;, but here is a real winner that&#x27;s been hangin&#x27; tough since 1904</li>
            <li> Assembly was simple turn razor upside down on counter or table, unscrew handle, lift up blade retaining clip, drop new blade in holding on the sides away from the sharpened blade ends, and reassemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really sharp looking, and adds about 75 classy points to you shave.</li>
            <li> I guess I thought the angle of the picture was making the handle look smaller, but nope, it really is that small.</li>
            <li> Slow down and enjoy the experience.</li>
            <li> The handle is slippery when wet (which is a major problem), and the end is rounded so it won&#x27;t stand up on end.</li>
            <li> Merkur is one of the few razor companies still turning out high quality double-edged safety razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor for the past couple years.</li>
            <li> Forget the butterfly type of double edge razor, they are a pain in the long run.</li>
            <li> is that the pattern on the handle does not provide much grip when it is wet, so I had to learn to grip it carefully to prevent it from slipping.</li>
            <li> The short handles takes some getting used to if you come from long handled razors</li>
            <li> Now all I have to buy is a box of like 100 blades and that&#x27;ll last us a long time.</li>
            <li> Also, The head is thin enough for me to place the blade right next to the beard line.  </li>
            <li> I learned to shave on double and single edge razors over 30 years ago.</li>
            <li> It comes with a Merkur blade and although Merkur makes top-shelf razors they are not known (at least in a positive sense) for their blades.</li>
            <li> It requires a little skill (i.e. practice) to get a good shave, and a light touch to keep from cutting yourself, but it didn&#x27;t take me long to get to the point where I can shave blindly in the shower and not get nicked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little old school anyway.</li>
            <li> And I have to say I would be hard pressed to buy another one or even really try anything else.</li>
            <li> I used to think I&#x27;d prefer a long handle, but I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> long handle for about six months now</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what a normal length handle is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the overall length of the handle.</li>
            <li> Well balanced and not too aggressive, the only possible problem is that the nickel is so highly polished that it&#x27;s a little slick.    </li>
            <li> have traditionally used shaving foam in the can, but tried Williams shaving soap from Wal-Mart less than a dollar as an experiment this last shave.</li>
            <li> My wife thought I was crazy or acting 50 years older than I really am, but I thought it was time to change the way I shave.</li>
            <li> A little scary for her at first, but now that she has the feel for it, she really enjoys the shaving experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, I figured if I had to get back to shaving on a daily basis once again, I was not going to go back to these expensive modern shavers</li>
            <li> I bought a second one due to the fact it works so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because of the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; looks and as a back up razor in case my other razor broke from dropping it.</li>
            <li> This razor needs care and understanding to use to its fullest potential, so do a little research and find out the proper way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You might want to Google for \\&quot;sample razor blade pack\\&quot; to get a few each of several different kinds to try.</li>
            <li> i cut myself a few times, nothing major, i assume i just need to get used to handling this razor.</li>
            <li> He suggested switching to a shaving brush and soap and using a single bladed razor.  </li>
            <li> However, the diameter of the handle is a little small and could be a problem if you have large hands.  </li>
            <li> am not sure what a more expensive razor would do for me that this one does not already to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple matter of less blade friction on the skin.</li>
            <li> uses the same Personna blades as my Parker (you break them in half for the shavette, but not the Merkur),&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a small razor, the handle is quite short so if you have really big hands</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of one hundred razors for less than five bucks and it will last me over a year.</li>
            <li> In 10 months I have spent less than $4 on razors for this shaver--and still have some left.  </li>
            <li> Handle is a little short, but I like it.</li>
            <li> It is a little short and takes a while to get used to it</li>
            <li> It is a bit slippery when it is wet.  </li>
            <li> , I remember I had bought my brother a shave kit containing a Merkur razor for Christmas a few years back</li>
            <li> 6 blades per head (5 + 1 precision trimmer) and 4 heads per cartridge is 24 blades at 20 dollars which is roughly 80 cents a blades.</li>
            <li> He said it was roughly 3 months.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with the short life of this razor.  </li>
            <li> In addition, this razor is nickel plated instead of chrome plated like the other Merkurs.</li>
            <li> I also have an Edwin Jagger and therefore compare these to each other all the time.</li>
            <li> it was small similar in size to one of the disposable razors you buy in the plastic bag.</li>
            <li> usually just a tiny un-noticeable pin prick of a cut - and usually when I am trying to get one last shave out of a blade that should be replaced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , only complaint is that in harder to reach spots</li>
            <li> It arrived today, I had been using a shavette with slight irritation, Not much but some.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s probably not right for you.</li>
            <li> take it from a guy with tough hair and a sensitive face:&lt;br</li>
            <li> take it from a guy with tough hair and a sensitive face:&lt;br</li>
            <li> After much research I decided to ditch the expensive cartridge/disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Been shaving with a heavier Merkur (38C) and kept getting nicked -- not fun come aftershave.</li>
            <li> He has a THICK and COARSE beard when it comes in.</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;m used to, but that&#x27;s to be expected since it&#x27;s not cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I bought it on the advice of my barber, trying to cut down on razor irritation to my throat.  </li>
            <li> Once you get the art of shaving down, this will give you the smoothest shave of your life.</li>
            <li> My only complaint (and it is a minor complaint)</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that it is very small.  </li>
            <li> The shorter handle makes you use less pressure.</li>
            <li> I also bought some extra razor blades and the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury shave set which came to a total of around $60, which I thought is a rather expensive investment, but would pay for itself in a few months time, not having to purchase the proglide blades</li>
            <li> The handle could be just a little longer, but I have no problem shaving with it.</li>
            <li> Merkur blades seem a little pricy</li>
            <li> I picked this little guy up to save my scalp.</li>
            <li> I hope to pass this down to my son in 18 years!</li>
            <li> It took a few shaves to get used to it</li>
            <li> handle is somewhat heavy and the blade you put in it does all the work.  </li>
            <li> So when you order a Merkur razor you should also order a few blades.</li>
            <li> I tried holding the razor at every conceivable angle and still failed at getting it to scrape away any whiskers.  </li>
            <li> hope i didn&#x27;t waste almost $30 on this razor.  </li>
            <li> A little small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found I have to lather my chin and neck twice for extra passes to obtain the smoothness I want without getting the crazy razor burn that comes along with using a single blade.</li>
            <li> It was a losing battle, so I picked up this bad boy as a quality entry to old fashion wet shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No more expensive cartridge based blades!!!</li>
            <li> There is no need to buy a really expensive razor unless you just want to try different razors like I do.</li>
            <li> After learning how to use a safety razor, I will never go back to buying expensive razors again.  </li>
            <li> No more disposables for me.</li>
            <li> The razor itself is but a small part of the safety razor shaving experience.</li>
            <li> used to shave with the fusion proglide, but started looking into safety and straight razors after I got sick of each proglide cartridge being about $5 a pop.</li>
            <li> The Merkur blade struck me as being incredibly thin; are blades from other manufacturers the same?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Learned the hard way that you cannot take it on a plane.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell it&#x27;s even cutting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell it&#x27;s even cutting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you buy this and use it with a regular aerosol cream and cold water you will cut yourself and feel like a pin cushion at the end of your shave.</li>
            <li> And less pressure means less cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> razor does nothing, by which I mean that it literally does not remove hair from my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back to expensive cartridge razors again!</li>
            <li> it can be a little ever so slightly difficult in comparison to longer handled models.</li>
            <li> The electrics gave me worse razor burn than dull disposables.</li>
            <li> and I bought myself this bad boy, so that we would have different looking ones.</li>
            <li> His hair is VERY thick so a sturdy razor is a must.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> replace her expensive Venus leg shavers.</li>
            <li> replace her expensive Venus leg shavers.</li>
            <li> Can someone tell me what I&#x27;m doing wrong?  </li>
            <li> the blade is difficult to change without cutting your self.</li>
            <li> The three piece design is dangerous for beginners.</li>
            <li> and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I always hated how the cartridge razors stayed clogged up after one use.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this razor.  The design on the handle looks like the razors my grandfather used.  I like the short handle which is very easy to hold on to.  However, the diameter of the handle is a little small and could be a problem if you have large hands.  I do not have large hands but find it a little difficult to keep a good grip on the handle during shaving.  The finish does not look like nickel.  It appears to be chrome but it is a high quality finish.  This is the first Merkur that I have owned and I am very impressed with the quality.  It is not what I would call an aggressive razor but it gave me a great shave with no nicks on my medium beard.  I can find no fault with the shave from this razor and would highly recommend it for newbie and experienced shaver alike.</li>
            <li> Love it, high quality and great shave.</li>
            <li> Mild and well built. If you are new to wetshaving, this is a decent place to start. The three piece design is dangerous for beginners.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Merkur 1904 safety razor here on Amazon. My package arrived on schedule. Just shaved with this razor, using a Dorco platinum blade. All i can say is &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; havent got this good of a shave since being shaved at a barber shop. This is now my go to razor. Cant wait to try it using a feather blade. Cudos to Merkur.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to replace a very old one.  He is very satisfied with it and likes it better than the more modern electric or multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> Great quality. I can see this product lasting a lifetime.</li>
            <li> This razor is fantastic! It gets such a close smooth shave that my legs are silky for days.</li>
            <li> A classic and worth every penny. Forget the butterfly type of double edge razor, they are a pain in the long run. A 3 piece razor will outlive you and never wear out. Forget those Chinese made ones, and get a real razor. It&#x27;s a heavy little razor, but it shaves beautifully. Just be sure to go slow and take little bites, and take your time. You will get a close shave. This razor is well made and is a good tradeoff between too small and too large, perfect for at home or travel. You will save $$$$ on razor blades and this will be the last razor you will ever buy, not bad for $30!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty awesome; once you learn to use it.&lt;br /&gt;PS not all blades work on all faces. Find the blade that works for you.</li>
            <li> Very nice piece. Unlike most other razors it&#x27;s nickel rather than chrome plated, which gives it a nice, old-timey look. Well balanced and not too aggressive, the only possible problem is that the nickel is so highly polished that it&#x27;s a little slick.    I&#x27;d buy it again in a minute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using his for about a month now and I&#x27;m quite pleased. If you&#x27;re careful, use a good lather, you&#x27;re going to get a nice shave. Learned the hard way that you cannot take it on a plane. Buy disposables and leave this one at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years. It&#x27;s holding up just fine. I rarely do anything to it except use it daily.  I used to think I&#x27;d prefer a long handle, but I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what a more expensive razor would do for me that this one does not already to. With Dorco blades (blue and red), I can shave in the shower without looking and without bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** 2015&lt;br /&gt;ironically, only 2 months after I wrote this review, the screw that binds the handle to the head fell out.  JB weld did not fix it, so it&#x27;s now in the landfill.  I am not pleased with the short life of this razor.  from 5 to now 3 stars.  The razor only lasted a couple years.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve bought.  This razor pays its self no need to buy disposables or proprietary cartridges.  All you need is a soap and brush and mug and favorite blade.</li>
            <li> I was tied of spending so much on disposable razor heads so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I&#x27;m a little old school anyway. I tried a straight razor for a while. The safety razor is in my opinion the best of both. It took a few shaves to get used to it but now I couldn&#x27;t do without. The only thing about this particular razor is the handle is a bit short.</li>
            <li> Good, solid razor best shave ive had. A little small but if thats fine its worth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the merkur 34c long handle for about six months now so I know how to use a de razor. So my dad just recently ran out of cartridges for his multi blade razor and asked if he could use mine (different blades of course). So he tried it and he liked that you can get a great shave for a fraction of the price. So I gave him mine and I bought myself this bad boy, so that we would have different looking ones. At first I was perplexed at how I was going to use a shorter handle. However this became a surprisingly positive trait. The shorter handle makes you use less pressure. And less pressure means less cutting yourself. Now I got used to cartridge razors starting out so I have this tendency, if you do too try out this razor, it&#x27;s merkur and it&#x27;s a short handle so you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The Merkur 1904 is a good razor for beginners, good quality, sturdy, heavy enough. The closed comb is the right choice if you just started DE shaving.</li>
            <li> I learned to shave on double and single edge razors over 30 years ago. After decades of using Atra type cartridge razors I wanted to try a more traditional razor again. I was not disappointed by this Merkur. Very well made, high quality metal components throughout. This razor has an excellent balance of closeness and smoothness. And it works well with many different brands of blades. My only complaint (and it is a minor complaint) is that the pattern on the handle does not provide much grip when it is wet, so I had to learn to grip it carefully to prevent it from slipping. My search for a perfect razor began and ended with this Merkur; I&#x27;m very pleased with it and intend to keep it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was advertised! Would buy as a gift for someone. The stainless is flawless after many uses. Hadle is a little short but easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I clearly need practise using it, but it did do a fairly decent job on my face...though i cant say 100% until i learn the techniques of shaing  with a safety razor. My only gripe is that it is very small.  My big hands have no real trouble holding it, but it just feels kind of odd.  I plan on replacing it with a longer handled one when i can, and this will probably be added to a travel kit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super sweet and BA razor.  Really sharp looking, and adds about 75 classy points to you shave. Nice weight and balance, only complaint is that in harder to reach spots it can be a little ever so slightly difficult in comparison to longer handled models. All in all a great and affordable razor. Old timey and classic.</li>
            <li> Great price, great handle. I would defiantly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great razor. A little on the small side, but good value for what I paid.</li>
            <li> Awesome, best shave ever.</li>
            <li> It arrived today, I had been using a shavette with slight irritation, Not much but some. But just used this, Loaded up a Personna lab blue, Lathered up and Oh. My. God. This razor is amazing, NO irritation, Baby butt smooth shave, And no cuts. If you&#x27;ve been wanting a safety razor this is a EXCELLENT beginner razor. Slightly short handle, But it shaves amazing. Even if you have no experience with safety razor shaving, Go for this, Also good beginner blades are Shark Super Chromes. But Personna Lab Blues is a smoother shave for about 3 more dollars for 100 pack over the sharks. Although the best blade for your skin might be different than mine so I&#x27;d recommend a sampler pack for the guy or gal out there new to this.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review. (P.S. I&#x27;m the only person I know that is a DE shaver and also a straight razor and at 16 at that! haha)</li>
            <li> This was my first safety razor, and it was not completely horrible, but not perfect either.     Faults: The razor is not that heavy, which is a great, if not necessary, plus for a razor.    The razor broke after eleven months of use.    I bought a Merkur Futur and it was great. No problems with it so far. A bit more expensive, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I got this for around $27 USD. It works great and is perfect for those beginning wet shaving or the experienced wet shaver looking for a razor that will last a life time.</li>
            <li> Seems good quality at first. Not so. This was my first razor. It provided excellent shaves but it broke after 4-6 months. First I dropped it on my sink. The corner of the safety bar became bent. This has NEVER happened to my current Gillette Superspeed despite being more than 40 years old and that I have owned for 3 years now. The design and weight of this particular Merkur also makes it more likely to be dropped when combined with lather. Anyways I still kept at it because despite the bent corner it still shaved fine. About 2 more drops later the head of the razor FELL OFF. The screwing mechanism in the middle was stuck inside the handle. It was as if it was connected to the top by glue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not the only one complaining about quality problems there are tons of reports by people on forums claiming that the plating wears off on Merkurs. Don&#x27;t buy into the myth of \\&quot;German engineering\\&quot; these are inferior razors who cant hold a candle to ancient American razors. I&#x27;m even much happier with my cheap-o aluminum Egyptian made Lord razor than this.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes shaving seem less a chore and more like a hobby, especially when used with shaving brush and soap.</li>
            <li> Beautiful perfect construction, perfect blade alignment, very smooth shaving. Another affordable luxury along with the Edwin Jagger DE89 you must have if you&#x27;re into double edge razor shaving. Either razor is worth every penny a true value and will last several life times with careful use.</li>
            <li> This safety razor works great. The handle makes it look like a classic. I bought a second one due to the fact it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is somewhat heavy and the blade you put in it does all the work.  You definitely must lather on an adequate amount of shaving cream prior to using this razor. I found that heating it up in hot water prior to using it improves its hair shaving ability.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to a five blade razor are even a 3 blade razor, this is far superior.  The disposable razors are inferior compared to this one.  After using a double edge razor, i would not go back to using disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this to someone else?&lt;br /&gt;Yes. This is a great quality razor and is a great price.</li>
            <li> After much research I decided to ditch the expensive cartridge/disposable razors. This razor is a thing of beauty. It feels very solid, and is sure to last dozens of years of good shaves. The handle is a lot shorter than I expected, but if you alter your shaving technique it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor thinking it was going to be same great design as the other merkurs ive had. Its not. the blade is difficult to change without cutting your self. I don&#x27;t recommend this model.</li>
            <li> Smooth brilliant razor. I like the weight and balance in the hand. I would like it to be about 1/2&amp;#34; longer but I&#x27;ve found most high end razors to be a little short for my hands.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding razor. A brand new razor with vintage style.    Merkur is one of the few razor companies still turning out high quality double-edged safety razors. They sell a number of different models many of which can be found here on Amazon. Most of those models, even those costing quite a bit more than this one, use the same head geometry so they will all give you essentially the same performance. The differences are all in the handle design -- heavier and/or longer in all combinations. But see next paragraph.    They do have some more \\&quot;exotic\\&quot; models: adjustables, \\&quot;slants\\&quot;, open comb, etc. having different head geometry but those are more specialized and if you are looking for a second (or third) razor they might very well be appropriate for you.    If you are looking for your first or tenth DE safety razor this one is quite appropriate. As I said above it will give you a shaving experience as good as many more expensive Merkurs without any extraneous features/frills/gimmicks (however you want to characterize them) and at a lower cost than all but one ([[ASIN:B0009IIBFE Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight]]) which is usually about the same price as this one, sometimes a dollar more sometimes a dollar less.    In addition, this razor is nickel plated instead of chrome plated like the other Merkurs. The difference can&#x27;t be seen in the pictures on Amazon but it is quite apparent in person. The nickel plating was used to enhance the overall \\&quot;antique\\&quot; look of this razor, along with the handle design. I think the Nickel finish is more elegant than the chrome -- and the handle design, in addition to giving this razor a nice look, is quite functional. The six flat sides give it a nice positive feel in your hand.    Well worth your consideration no matter if you are new to DE safety razor shaving or if you are an old hand.    HINT:    The razor comes with one blade so you will certainly need to buy more. It comes with a Merkur blade and although Merkur makes top-shelf razors they are not known (at least in a positive sense) for their blades. So when you order a Merkur razor you should also order a few blades. You might want to Google for \\&quot;sample razor blade pack\\&quot; to get a few each of several different kinds to try. Do this before you load up on bulk amounts of blades of a single kind.</li>
            <li> I have a beard and mustache, but with clear cheeks.  The weight of this razor is - almost - light enough for my taste.  And the handle is short enough for me to maneuver close to my beard.  Also, The head is thin enough for me to place the blade right next to the beard line.  A straight razor would be the perfect shaving tool for me, if I were brave enough to learn to use one and were willing to put up with the sharpening routine -- but I&#x27;m not. I have a Feather TTO and it shaves well, but the head is much thicker in profile than this one.  This is not an aggressive shaver. Its finish is flawless. I have no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Seemed very well built but something about it wouldn&#x27;t let the blade touch my beard. I tried a couple of different brands of blades with the same results. Was really looking forward to my first Merkur but was let down by this one. I will try again later with a more expensive model.</li>
            <li> Slippery grip easily fixed by rubber bands, just like my grandpa&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> This razor was recommended by friend and I bought it..very convenient especially the small handle gives you good control navigating through sensitive spots in your face and avoid cuts</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, it has a good, solid weight, and the angle of the shave is very comfortable.  Highly recommended.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This razor works for me.  I was not sure about its design but found that it is fine, no problems.  I may buy a second one if Amazon offers one at a good price.  Bottom line:  The is the best double edge razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Shave like your grandfather did!  Back before people needed 6 blades in a row to get the stubble off of their face, they used devices like this.  It requires a little skill (i.e. practice) to get a good shave, and a light touch to keep from cutting yourself, but it didn&#x27;t take me long to get to the point where I can shave blindly in the shower and not get nicked.  In 10 months I have spent less than $4 on razors for this shaver--and still have some left.  And I don&#x27;t get razor burn anymore!</li>
            <li> Like all Merkur products, this razor exudes old-school quality.  Don&#x27;t bother with cheap Chinese imitations--get a Merkur and it will essentially last forever and give you the best possible shave.  Clearly MUCH better than &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor for the past couple years. While I love it, it is a lot more work as far as maintenance and shave technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided because I need to shave more frequently now, I&#x27;d hop on the DE train. Picked this one because I liked the look, the reviews were solid, and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight is perfect for me, and I really like the design. I&#x27;ve got two shaves done with it so far using the Merkur blade included with it and haven&#x27;t nicked myself yet. Lovely design, great weight and balance. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Quality product, has good weight to it and is definetly something i can pass down to my son when the time comes.  Gives a pretty close shave, beard prep obviously has a hand in that to.  A brand i will definetly stick with.</li>
            <li> I switched from the Merkur Futur to this razor (thinking it was a downgrade). I was mistaken. This is a great little razor, and inexpensive. If you are just starting out DE shaving, I highly recommend this razor over the more expensive options (Futur, for example). Although you can never have too many razors, get the simple one to start with.</li>
            <li> My dad introduced me to this type of razor when I was a teenager. It gave a clean, close, comfortable shave at a reasonable price time after time. Why I ever got away from using it will remain a mystery. I purchased a Merkur Classic \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Safety Razor 42C awhile back and it was like getting back on that favorite bicycle you had as a kid. Combine the razor with Merkur Super Platinum blades and you arguably have the best shaving system on the planet, without all the high-priced, multi-blade,  cartridge nonsense. Highly recommend. Note to newbie users: Slow down and enjoy the experience. These are \\&quot;safety\\&quot; razors, but if you try to power thru at breakneck speeds, they can bite. ENJOY! :-)</li>
            <li> Used multi blade razors all my life. always end up irritated, have to put some kind of lotion or vaseline and face is still irritated and can hardly smile and touch my face with out irritation. Used this razor for the first time yesterday amazed at the lack of irritation. what was i doing with my face prior to that shave. i cut myself a few times, nothing major, i assume i just need to get used to handling this razor. four stars because just got the product yesterday.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because of the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; looks and as a back up razor in case my other razor broke from dropping it. If I ever drop it. The razor works fine. Not too aggressive for me. Perfect actually. The handle could be just a little longer, but I have no problem shaving with it. It&#x27;s just a preference. The price for the razor is an excellent buy. It&#x27;s just a step down from my Edwin Jagger, but this razor is well worth the money for $26. I switch back and forth between my Edwin Jagger and this Merkur. There is no need to buy a really expensive razor unless you just want to try different razors like I do. This Merkur 1904 is very good for the price. The angle is good and again, it&#x27;s not too aggressive. It&#x27;s about the same as my EJ. The EJ looks a little more...&amp;#34;elegant.&amp;#34; I might buy another Merkur 1904 for travel or work.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice razor. I also have an Edwin Jagger and therefore compare these to each other all the time. The Merkur is a milder shave but it is very effective.  In my case milder is not bad since I feel that as an everyday razor the Merkur is better than the Edwin Jagger.  The aggressiveness of the Edwin Jagger makes my skin sensitive if I use it every day for several consecutive days.  However, I can use the Merkur every day and never feel the sensitivity.  I take my Merkur with me on business travel and leave the EJ at home.  The short handles takes some getting used to if you come from long handled razors but I think it actually allows for a more delicate touch when using a double edge razor.  Its smaller size also makes it slightly more suitable for travel although neither razor is that big.  The chrome finish on the Merkur is not quite as fine as the finish on the EJ, although it is of very good quality.  I did return my first Merkur due to questionable finishing; my second one was perfect.  Overall, very pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li> I love the stubby handle, perfect weight in (my) hand, and overall style. The surface of the handle is non slip too. Overall I got to say that for my first safety razor I am impressed (not that I can go by much honestly). I did my research and these Merkur&#x27;s are the go to brand, these and Edwin Jaggers which I also considered.</li>
            <li> Gives great feedback, I can hear the blade cutting more than with my EJ. Almost the head is more curved than with my EJ which for me gives me a better shave. The finish looks great and for 26 dollars you can&#x27;t go wrong I&#x27;m now a Merkur fan for life and is now my go to razor over my EJ.</li>
            <li> The handle is slippery when wet (which is a major problem), and the end is rounded so it won&#x27;t stand up on end.</li>
            <li> For a smooth, close shave, Merkur is best!</li>
            <li> a decent first razor. absolutely not a bad choice. nice and heavy in the hand, and shaves great (as long as you use good blades). easy to clean, easy to use, and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I was initially concerned when I opened the package because of the size of this razor it was small similar in size to one of the disposable razors you buy in the plastic bag. My concern was soon laid to rest as the Amazon customer reviews were not wrong. The whole length of this razor from the very top to bottom is about 3&amp;#34;. The finish was perfect looks like something that was made to last 100 years ago not like the throwaways of today. Assembly was simple turn razor upside down on counter or table, unscrew handle, lift up blade retaining clip, drop new blade in holding on the sides away from the sharpened blade ends, and reassemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving for years spending the cash on multi-blade razor cartridges and found out that was all money thrown in the trash literally. Most of my razors had 3 or 4 blades and shaving was always missing spots especially under my nose. The stock Merkur blade that came with this razor I just finished my second shave and have never had a shave as good as this, not a single nick or irritation simply excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have traditionally used shaving foam in the can, but tried Williams shaving soap from Wal-Mart less than a dollar as an experiment this last shave. It&#x27;s simplicity but the way men shaved years ago still works and it works well for me. I don&#x27;t see changing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way I think this razor could be improved was if it was made in the USA, but Solingen Germany has had a long history of making great knives and blades for many different purposes and Merkur has produced a great replica razor that I will enjoy using for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur blades seem a little pricy so I bought 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades  here on Amazon for $11 and will try them out. So far Amazon reviews give it a top rating and I have found the reviews to be very credible.</li>
            <li> ..it came on time even though it was a Sunday..the finish is perfect,though I think it&#x27;s nickel plated..it has a vintage look..the cornered handle is good for added grip..short handle for stubby fingers like mine is perfect..close combed for a perfect shave..this is a keeper..</li>
            <li> Great razor bad toothbrush</li>
            <li> After a couple of years trying electric razors to combat the rising cost of disposable razor cartridges I gave up. The electrics gave me worse razor burn than dull disposables. On top of the rising cost of cartridges the quality kept going down. It was a losing battle, so I picked up this bad boy as a quality entry to old fashion wet shaving. Since new blades for one of these can be had for cents rather than dollars, it&#x27;s actually a bargain. This razor is easy to use - in a week, I have yet to so much as knick myself, which is more than I can say for cartridges, and a single pass is all it takes, so there&#x27;s very little razor burn - even less than high end multi-blade cartridges. It&#x27;s a simple matter of less blade friction on the skin. The weight of this razor is good, the grip is very usable, and very comfortable. The length of the handle has not been an issue for me. I&#x27;ve loaded two blades so far - the one that comes with the razor, and one replacement. Both lined up perfectly without any extra effort on my part. On the whole, I&#x27;d recommend this razor to experienced wet shavers considering it as a replacement or addition (since these really don&#x27;t wear out) or to new wet shavers, since it&#x27;s very easy to use in terms of blade angle.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my girlfriend.  After an extensive search for the right safety razor for her, I decided on the Merkur 1904 for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Merkur quality&lt;br /&gt;2.  In honor of her German heritage&lt;br /&gt;3.  The vintage design, since she&#x27;s into most things vintage (as am I ;)&lt;br /&gt;4.  Shorter handle to better fit her hands&lt;br /&gt;5.  Lesser weight for better balance while shaving in the tub&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves it.  A little scary for her at first, but now that she has the feel for it, she really enjoys the shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more expensive cartridge based blades!!!</li>
            <li> Replaced a safety razor I bought two years ago with this model. The quality of the Merkur is outstanding compared to my old razor.</li>
            <li> I decided after over a year using a safety razor I would invest in a higher end razor. I have read many of reviews praising the Merkur brand and I thought this one would appease my taste and liking. I love this razor. The weight is great and the length (shorter than my first \\&quot;trial\\&quot; razor) is perfect. The blade that came with it so you can try the Merkur brand blades was of course just as amazing as the razor itself. I am so happy with my purchase. I have thought about giving some out as presents this year.</li>
            <li> the weight is perfect for such a small razor, the handle length preferable. however, if you are not into short-length handles, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing this razor. the old-fashioned look adds to the revivification of an old tradition of shaving.</li>
            <li> This is the best Merkur razor made! Most Merkur razors are aggressive even their Futur and Progress adjustables. Perhaps it&#x27;s my 67 year old face with crevices and dents, or which sags and bags from being about 80 pounds overweight, that seems to get in the way of the Merkur family of razors.  This razor is the exception! Highly recommended after all it is a copy of Gillette&#x27;s 1904.  Paired with Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades it gives a great shave.  This may be all the razor one would ever need. If you need an adjustable double edge razor get a Gillette Slim or Fatboy Adjustable on eBay, it&#x27;s an even better shave!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep my review concise....this is a fantastic razor! I started shaving in the 1960s and have the facial scars to prove it. This razor is short and beefy. For first time users or for those like myself or recently returned to this type of shaving, let the weight of the razor do the work. For shaving technique here is a great link for a tutorial: http://www.gentlemansgazette.com/double-edge-razor-guide-de/.  This is not a shaving system if you are rushed and it probably won&#x27;t pass muster with the TSA. If you have the time it&#x27;s almost zen-like. Buy a system, however. Pick up a badger hair brush, some nice blades and a shaving cream. The quality of the razor: fantastic. The design: super cool. The result: best shave in years.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Pairs up nicely with Feather blades.</li>
            <li> Not long ago I ditched those crappy plastic cartridge razors for good, and went with an all-metal Parker Shavette.&lt;br /&gt;Shavettes are tricky--fun, yes, but tricky. This Merkur is a GREAT razor for someone who wants to break from the&lt;br /&gt;plastic-shaver scene but it skittish about the shavette/straight razor approach.&lt;br /&gt;This uses the same Personna blades as my Parker (you break them in half for the shavette, but not the Merkur),&lt;br /&gt;so it&#x27;s very hand that way. It&#x27;s a nice way to try BOTH if you want.&lt;br /&gt;The Merkur is a killer little unit, and I love it, and you will too. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it&#x27;s made in Germany. Not India, not China, not Korea. Germany. And the build quality totally reflects this...&lt;br /&gt;the pieces fit together very well, the blades sit right where they are supposed to with no tweaking, the overall fit-and-finish&lt;br /&gt;is excellent, and best of all, it has a nice weight too it. It looks, feels, and handles like a it&#x27;s made in Germany. The polish&lt;br /&gt;and construction are just excellent. I&#x27;m sure I could find &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m guessing it would be a marginal improvement at best&lt;br /&gt;and a 100-200% increase in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve gotten for a very long time. The length and angles are set up very, very well. With a good blade, I will go out on a limb and say it&#x27;s probably the  best thing I&#x27;ve ever shaved with for the money. Note on blades: Personnas are excellent, the Merkur blade that is included is good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had excellent shaves with a 4-bladed something or nother, but the price-per-shave was astronomical.&lt;br /&gt;Once you buy the Merkur, the blades are what...2 cents each? That&#x27;s what I call thrifty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How good is the shave? Well let&#x27;s put it this way: I shave maybe twice a week. For me, the longer my growth, the better the shave.&lt;br /&gt;Too short, and I&#x27;m hurting, and I look terrible--rashy and torn up. To test the Merkur, I got my good soap (Col. Conk), a badger brush,&lt;br /&gt;and I went after 2-3 days of a growth with it. Normally, that is a recipe for a lot of pain.

            <li> I love the heft, the look, and especially the function. With little or no &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34;, I went from $20 razor refills, to $0.45 refills, and am getting a closer shave, and a more enjoyable shaving experience.</li>
            <li> After learning how to use a safety razor, I will never go back to buying expensive razors again.  This is a step back in time to when shaving was still a bit of an &#x27;experience&#x27;.  Love the finish of the product and it feels solid in your had when in use.  Handle is a little short, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Being new to traditional wet shaving, this is my first DE safety razor. Razor is gorgeous and so well balanced. Incredible design has also allowed me to adapt to this style of shaving much more seamlessly. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in early October and have been using it for about 10 weeks now.  I bought it on the advice of my barber, trying to cut down on razor irritation to my throat.  He suggested switching to a shaving brush and soap and using a single bladed razor.  Taking his advice, I bought a shaving mug, an inexpensive brush, have found a couple of types of soap I like and bought this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked.  I no longer have the bumps and irritation under my chin and on my throat.  I&#x27;ve nicked myself about once a week - usually just a tiny un-noticeable pin prick of a cut - and usually when I am trying to get one last shave out of a blade that should be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that I am not getting as close a shave as I would like.  I lather up and go over my entire face with the razor twice, but at a couple spots there always seems to be a bit of stubble that is more noticeable than anything my 5 blade cartridge ever left behind.  I don&#x27;t want to go back to the razor burn of the cartridge, so maybe in the future I might try to find a more &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; safety razor that will cut a little closer to the skin.  (once I am sure I am practiced enough to handle it)</li>
            <li> My wife thought I was crazy or acting 50 years older than I really am, but I thought it was time to change the way I shave. In my reading I&#x27;ve heard many say Merkur made good beginner razor, so I knew I had to try. The fact this is based on the original gillette and nickel plated, I couldn&#x27;t say no. As a first double edge it is good, cuts close even with one pass and is forgiving to a beginner. It is definitely shorter than disposables which takes some getting used to, but looks great and is nice and balanced. I would recommend for beginners.</li>
            <li> Great old school look.  It is a bit slippery when it is wet.  Hefty feel. Quality.</li>
            <li> I have finally found the perfect size and weight safety razor for my face, and more importantly, my head...the Merkur \\&quot;1904\\&quot; 42C.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is the perfect shape, with the lengthwise flats, the perfect weight, and the key overall IMHO - the handle length. It allows multiple grip/finger configurations which head shavers will find very assuring. It is perfect for my older busted-up hands to comfortably grip and maneuver. To me, this is shaving nirvana!&lt;br /&gt;Sure, we all know there are more expensive, highly machined adjustable \\&quot;razor(s) of the day\\&quot;, but here is a real winner that&#x27;s been hangin&#x27; tough since 1904 that&#x27;s plenty good enough for me. If you have to have the latest, greatest, most expensive fad safety razor made, go waste your $$$ and be happy with your purchase. However, I have found in my older age, wisdom comes with experience, and experience comes right after you need it......high dollar items are not always the best way to go, and in the long run, does it matter what someone else thinks of your personal effects, really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR HEAD SHAVERS!</li>
            <li> Best New DE Razor out there for the money. Better than some of the more expensive Merkur. Great Size, Smooth Shave!</li>
            <li> This razor is very well made and gives you a very nice clean smooth shave.  It works well with all of the different brands of De blades.</li>
            <li> Overall this thing is a good buy if you are thinking about making the switch from the modern 4 or 5 blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to shave with the fusion proglide, but started looking into safety and straight razors after I got sick of each proglide cartridge being about $5 a pop. After I used up my last proglide razor, I was so set on not buying anymore of the expensive refills that I just stopped shaving altogether and grew a wicked awesome beard. But that amazingness had to come to an end when I got promoted to management inside my company and had to start caring for my appearance once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I digress. Anyway, I figured if I had to get back to shaving on a daily basis once again, I was not going to go back to these expensive modern shavers, I remember I had bought my brother a shave kit containing a Merkur razor for Christmas a few years back and he seemed to like it, so Merkur was the first name I looked at. I also looked at several other brands, but overall the reviews are better for the Merkur razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this razor because I thought it seemed elegant looking and the price tag is low. I believe I bought my brother the 30C model or something similar, but those seemed to be the popular ones because they were out of stock. I also bought some extra razor blades and the Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury shave set which came to a total of around $60, which I thought is a rather expensive investment, but would pay for itself in a few months time, not having to purchase the proglide blades anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it, I noticed right off the bat that it was smaller than I thought it was going to be. I guess I thought the angle of the picture was making the handle look smaller, but nope, it really is that small. But whatever, that&#x27;s no biggie, the fact that it&#x27;s made of metal gives it a good weight and the design is nice looking. Time to pop one of the razor blades in and get to town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;ve never used one before, there is definitely a learning curve. I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks now, shaving almost every day with it, and I&#x27;ve still got a lot to learn about my own face. I&#x27;ve managed not to slice myself. Definitely nicked myself along the jaw line, and I will say - shaving your chin is much trickier with this kind of razor. I&#x27;ve found I have to lather my chin and neck twice for extra passes to obtain the smoothness I want without getting the crazy razor burn that comes along with using a single blade. I&#x27;m sure that the longer that I use it and the better I get with it, the easier it will become to use it just as effectively as the multi-blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re thinking about making the switch, go ahead and just do it. If you end up not liking the razor, then you&#x27;ve got an interesting little trinket either way. But after you shave with it, I swear, it is a good feeling knowing that you don&#x27;t need the expensive razors to get a good shave, and you feel rather manly at that point. Also just remember, Now when you go to the store to buy more razors, you&#x27;re looking at about 3 dollars tops for 10 razors, compared to $20 for 4 proglides. And that&#x27;s still cheaper when you consider how many blades you&#x27;re getting in a cartridge of proglides. 6 blades per head (5 + 1 precision trimmer) and 4 heads per cartridge is 24 blades at 20 dollars which is roughly 80 cents a blades. The blades you will be buying from now on are at most 30 cents a blade. It just makes sense.</li>
            <li> I picked this little guy up to save my scalp. Been shaving with a heavier Merkur (38C) and kept getting nicked -- not fun come aftershave. This razor is the best one I have used out of a half-dozen double-edge razor options. No nicks, no irritation, no burns, no bumps. This one is worth every penny for face, body and head.</li>
            <li> OK, I was all excited to ditch the overpriced multi-blade razor cartridges and get into some good, old-school shaving.  After reading the reviews here on Amazon I bought the Merkur model 1904.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I was surprised at just how short the handle really is, but I figured that was something I&#x27;d get used to.  Maybe the short handle helps you keep the blade head at the correct angle, I figured.  I installed the Merkur blade that comes with the razor and gave it its first tryout yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does nothing, by which I mean that it literally does not remove hair from my face.  I tried holding the razor at every conceivable angle and still failed at getting it to scrape away any whiskers.  Can someone tell me what I&#x27;m doing wrong?  It seemed as though there just wasn&#x27;t enough space between the blade edge and the razor head.  The Merkur blade struck me as being incredibly thin; are blades from other manufacturers the same?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope i didn&#x27;t waste almost $30 on this razor.  Any assistance would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I really like the weight and finish on the 1904. Overall quality is great. My only complaint is making sure the blade is perfectly aligned. The razor head has a tiny bit of play when loading the blade. I was amazed how easy it was to rinse the shaving soap off this after every pass. I always hated how the cartridge razors stayed clogged up after one use.</li>
            <li> A good quality made razor but a little mild.  Beginning to really like the open comb razors that are more aggressive.</li>
            <li> Nothing cuts as close as a quality safety razor.  It&#x27;s the only way to get close lines on my beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> This razor is a fantastic buy! There is a learning curve, ive had it for a week and im still learning, but thats half the fun. This razor is very well constructed and feels nice in the hand</li>
            <li> I like this razor, basic, well balanced, I like the finish. Easy to use and clean, preferred over disposable ones.</li>
            <li> This is the very first safety razor I bought and the only one I&#x27;ve sued so far. And I have to say I would be hard pressed to buy another one or even really try anything else. This replica of the original mass production razor from 1904 is nickel plated, which makes it nice and heavy making it very smooth on the skin. Understand that this is high end product which does have a learning curve. If you buy this and use it with a regular aerosol cream and cold water you will cut yourself and feel like a pin cushion at the end of your shave. This razor needs care and understanding to use to its fullest potential, so do a little research and find out the proper way to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no issue with the grip and I&#x27;ve never dropped this razor so I&#x27;ve had no issue with the head braking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a small razor, the handle is quite short so if you have really big hands it&#x27;s probably not right for you. But at this price it&#x27;s worth getting used to. Properly used I promise you will never, ever go back to a cartridge.</li>
            <li> This razor took some acclimation for my husband to &amp;#34;get it right&amp;#34;. He said it was roughly 3 months. However, he prefers the shave he gets from this kind of razor to his previous brands. AND... it is cheaper for his annual shaving costs by more than half from what we can see... We are still in the first year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the initial phase, he had a bunch of nicks and cuts on his jaw and throat. He has a THICK and COARSE beard when it comes in. His hair is VERY thick so a sturdy razor is a must. He uses shaving soap rather than cream and his shave has never been closer. He does caution it is an adjustment to anyone that is switching but he recommends it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why we tried this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Husband saw no benefit to the 4 and 5 blade heads and when the most recent of his replaceable head razors stopped making the 4 blades in favor of 5 forcing us to buy yet another two razors (home and travel), it made us say wait. We noticed the cost was half again as much for the 5-blade replacement heads for adding a blade with no actual benefit or improved shave. We had enough. A barber friend recommended this and we jumped on it. He packs this part in his carry on but the blades go in the checked bag.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. Once you get the art of shaving down, this will give you the smoothest shave of your life. I wish I had switched years ago and if you love nostalgia as mush as I then this is right up your alley. The only down side is the overall length of the handle. It is a little short and takes a while to get used to it but I find that it allows you more manueverability. The best perk of all is that you save so much money. I bought a pack of one hundred razors for less than five bucks and it will last me over a year. You can spend thirty dollars on a replacement pack of two for the Mach 70 or whatever they are on now. Lastly, this isn&#x27;t just for men with light beards. I have a very thick beard and I used to shave twice a day; I&#x27;m in the Army. Since I started shaving with this, I only have to shave once a day and I get carded for smokes regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s favorite razor! He uses this every time he shaves. Saves lots of money and gets his face silky smooth :)</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor, and after some major research I went with this Merkur 1904.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a short handle, with some great detail.  It is easy to use and navigate with and have had great shaves with it, thus far.  It has nice weight and balance to it.  In addition, I purchased a variety pack of double edge razors to try and so far I love all that I&#x27;ve used so far, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone looking to get into the safety razor arena, I highly recommend this handle.  It has a nice classic look to it, a la it&#x27;s etching, unlike the HD everyone is recommending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes: I use this to shave both my face and entire head, and so far I am really enjoying the closeness of the shave I am getting with it.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> Great product! My husband loves it. It offers close and smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t cut his skin like the old razor did.</li>
            <li> I wish the blades wre easier to change. The originbal gillette I once had, a twist of the handle and the face would swing open making it simple to change the blade.</li>
            <li> Amazing razor.  I&#x27;m never going back to expensive cartridge razors again!</li>
            <li> Never thought to buy one of these before instead of razors all the time, but I love it. I had a slap on the forehead moment when I seen it. I can now just put a new blade on and other people in my family can use it. Which saves me a ton of money since I am a mom of 2 tweens. Now all I have to buy is a box of like 100 blades and that&#x27;ll last us a long time. Only wish the handle was a tad longer but I&#x27;ve never had one before so I&#x27;m not sure what a normal length handle is supposed to be. Just seems short to me compared to cheap plastic razors. Also a little heavier than a cheap plastic razor like I&#x27;m used to, but that&#x27;s to be expected since it&#x27;s not cheap plastic. Anyway it&#x27;s not a big deal because I still love it and plan to keep using it as long as I can. And my daughter likes it too.</li>
            <li> Feels great in the hand. The best blade I have found for this razor is the bic chrome platinum. No more disposables for me.</li>
            <li> Very nice, high quality safety razor. Easy to change blades (simply unscrew the handle from the two-piece head). I continue to search for good razor blades, cream and brush, as I adjust to making the switch from 3 or 4 bladed cartridges. The razor itself is but a small part of the safety razor shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I got this as my first DE safety razor. I now have 4 others. I came back to this razor after trying all the others. It cuts close but not too close. The weight is nice. For the price this is a great razor. Pair this with the 100 blade sampler and a nice shave soap and you are in business. Great starter razor! The photo is after almost 2 months of daily use.</li>
            <li> Works great and looks good. Replaced my disposables with this DE safety razor and never looked back. I hope to pass this down to my son in 18 years!</li>
            <li> I was worried about the short handle but it&#x27;s become my new favorite razor for my head and face.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after a coworker recommended this brand to me. My husband said it was one of the best shaves he had in  along time. He is so glad to know he can save money and have the best shave .</li>
