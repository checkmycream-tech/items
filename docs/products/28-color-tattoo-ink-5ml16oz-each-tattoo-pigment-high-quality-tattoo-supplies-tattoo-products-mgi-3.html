            <li>Each Tattoo Pigment High Quality Tattoo Supplies Tattoo Products MGI-3]] - much so it may not be the best review but its what I&#x27;ve experienced with this set so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great seller, you get exactly what is describe to you in the Ad.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>This product is great for a starter who wants to experiment with diff colors.</li>
            <li>i was somewhat satisfied some of the names of some of the colors were somewhat decieveing and i had to dilute some of the color because the ink was just too thikk like mudd</li>
            <li>but for the price they were okay.</li>
            <li>i understad that you get what you pay for, but for the quality of this ink you would think i got it for free!</li>
            <li>I was sorta hoping for more colors</li>
            <li>I wish there was more ink for the price</li>
            <li>, i would not put this ink  into any ones skin , probably better for practice skins , but even with that being said , the ink just ends up satiating, and not want to set</li>
            <li>This would be an ideal buy  for a beginner but spend the extra money to for quality ink .</li>
            <li>and you get a good quality ink for a reasonable price</li>
            <li>First off these are great for practice skins, pretty colors gives you room to play.</li>
            <li>any thing thats around 7.00 to 9.00 a oz, and make sure its not a china knock off,if the price is to cheap you no its not the original ink.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t ever put this trash inks or any cheap inks like this n peoples skin.</li>
            <li>My husband was excited about the colors.</li>
            <li>Ships safe and fast.</li>
            <li>i wanted if for a gift for my step son and it just wasn&#x27;t good enough quality to do what he wanted.</li>
            <li>Nice colors  should&#x27;ve gotten the bigger bottlew</li>
            <li>Turned out to be a rare ski.</li>
            <li>they peek off right after the healing process, you would think you didnt get color in the tattoo at all.</li>
            <li>it got here safe and sound and no problem with it, I would surly would need to pay more in the future but in a bigger seize</li>
            <li>many different colors</li>
            <li>but the price was ok,, but their was alot of different colors,,,.</li>
            <li>always buy your ink and other supplies from a reputable tattoo supplier!</li>
            <li>and when wiped it off, there wasn&#x27;t much sticking in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Tried another black ink that I own (not of this set)</li>
            <li>This is the absolute last time I will ever buy cheap ink.  </li>
            <li>and it stuck so much</li>
            <li>I wish who sale the real tattoo ink</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this is you really are trying to have a lot of colors on hand.</li>

            <li>came packaged very well</li>
            <li>I got this ink in, i did not expect much out of it but thought i would give it a chance for the price.</li>
            <li>ink sucks all its good at is staining clothing</li>
            <li>Not to sure of it either, extremely watery also</li>
            <li>set.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to see how it looks once it&#x27;s healed up, but just from those two colors - I&#x27;m not to sure about using the other ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it stayed in more compared to the black from this</li>
            <li>The ink doesnt last it fades really quick</li>
            <li>would not chance doing a live tattoo on a person with this ink.</li>
            <li>theres only enough ink in each tube to do a ladybug and its pretty much done think was thicker than i like</li>
            <li>a sharpie can do a better job than this DONT BUY SUCKS</li>
            <li>When I contacted seller, they were gracious enough to send a relacement, but the replacement was exactly the same...</li>
            <li>They are cheap but the size is just too small</li>
            <li>Colors were not what we expected, they had a very odd selection, I was expecting more general or basic colors instead of</li>
            <li>Its great color goes in the skin very nicely, only bad thing I have to say about it is that some of the colors were leaking.</li>
            <li>ill be more careful on what I buy thanks</li>
            <li>the colors were not  nearly as bright as advertised... just  cheap ink .. not  </li>

            <li> OK the bottles are mad small enough ink to do one maybe two smalls tattoos that&#x27;s if you don&#x27;t run of them like everything made in china</li>
            <li> a tattoo yesterday (only black ink -extremely watery-)</li>
            <li> it arrived (on time) all of the colors except for one were closed and not leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real</li>
            <li> it was aight wasnt what i expected</li>
            <li> I will now take all my business to \\&quot;world wide tattoo\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and because one was leaking and had gotten all over the other ones that were packaged with it.</li>
            <li> only thing is that they&#x27;re SO SMALL..</li>
            <li> /&gt;The ink had a very hard time staying in skin, and I had to go over it multiple multiple times.</li>
            <li> they are small i was hoping they would be a little bit bigger but the price on them you cant beat i like it</li>
            <li> Not worth any of the discount.  </li>
            <li> Good ink (IDK why others have said it&#x27;s horrible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably my fault for thinking I would get a decent product for that price, but what I got was simply crap, completely unusable - strait to the trash!</li>
            <li> the inks are watered down waste of 20 bucs smh</li>
            <li> This is horribly painful and super crappy.  </li>
            <li> A couple of the bottles had leaked a little and it was visible to the eye and should have been noticed in packaging</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stay and has caused some weird reactions on skin like completely fading out, and rash, and infection.</li>
            <li> Its cheap, and crap.</li>
            <li> Colors are bad, Tattoo turned out like a giant bruise.</li>
            <li> I used just a tiny bit of one to fill in the silhouette of a couple of birds on my arm and it hurts so bad.  </li>
            <li> This ink is no good</li>
            <li> not good</li>
            <li> But after a few days as the tattoo starts to heal it fades drastically, DO NOT buy this ink!!!</li>
            <li> literally the worst tattooing ink that you could possibly even use.</li>
            <li> crazy</li>
            <li> Sucke gave me a bad infection and now I got to get all my out lines redone ugh</li>
            <li> THIS INK IS BAD.</li>
            <li> Now  they have to find a way to cover this piece of crap....</li>
            <li> its terrible ink, and i would NOT reccomend it at all!!</li>
            <li> This ink is horrible.  </li>
            <li> It looks horrible.  </li>
            <li> these inks are the worst i have ever used.</li>
            <li> My friend did 3 tats with this ink and all horrible.</li>

            <li> took forever to get due to it coming from china and separates if you let it sit to long. I was not happy with the colors received and half filled bottles.  would not chance doing a live tattoo on a person with this ink. contacted the seller with no response. would not recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> i wanted if for a gift for my step son and it just wasn&#x27;t good enough quality to do what he wanted.</li>
            <li> Great for shading in 2  or more of 1 color in a tattoo .They are very nice bright colors.I have used them on my flower&amp; butterfly tattoos  &amp; worked great!</li>
            <li> I was sorta hoping for more colors but you pay for what u get next time ill be more careful on what I buy thanks</li>
            <li> they are small i was hoping they would be a little bit bigger but the price on them you cant beat i like it</li>

            <li> Good ink (IDK why others have said it&#x27;s horrible, mine doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;smell infected&amp;#34; and it hasn&#x27;t hurt any skin it&#x27;s been in)&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that they&#x27;re SO SMALL.. I wish there was more ink for the price</li>
            <li> The colors held well and you get a good quality ink for a reasonable price i would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> 26 of these were dyed up when i gotten it these, i would not put this ink  into any ones skin , probably better for practice skins , but even with that being said , the ink just ends up satiating, and not want to set, they way it should . This would be an ideal buy  for a beginner but spend the extra money to for quality ink .</li>
            <li> came packaged very well, it was everything that was told would be there, will be ordering from again, very good</li>
            <li> it got here safe and sound and no problem with it, I would surly would need to pay more in the future but in a bigger seize</li>
            <li> these inks you are seeing on the internet without a name are made in china,if it don&#x27;nt have a name and it like 28 colors for 10.00 to 20.00 don&#x27;nt buy. if you see any ink with tattoooo.com don&#x27;nt touch it its, toxic you will end up in the hospital with blood poison or staff infection ,i know i been there and done that about two yrs. ago. buy primz or scream or immortal OR EVEN IRON SAKURA if you want some cheap good ink and safe ink,now if you want some good ink buy iron butter fly, starbrite, intenze,,ect any thing thats around 7.00 to 9.00 a oz, and make sure its not a china knock off,if the price is to cheap you no its not the original ink. lol crazy rick P.S THIS IS&#x27;NT THE INK WITH TATTOOOO.COM ON IT AND IT SAID ITS STERIZIED,SO YOU MIGHT BE ALRIGHT,BUT I BET IT FADES AND FROM THE COMMENTS IT SHITY INK,JUST BECAREFUL WHAT YOU BUY WITHOUT A NAME, BECAUSE IT MIGHT COME BACK AND BITE YOU ON THE ASS WITH ALOT OF RECOLORING WHICH IS  DOUBLE WORK,WHEN YOU CAN BUY SOME LEGIT INK . GOOD LUCK</li>
            <li> theres only enough ink in each tube to do a ladybug and its pretty much done think was thicker than i like it to be</li>
            <li> This was for my son.  A couple of the bottles had leaked a little and it was visible to the eye and should have been noticed in packaging but my son did not care, he is using it anyway.</li>
            <li> Colors are bad, Tattoo turned out like a giant bruise. bleed under un tat skin... Now  they have to find a way to cover this piece of crap....</li>
            <li> This ink is horrible.  I am unfathomably sterile and I have been tattooing for a while now.  Like everything else I use I tested it on myself and got an infection.  I am hoping I don&#x27;t end up with ink poisoning.  It looks horrible.  I used just a tiny bit of one to fill in the silhouette of a couple of birds on my arm and it hurts so bad.  It has puss and scabs all over it and it&#x27;s red all around it.  This is horribly painful and super crappy.  Don&#x27;t ever buy this ink, EVER.  Not worth any of the discount.  This is the absolute last time I will ever buy cheap ink.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I got this ink in, i did not expect much out of it but thought i would give it a chance for the price. THIS INK IS BAD. It looks beautiful when it is first used. But after a few days as the tattoo starts to heal it fades drastically, DO NOT buy this ink!!! Its cheap, and crap. I will now take all my business to \\&quot;world wide tattoo\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This product was recalled and would like money back</li>
            <li> All inks were dry. When I contacted seller, they were gracious enough to send a relacement, but the replacement was exactly the same... all dry, and has since been recalled.</li>
            <li> First off these are great for practice skins, pretty colors gives you room to play. This product is NOT intended for use on human skin. It gets infected (even with the best care) bleeds out and leaves scars. I contacted the seller and got a refund ( I had pictures of the infection and etc)</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff before I tattooed my pecker I got ink poison I got infected do not buy this crappy product</li>
            <li> these inks are the worst i have ever used. they peek off right after the healing process, you would think you didnt get color in the tattoo at all. do not buy!</li>
            <li> Got these for my son and he used every bit of them. He never got any complaints and I would recommend for anyone who likes to do tattoos&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My friend did 3 tats with this ink and all horrible. The fading and infection that these reviews say is b-c of the lead</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably my fault for thinking I would get a decent product for that price, but what I got was simply crap, completely unusable - strait to the trash!</li>
            <li> Turned out to be a rare ski. Disease.  We never used them. Thank God!!</li>
