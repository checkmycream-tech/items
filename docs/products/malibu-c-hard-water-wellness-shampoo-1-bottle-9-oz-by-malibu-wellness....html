            <li>Love this product, works great!</li>

            <li>We will be buying more of this for sure!</li>
            <li>Great fast shipping also!</li>
            <li>I picked this up at my hair dressers and have had better hair since.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the conditioner and use the salon conditioner instead which seems better, but</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>tried many shampoos, nothing worked.</li>
            <li>love love love this stuff.</li>

            <li>Will be needing more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>I tried so many shampoos and conditioners, a shower filter, and nothing seemed to get my hair feeling healthy until I found this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It really works great.</li>
            <li>These are two of my favorite shampoos, but I don&#x27;t want to overuse them.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I use this shampoo 3 or 4 times a week and it takes care of it for the most part without over drying it.</li>
            <li>Have already purchased more.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I use a nice-smelling conditioner right after the Malibu shampoo &amp; conditioner and my hair smells good.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever written (although I should write more since I rely on everyone else&#x27;s!)  </li>
            <li>In a nut shell, this is an awesome shampoo that does exactly what it says it will do, and I will most definitely continue using it.  </li>
            <li>The BEST,  after my shower my heir is sooo clean of the other products that is a reason I buy MALIBU productsI LOVE IT</li>
            <li>It works well leaving my hair easy to manage and does not damage the color of my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and it has made a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This is also sulfate free</li>
            <li>but it still works great and can be used with regular water.</li>
            <li>Also important to me was finding a product that is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>It is also a good idea to get a shower filter to make your water soft to make your hair softer.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean, smooth, and not tangled after washing.</li>
            <li>At first, before I got this shampoo, my hair was greasy and oily, no matter how many times I washed it.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo to get the hard water minerals and gunk from your hair..</li>
            <li>I found this wonderful Malibu Shampoo for people who have well or hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad I discovered it, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the BEST if you have hard water!</li>
            <li>I have very hard water, and this is excellent for removing all the minerals, and rust that my water leaves in my hair.</li>
            <li>I use the Malibu Well Water shampoo and the conditioner together and they really work!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not expensive at all either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shampoo got rid of the chalky build up, makes my hair feel so soft and light</li>
            <li>Noticed immediately after the first use.</li>
            <li>After the first time I used it, I noticed that my hair was much lighter and looked healthier.  </li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s pure, sulfate free...amazing.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is great if you have very hard water.</li>
            <li>so it is gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li>I rated it 4 out of 5 stars only because the smell isn&#x27;t fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has cause a whole host of issues that I never knew could exist.  </li>
            <li>You can really tell a difference in the color and texture of your hair while using this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo once a week and really like the way my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li>Since moving to the country it&#x27;s been hard on my hair because of our well water, I&#x27;ve had so many comments on my hair since using this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Having well water has done a number on my hair but after using this shampoo my hair is back to feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>The product is worth it, however - you&#x27;ll save money buy purchasing the larger bottles.</li>
            <li>We moved to a new state and we are on well water now.</li>
            <li>My hair is finally back to normal after having lived with well water for two straight months.</li>
            <li>I have very hard well water and need to use this kind of shampoo to help with brassiness.</li>
            <li>The water is so hard to the point that many times when I run the shower, all I smell is chlorine.  </li>
            <li>Most people in the US have some degree of hard water anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use the Malibu C Hard Water Wellness conditioner and am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many shampoos, and with my hard water even professional shampoos made my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li>That it would be gentle enough to remove deposits yet now have affect on color.</li>
            <li>The smell is not perfumed and feels natural.</li>
            <li>I even switched from higher end Aveda dry remedy.</li>
            <li>This made my fine hair feel even more brittle, dry &amp; frizzy - even with plenty of expensive conditioner.</li>
            <li>After a vacation where softwater was the norm we realized their hair was much more manageable and finally realized that our hard water was the enemy.  </li>
            <li>My hair became dry and very problematic.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, not dry and holds the color forever now.</li>
            <li>Have been using this shampoo since I received it and seems to be helping to get rid of the yellow that I had in my white hair, Thanks</li>
            <li>I finely found refuge from the hard water with this product.</li>
            <li>I use this because I have well water and grey/white hair- removes yellow and keeps my hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo and the conditioner that goes with it my hair finally feels back to normal.</li>
            <li>In a nut-shell, I was hoping to find a product to get rid of build up on my hair and GENTLY strip away that grime weighing down my hair.  </li>

            <li> Since I have dark hair and dye it pretty often, it&#x27;s hard to tell if it actually got rid of the iron since I can&#x27;t see it, but my hair has definitely gotten much healthier lately and is growing much faster.</li>
            <li> On a side note....I buy this product much less expensively from a popular auction website (come on..</li>
            <li> I had to use and intensive hot oil conditioner on my hair for a week to get it to look at least presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry hair, and though it cleans well it does not totally strip my hair.</li>
            <li> I have always had soft hair and this water turned it into a dry straw-like mess.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is due to price.</li>
            <li> We live in South-Central Texas and the water is off the charts hard....    </li>
            <li> I live in Arizona in an area with extremely hard water and my hair shows the effects.</li>
            <li> again, I have been informed that Well Water Action shampoos &amp; conditioners are now called Hard Water Wellness shampoos &amp; conditioners, and I DID receive the items which were ordered.  </li>
            <li> I have well water, and water filters and clarifying shampoos did nothing to keep my blonde hair from turning green (from chlorine?).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using other clarifying shampoos here and there</li>
            <li> I use this about 5 times a week and switch it up with a moisturizing shampoo/conditioner on the other days.    </li>
            <li> She has been telling other clients about it.</li>
            <li> Even with a softener, well water can be hard on lots of things but especially hair.</li>
            <li> I started noticing the damaging effects of having a water-softener shortly after moving into a home with hard water.</li>
            <li> I am always left with a greasy feeling soap scum in my hair.</li>
            <li> but it did help get the black dye out of my hair</li>
            <li> I live in a city with very hard water, and this stuff works!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive for such a small bottle, so I only use it once a week</li>
            <li> like I just left the salon, and it brought my dull, expensive highlights back to life</li>
            <li> well water used to turn my highlighted hair green.  </li>
            <li> It also dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried sooo many detanglers to try to help (Miracle Sprouts Detangler was horrible).  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t green anymore, and I don&#x27;t have to pay $100 and spend 3 hours at the hairdresser to fix it!</li>
            <li> Had to ditch it after just a few uses!</li>
            <li> My daughters have fine hair that tangles HORRIBLY.  </li>
            <li> I have EXTREEMLY hard water in my town home.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a try after going to a hair salon and having my hair stylist recommend trying it because of my hard water.  </li>
            <li> moved out to the country where the hard water wreaked havoc on my hair.</li>

            <li> Best shampoo to get the hard water minerals and gunk from your hair.. Try it - and feel the difference you never knew even existed!!</li>
            <li> When we moved 3 years ago to our current home, I had to get used to having a well. Even with a softener, well water can be hard on lots of things but especially hair. I picked this up at my hair dressers and have had better hair since. Ordered on Amazon because it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> I use this because I have well water and grey/white hair- removes yellow and keeps my hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> My daughters have fine hair that tangles HORRIBLY.  We live in South-Central Texas and the water is off the charts hard....    I have tried sooo many detanglers to try to help (Miracle Sprouts Detangler was horrible).  After a vacation where softwater was the norm we realized their hair was much more manageable and finally realized that our hard water was the enemy.  I bought this product and it has made a HUGE difference.  I&#x27;ve tried using other clarifying shampoos here and there but they just aren&#x27;t as good.  This is also sulfate free so it is gentle on the hair.  I use this about 5 times a week and switch it up with a moisturizing shampoo/conditioner on the other days.    On a side note....I buy this product much less expensively from a popular auction website (come on..you know which one).</li>
            <li> In a nut-shell, I was hoping to find a product to get rid of build up on my hair and GENTLY strip away that grime weighing down my hair.  Oh, it got rid of the build-up alright, but then it went on to strip my hair of any body, shine, softness or life in it.  I had to use and intensive hot oil conditioner on my hair for a week to get it to look at least presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed by how harshly it treated my hair.  It was dumped ASAP.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo - from someone who uses well water and lives close to Lake Michigan</li>
            <li> My well water used to turn my highlighted hair green.  But this shampoo solved the problem.  I&#x27;m so very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> again, I have been informed that Well Water Action shampoos &amp; conditioners are now called Hard Water Wellness shampoos &amp; conditioners, and I DID receive the items which were ordered.  Sorry for the mistake, but I didn&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Shampoo has a nice smell. It works well leaving my hair easy to manage and does not damage the color of my hair.</li>
            <li> We moved to a new state and we are on well water now. My hair became dry and very problematic. But we travel a lot and every time we were away in a hotel my hair looked awesome. Finally did a lot of searching and realized problem was the well water. Tried everything, and nothing helped. This shampoo is AWESOME and my hairdresser can&#x27;t believe the difference. My hair is soft, not dry and holds the color forever now. She has been telling other clients about it. I don&#x27;t care for the conditioner and use the salon conditioner instead which seems better, but the shampoo. Can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li> I have well water, and water filters and clarifying shampoos did nothing to keep my blonde hair from turning green (from chlorine?). I use the Malibu Well Water shampoo and the conditioner together and they really work! My hair isn&#x27;t green anymore, and I don&#x27;t have to pay $100 and spend 3 hours at the hairdresser to fix it! I rated it 4 out of 5 stars only because the smell isn&#x27;t fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t smell horrible per se, just don&#x27;t expect your hair to smell delicious. I use a nice-smelling conditioner right after the Malibu shampoo &amp; conditioner and my hair smells good.</li>
            <li> Love this product, works great!</li>
            <li> It has helped to take the yellow out of my hair caused by minerals from our well</li>
            <li> My hairdresser was out at her salon and I went home and ordered it on line immediately.  Both the product and service was above my expectation. I Love It!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this drys my hair out horribly and tangles the hell out of it but it did help get the black dye out of my hair</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great if you have very hard water. I noticed a huge difference. I will use this stuff forever. My hair is finally looking the way it is supposed to. It is also a good idea to get a shower filter to make your water soft to make your hair softer. Also, this product smells wonderful. It lathers great and has a great texture. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems to keep my hair from feeling brittle. We have well water so I needed something to help keep out the various elements.</li>
            <li> I keep both this shampoo and conditioner at my mothers house permanently. I can NEVER get all the soap out of my hair with my parents well water. I am always left with a greasy feeling soap scum in my hair. This shampoo &amp; conditioner, however, is the best I have tried thus far (and I have tried a lot!). My hair feels clean, smooth, and not tangled after washing. My hair styles great as well! Very happy!</li>
            <li> The water at my house has a ton of excess iron, so I definitely needed this shampoo. Since I have dark hair and dye it pretty often, it&#x27;s hard to tell if it actually got rid of the iron since I can&#x27;t see it, but my hair has definitely gotten much healthier lately and is growing much faster. It&#x27;s a little expensive for such a small bottle, so I only use it once a week so it lasts longer, but I plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great. I have well water and my hair would turn a yellowish orange color from shampooing. This shampoo helped maintain my color especially my highlights. I would recommend it and the conditioner works well too.</li>
            <li> The BEST,  after my shower my heir is sooo clean of the other products that is a reason I buy MALIBU productsI LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Since moving to the country it&#x27;s been hard on my hair because of our well water, I&#x27;ve had so many comments on my hair since using this product! I love it! Great fast shipping also!</li>
            <li> I have EXTREEMLY hard water in my town home.  The water is so hard to the point that many times when I run the shower, all I smell is chlorine.  I feel like I&#x27;m taking a shower in a pool.  It&#x27;s has cause a whole host of issues that I never knew could exist.  One of those issues has been with my hair.  I decided to give this product a try after going to a hair salon and having my hair stylist recommend trying it because of my hard water.  After the first time I used it, I noticed that my hair was much lighter and looked healthier.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I hate how hard water makes my hair look and feel dirty. This really good stuff and I like the smell!</li>
            <li> Great product that works well. I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Have been using this shampoo since I received it and seems to be helping to get rid of the yellow that I had in my white hair, Thanks</li>
            <li> moved out to the country where the hard water wreaked havoc on my hair. tried many shampoos, nothing worked. gave up and wore it up for over a year because it always looked dirty no matter what i did to it. have only used this one time and my hair is back to being bouncy and shiny. wish i had found this sooner. love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been great to use once a week in-between the Malibu treatments. You can really tell a difference in the color and texture of your hair while using this product. We will be buying more of this for sure!</li>
            <li> I have white hair, so if my water conditioner needs cleaned, my hair will get a brassy tint to it.  All I have to do is use this shampoo and the brassiness is gone.  love it</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time.  We have very hard well water with rust and it keeps my hair color bright.</li>
            <li> Sent to my daughter in NY who has well water. As a hair dresser for 32+ years I knew with the ing . That it would be gentle enough to remove deposits yet now have affect on color. Will be needing more I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> I have very hard water, and this is excellent for removing all the minerals, and rust that my water leaves in my hair.</li>
            <li> I live in a city with very hard water, and this stuff works!  I tried so many shampoos and conditioners, a shower filter, and nothing seemed to get my hair feeling healthy until I found this shampoo.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> My hair is finally back to normal after having lived with well water for two straight months. At first, before I got this shampoo, my hair was greasy and oily, no matter how many times I washed it. After using this shampoo and the conditioner that goes with it my hair finally feels back to normal. It really works great. Highly recommended and it&#x27;s not expensive at all either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not living with hard well water anymore but it still works great and can be used with regular water. Most people in the US have some degree of hard water anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This made my fine hair feel even more brittle, dry &amp; frizzy - even with plenty of expensive conditioner. Had to ditch it after just a few uses!</li>
            <li> Works well in hard water conditions. I have dry hair, and though it cleans well it does not totally strip my hair. One of the best I&#x27;ve found. I even switched from higher end Aveda dry remedy.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever written (although I should write more since I rely on everyone else&#x27;s!)  I am compelled to because of the effectiveness of this product.  I moved into an apartment with very hard water (metallic taste and smell).  I have always had soft hair and this water turned it into a dry straw-like mess.  I was even considering moving.  I bought a shower head filter but it seemed to only remove chlorine.  After just one use, I noticed a difference.  It cleans, softens and restores my hair back to what it used to be.  I can&#x27;t believe the results.  AND it&#x27;s pure, sulfate free...amazing.  This will be my forever shampoo.  Thank you Malibu!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 20 years as a clarifier before dying my hair. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have hard, mineralized well water at my home.  Our water softener recently broke and in practically no time I started feeling a chalky build-up in my hair. I tried rinsing my hair with apple cider vinegar, which did make a difference but also got in my eyes and stung like the dickens.  I thought to myself that there must be a shampoo out there made for people who have hard water, so I searched Amazon, and behold I found this wonderful Malibu Shampoo for people who have well or hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo got rid of the chalky build up, makes my hair feel so soft and light like I just left the salon, and it brought my dull, expensive highlights back to life (the hard water made my highlights dull).  It has a very subtle fruity aroma to it, that I don&#x27;t believe you can even smell on the hair. In a nut shell, this is an awesome shampoo that does exactly what it says it will do, and I will most definitely continue using it.  I am so glad I discovered it, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo once a week and really like the way my hair feels.  I also use the Malibu&#x27;s Swimmer&#x27;s shampoo once a week. These are two of my favorite shampoos, but I don&#x27;t want to overuse them.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have well water that&#x27;s run through a softener and even though we use salt that&#x27;s suppose to remove rust, it doesn&#x27;t remove all of it.  After awhile my hair gets stained with an orange tint.  I use this shampoo 3 or 4 times a week and it takes care of it for the most part without over drying it.</li>
            <li> incredible shampoo. Noticed immediately after the first use. Have already purchased more. Having well water has done a number on my hair but after using this shampoo my hair is back to feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I used this to try and get orange out of my hair. My hair turned orange from hard mineral water when I went camping. It didn&#x27;t really work. It also dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  I have very hard well water and need to use this kind of shampoo to help with brassiness.</li>
            <li> There are advantages to having a well. However, great hair is not one of them. I started noticing the damaging effects of having a water-softener shortly after moving into a home with hard water. My hair became increasingly oily (which was NEVER a problem before) my color and shine suffered as well. I tried 3-4 different types of shampoo and conditioner before I stopped using conditioner all together. Since I didn&#x27;t use conditioner, my hair was often unmanageable. I finely found refuge from the hard water with this product. It&#x27;s organic (100% Vegan), SMELLS GREAT, and my hair is looking and feeling better with each use. The only reason I am giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is due to price. It&#x27;s $10 for a 9oz bottle of the conditioner and another $10 for the shampoo. The product is worth it, however - you&#x27;ll save money buy purchasing the larger bottles.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with the matching conditioner. I live in Arizona in an area with extremely hard water and my hair shows the effects. Using this once a month has helped clarify and chelate the minerals that build up with the use of hard water.</li>
            <li> Almost too good. Be sure to moisturize, condition and pH balance your hair after!</li>
            <li> I just got this product and it works well for my hair. The water I use is hard, and this shampoo helps to keep my hair managable. The smell is not perfumed and feels natural.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many shampoos, and with my hard water even professional shampoos made my hair feel greasy. This stuff is the BEST if you have hard water!</li>
            <li> Finally, I have my hair back! We moved one year ago to an area that has terrible water - hard water that leaves lots of build-up. It was embarrassing to go out in public. I would wear my hair in a pony tail all the time because the build-up in my hair made it look as if it hadn&#x27;t been washed. I have color treated hair (highlighted with foils) and was concerned about finding a daily shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t harm my hair. Also important to me was finding a product that is not tested on animals. This product goes one step further by being vegan! I also use the Malibu C Hard Water Wellness conditioner and am pleased with it. I hope this product is never discontinued and that I can continue to find it on Amazon.com.</li>
