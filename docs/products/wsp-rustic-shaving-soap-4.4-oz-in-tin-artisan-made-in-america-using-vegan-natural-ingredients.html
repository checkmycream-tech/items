            <li>I&#x27;ve used the best American made artisan shave soaps, and WSP soaps are the best of the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s a pleasant surprise, but I assume that as soon as I put on some aftershave...</li>
            <li>Pleasant.</li>
            <li>After months and months of research, I think they&#x27;ve come up with a good soap...a really good soap.  </li>
            <li>It lathered and loaded the brush nicely and gave me a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does smell good, it just doesn&#x27;t smell a lot.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really good smells good also</li>
            <li>Good lather without a lot of effort</li>
            <li>; It&#x27;s a fair price for a good soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find it to be a pleasant scent and very refreshing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>The Tobacco has more cologne type tobacco notes, and the Fougere Noir is a great take on the Fougere scent.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing</li>
            <li>Smooth shave, no irritation, a joy to use.  </li>
            <li>The puck comes in a nice tin with the ingredients listed around the edge of the lid.  </li>
            <li>The important part is the performance- very nice lather which helps to achieve a close shave without drying my skin out or leaving an oily residue.  </li>
            <li>Definitely one of the best shaving soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>the scent is mostly gone.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact</li>
            <li>The scent is soapy, for lack of a better term.  </li>
            <li>In addition, I may add that I&#x27;ve shaved with this product more than once and am quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s outstanding performance.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that this is made in America</li>
            <li>Shaved on top of a layer of LT Molle.</li>
            <li>great product, the smell is great and gives a nice slick shave.</li>
            <li>Clean smelling lathers up nicely with some work.  </li>
            <li>Nice fragrance and lathers very will, good smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>This is quickly becoming one of my go to soaps.</li>
            <li>It is fine.  </li>
            <li>This is excellent shaving soap for the money, it is even more slick than any of my tallow based artisan soaps.  </li>
            <li>But WSP is more slick, protective, and longlasting than the best tallow soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This soap makes a remarkable creamy foam that even with my feather blades leaves my face smooth and baby soft.</li>
            <li>Even towards the end of my 3rd pass, the lather doesn&#x27;t dissipate and continues to provide great glide and protection during the shave.  </li>
            <li>Really fantastic protection.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell, which I would consider light scented.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy having this soap in my rotation.</li>
            <li>WSP calls it &amp;#34;an enticing combination of barbershop aromas which begins with a strong, sweet aftershave followed by aromatic spices and orange zest.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>it lathers super easy.</li>
            <li>Loading is super easy.  </li>
            <li>Develops a rich, slick, creamy lather, perfect for a smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li>As a bonus is comes in a travel friendly tin.</li>
            <li>The Vetiver is a sweet vetiver like Fine Fresh Vetiver Aftershave,</li>
            <li>Barbershop was not a bad scent</li>
            <li>; It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just nothing to write home about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the right amount of water, and a good shaving brush, you get smooth, lasting foam.  </li>
            <li>Lee is super responsive.</li>
            <li>I very much like it!</li>
            <li>The puck is filled to the top (which is nice because it is full, but I wish there were a little extra lip at the top of the tin to make loading a touch easier).  </li>
            <li>Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>Wet Shaving Products tinned soap is as good as any brand that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Smells fresh, just like barbershop should.</li>
            <li>Good laher &amp; nice scent, though I&#x27;m not certain about the traditional barber shop scent.</li>
            <li>The puck takes a little working to get going but the lather is great even in a hot scuttle.</li>
            <li>average lather, great smell, fair price, MESSY.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d call it Barbershop scent, it doesn&#x27;t remind me of Floid, or Clubman, or any particular barbershop scent, but it is a nice, clean, scent that made the shave enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>Works better than shaving cream, but not as good as using oil (Shave Secret).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always excited about trying out a new shaving product.  </li>
            <li>It lathers quick, goes on thick and the shave is close and comfortable, the scent is pleasing without being overwhelming and leaves your face feeling soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>this was given to a first time &amp;#34;double blade razor&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It takes me around 20-30 seconds to get more than enough soap in my brush for a 3 pass shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While this shaving soap creates a wonderful lather, it unfortunately makes my skin burn and tingle.</li>
            <li>This is the first shave soap I&#x27;ve had this reaction to.</li>
            <li>A real bargain, and made in the USA!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite soap, with Williams taking second place now.</li>
            <li>It is very forgiving with the amount of water you add.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>it just smells to much like bar soap for my taste.  </li>
            <li>Very pleasing shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>Shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>: B---&amp;#62; It has a very fresh smell that makes me want to shave daily.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong, and doesn&#x27;t linger around long after you are finished shaving, which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li>The soap is easy to lather and will accept a wide range of water contents.  </li>
            <li>Try WSP and you&#x27;ll forget about other products, even other really good artisan products.</li>
            <li>I believe this is my new go to soap, just have to figure out how to get the puck out of the tin to put inside my bowl.</li>
            <li>I have other popular shaving soaps which I like, but I guess I&#x27;m partial to this one because of</li>
            <li>Very classic and simple scent, definitely worth a try if you like clean, crips and not overly complex scents.</li>
            <li>The rustic term applies, it reminds me of old time barber shop, but once you finish shaving, and rinse your face</li>
            <li>Only 5 seconds of loading produces enough thick, slick, protective, great smelling lather for multiple passes on my face and head.</li>
            <li>The soap is very long lasting, good for many months of daily shaving, it a similar or less expensive price, than other brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other vegan soaps that dissipate fast and aren&#x27;t as protective as tallow.</li>
            <li>I could barely smell it at all while I was shaving, but now, 30 minutes later, am getting spices and orange zest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> its natural look forward to trying other scents</li>
            <li> If the manufacturer could figure out a way to make this meltable, or put it in a little deeper container, this would be my new regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> As long a you do your part and control the water content this soap performs like a dream.</li>
            <li> While on the subject of scent, do not judge the scents of these soaps while smelling them from the can, the scents really present themselves when you lather the soap.  </li>
            <li> You can make an indentation with your finger if you push hard enough, but it is definitely not a cream or &amp;#34;Croap.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Gentlemen;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wet shaving for about ten years now, and have tried many soaps, from Presario and Taylors of Old Bond Street, to absurdly expensive soaps which were disappointing.</li>
            <li> Today, it was Wet Shaving Products (WSP) Rustic Shave Soap in Barbershop scent.  </li>
            <li> would buy again from Wet Shaving Products....</li>
            <li> you will be treated to one of the slickest lathers in the wet shaving world.  </li>
            <li> I think before too long I am going to try out some of their other scents!  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering other scents to try immediately, as well as trying this companies aftershaves.  </li>
            <li> It can be used out of the tin with little mess, closed and put away.</li>

            <li> The soap is the very best that I have ever bought.  Lots of great shaving pleasure.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  I&#x27;ve tried in once after receiving.  Nice fragrance and lathers very will, good smooth shave.  As a bonus is comes in a travel friendly tin.</li>
            <li> Slick and smells like a man should smell. The puck takes a little working to get going but the lather is great even in a hot scuttle.</li>
            <li> Very good shaving soap..American made too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always excited about trying out a new shaving product.  Today, it was Wet Shaving Products (WSP) Rustic Shave Soap in Barbershop scent.  $12.99 for a big 4 oz. tin at Amazon.  This soap is handmade by the folks at WSP.  After months and months of research, I think they&#x27;ve come up with a good soap...a really good soap.  It lathered and loaded the brush nicely and gave me a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jury is still out on the scent.  WSP calls it &amp;#34;an enticing combination of barbershop aromas which begins with a strong, sweet aftershave followed by aromatic spices and orange zest.&amp;#34;  Maybe...it&#x27;s hard to tell.  It does smell good, it just doesn&#x27;t smell a lot.  I like a soap/cream that hits me in the nose as soon as I start loading the brush and hangs on while I&#x27;m shaving.  It&#x27;s a great way to start the day.  This one just doesn&#x27;t do that.  I could barely smell it at all while I was shaving, but now, 30 minutes later, am getting spices and orange zest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a pleasant surprise, but I assume that as soon as I put on some aftershave...even balm...it will be gone.  Perhaps the scent will be stronger as I get down into the tin.  We&#x27;ll see, but for now.  I would give this a solid 4 out of 5 for the soap, 3 out of 5 for the scent.</li>
            <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve ever had will be buying others as well</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my son who rates it as five stars and states that he will never use anything but WSP shaving soap. &amp;#34;Best shaving product ever for people that get ingrown hairs&amp;#34;. Skin feels great too!!!</li>
            <li> I will buy again when needed!</li>
            <li> this was given to a first time &amp;#34;double blade razor&amp;#34; man.....HE LOVES IT!!! would buy again from Wet Shaving Products....great service...great products...happy customers!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing (Sorta like Mr. Fines American Blend aftershave) and it lathers super easy. I didn&#x27;t have to work the brush long before I got a really thick lather. Definitely one of the best shaving soaps I&#x27;ve tried. Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> Very good quality soap. It creates a really good lather and lasts quite a while and smells great!</li>
            <li> This is a great soap from WSP.  Packaging:  The puck comes in a nice tin with the ingredients listed around the edge of the lid.  The puck is filled to the top (which is nice because it is full, but I wish there were a little extra lip at the top of the tin to make loading a touch easier).  Loading:  This is not a super hard soap. You can make an indentation with your finger if you push hard enough, but it is definitely not a cream or &amp;#34;Croap.&amp;#34;  Loading is super easy.  It takes me around 20-30 seconds to get more than enough soap in my brush for a 3 pass shave.  Lather:  Lather is great!  The highpoint of this soap.  It makes great voluminous lather both during a face lather and bowl lather.  It is very forgiving with the amount of water you add.  It is hard to screw this lather up.  It is great!  Even towards the end of my 3rd pass, the lather doesn&#x27;t dissipate and continues to provide great glide and protection during the shave.  After a pass, there is plenty of slickness left behind on my face which I like.  Really fantastic protection.  Scent:  I have the Barbershop scent.  It is fine.  I find it to be a pleasant scent and very refreshing in the morning.  The scent is not too strong, and doesn&#x27;t linger around long after you are finished shaving, which I appreciate.  I think before too long I am going to try out some of their other scents!  Post-Shave:  Post shave is great.  My skin feels refreshed and moisturized after the shave.  The scent doesn&#x27;t linger around and interfere with the scent of any aftershave or cologne I want to use.  I always get a great shave with this shave soap.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is excellent shaving soap for the money, it is even more slick than any of my tallow based artisan soaps.  The soap is easy to lather and will accept a wide range of water contents.  Scent is subjective, I bought four of these soaps (Tobacco, Vetiver, Barbershop, and Fougere Noir) and the only scent that was not excellent to me was Barbershop.  Barbershop was not a bad scent it just smells to much like bar soap for my taste.  While on the subject of scent, do not judge the scents of these soaps while smelling them from the can, the scents really present themselves when you lather the soap.  The Vetiver is a sweet vetiver like Fine Fresh Vetiver Aftershave, The Tobacco has more cologne type tobacco notes, and the Fougere Noir is a great take on the Fougere scent.  It is hard for me to pick a winner between Tobacco and Fougere Noir.  If you are on the fence just buy this soap you will be treated to one of the slickest lathers in the wet shaving world.  As long a you do your part and control the water content this soap performs like a dream.</li>
            <li> Gentlemen;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been wet shaving for about ten years now, and have tried many soaps, from Presario and Taylors of Old Bond Street, to absurdly expensive soaps which were disappointing. I received the above tin in the mail this afternoon, and have just finished shaving with this product as I write.  This is the best soap I have ever used. It lathers quick, goes on thick and the shave is close and comfortable, the scent is pleasing without being overwhelming and leaves your face feeling soft and healthy.  I will be ordering other scents to try immediately, as well as trying this companies aftershaves.  You owe it to yourselves to try this soap.</li>
            <li> I purchased the barbershop scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this shaving soap creates a wonderful lather, it unfortunately makes my skin burn and tingle. It&#x27;s a slow creep, but about a minute in, it builds up to infuriating itch. This is the first shave soap I&#x27;ve had this reaction to.</li>
            <li> Wet Shaving Products tinned soap is as good as any brand that I have tried.  With the right amount of water, and a good shaving brush, you get smooth, lasting foam.  As for the scent(s), pick a scent that pleases you.  The rustic term applies, it reminds me of old time barber shop, but once you finish shaving, and rinse your face the scent is mostly gone.  Very pleasing shaving experience.  The soap is very long lasting, good for many months of daily shaving, it a similar or less expensive price, than other brands.</li>
            <li> great product, the smell is great and gives a nice slick shave. I love the fact its natural look forward to trying other scents</li>
            <li> I like the smell, which I would consider light scented.  The important part is the performance- very nice lather which helps to achieve a close shave without drying my skin out or leaving an oily residue.  I believe this is my new go to soap, just have to figure out how to get the puck out of the tin to put inside my bowl.</li>
            <li> Great soap. A real bargain, and made in the USA!</li>
            <li> Clean smelling lathers up nicely with some work.  It will be in my regular rotation of creams and soaps I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the best American made artisan shave soaps, and WSP soaps are the best of the best. Easiest soap to load, even in hard water. Only 5 seconds of loading produces enough thick, slick, protective, great smelling lather for multiple passes on my face and head. Lather doesn&#x27;t dissipate. I was skeptical of how WSP would compare to tallow based soaps--I&#x27;ve used other vegan soaps that dissipate fast and aren&#x27;t as protective as tallow. But WSP is more slick, protective, and longlasting than the best tallow soaps I&#x27;ve used. WSP Barbershop is the best barbershop scent I&#x27;ve used. Service is excellent too. Shipping is fast. Lee is super responsive. Try WSP and you&#x27;ll forget about other products, even other really good artisan products.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap.  Develops a rich, slick, creamy lather, perfect for a smooth and close shave. The scent is soapy, for lack of a better term.  Pleasant. Is it reminiscent of a barbershop?  No, not to me, but I like it.  This is quickly becoming one of my go to soaps.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap, with Williams taking second place now. This stuff is awesome,easy to lather. Smells fresh, just like barbershop should. I use a boar brush with it.</li>
            <li> WSP makes a great Barbershop scent. Very classic and simple scent, definitely worth a try if you like clean, crips and not overly complex scents. I really enjoy having this soap in my rotation.</li>
            <li> I bought my boyfriend this and it&#x27;s really good smells good also</li>
            <li> Good lather without a lot of effort</li>
            <li> This product is O.K. foams up quite well, has a pleasant aroma and does a great job on my face; smooth!!! In addition, I may add that I&#x27;ve shaved with this product more than once and am quite pleased with the results. It can be used out of the tin with little mess, closed and put away. This soap makes a remarkable creamy foam that even with my feather blades leaves my face smooth and baby soft. I have other popular shaving soaps which I like, but I guess I&#x27;m partial to this one because of it&#x27;s outstanding performance.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that this is made in America and I WANT to like this soap. If the manufacturer could figure out a way to make this meltable, or put it in a little deeper container, this would be my new regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I would grade it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LATHER:  C+ ---&amp;#62; It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;SMELL: B---&amp;#62; It has a very fresh smell that makes me want to shave daily. I DO like it.&lt;br /&gt;COST: C---&amp;#62; It&#x27;s a fair price for a good soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY GRIPE:  Trying to work up a lather in the tin is MESSY. I tried to transfer it to my mug and melt it down... no joy. It does soften, but it does NOT melt well. It is now (with some frustrating effort) in my mug and because I had to &amp;#34;mess around with it&amp;#34;, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: average lather, great smell, fair price, MESSY.</li>
            <li> Works better than shaving cream, but not as good as using oil (Shave Secret).</li>
            <li> Good laher &amp; nice scent, though I&#x27;m not certain about the traditional barber shop scent. I do, however, recommend this product. I very much like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d call it Barbershop scent, it doesn&#x27;t remind me of Floid, or Clubman, or any particular barbershop scent, but it is a nice, clean, scent that made the shave enjoyable.  This stuff lathers like nobody&#x27;s business.  No glycerine needed - just water.  Shaved on top of a layer of LT Molle. Smooth shave, no irritation, a joy to use.  Will be a regular in the rotation.</li>
