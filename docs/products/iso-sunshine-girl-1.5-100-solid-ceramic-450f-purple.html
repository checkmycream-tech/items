            <li>the cord is the best on any flat iron I have ever owned!!!  </li>
            <li>Same great product, same awesome price.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>It kind of pulls your hair if you are a fast straightener person.</li>
            <li>But so far it works good.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron get very hot and does very nice curls as well.</li>
            <li>My sister and I have this type of flat iron and think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, curls easily, straightens quickly and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>but it is the old school kind.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it heats up quick like stated.</li>
            <li>This also gets very hot.</li>
            <li>Can get very hot</li>
            <li>It gets super hot super fast and works better than any chi or revlon</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;m using this that uses the moisture in your hair instead of frying it its grown and its so much healthier!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend it only if you need a straightener asap for a good price â˜†</li>
            <li>so it is definitely worth getting.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be as good as my other one since they both go to 450 degrees</li>
            <li>This flat iron does the Job, I own it for 6 months</li>
            <li>Heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>this time it was only 25!my fave straightener, definitely a better buy then</li>
            <li>I love using it, would definitely refer someone to buy it.</li>
            <li>it gets really hot just how I like it.</li>
            <li>Everything came exactly as the seller put it.  </li>
            <li>cord is long enough and the swivel really helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The price was definitely a great buying factor.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I paid $100 in the mall almost 4 years ago and it still works great, just getting a little short in the cord</li>
            <li>- it works looks really well</li>
            <li>Absolutely serves it&#x27;s purpose</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s turned out to be better than expected.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I bought the same flat iron in the mall for WAY more!</li>
            <li>the heat does not go high enough to straighten my hair and my hair is easy to straighten.</li>
            <li>Good deal for a flat iron that works like other pricier ones.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a really good straightner at a reasonable price,&lt;br /&gt;this is the straightner for you, it quickly heats up and purple is a&lt;br /&gt;fabulous color, can&#x27;t ever go wrong with that.</li>
            <li>Decent flatiron for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>It really brings my natural kinky hair straight like a relaxer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit disheartened because I read the reviews before deciding on this particular seller.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Great product works exactly as expected and my hair has grown (it usually takes my hair forever to grow an inch)</li>
            <li>I only paid $29 for this and it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I was under the impression that I was receiving a NEW, unused product.</li>
            <li>I got my straightener within the shipping days that was estimated, along with everything being neatly intact and brand new.  </li>
            <li>its easy to use doesnt burn or destroy your hair.</li>
            <li>If you insist on buying from them, proceed with caution and understand that there is a possibility of getting a clearly used/faulty straightener.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>makes a natural look.</li>
            <li>Works well; no issues so far.</li>
            <li>Other straighteners have not been powerful enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had bought this product at a kiosk brand new several years ago.</li>
            <li>and this is the only iron that I have found that works and stay straight for several days -</li>
            <li>I bought the same exact one only in a different color</li>
            <li>With it being so much less in price than the ones professionals use in salons, I was hesitant at first.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an all ceramic flat iron that got hotter than my old one and this one did it.</li>
            <li>Heats fast and works very well for my hard to handle hair</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend to be careful and unplug when not in use and HEAT PROTECTANT!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this same flat iron in malls for over $200.</li>
            <li> No issues, just wondering if I should buy a 2nd one since I don&#x27;t know how long a flat iron is supposed to last.</li>
            <li> I can say that this flat iron works for my hair</li>
            <li> I have long (Asian)hair with medium thickness.</li>
            <li> I have thick natural hair with waves and if this product can straighten my hair(It can)</li>
            <li> I usually set the dial half way to 450 and that seems to be just the right heat setting for my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just what I expected!</li>
            <li> When I looked at the straightener, the plates were uneven and would not completely close when you clamped down on it.</li>
            <li> If your hair is wavy or curly and holds water then this is the iron for you - nothing that is less that 450 degrees will work as well</li>
            <li> Arrived in an little over a week.</li>
            <li> I seen this in the mall a few years ago.</li>
            <li> never looks dull when I use it.</li>
            <li> but it seems to dull my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I expect at least 3 years out of this one as well.</li>
            <li> does however heat up slow, it reaches the highest temperature with an estimated 10 minute waiting period.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and semi-wavy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t intend to buy a used or broken one.</li>
            <li> it was too expensive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I requested a refund immediately.</li>
            <li> i have crazy nappy curly&lt;</li>

            <li> I have long (Asian)hair with medium thickness. I can say that this flat iron works for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;I find that it does straighten my hair with ease and that it does heat up to 450F like it claims.&lt;br /&gt;It does however heat up slow, it reaches the highest temperature with an estimated 10 minute waiting period.&lt;br /&gt;The cord is long enough and the swivel really helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The price was definitely a great buying factor.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  Works great and the cord is the best on any flat iron I have ever owned!!!  no kink no twist.  Heats fast and works very well for my hard to handle hair</li>
            <li> I thought it would be as good as my other one since they both go to 450 degrees but it seems to dull my hair.  I got it to save money and wish I would of just spend another $30 and just got amika that I had before.</li>
            <li> I have had this for some time and still works great! This also gets very hot. Love the cute color too.</li>
            <li> I only paid $29 for this and it was worth it. I was looking for an all ceramic flat iron that got hotter than my old one and this one did it. I love the purple color too.</li>
            <li> amazing how it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair and keeps it looking silky and shinny. makes a natural look. i like the way it glides through your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this same flat iron in malls for over $200. I have always bought these online for a fraction of the price. When my last one quit on my after 3 years of daily use, I purchased this one. Same great product, same awesome price. Absolutely serves it&#x27;s purpose and I expect at least 3 years out of this one as well.</li>
            <li> Great product. It really brings my natural kinky hair straight like a relaxer. So I&#x27;m loving that. It&#x27;s turned out to be better than expected. With it being so much less in price than the ones professionals use in salons, I was hesitant at first. But I decided to give it a try. Works well; no issues so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good price for a \\&quot;iso straightener\\&quot; but it is the old school kind. It kind of pulls your hair if you are a fast straightener person. The grip on the straightener left me a sorta blister rash on my index finger. I don&#x27;t really recommend it only if you need a straightener asap for a good price â˜†</li>
            <li> Works Great. It has been a year since I have bought it and it still works.</li>
            <li> When I received the straightener, I was a bit weary of the packaging it was in because the box was just magnetized, and the inside of the box had fingerprints all inside of it. I was under the impression that I was receiving a NEW, unused product. When I looked at the straightener, the plates were uneven and would not completely close when you clamped down on it. Needless to say I requested a refund immediately. I&#x27;m a bit disheartened because I read the reviews before deciding on this particular seller. If you insist on buying from them, proceed with caution and understand that there is a possibility of getting a clearly used/faulty straightener.</li>
            <li> Arrived in an little over a week. once i received it there was glue on the plates of the iron which does not come off. I think if you gonna sell a product make sure its in good shape before selling and sending it to customers. Otherwise it heats up quick like stated.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I bought the same flat iron in the mall for WAY more! I searched on Amazon after my dog knocked mine over too many times and the plates started coming out. I&#x27;m thinking of buying one as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> the heat does not go high enough to straighten my hair and my hair is easy to straighten. you get what you pay!</li>
            <li> Love this straightener. It heats up quickly, curls easily, straightens quickly and gets the job done. My hair is thick and semi-wavy so it is definitely worth getting.</li>
            <li> I got my straightener within the shipping days that was estimated, along with everything being neatly intact and brand new.  Everything came exactly as the seller put it.  This straightener was over $100 when it was bought for me at a kiosk in the mall.  I had it for 5 years and it worked perfectly until I dropped it and cracked the ceramic part.  So I went on amazon and found it only for $20. love it, just perfect for my frizzy, curly Polynesian hair.</li>
            <li> Great product works exactly as expected and my hair has grown (it usually takes my hair forever to grow an inch) but since I&#x27;m using this that uses the moisture in your hair instead of frying it its grown and its so much healthier!! And it works perfect with every type of hair and does any style beautifully!</li>
            <li> It gets super hot super fast and works better than any chi or revlon i&#x27;ve ever used!  I loved it so much I bought a second one for my best friend</li>
            <li> This flat iron does the Job, I own it for 6 months and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier. I order another to give my mom as a mother&#x27;s day present!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year and it still works amazingly!!!!! Heats up within 45 seconds too!!!! Can get very hot so I highly recommend to be careful and unplug when not in use and HEAT PROTECTANT!</li>
            <li> Our daughters love it.  Both have long,thick, wavy hair.  Other straighteners have not been powerful enough.&lt;br /&gt;They are impressed that the straightening lasts.&lt;br /&gt;This straightener also allows them to get the job done quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Our neighbor&#x27;s daughter had this one and allowed them to try it.&lt;br /&gt;It, then, ended up at the top of my daughter&#x27;s Christmas list.&lt;br /&gt;My neighbor bought this last year at a stand at the mall.&lt;br /&gt;We ended up paying 1/3 of that price.</li>
            <li> I have thick natural hair with waves and if this product can straighten my hair(It can) then I recommend it to all looking for a great product , for a great price.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job and as describes.</li>
            <li> Came well packaged!! Love this product!</li>
            <li> I had bought this product at a kiosk brand new several years ago. It worked great and then broke. I bought the same exact one only in a different color and when it arrived it looked used and one of the plates was wobbly and almost falling out of place. I didn&#x27;t intend to buy a used or broken one. So this particular item may have been defective, however the one I had bought years ago was wonderful and I will probably buy one again but not online.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift, all i can say is that she loves it.</li>
