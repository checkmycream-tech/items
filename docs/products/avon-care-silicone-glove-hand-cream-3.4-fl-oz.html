            <li>Excellent product and very fast shipping!</li>

            <li>much better product that is not greasy or scented is O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream.</li>
            <li>Love this hand lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love this Avon glove.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Will NOT be able to use this.  </li>
            <li>I remember it being better some years ago.  </li>
            <li>Why I tried it on my feet, I don&#x27;t know, maybe out of desperation, but I&#x27;m soooo glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I would think Vaseline would be better, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>My hands stay much cleaner plus, my hands feel as though they have had they a conditioning treatment - very nice.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this hand cream, it really keeps your hands moist.  </li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t feel grease or has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>Then I slathered more on &amp; wore footies during the day, just to make sure my feet stayed nice &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li>Did the foot fairly exchange my feet for new ones?  </li>
            <li>Ours smelled fine.</li>
            <li>So, it came quickly and I was satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent&#x27;s might be good sales tool but there is usually no research into their effects on our health.</li>
            <li>the cream has already absorbed to make it easy for me to handle papers and continue my day, while my hands still feel softer and better for having used it.</li>
            <li>To prevent it, I smooth on this lotion and wipe around my cuticles and under my nails.  </li>
            <li>...wish it was avail in a light floral scent.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel as smooth as velvet.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and is not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Great for a stocking stuffer since the holidays are rapidly approaching.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not kidding, this is fantastic for feet.  </li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t feel I need a professional pedicure, my feet look that good.</li>
            <li>I got this hand cream at my local dollar store and ended up loving it!  </li>
            <li>I work with my hands and this cream is really cool</li>
            <li>I have a closet full of foot creams, some recommended by doctors, and not one of them can compare to Silicone Glove.  </li>
            <li>my life, I wondered how people can possibly have good looking, uncallused feet.  </li>
            <li>I got the product due to all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for dry skin in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly and was packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the feel of soft smooth hands.</li>
            <li>I wash my hands first thing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to last through how many washings?  </li>
            <li>but now they are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado and read a magazine review about this product from a doctor who had recently moved here and used this product and liked it.</li>
            <li>My hands feel better after using it and does not slow me  by having to &amp;#34;wait&amp;#34; until it  possible to handle an item.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t believe my friend when she told me about this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Noooooo more dry, cracked, bleeding hands!!!  </li>
            <li>I rated this product highly because it really stays on your hands</li>
            <li>Size is good to fit in my purse, which is why I bought it, not too small to be gone in a minute but small enough to fit.</li>
            <li>It would be just decent of Avon to declare on the package that the cream is scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went back to the dollar store and bought several more.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I use it for my face, it never clogs pores or causes breakouts and definitely helps get rid of dry skin fast :)</li>
            <li>Baby butt soft!!  </li>
            <li>Very good product for the drying cold weather.</li>
            <li>I heard somewhere about different brands of lip balm actually having ingredients in them that dry your lips so that you have to use more of their product.  </li>
            <li>Avon Silicone Glove keeps my hands protected so they stay soft and supple.</li>
            <li>After using it each time it leaves my hands feeling soft</li>
            <li>, they keep my hands quite soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Overnight, they were as soft as a baby&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I always wanted to have a professional pedicure, but I just couldn&#x27;t bear to show my feet.  </li>
            <li>I love the thick richness of this product.</li>
            <li>As long as I have to use so much hand lotion, I might as well buy some store brand stuff at Walgreens or somewhere.</li>
            <li>It has a light, non-offensive scent - lotions usually cause my hands to itch</li>
            <li>Hardly any fragrance, not oily, light feel.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I will go for several days without using this treatment, and my feet remain soft.  </li>
            <li>Even though I don&#x27;t see dry, white calluses any more, about twice a week, I&#x27;ll use a coarse emery board where they form, then rinse my feet &amp; work in a little Silicone</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Great hand cream. The best hand cream EVER</li>
            <li> I leave this by my gardening bench and apply the lotion every time I put on my gardening gloves.  It acts as a shield against dirt.  No matter what gloves I use, some  dirt creeps in under my nails.  To prevent it, I smooth on this lotion and wipe around my cuticles and under my nails.  My hands stay much cleaner plus, my hands feel as though they have had they a conditioning treatment - very nice. Yes, I use it on my toes, too.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this hand cream, it really keeps your hands moist.  I work with paper all day and my hands dry out to the point of cracking.  Anyway, this price was better than from an Avon Representative, so I went for it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream out there! It is so soft and smooth and leaves your hands filling great!</li>
            <li> Great product. I work with harsh cleaning chemicals and my hands were like sand paper. Avon Silicone Glove keeps my hands protected so they stay soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I love the thick richness of this product. This is NOT a runny thin product. It is thick and luxurious.</li>
            <li> Best hand lotion EVER! ...wish it was avail in a light floral scent.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t believe my friend when she told me about this product.  It&#x27;s quite impressive that this inexpensive hand cream from Avon actually HEALED my eczema on the tips of my fingers and the backs of my hands, and did a better job of it than my prescription cream.  Noooooo more dry, cracked, bleeding hands!!!  Man, I wish I found it 20 years ago!!  Hail to Avon!  :-)[[ASIN:B00538U9QO Avon Basics Silicone Glove Hand Cream 3.4 fl oz]]</li>
            <li> Size is good to fit in my purse, which is why I bought it, not too small to be gone in a minute but small enough to fit. Also it doesn&#x27;t feel grease or has a strong smell. If my skin feels dry i apply some and I&#x27;m good to go for hours!</li>
            <li> The Avon Basics Silicone Glove Hand Cream is heavily scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no mention of this fact in the description. For this reason it gets only 2 stars. If it was not scented the cream would get about 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent&#x27;s might be good sales tool but there is usually no research into their effects on our health. Also, scents can trigger asthma and allergies. It would be just decent of Avon to declare on the package that the cream is scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A much better product that is not greasy or scented is O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Always order from amazon. Makes your skin feel as smooth as velvet. Its a purse staple.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> S.t.i.n.k.s. Oh my goodness. I had to hold my breath when applying.  I planned on using this for my son&#x27;s eczema but neither of us could stand the smell. I dared not try it on him. Haven&#x27;t gotten around to returing.</li>
            <li> Love this hand lotion.  I live in Colorado and read a magazine review about this product from a doctor who had recently moved here and used this product and liked it. Keeps your hands moisturized even after hand washing if used on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this. I love this Avon glove. After using it each time it leaves my hands feeling soft which is what I try to aim for because I feel they are dry 24-7. Overall it&#x27;s an excellent product. My second container of it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Not crazy about the smell but it&#x27;s great to use before cleaning. I do feel that I need to reapply often but then again I do that anyways.</li>
            <li> I rated this product highly because it really stays on your hands and you do not have to reapply it a lot.  It has a light scent and is not too overpowering.  My hands tend to get irritated and very dry in the winter and this product does the trick.  This product arrived quickly and was packaged very well.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the feel of soft smooth hands.</li>
            <li> what I love best about this hand cream is how well it works on heels as well as hands</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it for my face, it never clogs pores or causes breakouts and definitely helps get rid of dry skin fast :) Hardly any fragrance, not oily, light feel. Great for hands or face.</li>
            <li> Avon Silicone Glove Hand Cream lives up to my expectation and it&#x27;s reputation.  Very good product for the drying cold weather.</li>
            <li> This really helps my husbands hands in the winter and it has a pleasant smell!</li>
            <li> OMGosh!  SMELLS AWFUL.  I got the product due to all the great reviews.  I wish I had listened to a 1-star review that also said it smelled terrible.  Will NOT be able to use this.  I thought the odor would maybe go away after it soaked in.  Nope -- had to wash my hands.</li>
            <li> I have looked all around for reviews of this product and see that a lot of the good reviews are from 2011 or so.  Not all.  But I wonder if they have changed the formula of this product? I remember it being better some years ago.  We got some in at work because we wash our hands a lot and we keep a tube on the counter (we work with money a lot).  I don&#x27;t find it smells bad (maybe there were some tubes that go bad? Hand lotion can do that if it gets heated up, it can curdle, I guess.  Ours smelled fine. But, as for protecting my hands when I wash them, no way.  I wash my hands first thing, they are very dry, and then I put this lotion on.  It&#x27;s supposed to last through how many washings?  Nope.  A minute or two later my hands are dry again.  And then again in 15-20 minutes.  And when I wash my hands again?  Forget it.  I heard somewhere about different brands of lip balm actually having ingredients in them that dry your lips so that you have to use more of their product.  I wonder if this is happening here.  We are on our last tube of this stuff.  Not going to get anymore.  As long as I have to use so much hand lotion, I might as well buy some store brand stuff at Walgreens or somewhere.</li>
            <li> i have bought this before for a friend who works at a gas station his hands used to be rough and dry but now they are soft and smooth. I would highly recommend this product you just need very little to rub into hands</li>
            <li> I got this hand cream at my local dollar store and ended up loving it!  It works well to moisturize my hands when they get ashy and it works wonders on my feet.  Baby butt soft!!  At $1, how can you beat that?  I went back to the dollar store and bought several more.  Great for a stocking stuffer since the holidays are rapidly approaching.  It has a light, non-offensive scent - lotions usually cause my hands to itch but this one doesn&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t say hypo-allergenic on the tube.</li>
            <li> This hand cream always alleviates any dryness of my hands. My hands feel better after using it and does not slow me  by having to &amp;#34;wait&amp;#34; until it  possible to handle an item.  By the time I  replace the cap and put it back in my desk drawer the cream has already absorbed to make it easy for me to handle papers and continue my day, while my hands still feel softer and better for having used it.</li>
            <li> Product was a known entity when I bought it.  Very good product.  Bought as a Christmas gift for all of the women in my life.</li>
            <li> I work with my hands and this cream is really cool, they keep my hands quite soft and hydrated. So, it came quickly and I was satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding, this is fantastic for feet.  I have a closet full of foot creams, some recommended by doctors, and not one of them can compare to Silicone Glove.  Why I tried it on my feet, I don&#x27;t know, maybe out of desperation, but I&#x27;m soooo glad I did.  I would think Vaseline would be better, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Bag Balm is like Vaseline, but it has a bad odor, and it didn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slathered Silicone Glove on my feet and wore footies overnight.  The difference in the a. m. was astounding.  What happened to those dry, callused feet!  Did the foot fairly exchange my feet for new ones?  Overnight, they were as soft as a baby&#x27;s.  Then I slathered more on &amp; wore footies during the day, just to make sure my feet stayed nice &amp; soft.  Sometimes I will go for several days without using this treatment, and my feet remain soft.  I cannot imagine why a hand cream beats any foot cream I&#x27;ve used, but it does.  It&#x27;s not greasy, and it will wash out of your footies, unlike Vaseline or Bag Balm.  Even though I don&#x27;t see dry, white calluses any more, about twice a week, I&#x27;ll use a coarse emery board where they form, then rinse my feet &amp; work in a little Silicone Glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my life, I wondered how people can possibly have good looking, uncallused feet.  I wondered what everyone was using.  I always wanted to have a professional pedicure, but I just couldn&#x27;t bear to show my feet.  Now, I don&#x27;t feel I need a professional pedicure, my feet look that good.</li>
            <li> You can actually feel it add a moisturizing layer of protection to your hands. I really like it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lotions and hand creams, including quite pricey ones, and this one is the best around!  If you have a problem with dry hands, this is the one!</li>
            <li> Recommended by Dermotologist!  Works like a charm on my dry hands!</li>
            <li> Keep this with me wherever I go. It is wonderful for dry skin in a dry climate. Climate getting drier and drier.</li>
