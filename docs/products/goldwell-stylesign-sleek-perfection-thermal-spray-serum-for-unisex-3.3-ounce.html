            <li>This stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair straight, frizz free and smells great.</li>
            <li>I had read positive reviews about this product and thought I&#x27;d try it, but it just didn&#x27;t work as good as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>I wish they could make it fragrance free tho</li>
            <li>This is a light weight product that my hair stylist used on me.  </li>
            <li>I am very enthusiastic with my flat iron and need a product like this to protect my hair from myself.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It sprays on as a very fine mist, and absolutely shortened the time it took to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Buy this and have fun.  </li>
            <li>One of the rare straighteners that worked for me.</li>
            <li>I use hair chi silk infusion after I flat iron and my hair ends up amazing.</li>
            <li>i spray it on first and my hair smooths right out.</li>
            <li>Try the Goldwell Straightening Balm also I use that first and the finish with the Spray Serum.  </li>
            <li>hey, but dont spray too much!</li>
            <li>I feel better about using my Flat Iron with this products.</li>
            <li>I love this spray when using my flat iron.</li>
            <li>...results superior to any other smoothing product I&#x27;ve tried, by far.  </li>
            <li>Spray on dry or wet hair before straightening or blow drying and leaves hair looking shiny and ends of hair looking healthy!!</li>
            <li>It almost lets you know how much is too much.  </li>
            <li>Before using this product my hair was straight but not sleek after staightening.  </li>
            <li>The product moisturizes your hair so you get sleek, straight hair.</li>
            <li>and I was amazed my hair stayed straight after straight ironing it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, the product itself works very well, i just wont be ordering it from these people anymore.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair bone straight for days.</li>
            <li>I get compliments everyday on how healthy my hair looks, it is shiny and smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>A necessity for smooth flat ironed hair.</li>
            <li>I love how it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, make it greasy feeling or crunchy.  </li>
            <li>Left it very soft and smooth and smells lovely - a little like grapefruit.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and this product leaves is smooth and silky looking.  </li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in my curly, frizzy hair while I blow dry and use a straightening iron.</li>
            <li>My hair is finally silky, healthy, and lasts till next shampoo.</li>
            <li>I see the most dramtaic difference when I blow out with a round brush</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Anyway I am Hispanic, older but a young 55 year old woman with a whole lot of Cha Cha left.  </li>
            <li>The cap doesn&#x27;t secure tightly, the pump gets stuck, and it leaks.</li>
            <li>My hair is left feeling soft,  silky, and not at all greasy (unless you use way too much).  </li>
            <li>It does not spray but mists, so that it is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Was recommended by a professional.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have straight hair and when i flat iron it always makes it dry and brittle.</li>

            <li> Want Flat Hair straightening serum</li>
            <li> I use it when blowing my hair out with a brush, using a flat iron, or curling iron.  </li>
            <li> My hair never burns or breaks when I flat iron it.</li>
            <li> This was probably because my hair was dry especially in the front.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair and this product really does the trick.</li>
            <li> Just minimal touch-up the next day.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my hair dry</li>
            <li> The to layer of my hair is always frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> I need a little something to calm my hair down because my hair is so thick, did just the trick.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stink either though, just really not my preference.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair wet at all like other thermal sprays.</li>
            <li> Be careful with spraying on roots if you have oily roots!</li>
            <li> Right when i received this product I knew something was wrong, the bottle was all taped up and seemed a little lighter that it should have been.</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time finding heat protectant products for my hair that actually worked.  </li>
            <li> about half the price of the hair salon.</li>
            <li> When i opened the bottle I came to notice that indeed it was half empty!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it did not have that heavy smell.</li>
            <li> One of the very few beauty products I&#x27;ve tried that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually use &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m switching to this!</li>
            <li> the pump was broken on the bottle</li>

            <li> REALLY think this is a GREAT Product!! I usually use &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m switching to this! Thank you Goldwell!! Try the Goldwell Straightening Balm also I use that first and the finish with the Spray Serum.  I feel better about using my Flat Iron with this products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it a 5, but although it works great, I didn&#x27;t find anything really special about it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a better serum</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best thermal protection spray I&#x27;ve ever used. It sprays on as a very fine mist, and absolutely shortened the time it took to straighten my hair. Left it very soft and smooth and smells lovely - a little like grapefruit. The only downside is it is a TINY bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> It Works and smells great.  I am a fan of Soya Want Flat Hair straightening serum but now I am \\&quot;Torn Between Two Lovers\\&quot;, : )  .  I like them both. The edge that this one has is the smell and the sprayer or spray nozzle.  It does not spray but mists, so that it is soft and manageable.  You will see when you work it.  It almost lets you know how much is too much.  And did I mention the smell?  ha ha  Anyway I am Hispanic, older but a young 55 year old woman with a whole lot of Cha Cha left.  Buy this and have fun.  -  Glo</li>

I spray it on my hair dry but also the following days when my hair needs a curling iron or flat iron touch up.  Love it!</li>

            <li> This stuff is perfect for flat ironing your hair! I  love it.</li>

When i opened the bottle I came to notice that indeed it was half empty!!&lt;br /&gt;Now, the product itself works very well, i just wont be ordering it from these people anymore.</li>
            <li> The cap doesn&#x27;t secure tightly, the pump gets stuck, and it leaks. This is my second bottle and they&#x27;ve both done that. I love the product itself, though. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair wet at all like other thermal sprays.</li>
            <li> One of the very few beauty products I&#x27;ve tried that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  My hair is left feeling soft,  silky, and not at all greasy (unless you use way too much).  I use it when blowing my hair out with a brush, using a flat iron, or curling iron.  I see the most dramtaic difference when I blow out with a round brush...results superior to any other smoothing product I&#x27;ve tried, by far.  I hope they never stop making this.</li>
            <li> Being African American I have always had a hard time finding heat protectant products for my hair that actually worked.  I have been using this for over a year or maybe even 2 now.

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell that great.  Doesn&#x27;t stink either though, just really not my preference.  I guess I prefer a serum rather than a spray.</li>
            <li> best product ever. I wish it did not have that heavy smell.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have straight hair and when i flat iron it always makes it dry and brittle. The to layer of my hair is always frizzy and dry. But NOT if i use this. i spray it on first and my hair smooths right out. I get compliments everyday on how healthy my hair looks, it is shiny and smooth and soft. I use hair chi silk infusion after I flat iron and my hair ends up amazing.</li>
