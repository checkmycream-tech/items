            <li>It is everything you could ask for in a good bronzing lotion.</li>
            <li>Gives a good tan and glow thumbs up</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>and also when you get out of the tanning bed you still smell good.</li>
            <li>I already had good color, but got even darker.</li>
            <li>Smelled good and worked well.  </li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant smell and goes easy and feels silky on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Really great lotion it has made me super tan!!</li>
            <li>This lotion is defiantly for a more experienced tanner.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Seemed more like a self tanner, however, was great on legs at the beach.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion!</li>
            <li>This lotion is pretty great!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells!</li>
            <li>that works much better!</li>
            <li>#1 -- make sure you wash your hands well after applying it, or as soon as you get out of the tanning bed.!  </li>
            <li>This is the first jwoww lotion that I am really impressed with!</li>
            <li>This lotion IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>And while it smells amazing, the scent doesn&#x27;t even stay with you through a 15 minute tan session, let alone all day.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and tans every spot on your body.</li>
            <li>I thought this would get me nice and tan</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t liked any of Jwoww&#x27;s lotions until now.</li>
            <li>Liked the lotion.  </li>
            <li>Works great and quickly</li>
            <li>You have to be very good about rubbing it in all the way and not over doing it, also washing hands afterwards because it does have so much self tanner in it.</li>
            <li>Gives you very good color and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth product, but you need to wash your hands immediately after tanning because the lotion will leave stains between your fingers!</li>
            <li>This product is by far the BEST tanning lotion ive ever used.</li>
            <li>This lotion is by far the best I have used.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This is by far our salons favorite and best selling lotion.</li>
            <li>The seller was great, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It smeller amazing before, but does have a strong after tan odor.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love an would recommend this lotion to all my girlfriends.</li>
            <li>I LOVE JWOW..........</li>
            <li>I think the lotion is OK</li>
            <li>DHA is self tanner, this is going to build more color on top of your tan.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Seems like more of a sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>I was sure to rub it in well and still ended up with streaks on my legs.</li>
            <li>Wat more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>its at the top of my favorite tanning lotions and trust me</li>
            <li>I love the way it works...</li>
            <li>After 3 uses in 3 days I didn&#x27;t notice any better color or softer skin than with my cheap-y lotions.</li>
            <li>I love it?  </li>
            <li>The scent is fabulous!</li>
            <li>and I have tried many many lotions.</li>
            <li>And ive also tried kardashian glow and girlfriend sexy.</li>
            <li>The bronzer is phenomenal, I have never been orange from it.</li>
            <li>I had results within 4 hours, and they were quite stunning.</li>
            <li>any tanner knows, you will (for the most part) get better results from a salon rather than a gym.</li>
            <li>So, thus, the lovely dovey feeling towards this lotion.</li>
            <li>It appears that I missed a bit around the top of my foot area, because I am literally talking a 2-3 shade difference between my lower shin/ankle and my foot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a self tanner than a bronzing tanning lotion...</li>
            <li>ive used many tanning lotions working at a tanning salon and all.</li>
            <li>I love the shimmer it gives.</li>
            <li>Love the color it gives.</li>
            <li>Not a terrible after smell like some tanning lotions leave.</li>
            <li>I thought it would hopefully become my go-to favorite.</li>
            <li>The smell could be better --  </li>
            <li>I believe it would be a much better lotion if it did.</li>
            <li>the $40 I paid for it was okay.</li>
            <li>It smelled really nice IMO, like pear/vanilla perfume, but light, it wasn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>Absolutley love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wash your hands after you apply.</li>
            <li>At first I really loved this lotion.</li>
            <li>Its definitely worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>This product is nothing special!</li>
            <li>The original tanner is much better.</li>
            <li>Leaves you with a deep golden perfect tan!!!</li>
            <li>Easily stains the palms.</li>
            <li>My two main needs for a good lotion.</li>
            <li>This product has a strong after tan odor.</li>
            <li>It leaves no orange streaks and the after tan smell isnt strong.</li>
            <li>But seriously, really strong.</li>
            <li>Also, this leaves a STRONG odor after you get out of the bed.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft, smells like a vanilla bergmont mix..soft and smooth, I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it cheaper on Amazon instead of paying full price at the salon.</li>
            <li>but after I got the hang of it was just fine.</li>
            <li>Not only did I feel darker after the first use, but it smelled great too!</li>
            <li>I went strictly off the reviews from amazon and purchased a whole bottle before trying a sample, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper han buying in a salon and works great super fast, just make sure to rinse hands after applying....</li>
            <li>I am huge fan of One &amp; Done</li>
            <li>The initial smell was great- light and fruity, not overly perfumed-</li>
            <li>Gave me great color, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it turning my hands orange if I forgot to wash them after applying.</li>
            <li>The J Woww 50x bronzer, is amazing tho and that really builds up my tan and helps maintain my color.</li>
            <li>Great bronzer, I can see a color difference after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel silky smooth</li>
            <li>I got great color from this lotion, and was even darker the next day.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product!</li>
            <li>This product is good, has a light clean scent, makes ur skin very soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Super strong DHA smell.</li>
            <li>But you can really smell the dha a few hrs in, so if you don&#x27;t mind that and love a lot of bronzer in a lotion its great!</li>
            <li>This lotion is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Overall though this gave me fantastic color and smelled good.</li>
            <li>Jwoww Wedding White tanning lotion is by far one of the best lotions I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>This is by far every bit amazing as it claims to be.</li>
            <li>You will smell like straight self tanner after you tan and it will get progressively more smelly until you get a chance to shower.</li>
            <li>I loved the  wedding white lotion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t pay full price for lotions ever</li>
            <li>It is good for a quick blast of color for a special occasion or something, but you can&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
            <li>is seriously the best lotion ever.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love love the Jwoww Wedding White!!</li>
            <li>it smells great and keeps me dark.</li>
            <li>It has a strong vanilla scent that I don&#x27;t care for and it is very oily.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion!!!</li>
            <li>But I would buy again because of how it makes skin feel and its a WHITE bronzer which is fabulous!!</li>
            <li>Favorite JWOWW lotion by far is One and Done</li>
            <li>The second time I used it I made sure to blend it in, this time I was really surprised at how nice of color I got.</li>
            <li>kind of have a love/hate relationship with this stuff but prefer the others over Wedding White.</li>
            <li>The lotion is pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have tried Karadashin Glow lotions, many from Designer Skin, all Jwoww lotions and I must say that this is by far my fav.</li>
            <li>I love this so much and color comes in fast.</li>
            <li>it smells great, is soft, not oily, and is a WHITE bronzer!</li>
            <li>When I was at school people noticed right away, saying how tan I was.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t rub the lotion in just right your color will streak.</li>
            <li>Right then and there I convinced myself I was going to purchase a bottle.</li>
            <li>anyone using a bronzer should know to wash there hands right after regardless.</li>
            <li>It was strong, and I am hoping something I can learn to live with after time.</li>
            <li>You get soooo dark about 4 hrs after tanning and really looks nice!</li>
            <li>Tan very fast..</li>
            <li>I would suggest starting with JWOW&#x27;s one and done then once you build up your tan then using wedding white and your tan will look amazing!</li>
            <li>It really sped up my tan!</li>
            <li>I am an avid tanner</li>
            <li>I really love using jwoww wedding white</li>
            <li>My tan looks real and my orange!</li>
            <li>I work at a tanning salon and have tried many different lotions.</li>
            <li>If you like to tan, you really should invest!</li>
            <li>I first tried a packet of this out at my salon, and instantly was in love.</li>
            <li>At first, I saw nothing.</li>
            <li>Fastforward 2 hours, and - BAM - I looked like I had just got back from some exotic tropical island.</li>
            <li>This is the first bottle that I have finished...</li>
            <li>I love and still occasionally use ONE AND DONE but LOOOOOVE this one!  </li>
            <li>I use to be really really tan!</li>
            <li>This is actually the most even color I have ever gotten from any tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>:) The only problem I had was around my ankles and achille&#x27;s tendons, but morning moisturizing took care of the issue.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of color after the first time I used this.</li>
            <li>ONLY complaint/suggestion that I would give is to make sure that you wash your hands after you use the product.</li>
            <li>That was a first.</li>
            <li>I just got this new lotion today, and noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li>I like this lotion for a quick blast of color, but really don&#x27;t care much for its fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay as much as they did, but I loved the dark color they were turning!</li>
            <li>I have found that the only way I can use it is if I put it on before I go tan, making sure that it is really even and well applied, and then washing my hands.  </li>
            <li>I went shopping directly after tanning- thrilled with the initial results.</li>
            <li>Okay- fast forward 3 hours later.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I couldnt believe how much darker I was.</li>
            <li>After the first time I used it, I had streaks of orange all over my legs, thinking I may have used too much.</li>
            <li>, you get a really nice dark tan with this.</li>
            <li>While this lotion does have some amazing and fast results, it also leaves dark brown streaks if you don&#x27;t get it blended all the way.  </li>
            <li>Jwoww&#x27;s wedding white bronzer is my new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>Smells like musky pear and feels very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>but i really slop it on.</li>
            <li>$90 a bottle was way too much for me to spend</li>
            <li>This product shipped to me fast and had no damage.</li>
            <li>It is also very sticky for a while after it is applied.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the real deal</li>
            <li>And I was ready to cry.</li>
            <li>Very... bronze.</li>
            <li>I can use a straight bronzer without a problem</li>
            <li>Worked fast.</li>
            <li>No orange here, really.</li>
            <li>i usually use hot lotion but the jwoww hot was so good i couldnt wait to try her wedding white an</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received more compliments on my tan with this lotion than all my other lotions combined.  </li>
            <li>Smells better than other lotions that I have tried and doesn&#x27;t leave you with that &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; after you are done tanning.</li>
            <li>I love jwowws other products</li>
            <li>I got JWoww White Wedding Private Reserve based on rave reviews, and was super excited to try it-</li>
            <li>My salon wasn&#x27;t currently offering any specials on a bottle of this, and as much as I loved it, I was not shelling out $100 on top of expensive tanning packages.</li>
            <li>feeling let down after the other Jwoww lotion were so great.</li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions from designer skin including luminary, black, conceited, and phoenician.</li>
            <li>I mainly use bronzers but others to.</li>
            <li>As a last ditch effort, I shelled out $14 on a packet just hoping there was a chance for my deep, lovely glow to get even deeper; even lovlier.</li>
            <li>This particular bed even had 2 burned out bulbs.</li>
            <li>it has a high level of DHA.</li>
            <li>I laid in high pressure bed for 15mins</li>
            <li>and when I got out at first did not have major difference</li>
            <li>I do believe it had far too much bronzer, as my palms and wrists were orange after use.  </li>
            <li>The color on me is a bit orangey-reddish-brown; not a good, deep tan color like others have experienced.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this lotion, and the color it gives me, but its just too greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I did not blend it in very well and it left orange spots on my wrists and legs.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s the real deal or not was told they stopped making this lotion would love to know the answer plz</li>
            <li>but I used this one and it washed RIGHT off when I showered or put actual after tanning lotion on.</li>
            <li>WOKE ME UP in the middle of the night when my head ducked under the covers- dutch-ovened myself right awake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got to live for a while with whatever scent the lotion has.)</li>
            <li>love this stuff, from a really white girl wanting a tan with minimal exposure..</li>
            <li>conceited and adore are pretty close to the white wedding also.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;The cap is easy to pop off if you stick something in the hole where the lotion comes out and pull up on it.</li>
            <li>This is for sure not worth the money, especially if you are trying to build your color.</li>
            <li>Thicker lotion (which can be both wonderful, as well as awful), feels super moisturizing, but does take a while to rub in, and if you are working with a 5 minute time between checking in and the bed coming on, that can be frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I would recommend the original Jwoww One &amp; Done black bronzer before this one however.</li>
            <li>The tanning oil is clear, however if you don&#x27;t wash your hands afterwards (can&#x27;t see tanning oil on them)</li>
            <li>This lotion gives you a pretty dark color, but is too much like a self tanner.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is white and you do not have to use much of this lotion</li>
            <li>I just think this one has the benefits that far outweigh the negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That may be the way I reacted to it because my skin is sort of sensitive.</li>
            <li>I definitely agree, and it was INTENSE.</li>
            <li>but this one would be my least favorite.</li>
            <li>No one wants the webs of their fingers/nails to turn a funky too-dark color, and that is exactly what will happen if you don&#x27;t wipe those spaces down after application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My tan wasn&#x27;t so WOW even after the second time using it, as I kind of expected after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li>its so funny I&#x27;ve been using jwow for a very long time and have all of hers</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this tanning lotion, a few of my tanning friends got it from the tanning salon we goto.</li>
            <li>Yes, you have to spend a little extra time rubbing it in, but it really doesnt take that much longer just a few more rubs and it is in.</li>
            <li>only regret to buying 3 bottles of this is that it leaves orange streaks mainly on the palms of my hands and in between my toes for about 3 days.</li>
            <li>Wedding White has a nice scent and is much less streaky than other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It left orange around my wrists, and it didn&#x27;t look like natural color.</li>
            <li>I usually finish maybe half then throw it in my car or give it away.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buying another bottle :)</li>
            <li>I usually wash my hands after applying the lotion right before going into the booth, but the next morning...</li>

            <li> Loved it, this made me 3 shades darker after 1 week.</li>
            <li> LOVED this lotion.</li>
            <li> It is everything you could ask for in a good bronzing lotion.</li>
            <li> Gives a good tan and glow thumbs up</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> and also when you get out of the tanning bed you still smell good.</li>
            <li> I already had good color, but got even darker.</li>
            <li> Smelled good and worked well.  </li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell and goes easy and feels silky on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Really great lotion it has made me super tan!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is defiantly for a more experienced tanner.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Seemed more like a self tanner, however, was great on legs at the beach.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> This lotion is pretty great!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> that works much better!</li>
            <li> #1 -- make sure you wash your hands well after applying it, or as soon as you get out of the tanning bed.!  </li>
            <li> This is the first jwoww lotion that I am really impressed with!</li>
            <li> This lotion IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> And while it smells amazing, the scent doesn&#x27;t even stay with you through a 15 minute tan session, let alone all day.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing, and tans every spot on your body.</li>
            <li> I thought this would get me nice and tan</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t liked any of Jwoww&#x27;s lotions until now.</li>
            <li> Liked the lotion.  </li>
            <li> Works great and quickly</li>
            <li> You have to be very good about rubbing it in all the way and not over doing it, also washing hands afterwards because it does have so much self tanner in it.</li>
            <li> Gives you very good color and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth product, but you need to wash your hands immediately after tanning because the lotion will leave stains between your fingers!</li>
            <li> This product is by far the BEST tanning lotion ive ever used.</li>
            <li> This lotion is by far the best I have used.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is by far our salons favorite and best selling lotion.</li>
            <li> The seller was great, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It smeller amazing before, but does have a strong after tan odor.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love an would recommend this lotion to all my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I LOVE JWOW..........</li>
            <li> I think the lotion is OK</li>
            <li> DHA is self tanner, this is going to build more color on top of your tan.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Seems like more of a sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> I was sure to rub it in well and still ended up with streaks on my legs.</li>
            <li> Wat more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> its at the top of my favorite tanning lotions and trust me</li>
            <li> I love the way it works...</li>
            <li> After 3 uses in 3 days I didn&#x27;t notice any better color or softer skin than with my cheap-y lotions.</li>
            <li> I love it?  </li>
            <li> The scent is fabulous!</li>
            <li> and I have tried many many lotions.</li>
            <li> And ive also tried kardashian glow and girlfriend sexy.</li>
            <li> The bronzer is phenomenal, I have never been orange from it.</li>
            <li> I had results within 4 hours, and they were quite stunning.</li>
            <li> any tanner knows, you will (for the most part) get better results from a salon rather than a gym.</li>
            <li> So, thus, the lovely dovey feeling towards this lotion.</li>
            <li> It appears that I missed a bit around the top of my foot area, because I am literally talking a 2-3 shade difference between my lower shin/ankle and my foot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a self tanner than a bronzing tanning lotion...</li>
            <li> ive used many tanning lotions working at a tanning salon and all.</li>
            <li> I love the shimmer it gives.</li>
            <li> Love the color it gives.</li>
            <li> Not a terrible after smell like some tanning lotions leave.</li>
            <li> I thought it would hopefully become my go-to favorite.</li>
            <li> The smell could be better --  </li>
            <li> I believe it would be a much better lotion if it did.</li>
            <li> the $40 I paid for it was okay.</li>
            <li> It smelled really nice IMO, like pear/vanilla perfume, but light, it wasn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Absolutley love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wash your hands after you apply.</li>
            <li> At first I really loved this lotion.</li>
            <li> Its definitely worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> This product is nothing special!</li>
            <li> The original tanner is much better.</li>
            <li> Leaves you with a deep golden perfect tan!!!</li>
            <li> Easily stains the palms.</li>
            <li> My two main needs for a good lotion.</li>
            <li> This product has a strong after tan odor.</li>
            <li> It leaves no orange streaks and the after tan smell isnt strong.</li>
            <li> But seriously, really strong.</li>
            <li> Also, this leaves a STRONG odor after you get out of the bed.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft, smells like a vanilla bergmont mix..soft and smooth, I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it cheaper on Amazon instead of paying full price at the salon.</li>
            <li> but after I got the hang of it was just fine.</li>
            <li> Not only did I feel darker after the first use, but it smelled great too!</li>
            <li> I went strictly off the reviews from amazon and purchased a whole bottle before trying a sample, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper han buying in a salon and works great super fast, just make sure to rinse hands after applying....</li>
            <li> I am huge fan of One &amp; Done</li>
            <li> The initial smell was great- light and fruity, not overly perfumed-</li>
            <li> Gave me great color, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it turning my hands orange if I forgot to wash them after applying.</li>
            <li> The J Woww 50x bronzer, is amazing tho and that really builds up my tan and helps maintain my color.</li>
            <li> Great bronzer, I can see a color difference after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel silky smooth</li>
            <li> I got great color from this lotion, and was even darker the next day.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product!</li>
            <li> This product is good, has a light clean scent, makes ur skin very soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Super strong DHA smell.</li>
            <li> But you can really smell the dha a few hrs in, so if you don&#x27;t mind that and love a lot of bronzer in a lotion its great!</li>
            <li> This lotion is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Overall though this gave me fantastic color and smelled good.</li>
            <li> Jwoww Wedding White tanning lotion is by far one of the best lotions I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is by far every bit amazing as it claims to be.</li>
            <li> You will smell like straight self tanner after you tan and it will get progressively more smelly until you get a chance to shower.</li>
            <li> I loved the  wedding white lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t pay full price for lotions ever</li>
            <li> It is good for a quick blast of color for a special occasion or something, but you can&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
            <li> is seriously the best lotion ever.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love the Jwoww Wedding White!!</li>
            <li> it smells great and keeps me dark.</li>
            <li> It has a strong vanilla scent that I don&#x27;t care for and it is very oily.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion!!!</li>
            <li> But I would buy again because of how it makes skin feel and its a WHITE bronzer which is fabulous!!</li>
            <li> Favorite JWOWW lotion by far is One and Done</li>
            <li> The second time I used it I made sure to blend it in, this time I was really surprised at how nice of color I got.</li>
            <li> kind of have a love/hate relationship with this stuff but prefer the others over Wedding White.</li>
            <li> The lotion is pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have tried Karadashin Glow lotions, many from Designer Skin, all Jwoww lotions and I must say that this is by far my fav.</li>
            <li> I love this so much and color comes in fast.</li>
            <li> it smells great, is soft, not oily, and is a WHITE bronzer!</li>
            <li> When I was at school people noticed right away, saying how tan I was.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t rub the lotion in just right your color will streak.</li>
            <li> Right then and there I convinced myself I was going to purchase a bottle.</li>
            <li> anyone using a bronzer should know to wash there hands right after regardless.</li>
            <li> It was strong, and I am hoping something I can learn to live with after time.</li>
            <li> You get soooo dark about 4 hrs after tanning and really looks nice!</li>
            <li> Tan very fast..</li>
            <li> I would suggest starting with JWOW&#x27;s one and done then once you build up your tan then using wedding white and your tan will look amazing!</li>
            <li> It really sped up my tan!</li>
            <li> I am an avid tanner</li>
            <li> I really love using jwoww wedding white</li>
            <li> My tan looks real and my orange!</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon and have tried many different lotions.</li>
            <li> If you like to tan, you really should invest!</li>
            <li> I first tried a packet of this out at my salon, and instantly was in love.</li>
            <li> At first, I saw nothing.</li>
            <li> Fastforward 2 hours, and - BAM - I looked like I had just got back from some exotic tropical island.</li>
            <li> This is the first bottle that I have finished...</li>
            <li> I love and still occasionally use ONE AND DONE but LOOOOOVE this one!  </li>
            <li> I use to be really really tan!</li>
            <li> This is actually the most even color I have ever gotten from any tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> :) The only problem I had was around my ankles and achille&#x27;s tendons, but morning moisturizing took care of the issue.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of color after the first time I used this.</li>
            <li> ONLY complaint/suggestion that I would give is to make sure that you wash your hands after you use the product.</li>
            <li> That was a first.</li>
            <li> I just got this new lotion today, and noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li> I like this lotion for a quick blast of color, but really don&#x27;t care much for its fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay as much as they did, but I loved the dark color they were turning!</li>
            <li> I have found that the only way I can use it is if I put it on before I go tan, making sure that it is really even and well applied, and then washing my hands.  </li>
            <li> I went shopping directly after tanning- thrilled with the initial results.</li>
            <li> Okay- fast forward 3 hours later.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I couldnt believe how much darker I was.</li>
            <li> After the first time I used it, I had streaks of orange all over my legs, thinking I may have used too much.</li>
            <li> , you get a really nice dark tan with this.</li>
            <li> While this lotion does have some amazing and fast results, it also leaves dark brown streaks if you don&#x27;t get it blended all the way.  </li>
            <li> Jwoww&#x27;s wedding white bronzer is my new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells like musky pear and feels very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> but i really slop it on.</li>
            <li> $90 a bottle was way too much for me to spend</li>
            <li> This product shipped to me fast and had no damage.</li>
            <li> It is also very sticky for a while after it is applied.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the real deal</li>
            <li> And I was ready to cry.</li>
            <li> Very... bronze.</li>
            <li> I can use a straight bronzer without a problem</li>
            <li> Worked fast.</li>
            <li> No orange here, really.</li>
            <li> i usually use hot lotion but the jwoww hot was so good i couldnt wait to try her wedding white an</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received more compliments on my tan with this lotion than all my other lotions combined.  </li>
            <li> Smells better than other lotions that I have tried and doesn&#x27;t leave you with that &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; after you are done tanning.</li>
            <li> I love jwowws other products</li>
            <li> I got JWoww White Wedding Private Reserve based on rave reviews, and was super excited to try it-</li>
            <li> My salon wasn&#x27;t currently offering any specials on a bottle of this, and as much as I loved it, I was not shelling out $100 on top of expensive tanning packages.</li>
            <li> feeling let down after the other Jwoww lotion were so great.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions from designer skin including luminary, black, conceited, and phoenician.</li>
            <li> I mainly use bronzers but others to.</li>
            <li> As a last ditch effort, I shelled out $14 on a packet just hoping there was a chance for my deep, lovely glow to get even deeper; even lovlier.</li>
            <li> This particular bed even had 2 burned out bulbs.</li>
            <li> it has a high level of DHA.</li>
            <li> I laid in high pressure bed for 15mins</li>
            <li> and when I got out at first did not have major difference</li>
            <li> I do believe it had far too much bronzer, as my palms and wrists were orange after use.  </li>
            <li> The color on me is a bit orangey-reddish-brown; not a good, deep tan color like others have experienced.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion, and the color it gives me, but its just too greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I did not blend it in very well and it left orange spots on my wrists and legs.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the real deal or not was told they stopped making this lotion would love to know the answer plz</li>
            <li> but I used this one and it washed RIGHT off when I showered or put actual after tanning lotion on.</li>
            <li> WOKE ME UP in the middle of the night when my head ducked under the covers- dutch-ovened myself right awake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to live for a while with whatever scent the lotion has.)</li>
            <li> love this stuff, from a really white girl wanting a tan with minimal exposure..</li>
            <li> conceited and adore are pretty close to the white wedding also.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;The cap is easy to pop off if you stick something in the hole where the lotion comes out and pull up on it.</li>
            <li> This is for sure not worth the money, especially if you are trying to build your color.</li>
            <li> Thicker lotion (which can be both wonderful, as well as awful), feels super moisturizing, but does take a while to rub in, and if you are working with a 5 minute time between checking in and the bed coming on, that can be frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I would recommend the original Jwoww One &amp; Done black bronzer before this one however.</li>
            <li> The tanning oil is clear, however if you don&#x27;t wash your hands afterwards (can&#x27;t see tanning oil on them)</li>
            <li> This lotion gives you a pretty dark color, but is too much like a self tanner.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is white and you do not have to use much of this lotion</li>
            <li> I just think this one has the benefits that far outweigh the negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That may be the way I reacted to it because my skin is sort of sensitive.</li>
            <li> I definitely agree, and it was INTENSE.</li>
            <li> but this one would be my least favorite.</li>
            <li> No one wants the webs of their fingers/nails to turn a funky too-dark color, and that is exactly what will happen if you don&#x27;t wipe those spaces down after application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My tan wasn&#x27;t so WOW even after the second time using it, as I kind of expected after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> its so funny I&#x27;ve been using jwow for a very long time and have all of hers</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this tanning lotion, a few of my tanning friends got it from the tanning salon we goto.</li>
            <li> Yes, you have to spend a little extra time rubbing it in, but it really doesnt take that much longer just a few more rubs and it is in.</li>
            <li> only regret to buying 3 bottles of this is that it leaves orange streaks mainly on the palms of my hands and in between my toes for about 3 days.</li>
            <li> Wedding White has a nice scent and is much less streaky than other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It left orange around my wrists, and it didn&#x27;t look like natural color.</li>
            <li> I usually finish maybe half then throw it in my car or give it away.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buying another bottle :)</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hands after applying the lotion right before going into the booth, but the next morning...</li>
            <li> I just want to clear up some things other people are saying.</li>
            <li> It was a little thick, so it took a little longer to rub in, but it had a nice silicone texture and it didn&#x27;t feel greasy to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used JWoww&#x27;s other lotions (Black Bronzer, 50x Black Bronzer and Energizing Black Bronzer) and I actually love them all.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Color also does not last long.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine how long they have been burned out, and how long they will stay that way.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a lotion I would use every day simply because it will give an unnatural look, but I used it every 2 or 3 days and used my regular lotion the other times.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money attempted to contact shipper</li>
            <li> but after few hrs WOW I had a ton of color.</li>
            <li> I currently rotate SB Pink Diamonds, Ed Hardy Hollywood Bronze,  DS Boutique Bronze Camouflage, OP Xtreme Intensifier, with</li>
            <li> but I believe that as long as you have a good base tan if you use this lotion you will not turn orange.</li>
            <li> I never miss a day of tanning unless im sick, I seen this and was like I need it, it must work amazingly.</li>
            <li> It was mixed with some other lotion I could tell by the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that its being discontinued other than that</li>
            <li> the lotion makes you sticky and leaves a gross lotion puddle on the tanning bed but other than that it does the job.</li>
            <li> it just feels like it is actually moisturizing your skin unlike other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> It will make your hands orange and just rubbing off with a dry towel was not working for me.</li>
            <li> I have a very odd skin tone, I am Irish, German and Indian.</li>
            <li> The only diwnfall is it doesn&#x27;t get u as dark as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Deep dark tan.</li>
            <li> On the way home from the tanning salon, I started getting little red bumps on my legs..</li>
            <li> It also is a very thick lotion; it takes awhile to rub in but is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Bring baby wipes or a wet towel with you to get it off your hands though, after you apply and before you get in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> concided coco devill believe in pink playboy boost 5 shades</li>
            <li> just to name a few Jwoww Wedding White tops them all!!</li>
            <li> ..came out a bit pink, but after an hour I can see the change, NO orange, NO streaks, and</li>
            <li> decided to give a bronzer another try, even though I had bought a few by Designer Skin and Jwoww, because Wedding White seemed interesting.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> First of all the product was fake.</li>
            <li> is just selling other place&#x27;s rejects.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon and tried this the other day.</li>
            <li> The dewy sheen of my skin after tanning topped every other lotion to date.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting past a certain dark color and after using this lotion I achieved a dark tan.</li>
            <li> You do get dark quick using this tanner, but the orange nasty hands aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> But you have to be very careful when applying it, because it will streak if you don&#x27;t apply it evenly.</li>
            <li> nothing was left behind as other bronzers would have left a brown tint.</li>
            <li> Obviously with any tanning product with bronzers you need to wipe your hands (this is common sense).</li>
            <li> but she now made this one which is supposed to be delicate to wear with white ....</li>
            <li> It makes me so dark.</li>
            <li> The lotion is thick and white, which made it difficult to rub in, but VERY silky and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> So I rubbed myself down, climbed into the bed, and got my relaxation on.</li>
            <li> Took a couple times to get used to how the color went on (slight streaking issues)</li>
            <li> darker black noir</li>
            <li> I doubt you will be anything less than satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon because my salon was having a half off sale.</li>
            <li> I am tossing this bottle out half full because it is just sooo bad.</li>
            <li> so my palms had a few slightly orange spots.</li>
            <li> And when I woke up, I noticed little brown lotion balls in my cleavage.</li>
            <li> my body isn&#x27;t orange although my hands were a little (but that&#x27;s my fault)</li>
            <li> I usually go with extreme tingles (Ruby, Obnoxious) and I usually buy a new lotion every few weeks because I get bored with what I have and want to switch to something better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I must be one of the few that this did NOT work for... :</li>
            <li> Your color goes away after a couple days if you dont use it everyday.</li>
            <li> but I could not get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> I tried this lotion on Friday past week.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have purchased multiple bottles.</li>
            <li> My skin is at least two shades darker in less than an hour, can&#x27;t wait until tommorow to see what will happen!</li>
            <li> The ATO from DHA in this was worse than any other indoor tanning or sunless tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I had hit a plateau, and was finding a hard time getting past it.</li>
            <li> kinda worried as I am Irish pale with a minimal base tan...</li>
            <li> This lotion even tans those hard to tan spots like pressure spots from tanning beds, neck, tops feet, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend at least trying a sample.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Serious color changes.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> :confused:</li>
            <li> Might as well have bought sunless tanner fake bake product.</li>
            <li> So sad</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I forgot, and had that weird orange color between my fingers.</li>
            <li> So skin tans in weird ways</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be using this disappointment again...</li>
            <li> FAKE!</li>
            <li> I got the wrong lotion in my jwow bottle I got duped!</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> mad:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- White lotion, which means you don&#x27;t have to be fearful of ruining any clothes with those awful</li>
            <li> Too bad they didn&#x27;t continue making it</li>
            <li> I have never had a lotion streak on me so badly.</li>
            <li> I am a weekly tanner &amp; i was so disappointed with this produt.</li>
            <li> I just started tanning again to get a base tan for the summer.</li>
            <li> this one shocked me that it didnt work so well!</li>
            <li> I peeling off my skin and it was disgusting!</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery, horrible results.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First of all the product was fake. It was mixed with some other lotion I could tell by the fragrance. I even brought the bottle to the salon and she had me smell there bottle vs mine. Different scent. Complete waste of money attempted to contact shipper and they never responded! Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;The cap is easy to pop off if you stick something in the hole where the lotion comes out and pull up on it. You can fill the lotion with anything you desire. FAKE!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! It really sped up my tan! Only thing I dislike is the orange lines between my fingers from the bronzer when I forget to wash them afterwards. But, that&#x27;s my fault.</li>
            <li> I am an avid tanner but I am also native american so I am darker in color anyways. I have a hard time getting past a certain dark color and after using this lotion I achieved a dark tan. I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Obviously with any tanning product with bronzers you need to wipe your hands (this is common sense). But I wont go without it.</li>
            <li> I really love using jwoww wedding white i usually use hot lotion but the jwoww hot was so good i couldnt wait to try her wedding white an i love it i would recomend everybody try it i have a really good tan from using it not even a week i dont use or like just bronzer lotions but its great an i will keep using it</li>
            <li> This lotion is pretty great! You have to be very good about rubbing it in all the way and not over doing it, also washing hands afterwards because it does have so much self tanner in it.You get soooo dark about 4 hrs after tanning and really looks nice! But you can really smell the dha a few hrs in, so if you don&#x27;t mind that and love a lot of bronzer in a lotion its great! Smells like musky pear and feels very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Loved it, this made me 3 shades darker after 1 week. great deal very pleased byu this purchase. thank you so much</li>
            <li> I absolutely love an would recommend this lotion to all my girlfriends. The bronzed did not leave streak marks nor did I smell like a tanning salon after using this product. My tan looks real and my orange!</li>
            <li> LOVED this lotion. Too bad they didn&#x27;t continue making it</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! Best I&#x27;ve ever used! Wish it was cheaper. It gave me the best color!</li>
            <li> I did not buy from this seller, but I didn&#x27;t care for this lotion. It is good for a quick blast of color for a special occasion or something, but you can&#x27;t use it daily. It left orange around my wrists, and it didn&#x27;t look like natural color. Color also does not last long. Might as well have bought sunless tanner fake bake product.</li>
            <li> The seller was great, fast shipping! I would recommend the original Jwoww One &amp; Done black bronzer before this one however. The tanning oil is clear, however if you don&#x27;t wash your hands afterwards (can&#x27;t see tanning oil on them) your hands will be dyed orange for the next week or so. It smells gross too. The original tanner is much better. You do get dark quick using this tanner, but the orange nasty hands aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion, and the color it gives me, but its just too greasy and heavy. I always end up breaking out when I use it, no matter what I try to do to avoid it. Great lotion, if your skin can handle it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE JWOW..........JUST NOT THIS ONE! its so funny I&#x27;ve been using jwow for a very long time and have all of hers but she now made this one which is supposed to be delicate to wear with white ....but...its the 1st jwow that turns me orange so either jwow lied or I got the wrong lotion in my jwow bottle I got duped! So sad</li>
            <li> I bought this on recommendation from my teenage niece.  I think the lotion is OK but I could not get past the smell.  It has a strong vanilla scent that I don&#x27;t care for and it is very oily.  I felt like it was rubbing off on everything I touched.</li>
            <li> Loved this lotion, smells great but will still get the bronzer smell overnight, nothing a shower won&#x27;t fix. Took a couple times to get used to how the color went on (slight streaking issues) but after I got the hang of it was just fine. Bring baby wipes or a wet towel with you to get it off your hands though, after you apply and before you get in the tanning bed. It will make your hands orange and just rubbing off with a dry towel was not working for me. Overall though this gave me fantastic color and smelled good. My two main needs for a good lotion. Favorite JWOWW lotion by far is One and Done but this is a close second!</li>
            <li> Gave me great color, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it turning my hands orange if I forgot to wash them after applying.</li>
            <li> I am a weekly tanner &amp; i was so disappointed with this produt. I read great reviws and they were a total lie. I am sitting here writing this with brown palms and brown spots all over my feet. I have never had a lotion streak on me so badly. It also does nothing for my skin. I am going back to the swedish beauty line. I am tossing this bottle out half full because it is just sooo bad.</li>
            <li> Jwoww Wedding White tanning lotion is by far one of the best lotions I have ever tried. I work at a tanning salon and have tried many different lotions. This lotion is defiantly for a more experienced tanner. it has a high level of DHA. DHA is self tanner, this is going to build more color on top of your tan. It also is a very thick lotion; it takes awhile to rub in but is very moisturizing. You will notice the color to appear 4-7 hours. The first time I used it I did not blend it in very well and it left orange spots on my wrists and legs. The second time I used it I made sure to blend it in, this time I was really surprised at how nice of color I got. I also recommend you wipe your hands off with a baby wipe, that your salon should supply you with. This is by far our salons favorite and best selling lotion.</li>
            <li> Awesome product at a much better price than buying at a tanning salon!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells. Works great and quickly but if you are outside and reapply it starts to turn your hands a brownish color.</li>
            <li> This lotion IS AMAZING. I have used it at my tanning salon and thought i would try to find it cheaper elsewhere &amp; i did.. Amazon. My low rating is because it expired a month after i got it which tells me this place is just selling other place&#x27;s rejects. I still use it and do get some color but i really slop it on.</li>
            <li> Seems like more of a sunless tanner. I was sure to rub it in well and still ended up with streaks on my legs. I do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I only have used this tanning lotion a couple of times.. Unfortunately it left orange streaks on and around my arm pits... This next day my shoulder were orange and my arm pits were white. Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after trying it out at my local tanning salon. $90 a bottle was way too much for me to spend so I looked on Amazon. This product shipped to me fast and had no damage. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This product has a strong after tan odor. You will smell like straight self tanner after you tan and it will get progressively more smelly until you get a chance to shower. It is also very sticky for a while after it is applied. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this or purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion yet! compared with lotion at local salon and it&#x27;s the real deal</li>
            <li> Much cheaper han buying in a salon and works great super fast, just make sure to rinse hands after applying....it will tint them.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful Received quickly! Thank You - Would have written a review sooner but i didnt know how.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love the Jwoww Wedding White!! It is everything you could ask for in a good bronzing lotion. It smells great and gives you excellent color!! Wat more could you ask for? Its definitely worth every penny!! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that its being discontinued other than that its at the top of my favorite tanning lotions and trust me I have almost tryed them all and have about 40 different bottles of different lotions such as jwoww one and done snooki 70× bronzer splurge concided coco devill believe in pink playboy boost 5 shades darker black noir just to name a few Jwoww Wedding White tops them all!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used JWoww&#x27;s other lotions (Black Bronzer, 50x Black Bronzer and Energizing Black Bronzer) and I actually love them all.&lt;br /&gt;This one smells absolutely amazing and smells the best out of the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret to buying 3 bottles of this is that it leaves orange streaks mainly on the palms of my hands and in between my toes for about 3 days. I usually wash my hands after applying the lotion right before going into the booth, but the next morning...orange.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a couple of days for it to go away but the glow/color I have afterwards is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I kind of have a love/hate relationship with this stuff but prefer the others over Wedding White.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells! I love the way it works... used it three times in a tanning bed also outside  .......it&#x27;s amazing thank you jwow xxoo</li>
            <li> feeling let down after the other Jwoww lotion were so great. After 3 uses in 3 days I didn&#x27;t notice any better color or softer skin than with my cheap-y lotions. And while it smells amazing, the scent doesn&#x27;t even stay with you through a 15 minute tan session, let alone all day.  I&#x27;ll stick with my ed hardy ink.</li>
            <li> Really great lotion it has made me super tan!! I love it?  Gives a good tan and glow thumbs up</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Exactly what I expected. This stuff works!</li>
            <li> Good quality. Tan very fast..</li>
            <li> This is the best bronzer, does not stain hands nor get on clothes even after working out. Awesome scent too.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the real deal or not was told they stopped making this lotion would love to know the answer plz</li>
            <li> Great lotion to get darker with tanning.  The scent is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Worked so well to tan me for my wedding.</li>
            <li> I thought this would get me nice and tan and it did not. instead of building my tan, my color started to fade. Now, i have to build my tan back up. The J Woww 50x bronzer, is amazing tho and that really builds up my tan and helps maintain my color. This is for sure not worth the money, especially if you are trying to build your color.</li>
            <li> I am a daily tanner and I have tried many many lotions. I mainly use bronzers but others to. I am huge fan of One &amp; Done it is one of my favs. I tried this lotion on Friday past week. I laid in high pressure bed for 15mins and when I got out at first did not have major difference but after few hrs WOW I had a ton of color. The lotion smells very good one you put it on and also when you get out of the tanning bed you still smell good. The lotion itself is white and you do not have to use much of this lotion a little goes a long way. Well I used it for 2nd time on Sat and I one again got a lot color from it. Feels wonderful on your skin as well.  This lotion even tans those hard to tan spots like pressure spots from tanning beds, neck, tops feet, etc. NO orange color or streeks just Awesome. The lotion is pricey but worth every penny. I have tried Karadashin Glow lotions, many from Designer Skin, all Jwoww lotions and I must say that this is by far my fav.</li>
            <li> I just got this new lotion today, and noticed a difference right away! I already had good color, but got even darker. When I was at school people noticed right away, saying how tan I was. This is one of the BEST lotions ever! If you like to tan, you really should invest!</li>
            <li> I tan at sun tan city and have used every lotion possible. I have tried many lotions from designer skin including luminary, black, conceited, and phoenician. And ive also tried kardashian glow and girlfriend sexy. Jwoww&#x27;s wedding white bronzer is my new favorite lotion. It smells amazing, and tans every spot on your body. It leaves no orange streaks and the after tan smell isnt strong. I haven&#x27;t liked any of Jwoww&#x27;s lotions until now. I highly recommend this lotion!!!</li>
            <li> This was the best lotion I have EVER had, wish they still made it</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years, and have tried all of &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; lotions out there. This is by far every bit amazing as it claims to be. The bronzer is phenomenal, I have never been orange from it. It smeller amazing before, but does have a strong after tan odor. I don&#x27;t mind, I just don&#x27;t go tanking while I&#x27;m at work. All in all, great product, great seller. Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> Wedding White has a nice scent and is much less streaky than other lotions I&#x27;ve used. It sells for almost triple what I paid here at the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> Nice smooth product, but you need to wash your hands immediately after tanning because the lotion will leave stains between your fingers!</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product.  If you don&#x27;t rub the lotion in just right your color will streak. I would not buy again or recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This is definitely an effective product! I had results within 4 hours, and they were quite stunning. Thanks for such a great product!</li>
            <li> I just bought this today at my local tanning salon for 80$$ kinda worried as I am Irish pale with a minimal base tan...laid in a level 5 bed, and could feel the heat..came out a bit pink, but after an hour I can see the change, NO orange, NO streaks, and no finger web orange,,,baby wipe fingers ASAP!!  My skin is at least two shades darker in less than an hour, can&#x27;t wait until tommorow to see what will happen! My skin feels soft, smells like a vanilla bergmont mix..soft and smooth, I love this stuff!! Came to amazon to buy cheaper! Yeah..love this stuff, from a really white girl wanting a tan with minimal exposure..</li>
            <li> At first I really loved this lotion. It smells awesome, gives you nice color and it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes. But you have to be very careful when applying it, because it will streak if you don&#x27;t apply it evenly. That being said, still one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> With every tanning product, there are going to be some problems. (see my pro/con list at the end) I just think this one has the benefits that far outweigh the negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As any tanner knows, you will (for the most part) get better results from a salon rather than a gym. I first tried a packet of this out at my salon, and instantly was in love. I had hit a plateau, and was finding a hard time getting past it. As a last ditch effort, I shelled out $14 on a packet just hoping there was a chance for my deep, lovely glow to get even deeper; even lovlier. At first, I saw nothing. And I was ready to cry. Fastforward 2 hours, and - BAM - I looked like I had just got back from some exotic tropical island. So, thus, the lovely dovey feeling towards this lotion. Right then and there I convinced myself I was going to purchase a bottle. My salon wasn&#x27;t currently offering any specials on a bottle of this, and as much as I loved it, I was not shelling out $100 on top of expensive tanning packages. I turned to amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 days later, my package was at my door. That is shipping speed I can totally appreciate. I had been planning on hitting the gym later that day, so I figured I would just give it a shot there and see if the results were similiar as to the experience I had at the salon. So I rubbed myself down, climbed into the bed, and got my relaxation on. (I just want to add a side note that I will always prefer salon beds over gym beds. This particular bed even had 2 burned out bulbs. I can only imagine how long they have been burned out, and how long they will stay that way.) It appears that I missed a bit around the top of my foot area, because I am literally talking a 2-3 shade difference between my lower shin/ankle and my foot. 2-3 SHADES!! That is revalutionary. Anyway, try it out. I doubt you will be anything less than satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- White lotion, which means you don&#x27;t have to be fearful of ruining any clothes with those awful stains.&lt;br /&gt;- Musky, vanilla scent, so you won&#x27;t smell like you just walked out of a candy factory.&lt;br /&gt;- Thicker lotion (which can be both wonderful, as well as awful), feels super moisturizing, but does take a while to rub in, and if you are working with a 5 minute time between checking in and the bed coming on, that can be frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;- Serious color changes. And not orangey. Very... bronze. And beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- YOU MUST WIPE YOUR HANDS. If you get caught in the rush I was talking about, do not, by any means, forget to wipe your hands. No one wants the webs of their fingers/nails to turn a funky too-dark color, and that is exactly what will happen if you don&#x27;t wipe those spaces down after application.&lt;br /&gt;- Super strong DHA smell. Like, I considered jumping in the shower all night while I was lying in bed smelling myself. It was strong, and I am hoping something I can learn to live with after time. But seriously, really strong.</li>
            <li> If this lotion is not applied evenly you will have streaks... It&#x27;s more of a self tanner than a bronzing tanning lotion...</li>
            <li> the lotion makes you sticky and leaves a gross lotion puddle on the tanning bed but other than that it does the job.</li>
            <li> I loved the  wedding white lotion. I read some reviews on here that made me worry but I believe that as long as you have a good base tan if you use this lotion you will not turn orange. I would suggest starting with JWOW&#x27;s one and done then once you build up your tan then using wedding white and your tan will look amazing! This lotion is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This product is nothing special! ive used many tanning lotions working at a tanning salon and all. this one shocked me that it didnt work so well! it is the most expensive lotion on my shelf and yet it isnt the best! I rather stick with my snookie 70x bronzer! that works much better!</li>
            <li> I have bought 7 lotions and white wedding has always been my fav it smells great and keeps me dark. I have always bought it at zoom tan here in ny and when they said they were not getting anymore I bought the last three they had so I baby them besides white wedding conceited and adore are pretty close to the white wedding also.</li>
            <li> Ive used it all. This product is by far the BEST tanning lotion ive ever used. It smells amazing and it still smells great after tanning. I love this so much and color comes in fast.</li>
            <li> Great bronzer, I can see a color difference after only a couple of uses. Smells great too, I have been very pleased with this lotion!</li>
            <li> I have used several in-door tanning products and this is one of my favorites. I love the shimmer it gives.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with tanning lotion. I usually go with extreme tingles (Ruby, Obnoxious) and I usually buy a new lotion every few weeks because I get bored with what I have and want to switch to something better.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give a bronzer another try, even though I had bought a few by Designer Skin and Jwoww, because Wedding White seemed interesting.&lt;br /&gt;This is seriously the best lotion ever. It makes me so dark. I do go tanning multiple times a week, I&#x27;m italian and I use the speed beds, but this stuff is unreal. This is the first bottle that I have finished...I usually finish maybe half then throw it in my car or give it away.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buying another bottle :)</li>
            <li> Liked the lotion.  Smelled good and worked well.  I do believe it had far too much bronzer, as my palms and wrists were orange after use.  Seemed more like a self tanner, however, was great on legs at the beach.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!! I get amazing color every time I use it! Makes my skin feel silky smooth and I can&#x27;t even tell I have tanning lotion on.!</li>
            <li> I love and still occasionally use ONE AND DONE but LOOOOOVE this one!  Love the color it gives. Great product!</li>
            <li> Im an EVERY day tanner. I never miss a day of tanning unless im sick, I seen this and was like I need it, it must work amazingly. I was wrong! I use to be really really tan! I used this, it didn&#x27;t even work. I can use a straight bronzer without a problem but I used this one and it washed RIGHT off when I showered or put actual after tanning lotion on. I peeling off my skin and it was disgusting! Never again will I buy this crappy lotion. Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell and goes easy and feels silky on your skin.  Not a terrible after smell like some tanning lotions leave.</li>
            <li> This lotion is by far the best I have used. It&#x27;s not a lotion I would use every day simply because it will give an unnatural look, but I used it every 2 or 3 days and used my regular lotion the other times.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion and was content with it after getting out of the bed. On the way home from the tanning salon, I started getting little red bumps on my legs.. That may be the way I reacted to it because my skin is sort of sensitive. Then the next morning on myway to work, I noticed ORANGE STREAKS on my legs. I&#x27;ve used a bronzing lotion before so I know how to apply it. I would definitely not recommend the product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I just started tanning again to get a base tan for the summer. The first time I used it I couldnt believe how much darker I was. I just want to clear up some things other people are saying. Yes, you have to spend a little extra time rubbing it in, but it really doesnt take that much longer just a few more rubs and it is in. Also I have had no problems with streaking. This is actually the most even color I have ever gotten from any tanning lotion. The color that you get is definitely not orange, you get a really nice dark tan with this. No, it does not feel greasy it just feels like it is actually moisturizing your skin unlike other tanning lotions. It also smells wonderful even after you have tanned. I would recommend this tanning lotion to anyone! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received more compliments on my tan with this lotion than all my other lotions combined.  Needless to say, I have purchased multiple bottles.</li>
            <li> This is a great bronzer... it made my skin look brighter and tanner without turning me orange. :) The only problem I had was around my ankles and achille&#x27;s tendons, but morning moisturizing took care of the issue.</li>
            <li> Worked fast. I had a lot of color after the first time I used this. Remember to wash your hands after you use it though. I forgot, and had that weird orange color between my fingers.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing!!! Leaves you with a deep golden perfect tan!!! Smells better than other lotions that I have tried and doesn&#x27;t leave you with that &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; after you are done tanning. ONLY complaint/suggestion that I would give is to make sure that you wash your hands after you use the product.If you don&#x27;t you will have bronzer stains on your hands, between your fingers and so forth. So I just scrub it and it will come off but it is just a pain.</li>
            <li> While this lotion does have some amazing and fast results, it also leaves dark brown streaks if you don&#x27;t get it blended all the way.  It also leaves stains between your fingers.  I have found that the only way I can use it is if I put it on before I go tan, making sure that it is really even and well applied, and then washing my hands.  Otherwise I look like I have bruises everywhere!  Also, this leaves a STRONG odor after you get out of the bed.  Pack your deodorant and some body spray!</li>
            <li> This was a very good product. Gives you very good color and the price was reasonable. Would definetly buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have a very odd skin tone, I am Irish, German and Indian. So skin tans in weird ways and i try everything. I work at a tanning salon and tried this the other day. I could tell i got darker immediately. I don&#x27;t pay full price for lotions ever but i would for this lotion. it smells great, is soft, not oily, and is a WHITE bronzer! i had no \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; on my cloths and i fell asleep on my white sheets before showering and nothing was left behind as other bronzers would have left a brown tint. I wasn&#x27;t sold on her lotions before but this is all i will use now!</li>
            <li> I must be one of the few that this did NOT work for... :mad: I currently rotate SB Pink Diamonds, Ed Hardy Hollywood Bronze,  DS Boutique Bronze Camouflage, OP Xtreme Intensifier, with SB Botanica Honey Face Facts on my face. I got JWoww White Wedding Private Reserve based on rave reviews, and was super excited to try it- I thought it would hopefully become my go-to favorite. It was definitely the most expensive one in my repertoire. Unfortunately, that wasn&#x27;t the case. The lotion is thick and white, which made it difficult to rub in, but VERY silky and moisturizing. The dewy sheen of my skin after tanning topped every other lotion to date. The initial smell was great- light and fruity, not overly perfumed- just what I like in a tanning lotion. (I tan in the evening, and don&#x27;t take a shower until the following morning to let the bronzers and dha have time to activate, so I&#x27;ve got to live for a while with whatever scent the lotion has.) I went shopping directly after tanning- thrilled with the initial results. Okay- fast forward 3 hours later. HOLY SMELL! The ATO from DHA in this was worse than any other indoor tanning or sunless tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Ever. BF pointed out that I smelled like cat pee. I definitely agree, and it was INTENSE. WOKE ME UP in the middle of the night when my head ducked under the covers- dutch-ovened myself right awake. Couldn&#x27;t wait to shower this morning! The color on me is a bit orangey-reddish-brown; not a good, deep tan color like others have experienced. And when I woke up, I noticed little brown lotion balls in my cleavage. That was a first. YUCK. :confused: Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be using this disappointment again...</li>
            <li> I like this lotion for a quick blast of color, but really don&#x27;t care much for its fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again...</li>
            <li> This product is good, has a light clean scent, makes ur skin very soft. The only diwnfall is it doesn&#x27;t get u as dark as I had hoped for. But I would buy again because of how it makes skin feel and its a WHITE bronzer which is fabulous!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this lotion after reading the reviews.  #1 -- make sure you wash your hands well after applying it, or as soon as you get out of the tanning bed.!  I forgot to do this the second time I used it &amp; had orange hands for several days until it wore off.  The smell could be better --  just wish it had silicone in it-- I believe it would be a much better lotion if it did. My tan wasn&#x27;t so WOW even after the second time using it, as I kind of expected after reading other reviews.  I like the fact that it is a bronzer but is a white lotion.  the $40 I paid for it was okay.</li>
            <li> this smells wonderful! works great. my body isn&#x27;t orange although my hands were a little (but that&#x27;s my fault) anyone using a bronzer should know to wash there hands right after regardless.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Not so great with keeping the skin moisturizer. Easily stains the palms. Will stick to tanning bronzes with silicon after using this. Glad I bought it cheaper on Amazon instead of paying full price at the salon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon because my salon was having a half off sale. I went strictly off the reviews from amazon and purchased a whole bottle before trying a sample, and I&#x27;m glad I did! It smelled really nice IMO, like pear/vanilla perfume, but light, it wasn&#x27;t overpowering. It was a little thick, so it took a little longer to rub in, but it had a nice silicone texture and it didn&#x27;t feel greasy to me. If you&#x27;ve ever used crystal faces, that&#x27;s what the texture of this reminded me of. I got great color from this lotion, and was even darker the next day. I did forget to wipe my hands after applying though so my palms had a few slightly orange spots. This is the first jwoww lotion that I am really impressed with! I&#x27;d recommend at least trying a sample.</li>
            <li> Absolutley love this lotion. Not only did I feel darker after the first use, but it smelled great too! I&#x27;ve never used a white bronzer before, but I&#x27;d recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this tanning lotion, a few of my tanning friends got it from the tanning salon we goto. I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay as much as they did, but I loved the dark color they were turning! So I turned to my trusty amazon to look for this product.. Speedy delivery, horrible results. After the first time I used it, I had streaks of orange all over my legs, thinking I may have used too much. I have it a week to fade and tried again. I used a lesser amount and still had orange streaks.. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This lotion gives you a pretty dark color, but is too much like a self tanner. Your color goes away after a couple days if you dont use it everyday. Plus it streaks like a self tanner and you smell like self tanner after using it. I love jwowws other products but this one would be my least favorite.</li>
            <li> The greatest bronzer I have ever used. Deep dark tan. People are asking me continuously &amp;#34;What lotion do you use?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> No orange here, really. Goes on white and doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes. Just make sure you wash your hands after you apply.</li>
