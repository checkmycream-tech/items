            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Top of the line seller and product.</li>
            <li>But, I appreciate the lower price and have switched most of my oils to Edens.  </li>
            <li>I love this mix.</li>
            <li>I love Eden&#x27;s Garden.  </li>

            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>and hopefully it is making the air more healthy for my family.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell, I have to say.</li>
            <li>Love four thieves.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful!</li>
            <li>I am excited to make my own stuff with my thieves.</li>
            <li>Was using Young Living thought I would try this instead because of pricing...works just as good!  </li>
            <li>High quality great smelling stuff.</li>
            <li>Good quality oil for an affordable price and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This blend is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to try Eden&#x27;s Garden Thieves!</li>
            <li>I love this scent, it&#x27;s a bit strong on the cinnamon flavor</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this oil; it smells strongly of cinnamon and cloves.</li>
            <li>but settles into a nice Cinnamon-Clove scent fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Sickness has been all over this holiday season, and my family has been healthy and sickness free dispite being around many people who have been passing around the funk at the holiday gatherings and in the stores.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite!!</li>
            <li>I also love how the company sends you a wonderful catalog with info and uses on other oils.</li>
            <li>This oil smells so good and tests as a pure oil.  </li>
            <li>Edens Garden is of such GREAT quality and such a GREAT price!</li>
            <li>but so far, we are happy with the product.</li>
            <li>We enjoy using this in our diffuser for the scent and for the benefit of keeping us safe from the germs of the winter season.</li>
            <li>Wow, this smells great.  </li>
            <li>Side by side with Young Living made me happy.  </li>
            <li>A great alternative to DoTerra or Young Living.</li>
            <li>When using topically, make sure you have a good carrier oil, like coconut, to cut the oil&#x27;s heat some and to create a nice massaging oil that goes farther than one drop or two drops will.</li>
            <li>Came in fast and was packaged good.</li>
            <li>As good as Thieves at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li>This product was packaged very well, and they even included info on how to use oil and what is good for what condition.</li>
            <li>Use your own judgment, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>While I enjoyed the scent when I smelled it in the bottle, it quickly began to overwhelmingly smell of cloves.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but not only does this oil smell amazing, perfect for the room oil diffuser.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about the quality of this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since purchased other Eden&#x27;s Garden oils and have been very happy with the others as well.    </li>
            <li>This is perfect for mixing with some other oils to make drops for your toothbrush and brushing your teeth to prevent and  kill gingivitis.  </li>
            <li>My son has allergy problem and easily catch flu.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy and thankful to find therapeutic grade oils at such a fantastic price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this oil for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Very quick to respond to any concerns or questions.</li>
            <li>Arrived 2 days early, very sturdy and protective packaging, and the best quality product I could hope for.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had success with this knocking out illness like some people claim, but I sure love the scent.</li>
            <li>Can use with distilled or filtered water to clean floor, as air freshener, on counter tops, diffuse in room to prevent spread of viruses and bacteria and much more.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t handle strong smells.</li>
            <li>Strong cinnamon and clove notes.</li>
            <li>It is a strong smell and will fill your room with a christmas-y type of smell.</li>
            <li>It will irritate my throat if too strong.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this product, so far I am delighted with the product.</li>
            <li>(it is rather strong and will sting the tongue a bit).</li>
            <li>The blend is no different in mix and is beautiful in smell.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if that is true or not, but it is interesting.</li>
            <li>Four Thieves Blend Essential oil is really nice, but I prefer the Young Living brand the best.  </li>
            <li>So it might be fine for you.</li>
            <li>I put this in a diffuser and with in 15-20 minutes, the runny nose was gone and she was breathing fine.  </li>
            <li>I combine some of these based on his symptoms and run it in my diffusor and he is fine all night.</li>
            <li>Everything was fine, thank you.</li>
            <li>This particular oil is great for so many things , it really helped with the viruses this yr .</li>
            <li>Very natural product that is good to use for the skin.</li>
            <li>I love their oils, and the booklet they send with every order comes as a handy reference when I&#x27;m thinking about ordering something new.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product in hopes that it would be as good as the Young Living brand I had received in a kit and that I would receive it more quickly.  </li>
            <li>In fact, Edens Garden&#x27;s smell even better, or should I say more pure maybe?</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It has a fabulous cinnamon clove scent with a hint of citrus.</li>
            <li>Smells great, diffused the last two nights while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>Customer service is nice and replies very timely.</li>

            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It smells good but does nothing as far as healing properties.</li>
            <li>Edens Garden also provided a wonderful product guide along with 101 ways to use essential oils which is very informative.</li>

            <li>Good price on this 4 thieves essential oils</li>
            <li>We loved the Thieves essential oil.</li>
            <li>but when you compare it to Doterra&#x27;s On Guard, I much prefer On Guard - which is a more premium product.</li>
            <li>I like sweet smells</li>
            <li>Thieves a superior essential oil to kill germs and bacteria in the home- either being difussed or added to cleaning products.</li>
            <li>6mo - 2yrs, mix 30 drops of sweet orange, 40 drops of cinnamon leaf and 25 drops of fir needle.</li>
            <li>For children 3-5yrs mix 30 drops sweet orange, 20 drops of clove, 20 drops cinnamon leaf and 25 drops of fir needle.</li>
            <li>YL&#x27;s blend is more like clove and so much nicer.</li>
            <li>Wished I could have the full ingredient listings.</li>
            <li>I simply love to smell it and it really relaxes me.  </li>
            <li>very concentrated...only needed a drop :)</li>
            <li>I loved this oil and all of the oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden, of which I&#x27;ve now tried several.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I could order it and any ready to try it out but have not had a reason to yet.</li>
            <li>I just spray my hands frequently and gives a nice comforting smell too</li>
            <li>This has a bit too much clove smell for me - I got this to help me sleep &amp; the clove smell was too overwhelming for me.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad, I like it</li>
            <li>Great smell, not a strong as young living, but depending on the use good substitute.</li>
            <li>Edens Gardens essential oils are a great value and as good of a product as any other.</li>
            <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t aware I needed to add it to another oil -- it was extremely strong.  </li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great product, and extremely helpful</li>
            <li>great for taking down inflammation and pain in my knee and last a good 8-10 hours</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not into the super earthy/hippie smells.</li>
            <li>love the smell of this essential oil :)</li>
            <li>This is what I needed and it came in quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many of the different companies that make an immune defense blend;  Eden&#x27;s Garden and Elizabeth Essentials are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Super speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>Love this scent - will definitely purchase more.  </li>
            <li>While this company does not participate in Prime, the product does ship quickly</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit woody to me, but blends in quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell to this oil high quality</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product,  I will be buying more oils from this company.</li>
            <li>One of my very favorite essential blends.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality!!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>You can buy anything from this company with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;They also include a fabulous little encyclopedia of herbs and their own synergy blends, and a great pamphlet with 101 uses for essential oils.</li>
            <li>This may be my new favorite blended oil.</li>
            <li>This smells really good, not sure that it is as healthy for me as it says.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Edens Garden !!!  </li>
            <li>I have smelled four thieves made by a different vendor &amp; it was much better!</li>
            <li>Thanks Eden&#x27;s Garden for helping me afford to keep my family safer from this germy world!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more from Eden&#x27;s Garden!</li>
            <li>One of my favorites from Edens Garden, and VERY affordable!!  </li>
            <li>and it really has helped!!</li>
            <li>it was definitely warm to put on the skin (temple, third eye, supersternal notch, wrists) but it was not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use with a little water to help get rid of unwanted oders.</li>
            <li>Liked it but the cinnamon scent is quite strong, can&#x27;t tell if there are other scents in this bottle.</li>
            <li>I use a few drops in my humidifier and it smells great to me</li>
            <li>I use it in my vaporized when I want to feel calm and alert.</li>
            <li>Love edens garden ,by far the fairest pricing .use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice, especially for the fall and holidays.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I know YL has astronomical prices, but so worth it for this blend.</li>
            <li>My daughter (who&#x27;s in elementary school)</li>
            <li>Putting Four Thieves on the bottom of my feet has now become a part of my morning routine and rarely do I have a headache now.  </li>
            <li>My favorite Edens Garden blend so far.  </li>
            <li>A powerful and uplifting blend that helped transform the energy of my office cubicle and workspace.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t be as powerful at some oils I have tried, but they are also 40 bucks.  </li>
            <li>I discovered the Aroma Soft diffuser (which I love) and Edens Garden oils.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the more cinnamon smell of young living thieves.</li>
            <li>This is turning out to be my favorite oil by far.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered more of the other brand to make sure I had some one hand with all the viruses going around.  </li>
            <li>It is also very allergy friendly and ive used it for my asthma by rubbing it on my chest.</li>
            <li>I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>Some companies have bought the right to say that, some have not.</li>
            <li>She was right.  </li>
            <li>and it cleared up right away.  </li>
            <li>Right when you feel any type of sickness come on, put it on right away and use it often.</li>
            <li>to sincerity apologize, inform me that this type of thing just \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t happen\\&quot;, and make things right to my utmost satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>Price was very attractive and especially you added info brochures on your other carried oils and the uses they perform - very well done - already making lists of the ones</li>
            <li>Very watery and dispenses too quickly.</li>
            <li>This brand of thieves oil is fair, but did not produce the same dramatic results that I had experienced with the higher end oil.</li>
            <li>The only gripe I have is how strong the smell is although its not a bad smell.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery</li>
            <li>Their oils are very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>If you are ordering from EG products for the first time, they come with an awesome little catalog with allof their products explaining all of their uses as well as what I like to call a \\&quot;cheat sheet\\&quot; for most common health issues and uses.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Four Thieves is one of my favorite essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I tried Edens Garden Four Thieves and Exhale first</li>
            <li>Many oils are sourced from the same locations throughout the world and there is no difference between vendors.</li>
            <li>a couple who massages together, stays together ;)</li>
            <li>Rub it on the bottom of your feet before bed and you simply won&#x27;t believe how much better you&#x27;ll feel in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and diffuse it daily to help keep sickness at bay!</li>
            <li>Order came pretty fast!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using it in the diffuser.</li>
            <li>I forgot about using it the first couple of days</li>
            <li>I first used the YSL version and then, I tried this.</li>
            <li>I also get a cup of boiling hot water</li>
            <li>; at the first onset of sickness, I used it on my son.</li>
            <li>I use this with a diffuser, and can definitely breathe better when I use it.  </li>
            <li>worked for exactly what I needed it for.</li>
            <li>when I need to purchase EO on Amazon I try to buy from Edens Garden first if they offer what I am looking for.</li>
            <li>I love this essential oil!</li>
            <li>Their shipping is not expensive and this is not a prime item on Amazon anyway.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils!!</li>
            <li>highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Love a mixture different herbs.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite essential oils of all.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love that I&#x27;m getting into the essential oils now.</li>
            <li>product and glad I didn&#x27;t buy into the gimmick out there paying $150.00 for a humidifier and essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Got it Love it and will definitely use your service again!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I bought this after discovering Thieves oil for the first time when a friend gave me some from YL.</li>
            <li>but I have felt no ill from doing so.</li>
            <li>I have cystic acne on my face, and was willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li>My husband actually likes this better.</li>
            <li>This item was exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>It is heavy on the lemon but not in a good way.</li>
            <li>a little strong on the cinnamon, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Aroma is pleasant and the quality is commensurate, if not better than that of the MLM blends on the market.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your oils are 100% pure essential oil, they include the Latin name of the plant on the bottle, that through some means you can verify country of origin (Eden&#x27;s is online at their website) and the company must be willing to provide MSDS sheets if requested.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant odor, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>great product but seems less potent than some of the other high quality brands</li>
            <li>I really like being able to get 4 Thieves in the larger bottle.</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t really know if it helped, but her feet sure did smell terrific!</li>
            <li>I have the Complete set they offer and as a budding aromatherapist, I think this brand is top notch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Burna few drops in my electric tart warmer and  it smells up my whole house plus it is good for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased a few of their oils and will continue to do so because their quality is exceptional without sticker shock  </li>
            <li>I am really looking forward to learning more about essential oils and their uses.</li>
            <li>I think DoTerra is still a better essential oil because it seems so much stronger.  </li>
            <li>will say that several other oils from this company have been great, and their shipping is always fast!</li>
            <li>I very pleased to have found this little gem.</li>
            <li>Also, the price is very reasonable and the shipping fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the positive oil and experience.</li>
            <li>Title pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>Since purchasing this item I have purchased several other Edens Garden&#x27;s oils and find them to be of great quality.</li>
            <li>I have not tried any other brands nor would I considering how effective Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s have been and how reasonably priced they are in comparison.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how much this is similar to another popular brand of theives oil.  </li>
            <li>I find myself mixing this with a few drops of other oils as well and the result is just wonderful.</li>
            <li>Your skin may be sensitive to this if it is used full strength.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Four Thieves oil and will purchase more essential oils from this company.</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like black licorice to me.</li>
            <li>As you may surmise, the ingredients such as clove give it a strong aroma.  </li>
            <li>Strong enough to fill up my large living room, and it&#x27;s a plus that it is known to fight sickness.  </li>
            <li>But the price is very reasonable and made this a decent alternative for the money.</li>
            <li>I have used it all winter to help ward off or keep a cold from going into a full blown episode and have had great success.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of poking around at other (more expensive) essential oil brands, and this one was the clear winner not only because of price, but because of great reviews and much more honest marketing.</li>
            <li>I also put it on the soles of my older children&#x27;s feet and they were mellow!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are other uses for this essential oil, but I love it; it has helped me and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It compares to high end oils I have used at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>There has been a huge difference in our health compared to last year.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>I really feel that it works to wars off colds and flu</li>
            <li>I was very hoarse very hours.  </li>
            <li>Very earthy to me and my clients (I am a massage therapist)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands like the commercial hand sanitizers that are mostly alcohol and water.</li>
            <li>We really like this blend for use in Yogi tea Maya cocoa spice tea.  </li>
            <li>So you should really try both of these blends.</li>
            <li>and I cannot say that it really had an impact on shortening their illness.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping .</li>
            <li>but, this smell is absolutely overpowering.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is very runny.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t describe the smell much...</li>
            <li>but I honestly really like it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend all Edens Garden oils!</li>
            <li>Our friend sells the real expenisve stuff and I bought this and put it in hands and inhale into mouth and hold and then into nostrils and once day had sore throat and did this</li>
            <li>Got here fast.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>Edens Garden seems to sell a plethora of EO at reasonable prices.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Absolutely a must have.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t put much stock into it working.</li>
            <li>Fantastic healing essential oil.</li>
            <li>I really like the Thieves blend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cinnamony.</li>
            <li>however your money can be spent in a better ways.</li>
            <li>It is also very calming to me.</li>
            <li>Very reviving and intense as an aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>Great story behind the Thieves oil.</li>
            <li>It absolutely works.</li>
            <li>He used it straight on his chest and under his nose.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thank you much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>hoping this really helps ward off colds this winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordered another bottle very soon.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold its scent inthe diffuser very well</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>until ready to mix with water.</li>
            <li>Absolutely compares to YL brand Thieves oil.</li>
            <li>Thieves oil should be heavy on the cinnamon and clove, the more powerful herbs in the formula.</li>
            <li>I have a few \\&quot;Now\\&quot; brand oils, which are quite good, but their blend nearly put it to shame</li>
            <li>I now make my own infusion on the stove and then add a few drops of thieves to strengthen concentrate.</li>
            <li>up the good work, Edens Garden, there are not many like you!</li>
            <li>The smell stays with you longer than most other products and does have a therapeutic effect.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and great price.</li>
            <li>Definitely a better price then the other brand.</li>
            <li>Love this ,,,and have added it as directed to a bottle with water and mist around the rooms as an antibacterial due to flu season which is on the rampage over here.</li>
            <li>Also, many other applications.</li>
            <li>I like to throw some on a clean rag and tumble it with my couch pillows and my kids stuffed animals for ten minutes to help freshen them up.</li>
            <li>I usually turn on my big vaporizer located in my bedroom about 1 to 2 hours before I retire for the night, and it makes the room smell great as well as help with my sinus headaches.  </li>
            <li>Has cleared up minor skin infections quickly!</li>
            <li>I purchased this for at least half of the price; but it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It is far less expensivd than some brands but just as effective.</li>
            <li>I usually blend my own, but thought I would try someone else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in anything that involves natural healing, or help, with the illnesses we face today.  </li>
            <li>Not quite the same as the young living blend, but smells pretty good all the same, definitely cheaper anyway.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare, but this is much more reasonable in price, especially since I use it mainly for cleaning and not personal health.  </li>
            <li>When I feel run down: I rub a drop or two on the top of my head and to the bottoms of my feet before yoga practice.</li>
            <li>Very strong scent that is long lasting.</li>
            <li>It was a little much for me, I was hoping to pick up on the eucalyptus scent more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this oil!</li>
            <li>Felt better in half the time of a 2 week virus</li>
            <li>I figure if it warded off the Black Plague (supposedly), it might keep the germs at bay.  :)</li>
            <li>Spicy and warm without smelling like dirty hippie. :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to find a company that provides quality essential grade oils at a price that us common folk can afford.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to get into oils, mainly because of the price.</li>
            <li>I massaged a bit of Four Thieves oil on the bottom of his feet and by the next day he was actually feeling better.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and the product actually works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Edens Garden oils.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Thieves Synergy blend.</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend Eden&#x27;s Garden over the rest ( Elizabeth Essentials</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality blend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Definitely a medicine cabinet and first aid kit staple!</li>
            <li>Right away, it was apparent that Edens Garden had sent me a very pure essential oil blend.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would come close to the Young Living brand</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is much stronger than the Young Living brand of thieves oil.</li>
            <li>We have avoided more than a few illnesses by using this oil.</li>
            <li>Love out a few drops in spray bottle for cleaning surfaces</li>
            <li>Hopefully, a few more nights of this</li>
            <li>Learning everyday of many uses for this product.</li>
            <li>However, in the winter it may be  useful to inhale it in steam for upper respiratory issues.</li>
            <li>This oil makes it smell like Christmas all over again,it makes the hole house smeel good, it also is so good to inhale,or if you have a cold or trouble breathing,bronchitis,any respatory problems.</li>
            <li>Love this essential oil, it smells great and keeps me from getting sick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already used it to stave off getting sick - great product!</li>
            <li>As I previously stated above, this was my first purchase of essential oils of any kind</li>
            <li>I used another brand&#x27;s eucalyptus oil in my new diffuser before this and my husband couldn&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good success with using it in cold and flu season as well as for cleaning.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think so, but even if it is, at least I&#x27;m not taking tons of OTC medicines that can&#x27;t be good for me to use on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does it help with cold season and germs, it is the perfect holiday scent.  </li>
            <li>Essential oils of cloves and cinnamon with other cheaper brands have a more penetrating odor than this.</li>
            <li>Eucalyptus radiata is safe for children not sure if that&#x27;s used in this one.    </li>
            <li>Love this oil blend!.I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in quality from this oil and the much more expensive &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; blends!</li>
            <li>This smells different when you first take it out of the bottle (minty, maybe?)</li>
            <li>This is my first with Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>Of course, I do my research first to learn as much as possible about the product before I try it.  </li>
            <li>But, that&#x27;s a small price to pay for feeling much better</li>
            <li>and I believe it helped keep us all healthy over this past winter and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>A little strong for someone who is hypersensitive, have had to figure out how to dilute it.</li>
            <li>This smell is a little strong for me.</li>
            <li>This oil smells very much like the same oil by Young Living.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it completely healed it, but it was significant enough that my teen daughter asked if she could also use it.  </li>
            <li>exact same thing as young living for a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li>I read the reviews of the four thieves essential oil for the much higher priced oil by Young Living.</li>
            <li>Not exactly same scent as that of a popular brand I have used in the past but will work.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other brands, but not bad</li>
            <li>It works, but the smell is definitely different from the YL brand...seems more diluted or less cinnamon smell.</li>
            <li>I have not used Four Thieves much but will in the very near future.  </li>
            <li>but I do spiritual work that calls for certain oils</li>
            <li>This oil is just as good as the more expensive brands for less than a third of the price.</li>
            <li>Also comes with a handy little brochure of different things you can use essential oils for.</li>
            <li>I sprinkle a few drops on two cotton balls and it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have not doubt that it would clear up your sinuses.  </li>
            <li>It must have been the eucalyptus;  I guess I&#x27;m sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the booklets that came with the essential oil are very informative.</li>
            <li>Comparable to Young Living</li>
            <li>They are so much cheaper because they cut out the middle man!</li>
            <li>WOW - just got this.  </li>
            <li>Husband&#x27;s week old sore throat is GONE</li>
            <li>The eucalyptus is completely over powering.</li>
            <li>and so it is a natural to use it.  </li>
            <li>I diffused this via humidifier in my 16 month old daughter&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li>4 of these would be the cost of one of the Young Livings oils.</li>
            <li>and she says it has really helped her concentration and focus immensely.</li>
            <li>Smells just like young living or the blend i make from scratch.</li>
            <li>It smell just like the one young living offers, but cheaper.</li>
            <li>But I use it straight on nothing mixed.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough to really attest to its effectiveness at this point though.</li>
            <li>This is unheard of for her this far into the school year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, all natural</li>
            <li>and I order from their website directly.  </li>
            <li>To me this is like Young Living Thieves.</li>
            <li>I have never purchased Young Living Thieves oil</li>
            <li>It so far has prevented the flu?</li>
            <li>up the old story on this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like using natural remedies for what ails me.  </li>
            <li>I really like my 4 thieves essential oil.</li>
            <li>I recommend this whole line of essential oils for whatever ails you too.</li>
            <li>No colds or flu so far this winter, knock on wood.</li>
            <li>This product was purchased directly from the EG website.</li>
            <li>My old boss will wonder why I am no longer buying the Young Living version.</li>
            <li>because I&#x27;m nursing I wanted something natural.</li>
            <li>I started using it on my face (blend with a carrier oil for sensitive skin, as always)  </li>
            <li>Just like Young Living and Doterra, but a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>It last much longer that way.</li>
            <li>Bottle is very poorly designed, it really need an eyedropper top or a better way to get a few drops out.  </li>
            <li>Love the small too!</li>
            <li>This is less sweet than the ingredients would suggest.  </li>
            <li>it does leave a little residue in my vaporizer so I have to clean it after every use with this one</li>
            <li>My Doctor suggested some ridiculously overpriced oils ( Young Living) at the time that worked better than what the drugs would have.</li>
            <li>I hate taking medicine and strive to live as naturally as possible, so this seems like a great alternative!</li>
            <li>Arrived much earlier then the arrival date; high quality product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Eden&#x27;s Garden Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>it was of such high quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to essential oils</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still experimenting with how to use it as I am new to essential oils and their uses.</li>
            <li>I may be new to this essential oils craze</li>
            <li>I repeat, this is my new essential oil store!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of essential oils</li>
            <li>This essential oil is affordable and equal in quality to any high priced oils I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Scent is very comparable to more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>She was markedly improved by the next morning.  </li>
            <li>The essential oils may be natural, but the chemistry changes as it enters the digestive sytem.</li>
            <li>Please consult a lisenced professional before consuming essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Terrific alternative to Young Living Thieves.</li>
            <li>Be careful using too much.</li>
            <li>I just barely received this oil</li>
            <li>I used to work in a Chiropractic Clinic where we sold Young Living Thieves Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>Good to use during cold and flu season</li>
            <li>It will be good for winter when cold season has arrived.</li>
            <li>four thieves is essential for the household, use on your body, and tap a little into your trash can to remove smells,  this is your super oil</li>
            <li>I do wish the Eucalyptus was less strong than the other oils, but</li>
            <li>Strong, concentrated effective for making my bug repellent.  </li>
            <li>Helped my daughter get well quickly after rubbing a few drops under her feet!</li>
            <li>Cheaper than the other brands and just as effective,would buy from again soon thanks</li>
            <li>I love the story behind this essential oil.</li>
            <li>Really helps you breathe better if you have a cold or sinus issues.</li>
            <li>blend will be found listed in the Essential Oils Pocket Reference as Thieves Oil with some general discussion and suggested uses.  </li>
            <li>they all came down with a virus,,,I used Four Thieves the whole time there and never got whatever bug they had.  </li>
            <li>I bought hoping that the formula was the same as Young Living Theives at a better price point however, I was sadly mistaken; the two are very different.</li>
            <li>It costs a little more than I like to spend, but a little does go a long way.  </li>
            <li>It came with a catalog and a little booklet describing how to use certain essential oils.</li>
            <li>This one appears to be much more subtle with perhaps less cinnamon and clove or maybe diluted a bit.</li>

            <li> If you make your own cleaners you will want this!</li>
            <li> The customer service was remarkable as well.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the customer service is excellent!</li>

            <li> As good of quality as Doterra</li>

            <li> The four thieves must have stolen the recipe to make this stuff smell good, unless you like the smell of rotten hippy...</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a good knock off.</li>
            <li> It will be good for a soap for a man, or for a multipurpose cleanser.  </li>

            <li> Good product.</li>

            <li> Sickness has been all over this holiday season, and my family has been healthy and sickness free dispite being around many people who have been passing around the funk at the holiday gatherings and in the stores.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite!!</li>

            <li> This oil smells so good and tests as a pure oil.  </li>
            <li> Edens Garden is of such GREAT quality and such a GREAT price!</li>
            <li> but so far, we are happy with the product.</li>
            <li> We enjoy using this in our diffuser for the scent and for the benefit of keeping us safe from the germs of the winter season.</li>
            <li> Wow, this smells great.  </li>
            <li> Side by side with Young Living made me happy.  </li>
            <li> A great alternative to DoTerra or Young Living.</li>
            <li> When using topically, make sure you have a good carrier oil, like coconut, to cut the oil&#x27;s heat some and to create a nice massaging oil that goes farther than one drop or two drops will.</li>
            <li> Came in fast and was packaged good.</li>
            <li> As good as Thieves at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li> This product was packaged very well, and they even included info on how to use oil and what is good for what condition.</li>
            <li> Use your own judgment, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> While I enjoyed the scent when I smelled it in the bottle, it quickly began to overwhelmingly smell of cloves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but not only does this oil smell amazing, perfect for the room oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about the quality of this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since purchased other Eden&#x27;s Garden oils and have been very happy with the others as well.    </li>
            <li> This is perfect for mixing with some other oils to make drops for your toothbrush and brushing your teeth to prevent and  kill gingivitis.  </li>
            <li> My son has allergy problem and easily catch flu.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy and thankful to find therapeutic grade oils at such a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this oil for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Very quick to respond to any concerns or questions.</li>
            <li> Arrived 2 days early, very sturdy and protective packaging, and the best quality product I could hope for.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had success with this knocking out illness like some people claim, but I sure love the scent.</li>
            <li> Can use with distilled or filtered water to clean floor, as air freshener, on counter tops, diffuse in room to prevent spread of viruses and bacteria and much more.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t handle strong smells.</li>
            <li> Strong cinnamon and clove notes.</li>
            <li> It is a strong smell and will fill your room with a christmas-y type of smell.</li>
            <li> It will irritate my throat if too strong.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this product, so far I am delighted with the product.</li>
            <li> (it is rather strong and will sting the tongue a bit).</li>
            <li> The blend is no different in mix and is beautiful in smell.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if that is true or not, but it is interesting.</li>
            <li> Four Thieves Blend Essential oil is really nice, but I prefer the Young Living brand the best.  </li>
            <li> So it might be fine for you.</li>
            <li> I put this in a diffuser and with in 15-20 minutes, the runny nose was gone and she was breathing fine.  </li>
            <li> I combine some of these based on his symptoms and run it in my diffusor and he is fine all night.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine, thank you.</li>
            <li> This particular oil is great for so many things , it really helped with the viruses this yr .</li>
            <li> Very natural product that is good to use for the skin.</li>
            <li> I love their oils, and the booklet they send with every order comes as a handy reference when I&#x27;m thinking about ordering something new.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in hopes that it would be as good as the Young Living brand I had received in a kit and that I would receive it more quickly.  </li>
            <li> In fact, Edens Garden&#x27;s smell even better, or should I say more pure maybe?</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It has a fabulous cinnamon clove scent with a hint of citrus.</li>
            <li> Smells great, diffused the last two nights while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> Customer service is nice and replies very timely.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using essential oils for a couple of years &amp; heard great things about Four Theives blend.</li>
            <li> Helped with my Bronchitis last Winters end before spring and also made house smell great when I used it in my steamer  thx medicine</li>
            <li> Suggested by a friend who is an RN to help keep my family germ free.</li>
            <li> Eden&#x27;s a Garden makes great quality essential oils.</li>
            <li> and fantastic for killing body odors (again, ask my son...).</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Works great in my Allay Essential Oil Diffuser.</li>
            <li> Shipping was excellent--arrived precisely on date promised.</li>
            <li> I want it to always be available for use in homemade products and for health issues as well.</li>
            <li> As a sinus sufferer, this essential oil is great to use in a vaporizer.  </li>

            <li> Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic oil blend.</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as good as the Young Living blend</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as young living Theives.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It smells good but does nothing as far as healing properties.</li>
            <li> Edens Garden also provided a wonderful product guide along with 101 ways to use essential oils which is very informative.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as the oil from Young Living.  </li>
            <li> This scent is spicy and just plain wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Since I use it to clean counter tops and in homemade hand sanitizers it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Very nice blend of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Remember, oils are super concentrated and it&#x27;s easy to overdo them.</li>
            <li> Love the product, love the price, I even loved the little book it came with.</li>
            <li> Super happy with all of my Essential oils from Edens Garden.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my Thieves.</li>
            <li> Love adding it to my mop bucket to freshen the whole house!  </li>
            <li> My husband thought it was overwhelming at first</li>
            <li> I filled my diffuser full of water and added 2-3 drops per the diffuser recommendation.</li>
            <li> My husband and I manage to stay pretty healthy, but a couple times during the year I get some sort of respiratory infection.</li>
            <li> Good general use oil</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very satisfied with all my purchases.</li>
            <li> (Much more reasonably priced as well!)</li>
            <li> Great aroma and long ladting versus any of the orher brands.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing essential oil out there.  </li>
            <li> I have used this oil in my oil diffuser, and I like to clean with it also.</li>
            <li> takes away that wet puppy smell and keeps the whole house smelling great!</li>
            <li> use this in dehumidifier and to clean with.</li>
            <li> Clean smell and hopefully cleaning air.</li>
            <li> Made her not sick with in 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> I shall next order from you.thanknyou for a well priced first class oil thats rich and smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Thieves for a long time, and am excited to think the quality and purity is as good as the reviews sound.</li>
            <li> Compared to young living products,you have done an amazing job with the oil combinations.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, just what I expected</li>
            <li> I leave the important ones, like OnGuard and Clary Calm to Do-Terra.</li>
            <li> Good price on this 4 thieves essential oils</li>
            <li> We loved the Thieves essential oil.</li>
            <li> but when you compare it to Doterra&#x27;s On Guard, I much prefer On Guard - which is a more premium product.</li>
            <li> I like sweet smells</li>
            <li> Thieves a superior essential oil to kill germs and bacteria in the home- either being difussed or added to cleaning products.</li>
            <li> 6mo - 2yrs, mix 30 drops of sweet orange, 40 drops of cinnamon leaf and 25 drops of fir needle.</li>
            <li> For children 3-5yrs mix 30 drops sweet orange, 20 drops of clove, 20 drops cinnamon leaf and 25 drops of fir needle.</li>
            <li> YL&#x27;s blend is more like clove and so much nicer.</li>
            <li> Wished I could have the full ingredient listings.</li>
            <li> I simply love to smell it and it really relaxes me.  </li>
            <li> very concentrated...only needed a drop :)</li>
            <li> I loved this oil and all of the oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden, of which I&#x27;ve now tried several.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I could order it and any ready to try it out but have not had a reason to yet.</li>
            <li> I just spray my hands frequently and gives a nice comforting smell too</li>
            <li> This has a bit too much clove smell for me - I got this to help me sleep &amp; the clove smell was too overwhelming for me.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad, I like it</li>
            <li> Great smell, not a strong as young living, but depending on the use good substitute.</li>
            <li> Edens Gardens essential oils are a great value and as good of a product as any other.</li>
            <li> However, I wasn&#x27;t aware I needed to add it to another oil -- it was extremely strong.  </li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product, and extremely helpful</li>
            <li> great for taking down inflammation and pain in my knee and last a good 8-10 hours</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not into the super earthy/hippie smells.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this essential oil :)</li>
            <li> This is what I needed and it came in quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many of the different companies that make an immune defense blend;  Eden&#x27;s Garden and Elizabeth Essentials are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Super speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Love this scent - will definitely purchase more.  </li>
            <li> While this company does not participate in Prime, the product does ship quickly</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit woody to me, but blends in quickly.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell to this oil high quality</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product,  I will be buying more oils from this company.</li>
            <li> One of my very favorite essential blends.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality!!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> You can buy anything from this company with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;They also include a fabulous little encyclopedia of herbs and their own synergy blends, and a great pamphlet with 101 uses for essential oils.</li>
            <li> This may be my new favorite blended oil.</li>
            <li> This smells really good, not sure that it is as healthy for me as it says.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Edens Garden !!!  </li>
            <li> I have smelled four thieves made by a different vendor &amp; it was much better!</li>
            <li> Thanks Eden&#x27;s Garden for helping me afford to keep my family safer from this germy world!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more from Eden&#x27;s Garden!</li>
            <li> One of my favorites from Edens Garden, and VERY affordable!!  </li>
            <li> and it really has helped!!</li>
            <li> it was definitely warm to put on the skin (temple, third eye, supersternal notch, wrists) but it was not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use with a little water to help get rid of unwanted oders.</li>
            <li> Liked it but the cinnamon scent is quite strong, can&#x27;t tell if there are other scents in this bottle.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops in my humidifier and it smells great to me</li>
            <li> I use it in my vaporized when I want to feel calm and alert.</li>
            <li> Love edens garden ,by far the fairest pricing .use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice, especially for the fall and holidays.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I know YL has astronomical prices, but so worth it for this blend.</li>
            <li> My daughter (who&#x27;s in elementary school)</li>
            <li> Putting Four Thieves on the bottom of my feet has now become a part of my morning routine and rarely do I have a headache now.  </li>
            <li> My favorite Edens Garden blend so far.  </li>
            <li> A powerful and uplifting blend that helped transform the energy of my office cubicle and workspace.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be as powerful at some oils I have tried, but they are also 40 bucks.  </li>
            <li> I discovered the Aroma Soft diffuser (which I love) and Edens Garden oils.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the more cinnamon smell of young living thieves.</li>
            <li> This is turning out to be my favorite oil by far.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered more of the other brand to make sure I had some one hand with all the viruses going around.  </li>
            <li> It is also very allergy friendly and ive used it for my asthma by rubbing it on my chest.</li>
            <li> I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> Some companies have bought the right to say that, some have not.</li>
            <li> She was right.  </li>
            <li> and it cleared up right away.  </li>
            <li> Right when you feel any type of sickness come on, put it on right away and use it often.</li>
            <li> to sincerity apologize, inform me that this type of thing just \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t happen\\&quot;, and make things right to my utmost satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> Price was very attractive and especially you added info brochures on your other carried oils and the uses they perform - very well done - already making lists of the ones</li>
            <li> Very watery and dispenses too quickly.</li>
            <li> This brand of thieves oil is fair, but did not produce the same dramatic results that I had experienced with the higher end oil.</li>
            <li> The only gripe I have is how strong the smell is although its not a bad smell.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery</li>
            <li> Their oils are very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> If you are ordering from EG products for the first time, they come with an awesome little catalog with allof their products explaining all of their uses as well as what I like to call a \\&quot;cheat sheet\\&quot; for most common health issues and uses.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Four Thieves is one of my favorite essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I tried Edens Garden Four Thieves and Exhale first</li>
            <li> Many oils are sourced from the same locations throughout the world and there is no difference between vendors.</li>
            <li> a couple who massages together, stays together ;)</li>
            <li> Rub it on the bottom of your feet before bed and you simply won&#x27;t believe how much better you&#x27;ll feel in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and diffuse it daily to help keep sickness at bay!</li>
            <li> Order came pretty fast!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using it in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I forgot about using it the first couple of days</li>
            <li> I first used the YSL version and then, I tried this.</li>
            <li> I also get a cup of boiling hot water</li>
            <li> ; at the first onset of sickness, I used it on my son.</li>
            <li> I use this with a diffuser, and can definitely breathe better when I use it.  </li>
            <li> worked for exactly what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> when I need to purchase EO on Amazon I try to buy from Edens Garden first if they offer what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil!</li>
            <li> Their shipping is not expensive and this is not a prime item on Amazon anyway.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils!!</li>
            <li> highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Love a mixture different herbs.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite essential oils of all.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love that I&#x27;m getting into the essential oils now.</li>
            <li> product and glad I didn&#x27;t buy into the gimmick out there paying $150.00 for a humidifier and essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Got it Love it and will definitely use your service again!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this after discovering Thieves oil for the first time when a friend gave me some from YL.</li>
            <li> but I have felt no ill from doing so.</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne on my face, and was willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li> My husband actually likes this better.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> It is heavy on the lemon but not in a good way.</li>
            <li> a little strong on the cinnamon, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Aroma is pleasant and the quality is commensurate, if not better than that of the MLM blends on the market.</li>
            <li> Just make sure your oils are 100% pure essential oil, they include the Latin name of the plant on the bottle, that through some means you can verify country of origin (Eden&#x27;s is online at their website) and the company must be willing to provide MSDS sheets if requested.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant odor, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> great product but seems less potent than some of the other high quality brands</li>
            <li> I really like being able to get 4 Thieves in the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t really know if it helped, but her feet sure did smell terrific!</li>
            <li> I have the Complete set they offer and as a budding aromatherapist, I think this brand is top notch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Burna few drops in my electric tart warmer and  it smells up my whole house plus it is good for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few of their oils and will continue to do so because their quality is exceptional without sticker shock  </li>
            <li> I am really looking forward to learning more about essential oils and their uses.</li>
            <li> I think DoTerra is still a better essential oil because it seems so much stronger.  </li>
            <li> will say that several other oils from this company have been great, and their shipping is always fast!</li>
            <li> I very pleased to have found this little gem.</li>
            <li> Also, the price is very reasonable and the shipping fast.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the positive oil and experience.</li>
            <li> Title pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing this item I have purchased several other Edens Garden&#x27;s oils and find them to be of great quality.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other brands nor would I considering how effective Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s have been and how reasonably priced they are in comparison.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how much this is similar to another popular brand of theives oil.  </li>
            <li> I find myself mixing this with a few drops of other oils as well and the result is just wonderful.</li>
            <li> Your skin may be sensitive to this if it is used full strength.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Four Thieves oil and will purchase more essential oils from this company.</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like black licorice to me.</li>
            <li> As you may surmise, the ingredients such as clove give it a strong aroma.  </li>
            <li> Strong enough to fill up my large living room, and it&#x27;s a plus that it is known to fight sickness.  </li>
            <li> But the price is very reasonable and made this a decent alternative for the money.</li>
            <li> I have used it all winter to help ward off or keep a cold from going into a full blown episode and have had great success.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of poking around at other (more expensive) essential oil brands, and this one was the clear winner not only because of price, but because of great reviews and much more honest marketing.</li>
            <li> I also put it on the soles of my older children&#x27;s feet and they were mellow!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are other uses for this essential oil, but I love it; it has helped me and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It compares to high end oils I have used at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> There has been a huge difference in our health compared to last year.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> I really feel that it works to wars off colds and flu</li>
            <li> I was very hoarse very hours.  </li>
            <li> Very earthy to me and my clients (I am a massage therapist)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Smells clean and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands like the commercial hand sanitizers that are mostly alcohol and water.</li>
            <li> We really like this blend for use in Yogi tea Maya cocoa spice tea.  </li>
            <li> So you should really try both of these blends.</li>
            <li> and I cannot say that it really had an impact on shortening their illness.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping .</li>
            <li> but, this smell is absolutely overpowering.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is very runny.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe the smell much...</li>
            <li> but I honestly really like it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend all Edens Garden oils!</li>
            <li> Our friend sells the real expenisve stuff and I bought this and put it in hands and inhale into mouth and hold and then into nostrils and once day had sore throat and did this</li>
            <li> Got here fast.</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> Edens Garden seems to sell a plethora of EO at reasonable prices.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a must have.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t put much stock into it working.</li>
            <li> Fantastic healing essential oil.</li>
            <li> I really like the Thieves blend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cinnamony.</li>
            <li> however your money can be spent in a better ways.</li>
            <li> It is also very calming to me.</li>
            <li> Very reviving and intense as an aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> Great story behind the Thieves oil.</li>
            <li> It absolutely works.</li>
            <li> He used it straight on his chest and under his nose.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thank you much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> hoping this really helps ward off colds this winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordered another bottle very soon.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold its scent inthe diffuser very well</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> until ready to mix with water.</li>
            <li> Absolutely compares to YL brand Thieves oil.</li>
            <li> Thieves oil should be heavy on the cinnamon and clove, the more powerful herbs in the formula.</li>
            <li> I have a few \\&quot;Now\\&quot; brand oils, which are quite good, but their blend nearly put it to shame</li>
            <li> I now make my own infusion on the stove and then add a few drops of thieves to strengthen concentrate.</li>
            <li> up the good work, Edens Garden, there are not many like you!</li>
            <li> The smell stays with you longer than most other products and does have a therapeutic effect.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and great price.</li>
            <li> Definitely a better price then the other brand.</li>
            <li> Love this ,,,and have added it as directed to a bottle with water and mist around the rooms as an antibacterial due to flu season which is on the rampage over here.</li>
            <li> Also, many other applications.</li>
            <li> I like to throw some on a clean rag and tumble it with my couch pillows and my kids stuffed animals for ten minutes to help freshen them up.</li>
            <li> I usually turn on my big vaporizer located in my bedroom about 1 to 2 hours before I retire for the night, and it makes the room smell great as well as help with my sinus headaches.  </li>
            <li> Has cleared up minor skin infections quickly!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for at least half of the price; but it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It is far less expensivd than some brands but just as effective.</li>
            <li> I usually blend my own, but thought I would try someone else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in anything that involves natural healing, or help, with the illnesses we face today.  </li>
            <li> Not quite the same as the young living blend, but smells pretty good all the same, definitely cheaper anyway.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare, but this is much more reasonable in price, especially since I use it mainly for cleaning and not personal health.  </li>
            <li> When I feel run down: I rub a drop or two on the top of my head and to the bottoms of my feet before yoga practice.</li>
            <li> Very strong scent that is long lasting.</li>
            <li> It was a little much for me, I was hoping to pick up on the eucalyptus scent more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this oil!</li>
            <li> Felt better in half the time of a 2 week virus</li>
            <li> I figure if it warded off the Black Plague (supposedly), it might keep the germs at bay.  :)</li>
            <li> Spicy and warm without smelling like dirty hippie. :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to find a company that provides quality essential grade oils at a price that us common folk can afford.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get into oils, mainly because of the price.</li>
            <li> I massaged a bit of Four Thieves oil on the bottom of his feet and by the next day he was actually feeling better.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and the product actually works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Edens Garden oils.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Thieves Synergy blend.</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend Eden&#x27;s Garden over the rest ( Elizabeth Essentials</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality blend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Definitely a medicine cabinet and first aid kit staple!</li>
            <li> Right away, it was apparent that Edens Garden had sent me a very pure essential oil blend.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would come close to the Young Living brand</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is much stronger than the Young Living brand of thieves oil.</li>
            <li> We have avoided more than a few illnesses by using this oil.</li>
            <li> Love out a few drops in spray bottle for cleaning surfaces</li>
            <li> Hopefully, a few more nights of this</li>
            <li> Learning everyday of many uses for this product.</li>
            <li> However, in the winter it may be  useful to inhale it in steam for upper respiratory issues.</li>
            <li> This oil makes it smell like Christmas all over again,it makes the hole house smeel good, it also is so good to inhale,or if you have a cold or trouble breathing,bronchitis,any respatory problems.</li>
            <li> Love this essential oil, it smells great and keeps me from getting sick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used it to stave off getting sick - great product!</li>
            <li> As I previously stated above, this was my first purchase of essential oils of any kind</li>
            <li> I used another brand&#x27;s eucalyptus oil in my new diffuser before this and my husband couldn&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good success with using it in cold and flu season as well as for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think so, but even if it is, at least I&#x27;m not taking tons of OTC medicines that can&#x27;t be good for me to use on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only does it help with cold season and germs, it is the perfect holiday scent.  </li>
            <li> Essential oils of cloves and cinnamon with other cheaper brands have a more penetrating odor than this.</li>
            <li> Eucalyptus radiata is safe for children not sure if that&#x27;s used in this one.    </li>
            <li> Love this oil blend!.I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in quality from this oil and the much more expensive &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; blends!</li>
            <li> This smells different when you first take it out of the bottle (minty, maybe?)</li>
            <li> This is my first with Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I do my research first to learn as much as possible about the product before I try it.  </li>
            <li> But, that&#x27;s a small price to pay for feeling much better</li>
            <li> and I believe it helped keep us all healthy over this past winter and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> A little strong for someone who is hypersensitive, have had to figure out how to dilute it.</li>
            <li> This smell is a little strong for me.</li>
            <li> This oil smells very much like the same oil by Young Living.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it completely healed it, but it was significant enough that my teen daughter asked if she could also use it.  </li>
            <li> exact same thing as young living for a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of the four thieves essential oil for the much higher priced oil by Young Living.</li>
            <li> Not exactly same scent as that of a popular brand I have used in the past but will work.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other brands, but not bad</li>
            <li> It works, but the smell is definitely different from the YL brand...seems more diluted or less cinnamon smell.</li>
            <li> I have not used Four Thieves much but will in the very near future.  </li>
            <li> but I do spiritual work that calls for certain oils</li>
            <li> This oil is just as good as the more expensive brands for less than a third of the price.</li>
            <li> Also comes with a handy little brochure of different things you can use essential oils for.</li>
            <li> I sprinkle a few drops on two cotton balls and it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I have not doubt that it would clear up your sinuses.  </li>
            <li> It must have been the eucalyptus;  I guess I&#x27;m sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the booklets that came with the essential oil are very informative.</li>
            <li> Comparable to Young Living</li>
            <li> They are so much cheaper because they cut out the middle man!</li>
            <li> WOW - just got this.  </li>
            <li> Husband&#x27;s week old sore throat is GONE</li>
            <li> The eucalyptus is completely over powering.</li>
            <li> and so it is a natural to use it.  </li>
            <li> I diffused this via humidifier in my 16 month old daughter&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li> 4 of these would be the cost of one of the Young Livings oils.</li>
            <li> and she says it has really helped her concentration and focus immensely.</li>
            <li> Smells just like young living or the blend i make from scratch.</li>
            <li> It smell just like the one young living offers, but cheaper.</li>
            <li> But I use it straight on nothing mixed.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to really attest to its effectiveness at this point though.</li>
            <li> This is unheard of for her this far into the school year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, all natural</li>
            <li> and I order from their website directly.  </li>
            <li> To me this is like Young Living Thieves.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased Young Living Thieves oil</li>
            <li> It so far has prevented the flu?</li>
            <li> up the old story on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like using natural remedies for what ails me.  </li>
            <li> I really like my 4 thieves essential oil.</li>
            <li> I recommend this whole line of essential oils for whatever ails you too.</li>
            <li> No colds or flu so far this winter, knock on wood.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased directly from the EG website.</li>
            <li> My old boss will wonder why I am no longer buying the Young Living version.</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;m nursing I wanted something natural.</li>
            <li> I started using it on my face (blend with a carrier oil for sensitive skin, as always)  </li>
            <li> Just like Young Living and Doterra, but a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It last much longer that way.</li>
            <li> Bottle is very poorly designed, it really need an eyedropper top or a better way to get a few drops out.  </li>
            <li> Love the small too!</li>
            <li> This is less sweet than the ingredients would suggest.  </li>
            <li> it does leave a little residue in my vaporizer so I have to clean it after every use with this one</li>
            <li> My Doctor suggested some ridiculously overpriced oils ( Young Living) at the time that worked better than what the drugs would have.</li>
            <li> I hate taking medicine and strive to live as naturally as possible, so this seems like a great alternative!</li>
            <li> Arrived much earlier then the arrival date; high quality product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend Eden&#x27;s Garden Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> it was of such high quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still experimenting with how to use it as I am new to essential oils and their uses.</li>
            <li> I may be new to this essential oils craze</li>
            <li> I repeat, this is my new essential oil store!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of essential oils</li>
            <li> This essential oil is affordable and equal in quality to any high priced oils I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Scent is very comparable to more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> She was markedly improved by the next morning.  </li>
            <li> The essential oils may be natural, but the chemistry changes as it enters the digestive sytem.</li>
            <li> Please consult a lisenced professional before consuming essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Terrific alternative to Young Living Thieves.</li>
            <li> Be careful using too much.</li>
            <li> I just barely received this oil</li>
            <li> I used to work in a Chiropractic Clinic where we sold Young Living Thieves Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> Good to use during cold and flu season</li>
            <li> It will be good for winter when cold season has arrived.</li>
            <li> four thieves is essential for the household, use on your body, and tap a little into your trash can to remove smells,  this is your super oil</li>
            <li> I do wish the Eucalyptus was less strong than the other oils, but</li>
            <li> Strong, concentrated effective for making my bug repellent.  </li>
            <li> Helped my daughter get well quickly after rubbing a few drops under her feet!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the other brands and just as effective,would buy from again soon thanks</li>
            <li> I love the story behind this essential oil.</li>
            <li> Really helps you breathe better if you have a cold or sinus issues.</li>
            <li> blend will be found listed in the Essential Oils Pocket Reference as Thieves Oil with some general discussion and suggested uses.  </li>
            <li> they all came down with a virus,,,I used Four Thieves the whole time there and never got whatever bug they had.  </li>
            <li> I bought hoping that the formula was the same as Young Living Theives at a better price point however, I was sadly mistaken; the two are very different.</li>
            <li> It costs a little more than I like to spend, but a little does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> It came with a catalog and a little booklet describing how to use certain essential oils.</li>
            <li> This one appears to be much more subtle with perhaps less cinnamon and clove or maybe diluted a bit.</li>
            <li> I find Edens Gardens to be a high quality product for less.</li>
            <li> Extremely fragrant and comparable to Young Living&#x27;s Thieves Oil.</li>
            <li> Good bye, flu &amp; cold symptoms!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m to the bottom of the bottle and need to get some more especially with cold season coming.  </li>
            <li> Made having a cold and sinus infection much more bearable especially during Christmas!  </li>
            <li> Arrived super fast and helped protect me from getting sick when normally I come down with every bug I encounter.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Edens Gardens in the past and this particular oil did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> This has so many uses from helping you sleep to getting over a cold.</li>
            <li> Love it and used it for my cold.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fragrance of Four Thieves and will rub a drop on my feet every morning for prevention during this cold and flu season.  </li>
            <li> With cold season coming up, I plan on using (and buying) more of this product.</li>
            <li> I use this for the dark blemish left in the middle of my fore head and on the side of forehead.  </li>
            <li> out there can spell a long illness that means missed school, Dr&#x27;s bills and the like.</li>
            <li> It helps when you have long hours on an airplane</li>
            <li> within a few weeks the blemish is completely gone  and stay gone for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not sure what Theives oil is supposed to smell like... new to this still.  </li>
            <li> I find these oil bland very useful I rub it on my chest, neck, behind my ears.</li>
            <li> I used this when I felt a cold coming on and by the next morning, I was feeling just fine.  </li>
            <li> As long as I use either one , I don&#x27;t need a flu shot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other blends that claim to be like Four Theives, however there&#x27;s been such a difference.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of info on the web from medical journals/peer reviews of research  of the oils outperforming antibiotics and other medicines.</li>
            <li> Cinnamon definitely overpowers the other fragrances</li>
            <li> I received this along with a diffuser and assorted other essential oils.  </li>
            <li> After getting advice from a friend that this oil takes odors out of clothes I was skeptical, but after using vinegar, baking soda, oxy clean, leaving my clothes in the sun and various other chemicals I almost gave up and threw my clothes away,</li>
            <li> Put Thieves in your humidifier to spread it through out your home and use it to clean when someone has been ill.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really put this one to the test yet, but will try it if I every get another serious infection that needs treatment.</li>
            <li> I have put a few drops in my regular bottle of hand wash and use it every time I&#x27;m out in public places.</li>
            <li> Also, this particular oil shouldn&#x27;t be used on small children due to the cloves.</li>
            <li> Most of her class became sick and missed several days of school.  </li>
            <li> Rid my entire family of illness in 2 days versus the average 7.</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing his it works when I start it earlier on when I&#x27;m coming down with something.</li>
            <li> Smells the same and less price.</li>
            <li> I much less open the bottle</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and other more expensive brands except for the price!</li>
            <li> This last winter (2014) is the first time I diffused this during cold and flu season and my entire family benefitted.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time believing it&#x27;s coincidence that neither of us have so much had a sniffle.</li>
            <li> I add a little lavender essential oil and spray it on doorknobs, faucet handles, counters, etc.  </li>
            <li> A better product and less expensive because you are not having to pay the multi level marketing price!</li>
            <li> so be careful if ingesting.</li>
            <li> This oil works just as expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected after all the rave reviews...</li>
            <li> I just recently spent a couple weeks with my Grandson and his family....</li>
            <li> Allegedly this oil is helpful with keeping germs at bay.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> I run these a lot and the aroma is what is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Item received sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Service was what was expected.</li>
            <li> I will use the Edens Garden in my diffuser so my money won&#x27;t be a total waste.</li>
            <li> I put it on cotton balls under the sinks.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been in the diffuser for the last few hours.</li>
            <li> but within a few days I noticed a definite difference.  </li>
            <li> I put a cotton ball with a few drops in all my garbage cans and in my vacuum cleaner bag.</li>
            <li> My husband got sick as a dog, but I was able to keep it at bay and I attribute this to using Thieves on the bottom of my feet every night.</li>
            <li> I notice the Cinnamon more in this than other brands which isn&#x27;t a bad thing</li>
            <li> This fall he has not got sick, I don&#x27;t  know if it was the essential oil, the new vitamin (I spent three months researching to find something of quality, because the trademarks are chemically pure and sugar) or sambucus Elderberry immune or the green juices that I am giving to him.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness, though, because I&#x27;m going to stick to the other Thieves formulas that aren&#x27;t quite as appalling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have a small humidifier next to my bed</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s due to diffusing Thieves</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Essentials is pharmecuitcal grade , meaning it brakes the blood brain barrier - it is sold at Multi Care hospital&#x27;s therapy so ax&amp; other Day</li>
            <li> smells nothing like the other thieves blends that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I could not smell any other scent included in it,</li>
            <li> This is a blend of Clove, Cinnamon Bark, Rosemary, Lemon, and Eucalyptus oils, also sold by other companies as Thieves Oil, or by other names.  </li>
            <li> I will not buy the YL or the other D brand, their prices are nuts.  </li>
            <li> But the price from the other company was beyond my budget.  </li>
            <li> I  am still using the other product I purchased from Amazon before I use this product.</li>
            <li> you get from other oils offered from MLM companies.</li>
            <li> and I have already bought 5 other oils from this company.</li>
            <li> Not exact but would not expect them to be.</li>
            <li> I like this and other products from Edens Garden.  </li>
            <li> A few drops in my diffuser goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I went home for vacation, got a cold, and used this when I returned to recover quickly.</li>
            <li> and this is not very sweet</li>
            <li> The blend is quite weak about 30-40% potency compared to doTerra.&lt;br /&gt;Likely less clove oil is used as it is more expensive</li>
            <li> Consuming Essential oils can be very dangerous and should only be done if under the care of a lisenced medical professional.</li>
            <li> The next day no more coughing and active as ever!</li>
            <li> Had to add some lavender to tone it down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try and mix it with something else to tone it down.</li>
            <li> i tried it on other family members and it seemed to kick these germies in the butt !</li>
            <li> Im writing this review a month after I purchased the oil, and I just used my last few drops this morning!!</li>
            <li> and I truly see a huge drop in the amount of times my kids have been sick compared to last.2 drops on thier feet every morning.</li>
            <li> I use a drop of this under my nose when I start feeling a cold coming on and it wipes it right out.</li>
            <li> It was $40 compared to this blend, which was WAY less, and decided on this.</li>
            <li> , she is less hyper and has less mosquitos.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like the black licorice smell.</li>
            <li> When I have felt tired or run-down or have been exposed to a nephew with a cold, I have inhaled from the bottle and felt much better too.</li>
            <li> but like all essential oils, the effects are subtle.  </li>
            <li> Although it is a very invigorating scent, especially when sick, it is not recommended as a stand alone perfume.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to smell a little less medicine-y.  </li>
            <li> this is not normal!!!!</li>
            <li> the other EO in this blend have very little influence---IF they are even there!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that the clove smell would overpower everything else, but out of the bottle</li>
            <li> I added about 20 drops in a 12 oz bottle of avacado carrier oil to moisturize my skin and give my immune system a little boost.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i know they are there---as this is not rocket science---sad that there is little truth in advertising.</li>
            <li> Every little sneeze, sort, cough, virus, bacteria, etc....</li>
            <li> Eden sends out a well written little booklet with each bottle ordered to explain the benefits of all their oils and uses.  </li>
            <li> took a little getting used to the scent.</li>
            <li> I rub a few drops on the bottom of my feet and a little on my throat glands when colds are going around</li>
            <li> Not very agreable, but very efficient against bad smells.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother, and she really likes to diffuse it during cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> We went through the whole traveling Christmas season without picking up the flu or even a cold.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to see if I was missing something.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> add a few drops</li>
            <li> After the inital turning on of the humidifier, the smell lightened a bit and, even though she still had a cruddy nose and cough, she was able to get some sleep.</li>
            <li> In the humidifier in the baby&#x27;s room, in a spray bottle with rubbing alcohol as a disinfectant, diffuse during germ season, sanitize baby bottles, and on our feet with some coconut oil when we&#x27;re starting to feel poorly.</li>
            <li> I have since been amazed that what our relatives just 2-3 generations ago used everyday, we are now rediscovering.</li>
            <li> I wear this oil everyday....</li>
            <li> Too heavy on the eucalyptus oil.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was slow but arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I like to put a few drops on a wipe and drop it in my daughter&#x27;s cloth diaper pail.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on the bottom of my feet each morning.</li>
            <li> and I still use Four Thieves every night since August on the bottoms of our feet and have only gotten one minor cold over Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Search no more for a less expensive yet equal quality oil.</li>
            <li> I live my career, can&#x27;t be sidelined with a cold, flu.</li>
            <li> first sign of any illness i apply to bottom of feet and the ailing area, and have not been sick all winter.</li>
            <li> I had already her sick for about 5 days and had shown improvement from other natural remedies when receiving this product in the mail.</li>
            <li> i get very sick easy just going out and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several different bottles from them and have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday!  </li>
            <li> This is just unheard of for her because she usually picks up all sorts of illnesses throughout the school year.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable b/c</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops into all my cleaning buckets!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m fairly certain my use of Four Thieves has kept me from getting sick this season.  </li>
            <li> about but since i apply this to my feet i dont get sick as much as i use to</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really believe everyone&#x27;s reviews about keeping you from getting sick but every time I could tell a sinus infection was coming on, I would put on my feet and add one drop to my saline Neilmed squirt bottle</li>
            <li> It is a very heavy scent.  </li>
            <li> But for those of you who think it can ward of bubonic plague, or any other disease, and who buy the silly story about &amp;#34;Four Thieves?&amp;#34;  Eucalyptus is from AUSTRALIA -- a continent not discovered by Europeans until two hundred years after the Black Death.  </li>
            <li> Ready for the cold season!</li>
            <li> I used it frequently on myself when I was caring for several sick family members and I did not get ill</li>
            <li> Bought this oil back in the fall b/c I was tired of my kids constantly being sick.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical and have been made a firm believer after several months of using oils.  </li>
            <li> and it filled our house with the disgusting smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using it regularly and have not had a cold yet this winter.  </li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a shortened duration of cold symptoms.</li>
            <li> I mix with carrier oil and put on my daughters heals , so far she has not been sick all winter and hasn&#x27;t need allergy meds</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t still buy YL oils and blends but Eden&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Like it ...cleared my sinus but left an unpleasant after smell.</li>
            <li> I live in cold New England and both housemates had a horrible hack for weeks.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than DoTerra and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I had been skeptical of Essential oils, until I had a health incident that I was unable to take hardcore medicines for.</li>
            <li> is so much less expensive than the Living Oils.</li>
            <li> Please stop being so ridiculously gullible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i heard they use to use this mix back in the day to break into people houses when they were sick and dying to steal their stuff...  </li>
            <li> And the back of my feet when im close to people is sick and it work so well.</li>
            <li> She has been sick with a cold and we are trying to prevent RSV or any other upper respiratory issues.</li>
            <li> Not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> I do hope these are organic, or at least consumable... as I intend on making my Thieves cough drops out of it!</li>
            <li> I am sold on the use of essential oils and will probably not be disappointed with this oil.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a disinfection and cleaning solution to wipe down surfaces, doorknobs, anything I think my have cold or flu viruses on.  </li>
            <li> I put this on the bottoms of our feet at night to keep down cold issues.</li>
            <li> I am a teacher surrounded by sick kids all day long</li>
            <li> this blend to keep my family from getting sick all year long.</li>
            <li> I was getting sick pretty often, bought this and haven&#x27;t been sick in months.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy with this.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted to Thieves - I use this brand for cleaning, diffusing and in a spray bottle on surfaces.</li>
            <li> I started using these 2 oils in a diffuser/humidifier in her room overnight early November and within 3 days she was over her cold and has not been sick since.</li>
            <li> My son had a terrible virus that lasted over a week with high fevers</li>
            <li> My husband thinks it helps his sinus but nothing dramatic yet.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I feel run down or feel like I might be getting sick. .Four</li>
            <li> Not potent, not very oily, and it smells horrible.</li>
            <li> I had heard a few friends of mine saying that this helps boost immunity as a preventative and helps you get well faster when sick.</li>
            <li> Have about 20 different oils and have yet to be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I usually get sick often but not since using these oils.</li>
            <li> but they are also extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I purchased two, one was a gift.</li>
            <li> I used this oil often when my family became ill.</li>
            <li> I work at a school and everyone is ill.</li>
            <li> My daughter started preschool this year and had been sick with common cold symptoms on and off since the beginning of September.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hard smell to describe, though I hate cinnamon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent of clove to begin with</li>
            <li> I purchased for my daughter who is 2 and made a vapor rub with it for her cold.</li>
            <li> think I was crazy...</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try it over the winter cold &amp; flu season.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have during cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> Works well against cold and respiratory problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hopeful it will help during cold season this year.</li>
            <li> I will use this through the winter as a protection through the cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> This stinks.</li>
            <li> Four Thieves is what got me through cold &amp; flu season.</li>
            <li> we were shocked that he fought whatever crap he had in a day in a half!!!</li>
            <li> No need for expensive do terra stuff, I&#x27;m hooked now!</li>
            <li> I usually have 2 or 3 really nasty ones.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to help to keep bad bugs at bay and seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for traveling with.  </li>
            <li> I have heard it to be an immune booster and helpful to bad breath too.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell bad either</li>
            <li> We have not been sick this fall.</li>
            <li> I diffuse if one of us is sick, it kills all the germs.  </li>
            <li> I am no longer getting sick.</li>
            <li> and I have not gotten sick this winter.</li>
            <li> and neither of us have been sick at all.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s soothing when you&#x27;re sick, even if it doesn&#x27;t speed healing.</li>
            <li> and then I don&#x27;t get sick.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I was sick and</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t been sick yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in a spray bottle with a touch of alcohol and fractured coconut oil to keep me from getting sick.</li>
            <li> though it was :(</li>
            <li> Saved me when I got a nasty cold around Christmas that turned into a sinus infection.</li>
            <li> However, this oil stopped a nasty cold overnight.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been sick once!</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t gotten sick this yr!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been mixing it in water in a spray bottle and using it as a tick repellent.  </li>
            <li> But this product, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Cold remedy, use it in household cleaners!!</li>

            <li> It helps fight and get rid of the nasty illnesses that are around this time of year.</li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34; formula I have ever smelled.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good price on this 4 thieves essential oils thanks</li>
            <li> exact same thing as young living for a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> Product is as described. A little strong for someone who is hypersensitive, have had to figure out how to dilute it.</li>
            <li> Does not smell as good as it sounds.</li>
            <li> A must have for every oil household !</li>
            <li> Good quality oil, smells good. I highly recommend Edens Garden oils.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells wonderful. I use it to make sea salt hairspray and my husband smells my hair all the time. Also comes with a handy little brochure of different things you can use essential oils for. Very helpful.</li>
            <li> Love Edens Garden oils</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure. This was recommended to me by a friend to keep me healthy. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to decide if it works yet.</li>
            <li> Great product 5 stars</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of the four thieves essential oil for the much higher priced oil by Young Living. It was $40 compared to this blend, which was WAY less, and decided on this. I made the right choice. The blend is no different in mix and is beautiful in smell. I put 4-5 drops at night in to my diffuser and my entire bedroom smells wonderful. It&#x27;s a hard smell to describe, though I hate cinnamon, it&#x27;s in there and you cannot even tell. I will be buying this over and over again. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> As good of quality as Doterra</li>
            <li> This smells so delicious. I mixed it with some witch hazel in a spray bottle and sprayed around the house when the kids started coughing. The next day no more coughing and active as ever! Less expensive than DoTerra and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I love the story behind this essential oil. It shows how beneficial e.o.&#x27;s are.</li>
            <li> Liked it but the cinnamon scent is quite strong, can&#x27;t tell if there are other scents in this bottle.</li>
            <li> has a very good aroma, but it seems very diluted. Essential oils of cloves and cinnamon with other cheaper brands have a more penetrating odor than this. As for effectiveness, I&#x27;m still evaluating. My son has allergy problem and easily catch flu. This fall he has not got sick, I don&#x27;t  know if it was the essential oil, the new vitamin (I spent three months researching to find something of quality, because the trademarks are chemically pure and sugar) or sambucus Elderberry immune or the green juices that I am giving to him. Maybe it&#x27;s a combination of everything.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my Thieves. Edens Garden is of such GREAT quality and such a GREAT price! I am happy to be part of a company with such a wonderful philosophy and mission. Thieves is the perfect oil for the season. It helps fight and get rid of the nasty illnesses that are around this time of year. Put Thieves in your humidifier to spread it through out your home and use it to clean when someone has been ill.</li>
            <li> Good product - great price.  We have avoided more than a few illnesses by using this oil.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is exactly as advertised.  Smells great!</li>
            <li> love it helps with pain</li>
            <li> Perfect blend. Great for diffusing</li>
            <li> Used for malaria in the middle ages when thieves who ransacked the hole of those with the disease put this oil on themselves to prevent contacting the disease. Great essential oil and great company to deal with!</li>
            <li> Love this! I use on the bottom of my kids feet to protect from germs and illness.  I swear by it, it works!!</li>
            <li> This smells great and is perfect for adding to a carrier oil. I have yet to diffuse it but so far, we are happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I really feel that it works to wars off colds and flu and too get rid of them. Its amazing to me! Love the small too!</li>
            <li> We loved the Thieves essential oil. It has a fabulous cinnamon clove scent with a hint of citrus. We enjoy using this in our diffuser for the scent and for the benefit of keeping us safe from the germs of the winter season.</li>
            <li> Warm and comforting scent.  Perfect during the winter months</li>
            <li> Four Thieves is one of my favorite essential oils.  Have given it as a gift and&lt;br /&gt;reordered another for myself.  Would recommend this to anyone looking for&lt;br /&gt;an oil blend to help support good health.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of oils. This version of Thieves works great and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> This is so great so many uses I love this oil.</li>
            <li> This has so many uses from helping you sleep to getting over a cold. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils and I know DoTerra oils are supposed to be the best but they are also extremely expensive. I tried Edens Garden Four Thieves and Exhale first and I LOVE them! They work great and are very affordable. My daughter started preschool this year and had been sick with common cold symptoms on and off since the beginning of September. I started using these 2 oils in a diffuser/humidifier in her room overnight early November and within 3 days she was over her cold and has not been sick since. Coincidence? Maybe but I&#x27;m a believer! Plus they smell soooo good and I&#x27;m not into the super earthy/hippie smells.</li>
            <li> I really like being able to get 4 Thieves in the larger bottle. We diffuse this essential oil all day. I ordered some for gifts, too.</li>
            <li> Smells like Christmas!</li>
            <li> Love out a few drops in spray bottle for cleaning surfaces</li>
            <li> Love it and used it for my cold. Felt better in half the time of a 2 week virus</li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling &amp;#34;Thieves&amp;#34; formula I have ever smelled. I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness, though, because I&#x27;m going to stick to the other Thieves formulas that aren&#x27;t quite as appalling.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that several other oils from this company have been great, and their shipping is always fast!</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast and helped protect me from getting sick when normally I come down with every bug I encounter. This is definitely an every day oil must have!</li>
            <li> like it. A couple of drops can last a day. You can use the bottle for months.</li>
            <li> great product but seems less potent than some of the other high quality brands</li>
            <li> Good bye, flu &amp; cold symptoms! Clove oil kind of smell, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Edens Gardens essential oils are a great value and as good of a product as any other. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me while I was having a drawn out problem with sinuses.  My husband and I both love the smell.  I rubbed some on the soles of my granddaughter&#x27;s feet when she was having a several-day bout of croup.  She was markedly improved by the next morning.  It don&#x27;t really know if it helped, but her feet sure did smell terrific!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! Its smells wonderful and diffuses well</li>
            <li> I purchased this to save some money from the YL brand. It works, but the smell is definitely different from the YL brand...seems more diluted or less cinnamon smell. Like I said, it works, but just not quite the same smell as the YL brand. I have several of the EG oils now and will continue to purchase them to save money, but I will probably splurge for the Theives next time.</li>
            <li> Love it! Spicy and warm without smelling like dirty hippie. :-)</li>
            <li> Ready for the cold season!</li>
            <li> It must have been the eucalyptus;  I guess I&#x27;m sensitive to it.  My larynx spasmed after I put drops on the balls.  This was one hour before a vocal critique.  I was very hoarse very hours.  It&#x27;s a blend: cinnamon, cloves, lemon and eucalyptus.  I&#x27;ll give it to someone with whom I won&#x27;t ever have close contact.  Oh.  I put them on dryer balls  because I can&#x27;t use those awful dryer sheets and I wanted to see if I was missing something.  So it might be fine for you.</li>
            <li> Great blend!  Very earthy to me and my clients (I am a massage therapist) all loved it!  I rarely have an issues with Edens Gardens scents, and if I do, they are very awesome and replace them quickly!  Perfect 5 Star rating!</li>
            <li> Great! Fast delivery. Thank you. Love this oil</li>
            <li> This blend is pretty good. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as good as the Young Living blend but at its price, who cares. I am a distributor for YL and do think their version is a deeper, richer mix but with a price break like this, there is no reason to not save some money and go with this blend. That is my thought on many of Eden&#x27;s oils. I have the Complete set they offer and as a budding aromatherapist, I think this brand is top notch. That doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t still buy YL oils and blends but Eden&#x27;s allows me to pick up so many great oils and really practice my hand at experimenting with so many oils. As for the &amp;#34;safe for ingestion&amp;#34; issue, there is no certifying body that can prove that statement. Some companies have bought the right to say that, some have not. Many oils are sourced from the same locations throughout the world and there is no difference between vendors. Just make sure your oils are 100% pure essential oil, they include the Latin name of the plant on the bottle, that through some means you can verify country of origin (Eden&#x27;s is online at their website) and the company must be willing to provide MSDS sheets if requested. Ingest with care and if concerned, consult with a certified aromatherapist.  Remember, oils are super concentrated and it&#x27;s easy to overdo them. A little goes a long ways so be careful if ingesting. When using topically, make sure you have a good carrier oil, like coconut, to cut the oil&#x27;s heat some and to create a nice massaging oil that goes farther than one drop or two drops will. Try this blend on the bottoms of your feet with carrier oil for a lovely foot massage...so lovely and it boosts your immune system...bonus! In fact, do it as a nightly couples massage...a couple who massages together, stays together ;)</li>
            <li> This works period.  Rub it on the bottom of your feet before bed and you simply won&#x27;t believe how much better you&#x27;ll feel in a couple of days.  I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! A few drops in my diffuser goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fragrance of Four Thieves and will rub a drop on my feet every morning for prevention during this cold and flu season.  Additionally, the booklets that came with the essential oil are very informative.</li>
            <li> I mixed this with fractionated coconut oil as its carrier, and use it instead of hand sanitizer. I figure if it warded off the Black Plague (supposedly), it might keep the germs at bay.  :)</li>
            <li> I will buy again. This oil is excellent quality and much cheaper than competitors.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Use it daily on self and around home.</li>
            <li> This is very nice and I would have given it more stars but when you compare it to Doterra&#x27;s On Guard, I much prefer On Guard - which is a more premium product.</li>
            <li> Love how this smells.  This is a great product to use with a little water to help get rid of unwanted oders.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this essential oil :)</li>
            <li> Comparable to Young Living but 1/3 the price! Super happy with all of my Essential oils from Edens Garden. They are so much cheaper because they cut out the middle man!</li>
            <li> This is what I needed and it came in quickly.  I&#x27;ve used it all over the house and it is great.  I&#x27;m to the bottom of the bottle and need to get some more especially with cold season coming.  Have used it all over the house in many ways.  GREAT product</li>
            <li> Love the smell and diffuse it daily to help keep sickness at bay!</li>
            <li> Got this to combat mold in my apartment. After 2 uses, the mold is gone and the room smells much better. I mix the synergy blend with about 3/4 cup water in a spray bottle (about 12 drops) and spray where I need it as well as misting the air with it. I am very satisfied with this product and will be purchasing again. I&#x27;m still experimenting with how to use it as I am new to essential oils and their uses. I highly recommend the Thieves Synergy blend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother, and she really likes to diffuse it during cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! works great for warding off colds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this all winter and I haven&#x27;t been sick once!</li>
            <li> I use Essential oils every day!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Edens Garden Thieves! I&#x27;ve tried others and this one makes me want to use it. I&#x27;ve had good success with using it in cold and flu season as well as for cleaning. Just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Used daily on the bottom of my feet and bypassed the illnesses that were going around at the office.</li>
            <li> We are knee deep in the flu, let you know if it helps with keeping all 5 of us from getting it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy and thankful to find therapeutic grade oils at such a fantastic price! I use my thieves oil every day,  either in my oil diffuser or topically.  I gave a bottle to my sister for Christmas,  as well since she has a baby.  Great for keeping those immune systems strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> * I gave one star only because I haven&#x27;t tried this brand.  Consuming Essential oils can be very dangerous and should only be done if under the care of a lisenced medical professional. The essential oils may be natural, but the chemistry changes as it enters the digestive sytem. Some can be life threatening or cause damange to your organs. Please consult a lisenced professional before consuming essential oils.  Also, this particular oil shouldn&#x27;t be used on small children due to the cloves. Eucalyptus radiata is safe for children not sure if that&#x27;s used in this one.    *I gave 1 star only because I haven&#x27;t tried this brand</li>
            <li> Great product and great value! I love to diffuse it!</li>
            <li> awesome thankyou for the great prices</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this oil for such a great price. I am going to go to Edens Garden for all my essential oils from now on. This oil works just as expected. Thieves is great for so many uses.</li>
            <li> I really love this oil...I put it in my diffuser every day.</li>
            <li> I have a small humidifier next to my bed and I add 2 drops of this every night into it. I love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in hopes that it would be as good as the Young Living brand I had received in a kit and that I would receive it more quickly.  It took more than two weeks to receive it so I ordered more of the other brand to make sure I had some one hand with all the viruses going around.  I just compared the two versions and can tell a big difference.  This one appears to be much more subtle with perhaps less cinnamon and clove or maybe diluted a bit.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Great for diffusing. We have not been sick this fall. I think it&#x27;s due to diffusing Thieves</li>
            <li> Perfect and fast shipping ! I use it everyday !</li>
            <li> Arrived, works nicely in my diffuser, seems like good quality</li>
            <li> If you make your own cleaners you will want this!</li>
            <li> Four Thieves is MY essential oil. Edens Garden prices are excellent and their products as good as you can get.  I use this daily. Its on my wish list for replacement in time.</li>
            <li> I made hand sanitizer with this and love it.  Smells clean and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands like the commercial hand sanitizers that are mostly alcohol and water.</li>
            <li> I run this oil in our diffuser often to keep germs at bay. We haven&#x27;t gotten sick this yr! Luck or oil? Who knows, but I will continue to use. The smell is not bad, I like it and I can&#x27;t handle strong smells.</li>
            <li> Great oil to use.  Great for keeping colds away.</li>
            <li> Rid my entire family of illness in 2 days versus the average 7. A great product!</li>
            <li> I love Edens Garden. They are the best and have amazing prices! Thank you for everything!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but not only does this oil smell amazing, perfect for the room oil diffuser. The customer service was remarkable as well. Very quick to respond to any concerns or questions. Thank you for the positive oil and experience.</li>
            <li> Compared to young living products,you have done an amazing job with the oil combinations.You can expect more orders from me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other brands, but not bad</li>
            <li> this is a great product ...works wonders for the flu season</li>
            <li> my sinus problem is so much better after diffusing this oil</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that the clove smell would overpower everything else, but out of the bottle it&#x27;s more of citrus cinnamon smell to me. Love adding it to my mop bucket to freshen the whole house!  I&#x27;ve always had excellent service from Eden&#x27;s Garden, and my packages have always arrived well ahead of schedule.  I love their oils, and the booklet they send with every order comes as a handy reference when I&#x27;m thinking about ordering something new.</li>
            <li> My neighbor assured me this essential oil would help my congestion.  She was right.  However, I wasn&#x27;t aware I needed to add it to another oil -- it was extremely strong.  When added to another neutral/transport oil it was great.</li>
            <li> It wasnt the greatest.</li>
            <li> great price an it is a healing product the heal most illnesses</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really put this one to the test yet, but will try it if I every get another serious infection that needs treatment.</li>
            <li> I am excited to make my own stuff with my thieves. Order came pretty fast!</li>
            <li> The four thieves must have stolen the recipe to make this stuff smell good, unless you like the smell of rotten hippy...</li>
            <li> I love it!! Great quality and great price! Don&#x27;t be fooled by the pricer brands claim of being &amp;#34;the only 100% pure&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not possible to know that and they trademarked that term.</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell wonderful and homey but I think it has kept germs at bay during this flu season.  When I feel run down: I rub a drop or two on the top of my head and to the bottoms of my feet before yoga practice.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using it in the diffuser. Love the scent and believe it is great at helping keep this household more healthy.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Just lightens the senses &amp; breathing. Ive added it to the humidifier, A cloth of it to the furnace filter, unscented lotions, water on the stove.Just seems to make me feel better at times. I like the smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the different companies that make an immune defense blend;  Eden&#x27;s Garden and Elizabeth Essentials are my favorite. As long as I use either one , I don&#x27;t need a flu shot! Elizabeth Essentials is pharmecuitcal grade , meaning it brakes the blood brain barrier - it is sold at Multi Care hospital&#x27;s therapy so ax&amp; other Day Spas . I have had excellent results with Eden&#x27;s Garden , which may be pharmecuitcal grade also but I don&#x27;t know- all I know is that it works! I have used YL &amp; Eden&#x27;s a Garden is just as good , but yet better because they do not overcharge .( they are lacking the greed factor)  so I highly recommend Eden&#x27;s Garden over the rest ( Elizabeth Essentials as well ) Eden&#x27;s garden is not as expensive as Elizabeth Essentials; both fantastic !</li>
            <li> Love this oil blend!.I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in quality from this oil and the much more expensive &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; blends! But this product, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> four thieves is essential for the household, use on your body, and tap a little into your trash can to remove smells,  this is your super oil</li>
            <li> I added about 20 drops in a 12 oz bottle of avacado carrier oil to moisturize my skin and give my immune system a little boost.  I smell like a spice cake, and my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing essential oil out there.  It cured my daughters fever over night.  Made her not sick with in 24 hours.  It prevented the rest of our family from catching her flu.  It helped my sore throat.  I diffuse if one of us is sick, it kills all the germs.  This oil has been getting a lot of use.  It&#x27;s one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Love this essential oil, it smells great and keeps me from getting sick.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Smells great and keeps us healthy through diffusing. Can&#x27;t wait to use it in DIY hand soap recipes :)</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better!</li>
            <li> smells nothing like the other thieves blends that I&#x27;ve purchased. Unfortunately I purchased two, one was a gift. But it smells aweful...like vicks menthol or something like that. Not pleasant at all. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very powerful! I&#x27;ve tried other blends that claim to be like Four Theives, however there&#x27;s been such a difference. This reminds me to order more!</li>
            <li> WOW - just got this.  Smells great, diffused the last two nights while sleeping.  Husband&#x27;s week old sore throat is GONE &amp; we both are sleeping better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!! I have been very happy with all of the oils I&#x27;ve bought from Edens Garden. They work just as well as DoTerra, but way more affordable.</li>
            <li> I think that this is a good product to help in keeping my family healthy and sickness free. It can give me a headache if I use more than 3 drops in my vaporizer.</li>
            <li> Comparable was good !</li>
            <li> love the blend, I use it on everything.</li>
            <li> Love this! I use it as a disinfectant when  I&#x27;m in public, like shopping carts.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the smell. The eucalyptus is completely over powering. I could not smell any other scent included in it,</li>
            <li> This is what I use as a room deoderizer in a spritzer bottle with purified water (4 ounces of water, 15 drops of oil)  shake it before using and it gets rid of odors.  I have 3 dogs and it works for doggie odor.  I also use it as a disinfection and cleaning solution to wipe down surfaces, doorknobs, anything I think my have cold or flu viruses on.  Again in a spritzer bottle the same mix as above, I spritz the surface, let it sit for a minute and wipe off with a microfiber cloth.  I like the smell of this and so it is a natural to use it.  Smells like clove and citrus with a hint of eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the products! Have about 20 different oils and have yet to be disappointed! Great prices and fast shipping. Customer service is nice and replies very timely. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> One of my very favorite essential blends.  I&#x27;d never be without some.</li>
            <li> Great for rubbing on throat and chest for colds.</li>
            <li> love it, use it for sickness, cleaning, diffusing.  first sign of any illness i apply to bottom of feet and the ailing area, and have not been sick all winter.</li>
            <li> Love the smell to this oil high quality</li>
            <li> It is perfect and everything in the description came true :) Also this product came in a timely fashion and works wonderfully. I am so thankful for this purchase.</li>
            <li> just what I needed, worked great</li>
            <li> Love it!  Saved me when I got a nasty cold around Christmas that turned into a sinus infection. I forgot about using it the first couple of days but once I remembered it saved my life!  Made having a cold and sinus infection much more bearable especially during Christmas!  I put some on the bridge of my nose through out the day and at night on the bottom of my feet.</li>
            <li> This is great oil! Helped my daughter get well quickly after rubbing a few drops under her feet!</li>
            <li> This is a great item.  I am no longer getting sick.</li>
            <li> Amazing oils !!!  Can&#x27;t wait to try others !!  I highly recommend Edens Garden !!!  Great products, fast shipping, great company values !!!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality blend. Smells amazing! ! Did NOT leak in transit. They even include a booklet on uses for essential oils.  I will order from Edens Garden again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I first used the YSL version and then, I tried this. It&#x27;s amazing. Smells the same and less price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful disinfectant and great for a homemade hand sanitizer with some tea tree and water in a small spray bottle also good air purifier</li>
            <li> works good&lt;br /&gt;even on dogs wound.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as young living Theives. But it&#x27;s a good knock off.</li>
            <li> I use this as a spray when I go to the gym and at work for germs. I also get a cup of boiling hot water add a few drops and it smells the entire office. Love this stuff</li>
            <li> Came in fast and was packaged good. I love the smell of thieves oil and use it everywhere in our house. Great for tennis shoes and dog beds!</li>
            <li> Arrived much earlier then the arrival date; high quality product.</li>
            <li> I like this scent. I put a cotton ball with a few drops in all my garbage cans and in my vacuum cleaner bag.</li>
            <li> We really like this blend for use in Yogi tea Maya cocoa spice tea.  That is a really great combination.  But for dilution into water we do prefer the Germ Fighter blend by Plant Therapy Essential Oils.  So you should really try both of these blends.</li>
            <li> Has the smell of creosote.  Tried some on a tissue by my bed overnight, didn&#x27;t help.  While creosote oil is said to have health benefits, it&#x27;s not something I would use or in the formula for 4 Thieves.</li>
            <li> I diffused this via humidifier in my 16 month old daughter&#x27;s room. She has been sick with a cold and we are trying to prevent RSV or any other upper respiratory issues. My husband thought it was overwhelming at first so we opened the door before putting her to bed. (He said \\&quot;it smells like baked goods!\\&quot;). I slept with my daughter to make sure she wasn&#x27;t overwhelmed. After the inital turning on of the humidifier, the smell lightened a bit and, even though she still had a cruddy nose and cough, she was able to get some sleep. Hopefully, a few more nights of this and she&#x27;ll start feeling better. I love this stuff. I also put it on the soles of my older children&#x27;s feet and they were mellow! I didn&#x27;t realize that was an effect! I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> I use this for everything.  In the humidifier in the baby&#x27;s room, in a spray bottle with rubbing alcohol as a disinfectant, diffuse during germ season, sanitize baby bottles, and on our feet with some coconut oil when we&#x27;re starting to feel poorly.</li>
            <li> I am a teacher surrounded by sick kids all day long but I keep using Thieves every night and I have not gotten sick this winter. My husband got sick as a dog, but I was able to keep it at bay and I attribute this to using Thieves on the bottom of my feet every night. It has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I love Eden&#x27;s Garden. I used this oil often when my family became ill. I used it frequently on myself when I was caring for several sick family members and I did not get ill (that could just be a boosted immunity though). I used it on them and I cannot say that it really had an impact on shortening their illness. My son had a terrible virus that lasted over a week with high fevers and I do know he slept better when I applied this to his feet and chest.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It worked for me,and I will be getting it again.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Great smell.  I use it quiet a bit.  Mix in a spray bottle with water for use on Counter tops and to spray hand towels too.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend.  It costs a little more than I like to spend, but a little does go a long way.  It is supposed to help to keep bad bugs at bay and seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for traveling with.  The smell stays with you longer than most other products and does have a therapeutic effect.</li>
            <li> This is a blend of Clove, Cinnamon Bark, Rosemary, Lemon, and Eucalyptus oils, also sold by other companies as Thieves Oil, or by other names.  As you may surmise, the ingredients such as clove give it a strong aroma.  My Pilates instructor asked that I not use this before a Pilates class.  It is a combination of antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal oils.  Your skin may be sensitive to this if it is used full strength.  There are various claims and suggested uses/  I have not doubt that it would clear up your sinuses.  I have found that it is best mixed with jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blend will be found listed in the Essential Oils Pocket Reference as Thieves Oil with some general discussion and suggested uses.  The individual component oils are also listed separately in that reference.</li>
            <li> putting a drop of this on my hands and rubbing my hands and face seemed to ward off everyone&#x27;s colds....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i heard they use to use this mix back in the day to break into people houses when they were sick and dying to steal their stuff...  i don&#x27;t know if that is true or not, but it is interesting.</li>
            <li> This oil smells very much like the same oil by Young Living. I&#x27;m glad I bought it. 4 of these would be the cost of one of the Young Livings oils. I do hope these are organic, or at least consumable... as I intend on making my Thieves cough drops out of it! I do wish the Eucalyptus was less strong than the other oils, but oh well.</li>
            <li> This smell is a little strong for me. I like sweet smells and this is not very sweet It will be good for a soap for a man, or for a multipurpose cleanser.  The bottle is nice size. Fast shipping .</li>
            <li> Not what I expected after all the rave reviews...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t what to use this for. I put it on the dog now, she is less hyper and has less mosquitos. she is SYNERGYZED now!</li>
            <li> Was using Young Living thought I would try this instead because of pricing...works just as good!  Love it!</li>
            <li> My boss started using this oil in the office and we became stuff up as if we had a colds . I guess we where having an allergic reaction, Guessing this isn&#x27;t the best thing for all to use.</li>
            <li> very disappointing!  !&lt;br /&gt;just buy a bottle of cloves---hard to smell anything else in this blend---the other EO in this blend have very little influence---IF they are even there!&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BRAND FOR THEIR BLENDS----GROSS EXAGGERATION TO COMPARE THEM TO THE MORE EXPENSIVE BRANDS.  I will not buy the YL or the other D brand, their prices are nuts.  I am still looking for good blends.&lt;br /&gt;i know they are there---as this is not rocket science---sad that there is little truth in advertising.</li>
            <li> Colds and this fall and winter it was great used it wonderful product !!!!</li>
            <li> Relaxing and lasting aroma!</li>
            <li> Title pretty much says it all. Very watery and dispenses too quickly. Thieves oil should be heavy on the cinnamon and clove, the more powerful herbs in the formula.</li>
            <li> I have used the four thieves blend of essential oil for about a year. I have used it all winter to help ward off or keep a cold from going into a full blown episode and have had great success. I put the four thieves on a wart and it was gone in about two weeks.! And of course one of the benefits of the four thieves essential oil is its aromatic quality ! This order was notable because  the price was reasonable and because it was delivered promptly and in perfect condition !</li>
            <li> Good price and delivered on time!</li>
            <li> Love edens garden ,by far the fairest pricing .use this blend to keep my family from getting sick all year long. It&#x27;s been a year and I truly see a huge drop in the amount of times my kids have been sick compared to last.2 drops on thier feet every morning.</li>
            <li> The smell is overpowering. I didn&#x27;t notice anything amazing about this product.</li>
            <li> I had been skeptical of Essential oils, until I had a health incident that I was unable to take hardcore medicines for. My Doctor suggested some ridiculously overpriced oils ( Young Living) at the time that worked better than what the drugs would have. I have since been amazed that what our relatives just 2-3 generations ago used everyday, we are now rediscovering. Onto Four thieves. My children have crappy immune systems. Every little sneeze, sort, cough, virus, bacteria, etc.... out there can spell a long illness that means missed school, Dr&#x27;s bills and the like. I learned about Four thieves from a friend and decided, &amp;#34; what the hey, I have nothing to lose, and it isn&#x27;t medication for the kids&amp;#34; at the first onset of sickness, I used it on my son. we were shocked that he fought whatever crap he had in a day in a half!!! this is not normal!!!! i tried it on other family members and it seemed to kick these germies in the butt ! YAY! I have used this oil in my oil diffuser, and I like to clean with it also. These are all just my opinions, but I honestly believe that this works as it is claimed to work. There is a lot of info on the web from medical journals/peer reviews of research  of the oils outperforming antibiotics and other medicines. Look it up, and make your own informed decisions. I for one will continue to let others know and support Edens Garden buy buying their products.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil to use with coconut oil for massage therapy. Smells like cloves, but it is better than smelling like menthol.</li>
            <li> Bought this oil back in the fall b/c I was tired of my kids constantly being sick. This is a fantastic oil. I&#x27;m very pleased with it and all the oils from Edens Garden. Great quality, great oil.</li>
            <li> Everyone asks me what I have on. This is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burna few drops in my electric tart warmer and  it smells up my whole house plus it is good for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best price out there, $60. in the market.</li>
            <li> Smells ok- I have smelled four thieves made by a different vendor &amp; it was much better!</li>
            <li> I use it to help my immune system to fight off colds and sinus infections.  Also have a toe with fungus I am alternating it with Tree Oil.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Thieves for a long time, and am excited to think the quality and purity is as good as the reviews sound.</li>
            <li> I may be new to this essential oils craze but, this smell is absolutely overpowering. I much less open the bottle and it filled our house with the disgusting smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another  brand of essential oil before and in comparison, they are not much different. In fact, Edens Garden&#x27;s smell even better, or should I say more pure maybe? It&#x27;s almost like you can smell the individual oil in the blend. It&#x27;s worth the price. Good product.</li>
            <li> I use this oil to help me resist colds and build up my immunity.  The oil arrived fast and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to a more expensive brand. It was used in a formula for home made anti- bacterial hand cleaner. I know I will also find more uses for it , and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Very natural product that is good to use for the skin. It works for what it is intended to work for.Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with Thieves</li>
            <li> I purchased this for at least half of the price; but it is wonderful.  I use a few drops in my humidifier and it smells great to me and it&#x27;s suppossed ot help alleviate flu and sickness etc.</li>
            <li> As always, prompt service in additional to quality oils and merchandise. I repeat, this is my new essential oil store! A+++++++</li>
            <li> I love the smell! I mix this with Wintergreen in a spray bottle and mist the dogs when they come in from outside...takes away that wet puppy smell and keeps the whole house smelling great!</li>
            <li> I love this in my diffuser!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  It freshens up my kitchen and disinfects it too!  Love the smell, lifts my mood as well.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this! I use it as a nighttime treatment with jojoba as a carrier. It smells wonderful and keeps breakouts away! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love tis mix - it&#x27;s soothing and warm.  I use it in my vaporized when I want to feel calm and alert.</li>
            <li> Did I say I love this? lol Does everything stated in use guides that I have read. Yes. I&#x27;ll reorder man many ti,es going forward. Did I say I love this oil???</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to save money.  I am not happy with this.  It does not smell like thieves nor does is look like thieves.  It is very runny.  And i tried to diffuse it and the smell went away in about 10 minutes. I was really hoping this would come close to the Young Living brand but it just does not compare.  So I will be paying more for Thieves and sticking to better quality.</li>
            <li> Three stars because I&#x27;ll have to use it for more things.  Diluted it in a bug repellant recipe.  Worked perfectly.  The smell is not offensive or alluring.  Not sure what Theives oil is supposed to smell like... new to this still.  I can&#x27;t describe the smell much... I might run across this scent outside...</li>
            <li> I have been using essential oils for a couple of years &amp; heard great things about Four Theives blend. But the price from the other company was beyond my budget.  I tried Edens Garden&#x27;s versions &amp; it&#x27;s wonderful. I&#x27;ve used it for cleaning, treating acne &amp; as a chest rub for allergies.  I just ordered another bottle.  It&#x27;s great to find a company that provides quality essential grade oils at a price that us common folk can afford.</li>
            <li> Very nice blend of essential oils. I make candles and soap so this product is perfect. Customers love this product!</li>
            <li> This blend is great! It smells wonderful and is high quality for the price. Very pleased with this blend. It has many uses.</li>
            <li> Great product! Perfect blend, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. Thieves is amazing, and I will be buying more</li>
            <li> have not used this product ye. I  am still using the other product I purchased from Amazon before I use this product.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the Edens Garden&#x27;s line of essential oils. Extremely fragrant and comparable to Young Living&#x27;s Thieves Oil. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> received and love it!!</li>
            <li> Love it! I carry in my purse and use daily...a drop or 2 rubbed into bottoms of feet is a ritual for me.</li>
            <li> I use this in my homemade cleaning products and love it, but the best way I use it is in a diffuser in my home to clear the air of germs. My daughter has used it in her bedroom diffuser while she studies and she says it has really helped her concentration and focus immensely.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Fragrant. I&#x27;ve been applying to the bottoms of my feet daily.</li>
            <li> Great oil blend. Smells just like young living or the blend i make from scratch. Use this blend alot to keep colds and flu to a minimum. Smells of clove and cinnamon and eucalyptus mostly.</li>
            <li> It smell just like the one young living offers, but cheaper. I use it for multiple things, cleaning which is one of them! I will be buying this again! My new favorite!!</li>
            <li> The dropper is stuck in the bottle. I have to pry it off everytime I use it.  Otherwise I like the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent of clove to begin with and I feel the clove oil in this blend is overpowering.  Would not buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and has a very strong scent. I used another brand&#x27;s eucalyptus oil in my new diffuser before this and my husband couldn&#x27;t smell it. Same number of drops of the thieves and my living rooms smells like i want to lick the walls. My husband keeps staring at the diffuser like he is going to take a bite out of it. Strong cinnamon and clove notes.</li>
            <li> Helped with my Bronchitis last Winters end before spring and also made house smell great when I used it in my steamer  thx medicine</li>
            <li> Arrived 2 days early, very sturdy and protective packaging, and the best quality product I could hope for. And the scent is to die for!</li>
            <li> I love this scent, it&#x27;s a bit strong on the cinnamon flavor but I honestly really like it.  It is a strong smell and will fill your room with a christmas-y type of smell.</li>
            <li> Super speedy delivery. WONDERFUL fragrance.  Will be back for me.</li>
            <li> I truly love this stuff i get very sick easy just going out and about but since i apply this to my feet i dont get sick as much as i use to it works amazing i will keep buying this for sure awesome price awesome oil</li>
            <li> service was great. Scent not as strong as others I have purchased, but pleasant</li>
            <li> Terrific alternative to Young Living Thieves.</li>
            <li> Works great! Has cleared up minor skin infections quickly! Definitely a medicine cabinet and first aid kit staple!</li>
            <li> Nicely packed. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought a bigger bottle.  Smells great and diffuses nicely.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! Very high quality!! Can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and other more expensive brands except for the price! Highly recommend all Edens Garden oils!</li>
            <li> I think the Thieves blend is great good for using in so many ways.!!!  Good for sanitizing , and can be put in a diffuser!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product - fast shipping. Thieves a superior essential oil to kill germs and bacteria in the home- either being difussed or added to cleaning products.</li>
            <li> a great product, a must buy to help with immune system problems, we travel on planes a lot and this stuff really works</li>
            <li> Our friend sells the real expenisve stuff and I bought this and put it in hands and inhale into mouth and hold and then into nostrils and once day had sore throat and did this and it cleared up right away.  My hubby uses it to and  helps his sinuses.  But I use it straight on nothing mixed.  But will continue to use and reorder as needed.</li>
            <li> This oil smells so good and tests as a pure oil.  As good as Thieves at a much lower price.  Thieves has been my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; oil, but this will take its place at my house.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality great smelling stuff. Use it in lotion....</li>
            <li> Wow, this smells great.  I am using it for boosting the immune system, but the smell makes me happy too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been mixing it in water in a spray bottle and using it as a tick repellent.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> Love this scent - will definitely purchase more.  This history about the scent is very interesting . . .</li>
            <li> Smells great! I purchased for my daughter who is 2 and made a vapor rub with it for her cold. Applied 3 times a day and she got over her child quicker than ever. Also quicker than me or my husband. I am definately going to start using daily as a preventative.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this oil.  I am also very happy with this brand.  I&#x27;ve gotten several different bottles from them and have not been disappointed.  I will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I use this for the dark blemish left in the middle of my fore head and on the side of forehead.  within a few weeks the blemish is completely gone  and stay gone for a long time. When it started to come back I used it again. It is also very allergy friendly and ive used it for my asthma by rubbing it on my chest.</li>
            <li> I use this with a diffuser, and can definitely breathe better when I use it.  Very pleasant odor, and a little goes a long way.  For nights when my head is stopped up, this does the trick.</li>
            <li> The title says it all. Not potent, not very oily, and it smells horrible. I question the authenticity of anything this company sells. Stay away from it and save your money.</li>
            <li> I loved it but now I&#x27;m trying to find a cleaning product with this blend.  Can you help me out?</li>
            <li> use this in dehumidifier and to clean with. Very pleased with the smell and results. I even mixed this with Epson salts and put it in my sons bath when he wasn&#x27;t feeling well.</li>
            <li> Love this oil!!  Use it everyday!  Smells great.  Excellent company-great website fast shipping!!  Prices are good and product is excellent.</li>
            <li> Good quality oil for an affordable price and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Bottle is very poorly designed, it really need an eyedropper top or a better way to get a few drops out.  But the contents are top notch.  When you try to get a drop out you have to tap and shake the bottle and you sometimes get 1,2,3 or 7 drops...Its a shame the bottle is such an afterthought...</li>
            <li> Grrrrrreat! I notice the Cinnamon more in this than other brands which isn&#x27;t a bad thing</li>
            <li> Suggested by a friend who is an RN to help keep my family germ free. I find Edens Gardens to be a high quality product for less. Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase again.</li>
            <li> My daughter came home from kindergarten with a runny nose.  There were several colds and viruses going around.  I did not want to take any chances.  I put this in a diffuser and with in 15-20 minutes, the runny nose was gone and she was breathing fine.  At bed time I rubbed in a couple of drops on her feet.  The next morning there was still no sign of her runny nose.  Most of her class became sick and missed several days of school.  I am happy to say......she did not miss one.  I proceeded to buy many more for family and friends.</li>
            <li> I put this on a tooth that had been crowned a month prior and then needed a root canal.  I was bummed and started reading on a site about this preventing from having to get a root canal.  I work in dentistry mind you, but I gave it a try and it worked!!!!  No more sensitivity to hot and I can chew on it.  It&#x27;s been 3 months now.  So happy.  Didn&#x27;t tell the dentists I work for...they&#x27;d think I was crazy...oh well...it worked!</li>
            <li> Like it ...cleared my sinus but left an unpleasant after smell.</li>
            <li> Great smell, not a strong as young living, but depending on the use good substitute.</li>
            <li> worked for exactly what I needed it for. I had left Fish Oil Gel capsules in my pocket and then washed my clothes. My clothes smelled HORRIBLE; like a walking fish. After getting advice from a friend that this oil takes odors out of clothes I was skeptical, but after using vinegar, baking soda, oxy clean, leaving my clothes in the sun and various other chemicals I almost gave up and threw my clothes away, but then I took my friends advice and bought this and used 5 drops of this into my laundry load and was SO glad when it took out all the fish odor!</li>
            <li> Nice blend. Effective. Good price. Got here fast.</li>
            <li> love doing business with Eden&#x27;s Garden!  fast shipping and if there&#x27;s a problem they will fix it.</li>
            <li> This is another blend that I just love the smell. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to really attest to its effectiveness at this point though.</li>
            <li> love this company.  good quality products at very good prices, excellent service.  the 4 thieves blend smells better than I thought it would, as a matter of fact, I like it.  It makes a great bathroom disinfectant, you get an air freshener in the bargain.  It smells like fall and holidays and cleanliness and spice markets and warmth and home.</li>
            <li> Great item, fast shipment and appreciate the products catalog.</li>
            <li> As good as the originals.  I&#x27;ve done side-by-side testing.  I&#x27;m very pleased to be able to use this blend more liberally...</li>
            <li> I am constantly putting this on like a perfume when I go out into public!  It seems to keep me from catching any bug that is going around.  I just recently spent a couple weeks with my Grandson and his family....they all came down with a virus,,,I used Four Thieves the whole time there and never got whatever bug they had.  Whether that was the reason or not...I will continue using it!</li>
            <li> I love thieves oil.  It smells so good and I use it in my handmade lotions and soaps.  I am very pleased with the smell of this blend.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice, especially for the fall and holidays.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again.</li>
            <li> I have recently jumped into the EO arena out of curiosity. Allegedly this oil is helpful with keeping germs at bay. I justlike how it smells when diffused . I can def smell cloves. Edens Garden seems to sell a plethora of EO at reasonable prices.  They even mail out an informational booklet that explain EO and different scents. when I need to purchase EO on Amazon I try to buy from Edens Garden first if they offer what I am looking for.</li>
            <li> replacement bottle...wouldn&#x27;t be without my thieves</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the customer service is excellent! It helps to sooth into a good sleep.</li>
            <li> Great in the bath. heated, rub in on hands</li>
            <li> I wear this oil everyday....love it!</li>
            <li> love this product! if my head aches I put some on forehead &amp;  it helps my head to stop hurting also the arthritis in my hands to stop hurting when I rub it on them.</li>
            <li> Not quite the same as the young living blend, but smells pretty good all the same, definitely cheaper anyway.</li>
            <li> Great product, and extremely helpful</li>
            <li> Use this at work for my allergies</li>
            <li> Beautiful aroma.  Not at all overwhelming to me.  Love!</li>
            <li> This may be my new favorite blended oil. I usually blend my own, but thought I would try someone else. great smell. a little strong on the cinnamon, but that&#x27;s ok. it was definitely warm to put on the skin (temple, third eye, supersternal notch, wrists) but it was not unpleasant. would make a great neck/shoulder rub.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve recently decided not to get the flu shot. I&#x27;ve been looking for ways to boost our immune system. We take vitamin D3 and vitamin C daily. I&#x27;ve added this to our daily routine (mixed with a carrier oil on the soles of our feet). There has been a huge difference in our health compared to last year. Four Thieves is not recommended for children for a similar germ fighter ages 6mo - 2yrs, mix 30 drops of sweet orange, 40 drops of cinnamon leaf and 25 drops of fir needle. For children 3-5yrs mix 30 drops sweet orange, 20 drops of clove, 20 drops cinnamon leaf and 25 drops of fir needle.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this after using up my bottle of YL&#x27;s Thieves oil. This oil, in my opinion, smells horrible. It is heavy on the lemon but not in a good way. YL&#x27;s blend is more like clove and so much nicer. Will not be purchasing again. I know YL has astronomical prices, but so worth it for this blend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try it over the winter cold &amp; flu season. I have heard it to be an immune booster and helpful to bad breath too. I highly recommend this seller. Very great service &amp; products!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil; it smells strongly of cinnamon and cloves. It has great health benefits, from preventive to healing. I put it on my feet before bed, and it works like a charm! Eden&#x27;s a Garden makes great quality essential oils. I highly,y recommend them.</li>
            <li> Really nice. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil! It&#x27;s a must have during cold and flu season. Since purchasing this item I have purchased several other Edens Garden&#x27;s oils and find them to be of great quality.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Another great investment! This oil helps me to relax and focus. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a must have.  I was getting sick pretty often, bought this and haven&#x27;t been sick in months.  Whenever I feel run down or feel like I might be getting sick. .Four Thieves to the rescue!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way this smells. I like to throw some on a clean rag and tumble it with my couch pillows and my kids stuffed animals for ten minutes to help freshen them up. My kids also love the smell!</li>
            <li> We love this! We have purchased before and needed more to get us through the winter months!</li>
            <li> Stuff works great! No need for expensive do terra stuff, I&#x27;m hooked now! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Love love this blend.</li>
            <li> The blend is quite weak about 30-40% potency compared to doTerra.&lt;br /&gt;Likely less clove oil is used as it is more expensive</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it smells like a good oil. Will use it more in the flu season.</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like black licorice to me. I wont buy this one again. It&#x27;s not my thing. I just don&#x27;t like the black licorice smell. That&#x27;s all it reminds me of.</li>
            <li> using this this winter. doesn&#x27;t smell bad either</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about the quality of this product! In my opinion it is much stronger than the Young Living brand of thieves oil. A better product and less expensive because you are not having to pay the multi level marketing price! While this company does not participate in Prime, the product does ship quickly and I always receive my order within a week of ordering.</li>
            <li> Love these oils.  Reasonably priced and great prices!  The product book they send with every order is outstanding!  It is so nice to find a reasonably priced thieves product, now I can use it for so many purposes and still feed my family!!!  Thanks Eden&#x27;s Garden for helping me afford to keep my family safer from this germy world!!</li>
            <li> not my fav scent, but diffused all winter to help ward off germs in the air</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim since it was so inexpensive but I didn&#x27;t put much stock into it working. I had heard a few friends of mine saying that this helps boost immunity as a preventative and helps you get well faster when sick. I bought it the week before school started and thought why not? With all the stuff kids pass around at school, I&#x27;ll give it a shot. I bought a roller bottle and mixed it with a Carrier oil. My daughter (who&#x27;s in elementary school) and I both have been rubbing it on the bottoms of our feet and on the back of our necks since the end of August and it&#x27;s now the end of November and neither of us have been sick at all. This is unheard of for her this far into the school year. I have a very hard time believing it&#x27;s coincidence that neither of us have so much had a sniffle. We&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this on a daily basis. It&#x27;s inexpensive, all natural and it smells awesome. I&#x27;m so happy I took the chance. I&#x27;m definitely a believer. I&#x27;ve since purchased other Eden&#x27;s Garden oils and have been very happy with the others as well.    Update - 2/19/15  I am convinced this stuff is a miracle blend.  As I previously stated above, this was my first purchase of essential oils of any kind and I have since bought several others for all sorts of things and am so very happy I tried them.  I was very skeptical and have been made a firm believer after several months of using oils.  My daughter (who is 7) and I still use Four Thieves every night since August on the bottoms of our feet and have only gotten one minor cold over Christmas.  This is just unheard of for her because she usually picks up all sorts of illnesses throughout the school year.  I have not tried any other brands nor would I considering how effective Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s have been and how reasonably priced they are in comparison.  I have bought several bottles now and will continue to do so.  If you are ordering from EG products for the first time, they come with an awesome little catalog with allof their products explaining all of their uses as well as what I like to call a \\&quot;cheat sheet\\&quot; for most common health issues and uses.  Most of the time Amazon does not have EG in stock anymore and I order from their website directly.  Their shipping is not expensive and this is not a prime item on Amazon anyway.  I just take the time to write reviews on here because I always check Amazon reviews for any item before I make a decision whether or not to purchase it.  Highly recommend Eden&#x27;s Garden Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> I had been having daily headaches for weeks, took OTC, migraine, allergy meds etc; I even went to the doctor for my headaches and nothing helped me.  I recently started using essential oils and read that Four Thieves can help with headaches.  I rubbed Four Thieves on the bottom of my feet one morning and no headache that day.  I did this for the next several days and no headaches.  To experiment, I didn&#x27;t rub the Four Thieves on my feet for 2 days and I had headaches those days.  I started using the Four Thieves essential oil again and the headaches are gone.  Putting Four Thieves on the bottom of my feet has now become a part of my morning routine and rarely do I have a headache now.  My DH says it&#x27;s all in my head that this essential oil makes my headaches go away .............. I don&#x27;t think so, but even if it is, at least I&#x27;m not taking tons of OTC medicines that can&#x27;t be good for me to use on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are other uses for this essential oil, but I love it; it has helped me and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I find these oil bland very useful I rub it on my chest, neck, behind my ears. And the back of my feet when im close to people is sick and it work so well. Help to keep the viruses away</li>
            <li> Fantastic healing essential oil. I use a drop of this under my nose when I start feeling a cold coming on and it wipes it right out. It&#x27;s also great for athlete&#x27;s foot (ask my son! ha ha) and fantastic for killing body odors (again, ask my son...). Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Using in diffusers throughout home. Clean smell and hopefully cleaning air. Be careful using too much. It will irritate my throat if too strong.</li>
            <li> USING THIS FOR MY HUSBAND WITH A LOW IMMUNE SYSTEM.</li>
            <li> I am a convert!If you have used YL&#x27;s thieves and agree they make AWSOME blends but price gouge.....then make the switch.Search no more for a less expensive yet equal quality oil.I have tried others and honestly,they are not that great.In my book,you have two choices,&amp;#34;YL or EG.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This oil is just as good as the more expensive brands for less than a third of the price. I love the smell and there are many uses for thieves oil. I am almost out and will need to repurchase soon.</li>
            <li> Great like do terra&#x27;s on guard</li>
            <li> In Nursing school a friend of mine swore by this stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Eden&#x27;s Garden essential oils!! highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Too heavy on the eucalyptus oil.  Had to add some lavender to tone it down.  Will use another company for this blend next time.</li>
            <li> A great company. Great customer service. This blend is good to have when you need to revitalize your senses. Put a couple of drops on a cotton ball and put in a plastic bag. Inhale and feel your senses lift .</li>
            <li> To me this is like Young Living Thieves. I have a kidney disease and put this on the bottom of my feet daily to keep away germs.</li>
            <li> I had heard many good things about the Four Thieves blend and wanted to try it for myself.  I must say that I am very impressed.  Sickness has been all over this holiday season, and my family has been healthy and sickness free dispite being around many people who have been passing around the funk at the holiday gatherings and in the stores.  We use this mostly at night time and sometimes during the day if we are at home.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is affordable and equal in quality to any high priced oils I have ever used! Edens Garden will always be the one I choose. Thank you</li>
            <li> Like the fragrance and look forward to using it</li>
            <li> love, love this scent.</li>
            <li> I just barely received this oil but I&#x27;m confident that it&#x27;s going to be a good one.</li>
            <li> Good product. Works well against cold and respiratory problems</li>
            <li> Wished I could have the full ingredient listings.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had success with this knocking out illness like some people claim, but I sure love the scent. And it&#x27;s soothing when you&#x27;re sick, even if it doesn&#x27;t speed healing.</li>
            <li> Love edens garden. quality oils at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Great product quality.  Scent is very comparable to more expensive brands.  I don&#x27;t know why anyone would spend more money when you don&#x27;t need to!  I highly recommend this product,  I will be buying more oils from this company.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. I&#x27;m hopeful it will help during cold season this year.</li>
            <li> Love a mixture different herbs.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It&#x27;s my go-to oil for a lot of purposes.</li>
            <li> I mix it with Almond Oil and rub it on the bottom of my feet at night. I think it helps me sleep</li>
            <li> It smells good but does nothing as far as healing properties.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Comparable to all others. You can buy anything from this company with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;They also include a fabulous little encyclopedia of herbs and their own synergy blends, and a great pamphlet with 101 uses for essential oils.</li>
            <li> My favorite Edens Garden blend so far.  I have never purchased Young Living Thieves oil so I can&#x27;t compare, but this is much more reasonable in price, especially since I use it mainly for cleaning and not personal health.  When I have felt tired or run-down or have been exposed to a nephew with a cold, I have inhaled from the bottle and felt much better too.</li>
            <li> I filled my diffuser full of water and added 2-3 drops per the diffuser recommendation. While I enjoyed the scent when I smelled it in the bottle, it quickly began to overwhelmingly smell of cloves. It was a little much for me, I was hoping to pick up on the eucalyptus scent more.</li>
            <li> use it at work and home...great</li>
            <li> One of my favorite essential oils of all. Smells fantastic. Like pumpkin pie and Christmas, with the wonderful smell of cloves.  Use with carrier oil to rub on bottoms of feet. Good for immune system. I use it in my carrier cream to offset the smell of teatree, with added peppermint oil. Great for antiseptic properties to combat folliculitis.</li>
            <li> I think this smells great. Nice clove smell. A little goes a long way, and great price.</li>
            <li> Yes I use it for several different things and it was shipped out immediately was very happy with that!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and was what it said. Not exactly same scent as that of a popular brand I have used in the past but will work. Definitely a better price then the other brand. Since I use it to clean counter tops and in homemade hand sanitizers it works just fine.</li>
            <li> We rub this on our feet at night. It so far has prevented the flu? No vaccine/ poison needed this season.&lt;br /&gt;Look up the old story on this stuff. Its got a really interesting origon. Bubonic plaques, thieves and what not.</li>
            <li> A powerful and uplifting blend that helped transform the energy of my office cubicle and workspace.</li>
            <li> Great oil.  Relaxing calming fragrance.  Healing for skin eruptions, great to inhale to prevent colds and flu, also energizing.  Love this oil.  Has so many purposes.  Eden sends out a well written little booklet with each bottle ordered to explain the benefits of all their oils and uses.  Came packaged nicely in bubble wrap.  I have purchased a few of their oils and will continue to do so because their quality is exceptional without sticker shock  you get from other oils offered from MLM companies.</li>
            <li> I have bought from this company many times. Very satisfied with the product, shipped quickly and on time, price is perfect. I run these a lot and the aroma is what is to be expected. When my grand son comes over and has a sniffle, cough, or runny nose I combine some of these based on his symptoms and run it in my diffusor and he is fine all night. Would and have been buying again.</li>
            <li> I smelled this scent of essential oil at a local massage clinic and asked what it was. When they said it was four thieves I had to get some. I bought it on Amazon and got mine burning today in water on a warmer. It smells so soothing and calming and wonderful. I love it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding antibacterial blend. Used in kitchen and bathroom.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get into oils, mainly because of the price. But when I began doing more research on the benefit of oils, I knew I had to try them. I&#x27;m a teacher, and each year every sort of sickness you can imagine goes around. My husband and I manage to stay pretty healthy, but a couple times during the year I get some sort of respiratory infection. I&#x27;m really excited to try Eden&#x27;s Garden Thieves! I&#x27;ve started using it in my foaming hand soap dispenser, along with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Lavender soap. I hate taking medicine and strive to live as naturally as possible, so this seems like a great alternative! The price is AMAZING for the quality of this product! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more from Eden&#x27;s Garden!</li>
            <li> This smells different when you first take it out of the bottle (minty, maybe?) but settles into a nice Cinnamon-Clove scent fairly quickly.  Definitely a great product.</li>
            <li> Will buy again! Has calming effect too! Excellent when used with coconut oil pulling, so gums are healthier and mouth fresh!</li>
            <li> This oil is very effective against illness. It is also used  for cleaning. I will be using this for that.  I appreciate the description for it gave the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be as powerful at some oils I have tried, but they are also 40 bucks.  Good general use oil</li>
            <li> Cinnamon definitely overpowers the other fragrances but I really liked the end result. Clears the sinuses effectively and smells wonderful. I&#x27;m new to the world of essential oils (I used this in a mister) so I cant do any product comparison but I would buy this again</li>
            <li> It is a very heavy scent.  Gives me a headache. Very disappointed to have bought it</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Quailty is fantastic and for the price you can&#x27;t find a better deal anywhere!</li>
            <li> we use it all the time</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. Learning everyday of many uses for this product. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 years along with an immune powder drink mix. If you desire to avoid the be your best in immune health, give this a try. No bronchitis, flu-like symptoms  for 3 yrs. I live my career, can&#x27;t be sidelined with a cold, flu.</li>
            <li> This is my first with Essential Oils.  I went to a YL party and loved the product but wanted to research before I jumped in.  I discovered the Aroma Soft diffuser (which I love) and Edens Garden oils.  I really like the Thieves blend. My husband thinks it helps his sinus but nothing dramatic yet.  I simply love to smell it and it really relaxes me.  I just ordered three more.  I hope to find something to help my husbands sinus condition. I am really looking forward to learning more about essential oils and their uses. Also, the price is very reasonable and the shipping fast.</li>
            <li> awesome!!!!!! very good quality111</li>
            <li> Burnt oil residue left after burn.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for months and would definitely recommend it.  It is far less expensivd than some brands but just as effective.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE BLEND!! I use it on my body, in the laundry, &amp; in a diffuser!</li>
            <li> This oil is so wonderful! Smells great and comes in the perfect size.  I just love Edens Garden products.</li>
            <li> This product was packaged very well, and they even included info on how to use oil and what is good for what condition. I am very pleased with this brand and will purchase more from them.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Great prices and products!</li>
            <li> The best of the best .</li>
            <li> Another favorite, so good in my  dishwasher to freshen it....as well as all over the house.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in anything that involves natural healing, or help, with the illnesses we face today.  Of course, I do my research first to learn as much as possible about the product before I try it.  We&#x27;re very happy with this blend of oils.  My husband came home from work feeling a bit congested and thought he was catching a cold, or bug.  I massaged a bit of Four Thieves oil on the bottom of his feet and by the next day he was actually feeling better.  I have a history of sinus problems, and I&#x27;ve also used this oil for help with that.  Inhaling it is helpful for sinus headaches, too.  Use your own judgment, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how much this is similar to another popular brand of theives oil.  Thank you for making it more affordable!  I&#x27;m very pleased!!</li>
            <li> I like Four Thieves and this brand is so much less expensive than the Living Oils. It is serving it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Have ordered many times over. Use it all the time. Put it in humidifier to cleanse the air each night.</li>
            <li> I received this along with a diffuser and assorted other essential oils.  This has to be one of my favorites.  Not only does it help with cold season and germs, it is the perfect holiday scent.  Will be buying more of this one</li>
            <li> I love that I&#x27;m getting into the essential oils now. I think they are amazing. I seem to try something different every day. They are amazing.</li>
            <li> Works great in my Allay Essential Oil Diffuser. With cold season coming up, I plan on using (and buying) more of this product. Edens Garden also provided a wonderful product guide along with 101 ways to use essential oils which is very informative. I highly recommend the Four Thieves oil and will purchase more essential oils from this company.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.... Smells a lot like clove. I prefer the more cinnamon smell of young living thieves. However, I do like a lot of the oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden.. Just not this one.</li>
            <li> I like using natural remedies for what ails me.  this is a great product, at a good price. It compares to high end oils I have used at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> This smells so incredibly wonderful. We use this at the preschool to help keep the kids (and us) healthy during the winter months. Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cinnamony. I&#x27;m going to try and mix it with something else to tone it down.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great for fighting colds/ sore throats at the onset.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the fact that I felt an energy shield go up when I rubbed it on the soles of my feet before heading to the airport. We went through the whole traveling Christmas season without picking up the flu or even a cold.</li>
            <li> Love this ,,,and have added it as directed to a bottle with water and mist around the rooms as an antibacterial due to flu season which is on the rampage over here. The smell is great, you packaging very prompt. Price was very attractive and especially you added info brochures on your other carried oils and the uses they perform - very well done - already making lists of the ones I shall next order from you.thanknyou for a well priced first class oil thats rich and smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It arrived quickly and the product actually works. Right when you feel any type of sickness come on, put it on right away and use it often. So glad I found this! If you&#x27;re looking for something to help keep you well, definitely give this a try!</li>
            <li> Product as described. Shipping was slow but arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to Thieves - I use this brand for cleaning, diffusing and in a spray bottle on surfaces.</li>
            <li> I really like my 4 thieves essential oil.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality compared to the pricier products. I&#x27;ve been using this in my humidifier all winter. Love the smell!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite EO&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The rage now is aromatherapy.  I wanted to see what the hustle and bustle is about with the four thieves synergy blend essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;Fun product and glad I didn&#x27;t buy into the gimmick out there paying $150.00 for a humidifier and essential oils.  I like the scents however your money can be spent in a better ways.</li>
            <li> This scent is spicy and just plain wonderful.  Strong enough to fill up my large living room, and it&#x27;s a plus that it is known to fight sickness.  One of my favorites from Edens Garden, and VERY affordable!!  This one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> very concentrated...only needed a drop :)</li>
            <li> Smells so delicious. It is also very calming to me.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine, thank you.</li>
            <li> Shipping was excellent--arrived precisely on date promised. Very reviving and intense as an aromatherapy. Although it is a very invigorating scent, especially when sick, it is not recommended as a stand alone perfume.</li>
            <li> NIce spicy smell. I feel a snese of protection with this but like all essential oils, the effects are subtle.  I will use this through the winter as a protection through the cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced this has helped me stay well! I live in cold New England and both housemates had a horrible hack for weeks. I went home for vacation, got a cold, and used this when I returned to recover quickly.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of poking around at other (more expensive) essential oil brands, and this one was the clear winner not only because of price, but because of great reviews and much more honest marketing. I took a chance and ordered some, and now I&#x27;m hooked! It came with a catalog and a little booklet describing how to use certain essential oils. I use this one for everything! Smells great in the diffuser, and works really beautifully for cleaning and deodorizing. I like to put a few drops on a wipe and drop it in my daughter&#x27;s cloth diaper pail. Lovely!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very satisfied with all my purchases. 👍</li>
            <li> This smells really good, not sure that it is as healthy for me as it says.  It was worth buying just because it makes the house smell so good.</li>
            <li> My wife does not like it</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this product, so far I am delighted with the product.</li>
            <li> I loved this oil and all of the oils from Eden&#x27;s Garden, of which I&#x27;ve now tried several. I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Great product. Great story behind the Thieves oil. I want it to always be available for use in homemade products and for health issues as well.</li>
            <li> Yeap it works at ridding bacteria. I recommend this whole line of essential oils for whatever ails you too. That is if you want to stay away from the Doctors office and away from side effects from prescription drugs.</li>
            <li> Happy with the experience. Like the product.</li>
            <li> Really helps you breathe better if you have a cold or sinus issues.</li>
            <li> This oil was recommended to me to use to keep colds away. I have been using it regularly and have not had a cold yet this winter.  Here is hoping I don&#x27;t get one.</li>
            <li> No colds or flu so far this winter, knock on wood. Made a mix with coconut oil to carry with me and put on my hands and beard when I go out to public places. also put a drop in spray bottle and the laundry to fight mold and germs.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil. Best one I&#x27;ve bought so far and I have already bought 5 other oils from this company. Don&#x27;t get me won&#x27;t I love all the others but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> took a little getting used to the scent. But after awhile my family liked it. Item received sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Good item and works well for the price. Service was what was expected. Package arrived on time with no damage.</li>
            <li> This stinks. Nothing at all like On Guard, should not make a claim that it does.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.I will order more from Edens Garden when I&#x27;m able.Great product😀</li>
            <li> I have ordered Edens Gardens in the past and this particular oil did not disappoint. I use it in my diffuser and in my home made mouth wash. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> As a sinus sufferer, this essential oil is great to use in a vaporizer.  I usually turn on my big vaporizer located in my bedroom about 1 to 2 hours before I retire for the night, and it makes the room smell great as well as help with my sinus headaches.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I usually get sick often but not since using these oils. I put a few drops on the bottom of my feet each morning. If I start to feel rundown I&#x27;ll put some more on during the day. That feeling goes away almost immediately. The only gripe I have is how strong the smell is although its not a bad smell. But, that&#x27;s a small price to pay for feeling much better</li>
            <li> Love the product, love the price, I even loved the little book it came with. Fast and courteous service. Got it Love it and will definitely use your service again! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Not very agreable, but very efficient against bad smells.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice-smelling oil.  I&#x27;ve used it for aromatherapy.  But for those of you who think it can ward of bubonic plague, or any other disease, and who buy the silly story about &amp;#34;Four Thieves?&amp;#34;  Eucalyptus is from AUSTRALIA -- a continent not discovered by Europeans until two hundred years after the Black Death.  Please stop being so ridiculously gullible.</li>
            <li> This was great quality for a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used it to stave off getting sick - great product!</li>
            <li> I rub a few drops on the bottom of my feet and a little on my throat glands when colds are going around and I stay healthy</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the other brands and just as effective,would buy from again soon thanks so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very potent stuff so watch what you put it on.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I though it was :(</li>
            <li> I use this in my DIY air freshener spray as well as all purpose cleaner</li>
            <li> I bought this after discovering Thieves oil for the first time when a friend gave me some from YL. This brand of thieves oil is fair, but did not produce the same dramatic results that I had experienced with the higher end oil. But the price is very reasonable and made this a decent alternative for the money.</li>
            <li> I love to use this oil in my warmer. I enjoy the fragrance of spices so this suits me well. I also use a wee bit of this oil on my toothbrush along with toothpaste to brush my teeth (it is rather strong and will sting the tongue a bit). I do not know if brushing your teeth or rinsing your mouth with it is recommended but I have felt no ill from doing so.</li>
            <li> diffuse it in my kitchen daily and apply to myself and kids.  Side by side with Young Living made me happy.  Not exact but would not expect them to be.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased directly from the EG website. Aroma is pleasant and the quality is commensurate, if not better than that of the MLM blends on the market. (Much more reasonably priced as well!)</li>
            <li> Perfect product, much better price and quality than products being hawked by coworkers.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are not kid safe.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this therapeutic blend. It has a wonderful aroma and my clients comment how much they enjoy it also.  The cinnamon/clove is wonderful this time of year too! Very reasonably priced!!!</li>
            <li> Very strong smell. price was right for a great product. Kept the flu at bay to one household member!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help combat illness, but got an added surprise, which is that this oil smells really nice and pleasant. Gotta love that. Smells like cinnamon and cloves. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought hoping that the formula was the same as Young Living Theives at a better price point however, I was sadly mistaken; the two are very different. Not as potent as I would expect. I will use the Edens Garden in my diffuser so my money won&#x27;t be a total waste.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described and delivered very quickly. I would purchase from this vendor again. Thank you very much! I didn&#x27;t really believe everyone&#x27;s reviews about keeping you from getting sick but every time I could tell a sinus infection was coming on, I would put on my feet and add one drop to my saline Neilmed squirt bottle and I didn&#x27;t have a sinus infection this year. Unbelievable b/c I usually have 2 or 3 really nasty ones. It absolutely works. I put on every time I feel like I&#x27;m getting something and then I don&#x27;t get sick. Have been using for many months now.</li>
            <li> it is actually a bit overpowering at times but I like to change it up with something a bit musky here and there. it does leave a little residue in my vaporizer so I have to clean it after every use with this one (I should be doing that anyways I guess)</li>
            <li> Bought this and have used it already 10 times on my feet and neck at night while its allergy season and it really has helped!! This would a great buy!</li>
            <li> This particular oil is great for so many things , it really helped with the viruses this yr .</li>
            <li> Love this blend.  I put it on cotton balls under the sinks.</li>
            <li> Just got it today and it&#x27;s been in the diffuser for the last few hours. Smells amazing. I used to work in a Chiropractic Clinic where we sold Young Living Thieves Essential Oil. This is just as wonderful at a fraction of the cost. My old boss will wonder why I am no longer buying the Young Living version. I took a chance and bought three of these. So glad I did.</li>
            <li> In our house we use this oil for its antibacterial properties. We put it in our vents and let it blow through the house. Love thieves! It&#x27;s great for your immune system and can be used to clean your yoga mat too :)</li>
            <li> I usually put this in my diffuser during the day, but I&#x27;m not as consistent with it as I am with the nighttime diffusing. I haven&#x27;t noticed any lessening of headaches.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I was sick and because I&#x27;m nursing I wanted something natural. I had already her sick for about 5 days and had shown improvement from other natural remedies when receiving this product in the mail. After using it for 3 days I felt back to myself. I look forward to seeing his it works when I start it earlier on when I&#x27;m coming down with something.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic.  I will admit it.  I have cystic acne on my face, and was willing to try anything.  I ordered and waited.  The smell is a bit woody to me, but blends in quickly.  I started using it on my face (blend with a carrier oil for sensitive skin, as always)  but within a few days I noticed a definite difference.  I&#x27;m not saying it completely healed it, but it was significant enough that my teen daughter asked if she could also use it.  She has now taken over my bottle!  I would recommend it to those who just need a healing boost.  I will be ordering again.  Very pleased with the quality and the company.</li>
            <li> I have put a few drops in my regular bottle of hand wash and use it every time I&#x27;m out in public places. I rub it on the soles of my feet everyday, and I feel wonderful. I mix it with my vitamin e oil and use it twice a week as a nail strengthener. I very pleased to have found this little gem.</li>
            <li> nice to have in medicine chest</li>
            <li> It helps when you have long hours on an airplane</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Just like Young Living and Doterra, but a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> My son was home from college and stopped himself by using this product. He used it straight on his chest and under his nose.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something to keep my family healthy &amp; this does the trick!  Use with a diffuser and to make hand sanitizer spray with Purification blend.  It smells great &amp; we love it!</li>
            <li> Eden&#x27;s Garden is my go to online source for essential oils! I love this company!!! Service is always prompt and the employees kind and thoughtful.</li>
            <li> I used this when I felt a cold coming on and by the next morning, I was feeling just fine.  I used it with a carrier oil on the bottoms of my feet and on my neck and chest.  After rubbing it on, I cupped my hands around my nose and inhaled several times.</li>
            <li> This is less sweet than the ingredients would suggest.  I wanted it to smell a little less medicine-y.  However, in the winter it may be  useful to inhale it in steam for upper respiratory issues.</li>
            <li> This oil makes it smell like Christmas all over again,it makes the hole house smeel good, it also is so good to inhale,or if you have a cold or trouble breathing,bronchitis,any respatory problems.Thank You</li>
            <li> Great aroma and long ladting versus any of the orher brands. Only Edens Garden brand for me in the future.</li>
            <li> Strong, concentrated effective for making my bug repellent.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I put this on the bottoms of our feet at night to keep down cold issues. It works great, and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love thieves! Use in diffuser for colds, in a roller for my cough &amp;. Cold remedy, use it in household cleaners!! So many uses 😊</li>
            <li> As my luck would have it, there was a bit of a mix-up on my order.  However, after notifying Edens Garden they contacted me *within the hour* to sincerity apologize, inform me that this type of thing just \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t happen\\&quot;, and make things right to my utmost satisfaction.  When I received the product, I, of course removed the cap to give it the nose test.  Right away, it was apparent that Edens Garden had sent me a very pure essential oil blend.  I have a few \\&quot;Now\\&quot; brand oils, which are quite good, but their blend nearly put it to shame it was of such high quality.  So I&#x27;ll definitely be used them again for future purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work, Edens Garden, there are not many like you!</li>
            <li> Does not smell too great but if it keeps away germs and viruses, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is great smelling four thieves. I enjoy it.  It is a standard oil in my house. Thank you much</li>
            <li> Great quality product. I like this company and just bought the head ease because I liked thieves so much.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell!!! Not my fav but I do spiritual work that calls for certain oils and this is one of them. I am sure once I mix it it will be a nice addition . But I would never wear stand alone. I also love how the company sends you a wonderful catalog with info and uses on other oils. Will def order from them again!</li>
            <li> Four Thieves Blend Essential oil is really nice, but I prefer the Young Living brand the best.  This is perfect for mixing with some other oils to make drops for your toothbrush and brushing your teeth to prevent and  kill gingivitis.  It can also be used in homemade hand sanitizers and homemade cleaners.  Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> Four Thieves is what got me through cold &amp; flu season. I swear by this oil. I also diffuse it in my classroom and my students love it too!</li>
            <li> the oil is for health reasons. I had the stomach flue for 13 days and a brother from church said he takes Thieves every day and he hasn&#x27;t been sick in years. I decited to try it . Haven&#x27;t been sick yet.</li>
            <li> Use it for cleaning and love it!  I mix a few drops into all my cleaning buckets! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very strong smell. Good to use during cold and flu season</li>
            <li> This is turning out to be my favorite oil by far.  I find myself mixing this with a few drops of other oils as well and the result is just wonderful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good and it works has a nice smell and leaves a nice refreshing scent. It will be good for winter when cold season has arrived.</li>
            <li> A great alternative to DoTerra or Young Living. This isn&#x27;t as cinnamon smelling as the others, but didn&#x27;t notice a difference in usage. My husband actually likes this better. I love it.</li>
            <li> Top of the line seller and product. Very strong scent that is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, just what I expected</li>
            <li> Do like this, I use essential oils all the time.</li>
            <li> I think DoTerra is still a better essential oil because it seems so much stronger.  The sensation I get with one drop of Do-Terra vs Eden&#x27;s Garden...I need about 5 drops.  But, I appreciate the lower price and have switched most of my oils to Edens.  I leave the important ones, like OnGuard and Clary Calm to Do-Terra.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I could order it and any ready to try it out but have not had a reason to yet.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as the oil from Young Living.  I bought several of these for myself and family and I believe it helped keep us all healthy over this past winter and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like this and other products from Edens Garden.  The price is great for Thieves.</li>
            <li> I use it as an air freshner for trash cans and it works wonderfully! I sprinkle a few drops on two cotton balls and it makes a huge difference. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> smells amazing.  hoping this really helps ward off colds this winter.</li>
            <li> great for taking down inflammation and pain in my knee and last a good 8-10 hours</li>
            <li> I like this alot, use it in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic oil blend. Smells fabulous and Im writing this review a month after I purchased the oil, and I just used my last few drops this morning!! I&#x27;ll be ordered another bottle very soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in a spray bottle with a touch of alcohol and fractured coconut oil to keep me from getting sick. I work at a school and everyone is ill. I just spray my hands frequently and gives a nice comforting smell too</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold its scent inthe diffuser very well</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this mix. Can use with distilled or filtered water to clean floor, as air freshener, on counter tops, diffuse in room to prevent spread of viruses and bacteria and much more. I now make my own infusion on the stove and then add a few drops of thieves to strengthen concentrate. Put in frig. until ready to mix with water. It last much longer that way.</li>
            <li> I love Eden&#x27;s Garden.  Their oils are very reasonably priced.  And I&#x27;m fairly certain my use of Four Thieves has kept me from getting sick this season.  I use it as a room deodorizer and I also mix it with hazelnut oil and rub it on my feet and chest.</li>
            <li> Really good smelling thieves oil</li>
            <li> I love Edens Garden oils --- they are great.  I have not used Four Thieves much but will in the very near future.  I am sold on the use of essential oils and will probably not be disappointed with this oil.  I use coconut oil with all my oils.</li>
            <li> helps with frame of mind, and stuffy nose for me. Also, many other applications. it&#x27;s great stuff</li>
            <li> This one for the money last forever</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a must have .Put it on my feet every night before bed . Keeping me healthy this winter.....</li>
            <li> Love this oil! So great for all of the colds going around this time of year.</li>
            <li> Love it. Very pleased with product and price.</li>
            <li> This has a bit too much clove smell for me - I got this to help me sleep &amp; the clove smell was too overwhelming for me.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in a diffuser and love it. Smells good and hopefully it is making the air more healthy for my family.</li>
            <li> I mix with carrier oil and put on my daughters heals , so far she has not been sick all winter and hasn&#x27;t need allergy meds</li>
            <li> A nice clove scented oil that I used in my travels.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely compares to YL brand Thieves oil. I can&#x27;t live without this oil!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell, I have to say. However, this oil stopped a nasty cold overnight.</li>
            <li> Love four thieves.  Very clean smelling and great for fighting germs.  I diffuse often and have to keep in stock.</li>
            <li> This last winter (2014) is the first time I diffused this during cold and flu season and my entire family benefitted. I definitely noticed a shortened duration of cold symptoms. I also believe we totally skipped some colds we could have had. And it smells absolutely amazing!!</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I was expecting.  I add a little lavender essential oil and spray it on doorknobs, faucet handles, counters, etc.  I would definitely purchase this item again.</li>
