            <li>I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of what you would imagine &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; to smell like.</li>
            <li>Well I just started to use it, but I can say that it feels nice and smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic, vegan and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Seems to do a good job of moisturizing and absorbs really well, not to greasy.</li>
            <li>IN ONE Anti Aging Face &amp; Eye Cream, delivers extraordinary nourishment, deep cellular rejuvenation, collagen boosting, wrinkle repairing, superb hydration and help make youthful looking skin.</li>
            <li>but all the other wonderful ingredients help to reduce lines and moisturize.</li>
            <li>I like how the product contains a spritz pump, so you can pump out the product for easy hygienic access.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it IS organic &amp; smells fresh &amp; feels smooth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got great, all natural ingredients that make me feel comfortable about applying it to my skin.</li>
            <li>I like that the cream does not have a strong sent.</li>
            <li>I like it because its organic and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell to it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is 75 POWER PACKED 99% NATURAL &amp; 70% ORGANIC Ingredients including many impressive antioxidants to prevent early aging and wrinkles in addition to rehydrate and rebuild your skin&#x27;s support structure by enhancing the growth of elastin and collagen.&lt;br /&gt;ALL</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly as it absorbs into the skin LOVE</li>
            <li>an actual impressed with how this product has worked with my particular skin!</li>
            <li>This cream goes in so smoothly and absorbs in so well.  </li>
            <li>Smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>also like the texture of this product and how it goes on smooth on your skin without making your face too oily.</li>
            <li>Overall great product and would buy again.</li>
            <li>Add Vitamin E and you will help reduce the appearance of wrinkles, strengthen your skin, provide nourishment to your skin, stimulate collagen and elastin production, and balance and smooth out skin pigmentation.</li>
            <li>It absorbs so well that you will probably forget that you even put any on until you run your hand against your face and realize that it feels really smooth.</li>
            <li>Which is great to me, I love finding new products that use a lot of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This might be one of my new favorite face creams!</li>
            <li>So excited to have found.</li>
            <li>I am excited about the results I am seeing with this face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My experience has been positive and I will continue to use it for sure.</li>
            <li>Spreads easily and quick absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will take up to 6 months time to maximize the full benefits one will receive from using Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice, soft scent that&#x27;s not to feminine.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and the fact that it absorbs super fast and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle which is awesome because the harsher smells set off my asthma.</li>
            <li>and I gave the TruOrganik SUPER ANTIOXIDANT to my wife</li>
            <li>One quick spray will refresh your face with in moments.</li>

            <li>I love that it&#x27;s mostly natural and organic.</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin glowing and feels so fresh.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth reordering over and over.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old, have been using this for about 6 weeks, and my skin looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling fresh &amp; not greasy like some creams out</li>
            <li>i am willing to try just about anything that will help with the wrinkles and so far this is doing good and not leaving my face oily or dry, it has helped the damage the sun has caused to my face from sitting out in the sun for to many years.</li>

            <li>I really like this face cream!</li>
            <li>There are also no uncomfortable odors.</li>
            <li>Pump stopped working after 3 days of using it (reason for 4 *).</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will also notice a difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  </li>
            <li>My face is smooth and it isn&#x27;t breaking out as it normally does with new lotions.</li>
            <li>&amp; I was not compensated in any way for my positive reviews!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I love the smell so delicate and sweet!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay...nothing to really bragg about.</li>
            <li>so you know how much you are getting each time.</li>
            <li>Delivery fast.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>Looked like a great product based on the ingredients, but my face was not happy.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using it on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been trying a lot of different items lately, and with my skin being sensitive nothing has seemed to irritate it which makes me so HAPPY!</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting ready for my wedding</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs very well into my skin.</li>
            <li>I am very thankful to have been given the opportunity to test and review this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Many other products she tried really make her skin break out.</li>
            <li>First off, I am happy that this product is not full of a bunch of chemicals and harsh additives.</li>
            <li>I have tried LOTS of different products but this by far is superior to any other</li>
            <li>This definitely make my skin feel smooth, and soft</li>
            <li>Since my skin is very dry due to the area I am in, I needed a good moisturizer that would not be greasy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend &amp;#34;received</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>This has done wonders for me and I highly recommend it to all of my friends now.</li>
            <li>You get all of this from Pure Body Natural Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, glowing and vibrant again!</li>
            <li>It provides hydration and balance without causing breakouts, a real plus for her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really like that is made with organic and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It helped reduce my dark spots and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Just kind of ridiculous and</li>
            <li>I love the fact that even though it&#x27;s a fairly small bottle you really don&#x27;t need that much to cover your entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>The ingredient list are all familiar to me, such as hyaluronic acid, retinol, various vitamins, rosehip oil, and peptides.</li>
            <li>There are many other products out there, especially just things that you&#x27;d pick up from the drug store, that I would never want to put on my skin - the largest organ of my body.</li>
            <li>Compared to other moisturizers, this is pretty much all natural and contains about 70% organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>The cream is organic and natural and is loaded with antioxidants.</li>
            <li>Since I have sensitive skin I always worry but thus didn&#x27;t burn or cause redness</li>
            <li>It comes with a pump which makes easier to measure and not waste it.</li>
            <li>It is organic, has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am not dissapointed in the use of it this far.</li>
            <li>Using for sensitive  area under eyes.</li>
            <li>I know i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Do not try this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is soft and yet not too greasy.</li>
            <li>I chose this because the cream is organic and natural and is loaded with antioxidants.  </li>
            <li>It is 90% natural and 70% organic.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and have to watch what I use but didn&#x27;t have any problems with this product.</li>
            <li>A small amout out of the handy pump bottle goes a long wase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still dealing with impurities being brought out of my skin, but they are going away nicely, leaving behind a glowier smoother skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t mean you stop at that point, but probably won&#x27;t see much more difference unless you do stop using it.</li>
            <li>have dry skin with psoriasis that comes down my forehead, because of this I need to use pretty intense moisturizer and the antioxidants and rosehip in this really helped with the quality of my skin and reducing my outbreaks.</li>
            <li>What Vitamin C &amp; Hyaluronic Acid do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin generate fresh new cells.</li>
            <li>First I thought that, the hole is not big enough</li>
            <li>The rosehip alone is full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, all while reducing scars and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely a week</li>
            <li>Then, I opened the whole head portion and discovered that the bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li>It is 99% natural and only 70% organic.</li>
            <li>Use the dropper provided to get just the right amount where you want it, without waste.</li>
            <li>It contains rosehip oil , Coenzyme Q10 , retinol among other ingredients and the results I am getting are very noticeable because I&#x27;ve been getting compliments and being asked if I had a job done around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It goes away way too quickly, but a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>The pump sticks a bit and since it&#x27;s a product for aging women, it&#x27;s irritating that I can&#x27;t read the fine print.</li>
            <li>I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice, soft scent that&#x27;s not to feminine.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and the fact that it absorbs super fast and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle which is awesome because the harsher smells set off my asthma.</li>
            <li> and I gave the TruOrganik SUPER ANTIOXIDANT to my wife</li>

            <li> /&gt;You will also notice a difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.  </li>
            <li> My face is smooth and it isn&#x27;t breaking out as it normally does with new lotions.</li>

            <li> I love the smell so delicate and sweet!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay...nothing to really bragg about.</li>
            <li> so you know how much you are getting each time.</li>
            <li> Delivery fast.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li> Looked like a great product based on the ingredients, but my face was not happy.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been trying a lot of different items lately, and with my skin being sensitive nothing has seemed to irritate it which makes me so HAPPY!</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting ready for my wedding</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs very well into my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very thankful to have been given the opportunity to test and review this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Many other products she tried really make her skin break out.</li>
            <li> First off, I am happy that this product is not full of a bunch of chemicals and harsh additives.</li>
            <li> I have tried LOTS of different products but this by far is superior to any other</li>
            <li> This definitely make my skin feel smooth, and soft</li>
            <li> Since my skin is very dry due to the area I am in, I needed a good moisturizer that would not be greasy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend &amp;#34;received</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> This has done wonders for me and I highly recommend it to all of my friends now.</li>
            <li> You get all of this from Pure Body Natural Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, glowing and vibrant again!</li>
            <li> It provides hydration and balance without causing breakouts, a real plus for her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really like that is made with organic and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It helped reduce my dark spots and fine lines.</li>
            <li> Just kind of ridiculous and</li>
            <li> I love the fact that even though it&#x27;s a fairly small bottle you really don&#x27;t need that much to cover your entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list are all familiar to me, such as hyaluronic acid, retinol, various vitamins, rosehip oil, and peptides.</li>
            <li> There are many other products out there, especially just things that you&#x27;d pick up from the drug store, that I would never want to put on my skin - the largest organ of my body.</li>
            <li> Compared to other moisturizers, this is pretty much all natural and contains about 70% organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> The cream is organic and natural and is loaded with antioxidants.</li>
            <li> Since I have sensitive skin I always worry but thus didn&#x27;t burn or cause redness</li>
            <li> It comes with a pump which makes easier to measure and not waste it.</li>
            <li> It is organic, has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am not dissapointed in the use of it this far.</li>
            <li> Using for sensitive  area under eyes.</li>
            <li> I know i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Do not try this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is soft and yet not too greasy.</li>
            <li> I chose this because the cream is organic and natural and is loaded with antioxidants.  </li>
            <li> It is 90% natural and 70% organic.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have to watch what I use but didn&#x27;t have any problems with this product.</li>
            <li> A small amout out of the handy pump bottle goes a long wase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still dealing with impurities being brought out of my skin, but they are going away nicely, leaving behind a glowier smoother skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mean you stop at that point, but probably won&#x27;t see much more difference unless you do stop using it.</li>
            <li> have dry skin with psoriasis that comes down my forehead, because of this I need to use pretty intense moisturizer and the antioxidants and rosehip in this really helped with the quality of my skin and reducing my outbreaks.</li>
            <li> What Vitamin C &amp; Hyaluronic Acid do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin generate fresh new cells.</li>
            <li> First I thought that, the hole is not big enough</li>
            <li> The rosehip alone is full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, all while reducing scars and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely a week</li>
            <li> Then, I opened the whole head portion and discovered that the bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li> It is 99% natural and only 70% organic.</li>
            <li> Use the dropper provided to get just the right amount where you want it, without waste.</li>
            <li> It contains rosehip oil , Coenzyme Q10 , retinol among other ingredients and the results I am getting are very noticeable because I&#x27;ve been getting compliments and being asked if I had a job done around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It goes away way too quickly, but a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The pump sticks a bit and since it&#x27;s a product for aging women, it&#x27;s irritating that I can&#x27;t read the fine print.</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>
            <li> All these ingredients really provide your face with the essential fatty acids and antioxidants that are supposed to moisturize your dry skin while reducing your wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Therefore, by using the dropper, you&#x27;ll have that bottle last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its non greasy and absorbs quickly and easily, I am not the biggest fan of the smell, its has a &#x27;green&#x27; smell to it</li>
            <li> The bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long...</li>
            <li> Oz says when looking for a Vitamin C Serum, it needs to have at least 20% Vitamin C. Pure Body Naturals does just</li>
            <li> really have NOTHING negative to say about this product</li>
            <li> Havent used it to long so time will tell if its helping the aging process or not..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t want to see the long term use will affect my skin appearance.</li>
            <li> I have several products from this company, and all work as expected.</li>
            <li> I look forward to continueing use of this product and seeing the long term effects.</li>
            <li> I put it on right before I apply my makeup Everyday!!!</li>
            <li> cause my face isn&#x27;t so dry.  </li>
            <li> It does not make my skin feel dry or itchy.</li>
            <li> In the summer months when you&#x27;re using A/C and or your house is too dry you need to give your skin some help.</li>
            <li> No harmful chemicals to dry out or damage your skin.</li>
            <li> cause i&#x27;m team dry face!  </li>
            <li> Comes in an amber colored bottle to prevent the Vitamins from breaking down in the light rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> , her skin gets very dry in winter</li>
            <li> also love the fact that their isn&#x27;t a bad smell with this like some face creams.</li>
            <li> but my bottle was practically empty.</li>
            <li> But this time, both the bottles were almost empty when I opened those.</li>
            <li> actually, I think it may have help with a bad breakout I had right before starting to use this product.</li>
            <li> A little bit truly does go a long way with this</li>
            <li> bought it to try it out due to the review.</li>
            <li> Not sure I look any younger.</li>
            <li> The only qualm I have is the small bottle.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, as some other creams did before!</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the bottle is really small, so I hope it won&#x27;t be out of stock!</li>
            <li> Not many products help balance her dry spots.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet, not even slightly.</li>
            <li> This little bottle is loaded with slew of ingredients.</li>
            <li> This little bottle lasts a while</li>
            <li> I recommend this along with their other products!!</li>
            <li> A few minutes after i put it on</li>
            <li> Peptides work well to firm the skin</li>
            <li> Tripeptide-5&lt;br /&gt;~  Beeswax, Green Tea, Cranberry, Raspberry, Grape &amp; Blueberry Extract</li>
            <li> Within a few days your skin will feel softer and silkier.</li>
            <li> Jojoba, aloe, rosehip oil to name a few.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if that makes sense, but basically my eyes feel refreshed</li>
            <li> not sure what the Rave is about this product.</li>
            <li> So small.</li>
            <li> Im not sure about this product at all.</li>
            <li> The pump sucks; you have to press it a few times to get the product out, and when it does the it shoots out the cream landing who knows where.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I do not see look as tired.</li>
            <li> Is a useless product.</li>
            <li> I hate feeling like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> but that was crazy .</li>
            <li> So i refrain from giving a bad rating.</li>
            <li> annoying to tolerate.</li>
            <li> It was horrible .</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This stuff feels refreshing and works so good! I have been using it for my eye area at night and in the morning. It acts as a moisturizer but when I look at my eyes they do not feel as puffy. I am not sure if that makes sense, but basically my eyes feel refreshed and I do not see look as tired. The cream has a cucumber smell to it. Love this stuff, I was lucky enough to receive this on a promotional discount but I plan on continuing to purchase it. Works very good!</li>

            <li> This cream is amazing and works wonders.  I like the fact that it is organic and not tested on animals and made in the United states. I been using this since january and I have seen amazing results. It comes in a pump bottle so you know how much you are getting each time. I also like that I can use it underneath my makeup and leave my face looking flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 75 POWER PACKED 99% NATURAL &amp; 70% ORGANIC Ingredients including many impressive antioxidants to prevent early aging and wrinkles in addition to rehydrate and rebuild your skin&#x27;s support structure by enhancing the growth of elastin and collagen.&lt;br /&gt;ALL IN ONE Anti Aging Face &amp; Eye Cream, delivers extraordinary nourishment, deep cellular rejuvenation, collagen boosting, wrinkle repairing, superb hydration and help make youthful looking skin.</li>
            <li> This product is really good. I received it for quality testing and review and I gave the TruOrganik SUPER ANTIOXIDANT to my wife, her skin gets very dry in winter and I though she may like to give it a try. Not many products help balance her dry spots. Many other products she tried really make her skin break out. She really likes the TruOrganik SUPER ANTIOXIDANT moisturizer. It is organic, has natural ingredients. It provides hydration and balance without causing breakouts, a real plus for her sensitive skin. She has been using this for almost 2 weeks and her skin is smoother, more luminous. She is happy with this product and so am I.</li>
            <li> This Antioxidant is a bottle of sunshine. One quick spray will refresh your face with in moments. I am excited about the results I am seeing with this face moisturizer. The cream is organic and natural and is loaded with antioxidants which is always healthy. I needed something that would specifically target the lines around my mouth which is does. Since my skin is very dry due to the area I am in, I needed a good moisturizer that would not be greasy. This does the trick for me :) I also received it for free to test out so that makes it even better!</li>
            <li> Received this item for free, nice antioxidant supplement for face. Would recommend to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this, light and soothing and the fact that is an antioxidant for your face is the greatest. At my age I need assistance with complexion as it seems to have gone in reverse.  I am not dissapointed in the use of it this far. This review is solely my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The information provided is what I experienced.</li>
            <li> not sure what the Rave is about this product. bought it to try it out due to the review. Been using it for several months now have not seen any changes at all. didnt work for me</li>
            <li> easy to use works good</li>
            <li> good product, no skin irritation, good absorption, no greasy , would by again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference but use it daily.</li>
            <li> It is OK product. Delivery fast.</li>
            <li> Good product. Using for sensitive  area under eyes. Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li> Been using over a week, but I want expected to see amazing results.  It&#x27;s just great because it&#x27;s so &amp;#34;ALL NATURAL&amp;#34; you can use it all over your gave, neck, AND EYES!  Wish it came in a bigger size. So small.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my face feel and think it makes my skin look better. However maybe it was me but my bottle was practically empty. I feel like I just used up a sampler. It&#x27;s barely a week and I&#x27;m already out of product. Just kind of ridiculous and no I didn&#x27;t over apply product I literally would dab a dime sized amount all over my face and neck twice a day.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this moisturizer for about a month now and I can definitely see a difference. My skin is firmer, healthier and has a glow. I love that it&#x27;s organic, vegan and cruelty free. I will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product with a discount. After using this product a couple of times, I can already feel my skin feeling tighter and healthier. I can&#x27;t want to see the long term use will affect my skin appearance. I&#x27;m not expecting a drastic change, but I hope the continuation of this product keep my skin feeling healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I tried this product threw karmas reviews. I love trying all these different products to see which one works best. A few minutes after i put it on i had to rinse it off my face because it felt like it was on fire. My face was red . after i washed it two times it was still red with patches . I know i have sensitive skin but that was crazy . It said for all skin types. Do not try this product if you have sensitive skin. It was horrible .</li>
            <li> I really like this face cream! It is soft and yet not too greasy. The smell is subtle which is awesome because the harsher smells set off my asthma. I love that it&#x27;s mostly natural and organic. It does leave my skin glowing and feels so fresh. It&#x27;s great product and I was lucky to receive a bottle complimentary to try and to give it a review.</li>
            <li> Looked like a great product based on the ingredients, but my face was not happy. I am sure it is a good product but not for me.</li>
            <li> Neither here not there.  I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using it on my skin.</li>
            <li> This little bottle is loaded with slew of ingredients. I love anything containing Peptides. Peptides work well to firm the skin but all the other wonderful ingredients help to reduce lines and moisturize. It soaks in immediately providing a youthful glow. I use it as a serum and follow up with TruOrganics Retinol Moisturizer. They make a great team. Many moisturizers don&#x27;t do a thing as an eye cream. This one does. I&#x27;m not a fan of the bottle. The pump sticks a bit and since it&#x27;s a product for aging women, it&#x27;s irritating that I can&#x27;t read the fine print. It&#x27;s microscopic. It would be better served to the customer to be in a more substantial sized bottle so we can read it. My 4 star rating is based on the packaging. The product itself, I love. Sample provided to try and test as a consumer for review purposes. These are my findings.</li>
            <li> I have tried LOTS of different products but this by far is superior to any other</li>
            <li> This would be considered the BMW of face creams.  You know, the most expensive one on the market that you can customize with all the extras.  Natura Science Labs hit this one out of the park because it is packed with all the greats. To name some of the ingredients that should stand out if you have been researching creams and serums to turn back the hands of time.  This bottle has them all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~  Botanical Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;~  Ocean Based Retinol&lt;br /&gt;~  Vitamin B5, C &amp; E&lt;br /&gt;~  Rosehip Oil, Coconut Oil &amp; Q10&lt;br /&gt;~  Matrixyl 3000 &amp; Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5&lt;br /&gt;~  Beeswax, Green Tea, Cranberry, Raspberry, Grape &amp; Blueberry Extract&lt;br /&gt;~  Macadamia, Avocado, Flax Seed, Evening Primrose, Borage, Tamanu &amp; Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;~  Licorice, Eyebright, Arnica, Bearberry Extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why when it says SUPER Antioxidant it is not joking because it has some of the best ingredients on the market that are going to take the age out of your face without a surgical price tag.  You will be doing yourself a favor to try this one.  *received for testing and review.</li>
            <li> ANOTHER GOOD ITEM! I have several products from this company, and all work as expected. I have been trying a lot of different items lately, and with my skin being sensitive nothing has seemed to irritate it which makes me so HAPPY! This definitely make my skin feel smooth, and soft and I hope it will continue to impress. I have seen noticeable differences in my face. I will continue using and purchase more once this is out. I received this for an unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> 2nd order .. Great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got it. I got it thinking of my mom,she uses alot of stuff for her face and I know she&#x27;s going to love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome. I love this. A lot. Really. I do.  The bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long... But it&#x27;s worth reordering over and over.</li>
            <li> Is a useless product.</li>
            <li> Im not sure about this product at all. I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet, not even slightly. I hate feeling like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Not sure I look any younger.</li>
            <li> The texture feels good but I can&#x27;t get over the dispenser. The pump sucks; you have to press it a few times to get the product out, and when it does the it shoots out the cream landing who knows where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too annoying to tolerate.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  The seller is really efficient, and the product is great.  I&#x27;m 68 years old, have been using this for about 6 weeks, and my skin looks better than ever.  I ordered a second bottle for my travel kit.</li>
            <li> I chose this because the cream is organic and natural and is loaded with antioxidants.  This cream goes in so smoothly and absorbs in so well.  My face is smooth and it isn&#x27;t breaking out as it normally does with new lotions. I can&#x27;t wait to see how things progress with continued use. I am pleased to have received this product as a discounted price. My experience has been positive and I will continue to use it for sure.</li>
            <li> Makes My skin feel tighter and healthier. Smooth to the touch. I this this is a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial moisturizer and it really does work wonders in preventing your face from aging too quickly. Compared to other moisturizers, this is pretty much all natural and contains about 70% organic ingredients. The ingredient list are all familiar to me, such as hyaluronic acid, retinol, various vitamins, rosehip oil, and peptides. All these ingredients really provide your face with the essential fatty acids and antioxidants that are supposed to moisturize your dry skin while reducing your wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the texture of this product and how it goes on smooth on your skin without making your face too oily. There are also no uncomfortable odors. I like how the product contains a spritz pump, so you can pump out the product for easy hygienic access. The only qualm I have is the small bottle. It goes away way too quickly, but a little goes a long way! I highly recommend using this product. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, glowing and vibrant again! This has done wonders for me and I highly recommend it to all of my friends now. I&#x27;m getting ready for my wedding and I wanted to make sure that my skin was nice for it, this did the trick. My acne cleared up, my skin is softer and smoother and it has just worked miracles.</li>
            <li> When putting on the lotion it is very smooth and feels refreshing.  It does not make my skin feel dry or itchy. It has a nice smell to it.  I received this free to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good product. Pump stopped working after 3 days of using it (reason for 4 *). Overall great product and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the product for the effect. This is the 4th bottle I got. But this time, both the bottles were almost empty when I opened those. First I thought that, the hole is not big enough that&#x27;s why the product is not coming out. Then, I opened the whole head portion and discovered that the bottle is almost empty. Maybe it&#x27;s a batch defect. So i refrain from giving a bad rating.</li>
            <li> I have been using thia product for 4 days!&lt;br /&gt;I an actual impressed with how this product has worked with my particular skin! My face looks rejuvenated and glowing!</li>
            <li> This little bottle lasts a while and hopefully I&#x27;ll feel a lot better when it&#x27;s done than when I began. In the summer months when you&#x27;re using A/C and or your house is too dry you need to give your skin some help. Hire this antioxidant and put it to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW**</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells nice like cucumbers. Feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer. It is 90% natural and 70% organic. No harmful chemicals to dry out or damage your skin. A small amout out of the handy pump bottle goes a long wase. I like that the cream does not have a strong sent. I have used this moisturzer 2 times a day once in the morning and once before bed. I really like how it leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I look forward to continueing use of this product and seeing the long term effects. I recomend this product to anyone trying to improver there overall skin health. I recived this product free in exhange of my honest opinion and review.</li>
            <li> I like it because its organic and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell to it i use it at night</li>
            <li> What Vitamin C &amp; Hyaluronic Acid do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin generate fresh new cells. Add Vitamin E and you will help reduce the appearance of wrinkles, strengthen your skin, provide nourishment to your skin, stimulate collagen and elastin production, and balance and smooth out skin pigmentation. You get all of this from Pure Body Natural Vitamin C Serum. Not just because they added Vitamin E to the Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid, but because the three ingredients work so well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Oz says when looking for a Vitamin C Serum, it needs to have at least 20% Vitamin C. Pure Body Naturals does just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t sticky, but it isn&#x27;t like water either. Use the dropper provided to get just the right amount where you want it, without waste. Comes in an amber colored bottle to prevent the Vitamins from breaking down in the light rendering it useless. The bottle is packaged in bubble wrap, tape and placed in a bubble envelope. No crunching or breaking. Shipment goes out quickly after order is placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take up to 6 months time to maximize the full benefits one will receive from using Vitamin C Serum. It doesn&#x27;t mean you stop at that point, but probably won&#x27;t see much more difference unless you do stop using it. Therefore, by using the dropper, you&#x27;ll have that bottle last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will also notice a difference the first time you use it. Most products are not that way. You will feel your skin tighten, you&#x27;ll see your skin brighten. Within a few days your skin will feel softer and silkier. I&#x27;m still dealing with impurities being brought out of my skin, but they are going away nicely, leaving behind a glowier smoother skin. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the anti-aging products I&#x27;ve tried, this one works the fastest, and the bestest. I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I like this Organic Face &amp; Eye Cream! Love the fact that it IS organic &amp; smells fresh &amp; feels smooth! I put it on right before I apply my makeup Everyday!!! It leaves your face feeling fresh &amp; not greasy like some creams out there!&lt;br /&gt;Im so happy I was chosen to review this item for free for my 100% honest feedback &amp; I was not compensated in any way for my positive reviews!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I received the Organic Super Antioxidant for testing and reviewing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be one of my new favorite face creams! I love the texture and the fact that it absorbs super fast and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky. It absorbs so well that you will probably forget that you even put any on until you run your hand against your face and realize that it feels really smooth.I love the fact that even though it&#x27;s a fairly small bottle you really don&#x27;t need that much to cover your entire face and neck. A little bit truly does go a long way with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that their isn&#x27;t a bad smell with this like some face creams. If you even smell anything it&#x27;s more of what you would imagine &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; to smell like. Which means this product would be good for just about any and everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have NOTHING negative to say about this product and I will definitely be telling my friends and family that they need to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have included a picture of what the bottle and package looks like and also a picture of what the cream looks like once you squeeze it out.</li>
            <li> i am willing to try just about anything that will help with the wrinkles and so far this is doing good and not leaving my face oily or dry, it has helped the damage the sun has caused to my face from sitting out in the sun for to many years. I received this for my hones review.</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff. It helps keep your face looking youthful and glowing. It is packed full of organic antioxidants and vitamins that help keep you looking your best. It adds a nice little face glow and makes my face looking good and feeling smooth and soft. I really like that is made with organic and all natural ingredients. I have extremely sensitive skin and have to watch what I use but didn&#x27;t have any problems with this product. It worked perfectly cleaned up my face and acne and helping me stay looking young. I received this as a gift for review.</li>
            <li> I received this in order to review and share my honest opinions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin with psoriasis that comes down my forehead, because of this I need to use pretty intense moisturizer and the antioxidants and rosehip in this really helped with the quality of my skin and reducing my outbreaks. Its non greasy and absorbs quickly and easily, I am not the biggest fan of the smell, its has a &#x27;green&#x27; smell to it but it goes away quickly as it absorbs into the skin LOVE THIS</li>
            <li> First off, I am happy that this product is not full of a bunch of chemicals and harsh additives. It&#x27;s got great, all natural ingredients that make me feel comfortable about applying it to my skin. There are many other products out there, especially just things that you&#x27;d pick up from the drug store, that I would never want to put on my skin - the largest organ of my body. Anyways, back to this product. It&#x27;s terrific! It&#x27;s got a nice, soft scent that&#x27;s not to feminine. It&#x27;s also not greasy, which is very important to me. It absorbs very well into my skin. I also have quite a struggle with acne and I didn&#x27;t find this to product to make me break out at all ... actually, I think it may have help with a bad breakout I had right before starting to use this product. I am very thankful to have been given the opportunity to test and review this product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is packed with all kinds of nutrients and awesome things for your skin! Jojoba, aloe, rosehip oil to name a few. It is 99% natural and only 70% organic. Which is great to me, I love finding new products that use a lot of natural ingredients. This stuff really works. It helped reduce my dark spots and fine lines. it hydrated my skin nicely. It rubs in and absorbs well and didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. *sample provided to review.</li>
            <li> Well I just started to use it, but I can say that it feels nice and smooth on my skin. Also it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, as some other creams did before! I love the smell so delicate and sweet! The only thing is that the bottle is really small, so I hope it won&#x27;t be out of stock! Because I think I am going to buy more when it is finished! :)</li>
            <li> Love this. I am going to order  2 next time.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel great</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.</li>
