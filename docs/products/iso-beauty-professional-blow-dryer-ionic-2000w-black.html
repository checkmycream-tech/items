            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It gets very hot with is great for straightening hair.</li>
            <li>The best bow dryer ive ever put my hands on im a professional Barber</li>
            <li>This blow dryer looks great, but it&#x27;s just a lot of hair, and not even hot air.</li>
            <li>I use on medium heat and good for cool button</li>
            <li>Love This Blow</li>
            <li>it fast for great price!&lt;br /&gt;Me &amp; My Family Love shopping with Amazon</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>If you are interested in this dryer because they claim in the product description that it is Not 110-220 Volt and  50-60Hz, DON&#x27;T because it isn&#x27;t!!!  </li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t easily use a plug adaptor and use it during my upcoming trip to Asia.</li>
            <li>Hands down the worlds BEST blowdryer...</li>
            <li>Huge under statement.</li>
            <li>Very powerful blow dryer.</li>
            <li>The blow dryer is extremely powerful, so if you try to use it on the most powerful setting, your hair is gonna blow all over the place.</li>
            <li>but this thing has exceptional great power with easy use buttons of cold warm and hot.</li>
            <li>I already have one of those, a Super Solano in fact.</li>
            <li>I love my new hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Did not have what it takes to dry my and the florsent lights are to bright when shining on my face.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Much better than my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Overall, after reading countless of reviews for this and other blow dryers, i thought i had found the perfect one, but no... my $18 Walgreen&#x27;s blow dryer was more efficient.</li>
            <li>But forgot to turn it on to see if it got hot.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fast and is not heavy!!!!</li>
            <li>So you have to leave it in the middle setting, which is also a bit too strong.</li>
            <li>It dryes my hair super fast while leaving it soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>You spend a little bit of dough for it, but it is far superior to the cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very well packaged.</li>
            <li>that was important to me as I&#x27;m a female barber.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>I SAVED SO MUCH MONEY</li>
            <li>but it seems to be a very well built.</li>
            <li>My hair actually felt softer the first time I used this!</li>
            <li>it gets hot (someone complain for not enough heat)</li>
            <li>I use it on sensitive scalps:))&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>this thing is srond enoughf and not even that loud.</li>
            <li>The plug is verry smaller than normal blow dryer plugs witch is a bounce the cord isent</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It uses a centrifugal fan, and it&#x27;s a little quieter than other blow dryers.</li>
            <li> Blew cold air, never got hot.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> to heavy</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair and the 2000W</li>
            <li> dont look no more</li>
            <li> Drys very slow and not powerful</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s sad.</li>

            <li> Great product. Not only is it sleek in design but fucntions well. I feel like a pro when using it .</li>
            <li> I love my new hairdryer. It dryes my hair super fast while leaving it soft and shinny. Thanks ISO!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Drys very slow and not powerful</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful top quality blow dryer! Very well packaged. Worth every penny. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love This Blow dryer!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best.&lt;br /&gt;Got it fast for great price!&lt;br /&gt;Me &amp; My Family Love shopping with Amazon</li>
            <li> When I received my blow dryer my daughter had opened it, and threw away the box. When I went to use it the blow dryer it was broke.  Very disappointed, and bummed I can&#x27;t return it. :(</li>
            <li> If you are interested in this dryer because they claim in the product description that it is Not 110-220 Volt and  50-60Hz, DON&#x27;T because it isn&#x27;t!!!  I bought this so I couldn&#x27;t easily use a plug adaptor and use it during my upcoming trip to Asia. It just arrived and I opened the box to find a 110V 50Hz dryer. I already have one of those, a Super Solano in fact. Totally defeated the purpose and I leave in 36 hours with no hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair actually felt softer the first time I used this! I love it!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Professional blow dryer&amp;#34; Huge under statement. Shipping was wonderful, unpacked it all nice and neat. But forgot to turn it on to see if it got hot. Was used the next day, no damage to it what so ever. Blew cold air, never got hot. Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair dresser ...this dryer makes my job easier!!!! it&#x27;s fast and is not heavy!!!! if you need a hair dryer...get this one!</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works great, looks reply good&lt;br /&gt;Not to heavy that was important to me as I&#x27;m a female barber.&lt;br /&gt;Long cord is a plus and simple in use ...it gets hot (someone complain for not enough heat) I use on medium heat and good for cool button I use it on sensitive scalps:))&lt;br /&gt;And the price is awesome !!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Hands down the worlds BEST blowdryer... all the women in my family have one. Its awesome, heat controls and power controls. Works awesome</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME I SAVED SO MUCH MONEY I RECOMMEND FOR FUTURE PURCHASES!!! 100% RELIABLE!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M SO GLAD I FOUND IT!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST blow dryer.  You spend a little bit of dough for it, but it is far superior to the cheaper ones.  It gets very hot with is great for straightening hair.</li>
            <li> Very powerful blow dryer. It uses a centrifugal fan, and it&#x27;s a little quieter than other blow dryers.</li>
            <li> This dryer is great - I have very thick long hair and the 2000W really helps to get it dried quicker......</li>
            <li> Much better than my old hair dryer. I would recommend</li>
            <li> Great purchase, super!!!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer looks great, but it&#x27;s just a lot of hair, and not even hot air. It was 3 heat settings a,d 3 power settings. the high setting is barely hot, so you can&#x27;t mold hair, the middle temp setting is just slightly cooler than that, and also useless. The blow dryer is extremely powerful, so if you try to use it on the most powerful setting, your hair is gonna blow all over the place. So you have to leave it in the middle setting, which is also a bit too strong. Overall, after reading countless of reviews for this and other blow dryers, i thought i had found the perfect one, but no... my $18 Walgreen&#x27;s blow dryer was more efficient. That&#x27;s sad.</li>
            <li> Did not have what it takes to dry my and the florsent lights are to bright when shining on my face.</li>
            <li> The best bow dryer ive ever put my hands on im a professional Barber and i was thinking of buying a compressor for blowing hair off my clients but this thing has exceptional great power with easy use buttons of cold warm and hot. The plug is verry smaller than normal blow dryer plugs witch is a bounce the cord isent bulk it is exclent. I will not be needing a $300 dollar compressor this thing is srond enoughf and not even that loud. Its great. As for as long life im not shure but cuz i recently got it but it seems to be a very well built. It includes 2 attachments and in store prices $180 Amazon.com prices is a bonus i hope this helps you guys make a decision dont look no more this is the one ONE.</li>
