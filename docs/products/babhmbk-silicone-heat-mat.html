            <li>Nice mat for what it is, but</li>

            <li>Great price and worth every penny !</li>
            <li>In the words of papa Phil from duck dynasty, I was &amp;#34;Happy Happy Happy&amp;#34; after using this on my hair for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great with my Tigi Beach Waves tool, which doesn&#x27;t have any sort of holder to keep the hot tool off the counter.</li>
            <li>However, that&#x27;s not saying its not for you! :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>This allows her to lay the iron on the dresser top with no damage to the dresser.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased this as well.</li>
            <li>god knows what bathroom gunk, but with regular rinsing with a bit of Dawn it&#x27;s been great!</li>
            <li>SATISFIED.......</li>
            <li>This product was just what I was looking for and more.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived very quickly, thank you.</li>
            <li>It has really held up so far, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp; is easy to wash off</li>
            <li>Travels easily too.</li>
            <li>This mat is great for saving your counter top from the heat of the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This mat replaced a towel that was always in danger of catching fire from a hot curling iron.</li>
            <li>This mat is fabulous and easy for her to just wrap around the iron when she&#x27;s done using it.</li>
            <li>It literally takes me about 5 minutes and it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall a Great Product.</li>
            <li>It works great and is bigger then the iron, in case it moves around.</li>
            <li>great for my new vanity, keeps my straight iron from burning it.</li>
            <li>it keeps your counter cool</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Wish it was more narrow to fit better on my counter top.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to have a home to go into, so after that incident, knowing my memory, I wanted something to safeguard me from having that happen again.</li>
            <li>Aborbs all heat from very hot tools</li>
            <li>Its the perfect size long enough and wider than needed.</li>
            <li>When on a wooden unit I do worry as it still gets warm but often fold the mat in half and place the straightners on top - no problem! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and when clean look exactly as it does the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>This item was shipped quickly and it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>right size to protect without having to put away all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Could not find in any stores.  </li>
            <li>great little tool!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to - keep heat off of the countertop.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>it does get somewhat hot</li>
            <li>I use this mat every time Im using a hot tool.</li>
            <li>Could have been longer so you could put two hot hair tools on it..but does the job for one tool.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works exactly as described</li>
            <li>It washes clean fairly easily, though seems to act as a magnet for loose make-up.  </li>
            <li>I can heat up my flat iron and not worry about burning my bathroom counter top.  </li>
            <li>I really love this on my long hair.</li>
            <li>It works very well and it is large enough that you can fit your whole curling iron on it along with additional ones if needed.</li>
            <li>The silicone mat protects your counter from the intense heat of a straight iron (mine goes from 240 degrees up to 400 degrees.)  </li>
            <li>and it really is heat resistant</li>
            <li>but it really protects your furniture or counter.</li>
            <li>She said it worked very well for her.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I have a very HOT iron that actually did scorch/burn a spot in my counter top after I forgot and left it on for the entire day!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to clean  rinse with water and soap and drip dry or wipe down with a disinfecting wipe.</li>
            <li>I bought my daughter a new hair iron and noticed that she had to lay it on the tile floor when brushing her hair, then bend over and pick it up again, and repeat this process.</li>
            <li>This new mat does its job and keeps burning and melting from happening.</li>
            <li>Its very helpful as i leave my straighter on it after its unplugged so it can cool down and then roll up the mat for storage!</li>
            <li>At least I haven&#x27;t burn anything since :)</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the company that makes this offers a 1 year warranty.</li>
            <li>so the 1-inch flat iron fits very well.</li>
            <li>I love this no more resting your flat irons on a old towel.</li>
            <li>In addition to protecting your counter, the straight iron doesn&#x27;t seem to slip while on the mat as it did on the regular countertop prior to getting the mat.  </li>

            <li> It lays flat, yet can be rolled for storage.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning for either my flat iron or curling iron</li>
            <li> I can accidentlly leave my flat iron on and not worry about burning my dresser.</li>
            <li> but then again i don&#x27;t lay my flat irons on its side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;like curling irons, flat irons, hair lowers etc.  </li>
            <li> but it does what it says and no burn marks on the counter from the flat iron!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many counters I have left ugly scars on.</li>
            <li> It lays flat, and the devices don&#x27;t slide around like with other solutions.</li>
            <li> Was a little smaller than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Purchased due to request from my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> so the irons stay put once you set them down.  </li>
            <li> Item is too small</li>
            <li> I use it at 400 degrees almost always since I have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Thick material, protects all surfaces.</li>
            <li> sorry I wasted my money</li>
            <li> But with this product I will never again leave my mark behind.</li>
            <li> I have a piece of furniture with glass shelves in the bathroom, and I needed something to sit on it for my straightening iron and curling iron that wouldn&#x27;t look horrible if left out on the shelf every day.</li>
            <li> We have a really small bathroom and the mat can get nasty with water/makeup/</li>

            <li> Just not for me!  However, that&#x27;s not saying its not for you! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair straightners and it works well depending on where you put it.  When on a wooden unit I do worry as it still gets warm but often fold the mat in half and place the straightners on top - no problem! :)</li>
            <li> This is another excellent product I found on Amazon!  The silicone mat protects your counter from the intense heat of a straight iron (mine goes from 240 degrees up to 400 degrees.)  I use it at 400 degrees almost always since I have thick hair.  In addition to protecting your counter, the straight iron doesn&#x27;t seem to slip while on the mat as it did on the regular countertop prior to getting the mat.  I love this product.  Highly recommend. ;o) ;o)</li>

            <li> This mat replaced a towel that was always in danger of catching fire from a hot curling iron. It does exactly what it is supposed to - keep heat off of the countertop. It lays flat, yet can be rolled for storage. I bought eight of them, one for my wife and the others for her friends at work. Everyone has given rave reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! It was exactly what I was looking for. I have a piece of furniture with glass shelves in the bathroom, and I needed something to sit on it for my straightening iron and curling iron that wouldn&#x27;t look horrible if left out on the shelf every day. This fit perfectly, and it looks great as well. It lays flat, and the devices don&#x27;t slide around like with other solutions. It has really held up so far, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>

            <li> This does a great job of protecting the counter from heat.  I&#x27;ve used it with hair straighteners (up to 430 degrees) and curling irons.

            <li> I bought my daughter a new hair iron and noticed that she had to lay it on the tile floor when brushing her hair, then bend over and pick it up again, and repeat this process. This allows her to lay the iron on the dresser top with no damage to the dresser. She loves it!</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this as well. I have it on my vanity and when I walk away I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair iron burning anything or sliding off.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a heat resistant mat, similar to what my stylist uses, and found this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it, it has proven to hold up well against the heat and has prevented me from burning/melting things around my apartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rolls up very nicely so that you can easily pack it when you travel.</li>
            <li> Nice mat for what it is, but the curl won&#x27;t come out of it, even after several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried weights, warm air, all of that. Stays curled.</li>
            <li> Works great with my Tigi Beach Waves tool, which doesn&#x27;t have any sort of holder to keep the hot tool off the counter. We have a really small bathroom and the mat can get nasty with water/makeup/god knows what bathroom gunk, but with regular rinsing with a bit of Dawn it&#x27;s been great!</li>
            <li> Protect you counter tops with this great heat mat.  Aborbs all heat from very hot tools&lt;br /&gt;like curling irons, flat irons, hair lowers etc.  Doesn&#x27;t move around on counter and just&lt;br /&gt;the right size to protect without having to put away all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Could not find in any stores.  Great price and worth every penny !&lt;br /&gt;COMPLETELY SATISFIED.......THANK YOU AMAZON !!</li>
            <li> Thick material, protects all surfaces. This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have no worries about my daughter melting anything when she uses her curling iron.  This mat is fabulous and easy for her to just wrap around the iron when she&#x27;s done using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many counters I have left ugly scars on. But with this product I will never again leave my mark behind. Perfect size and worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product was just what I was looking for and more.  I can heat up my flat iron and not worry about burning my bathroom counter top.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> My daughter has used this almost daily to prevent damage to our counters.</li>
            <li> I really love this on my long hair. It literally takes me about 5 minutes and it does a fantastic job. I like the fact that the company that makes this offers a 1 year warranty. YOu just have to register it. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Item is too small&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not using it and I added it to garage sale item box.&lt;br /&gt;Very sorry I wasted my money</li>
            <li> Simple item that works well and does what it is supposed to do, which would be protecting my bathroom counter. It is fairly big so the 1-inch flat iron fits very well.</li>
            <li> I have a very HOT iron that actually did scorch/burn a spot in my counter top after I forgot and left it on for the entire day! I was lucky to have a home to go into, so after that incident, knowing my memory, I wanted something to safeguard me from having that happen again. This silicone heat mat does just that job. I appreciate it!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and it was well received. She said it worked very well for her. Travels easily too.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s curling iron and straightener were creating melting spots.  This new mat does its job and keeps burning and melting from happening.</li>
            <li> This heat mat does just what it tell you it does. Easy to clean. Very sturdy. Overall a Great Product.</li>
            <li> After my daughter burned my counter. I bought this. It works great and is bigger then the iron, in case it moves around.</li>
            <li> Was a little smaller than I thought it would be but it does what it says and no burn marks on the counter from the flat iron!</li>
