            <li>Smells so good</li>
            <li>good as a starter...</li>
            <li>The scents are truly superior.</li>
            <li>This was a great choice for an assortment to find the scents I like better.</li>

            <li>Love all the scents!</li>
            <li>Thank you for the amazing choice in you choice of fragrance.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for samplers because i haven&#x27;t found anything i have liked.  </li>
            <li>This brand of incense is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Ok, my advise... DONT BUY THESE..</li>
            <li>I found this after I burned and enjoyed the musk scent and a couple of the others (pine, maybe?).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe you&#x27;ll get a good, fresh pack, but I&#x27;m not taking the chance again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cute with these mini sticks burning in it.</li>
            <li>I like and still use these incense many months after receiving.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>sampler packs and these short sticks scent the room the perfect amount.  </li>
            <li>I guess they do not make the matches any more.</li>
            <li>I love, love these....</li>
            <li>the plus side, the incense is so good that you do not need a whole stick to fill a 20x20 room with fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have had all of these scents before from other brands nothing has ever smelled as perfect as they do from this Auroshikha line.</li>
            <li>I loved to burn incense and my preference is more along the natural cone wood incense...</li>
            <li>First off, I liked the musk scent.</li>
            <li>Lemongrass, jasmine and rose are my favorite so far!</li>
            <li>ThIs is the best incense I&#x27;ve found; it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm and scents are faithful to standard fragrances; nice burn, low ash.</li>
            <li>I just wish I bought a full sized batch of incense.</li>
            <li>there bold pure strong scent without being over powering.</li>
            <li>, the only one i like was the rose.</li>
            <li>The other scents are good as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this variety pack because I have a hard time finding my favorite scent on its own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are perfect for me, and I prefer these rather than buying long sticks which I extinguish half-way down anyway, or having to stay with one incense scent packet for ages until it&#x27;s used up.</li>
            <li>this is my first time buying incense</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t really like the mayority</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t take up much space at</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like burning a whole stick.</li>
            <li>but the smells are very feint and while burning, it burned my nose and</li>
            <li>I wont purchase it as much as I would like to.</li>
            <li>and I get annoyed with it, rather than feeling that it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
            <li>Some incenses make me cough or give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up this sampler long ago in Whole Foods because every once in awhile, I do like to use incense, especially if we accidentally burn something on the stove, or just want an exotic scent in the home.</li>
            <li>I opened them and found that many of the little packets were moldy.</li>
            <li>The scents themselves are just fine, but I thought the sticks would be larger so you have to burn at least two of them (or more).</li>
            <li>They are not the normal sized incense sticks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a good 15 minutes to get all of the little mini-packs off of the cardboard backing they were glue-gunned to and then to detach the packs from each other with out breaking them all or shredding the labels.</li>
            <li>and they come in very small plastic packages (the sticks for each scent come in their own tiny package</li>
            <li>The only good thing is some of the sticks smell good, but they are so small and hard to open and just a basic waste.</li>
            <li>When these arrived I was very surprised to find that the sticks were so very short!  </li>
            <li>It will definitely be in the rotation-give it a try it is far above the others.</li>
            <li>They burn just long enough to clear the air  or scent the air.</li>

            <li> I really enjoyed the incense but was surprised at how small each piece was....about 3 inches and only 3 per fragrance....which made it seem rather expensive for what I got......</li>
            <li> Is easy to use and clears the air of stale orders.  </li>
            <li> and they are only 1.5&amp;#34; long!!  </li>
            <li> I would have spent my entire refund...</li>
            <li> Incense smoke burning too long bothers my lungs</li>
            <li> The sticks are extremely short which is to be expected from a sampler pack</li>
            <li> This was different than expected.  </li>
            <li> use these in a little tiny Japanese incense holder...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re only a few inches long</li>
            <li> The descriptions on the website were a bit confusing to me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really crazy about these small incense sticks, therefore would not have ordered them.</li>
            <li> I just wish they were a little larger.</li>
            <li> There is a wide variety and some I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> That being said between the cost and the fact that they a mini sticks less than half the length of your regular incense sticks</li>
            <li> I thought one moldy pack might be a fluke, but it turned out that at least a third of the sticks in the set had mold growing on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had this little pack for years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were hard to peel out of the box (I remember that after reading one user&#x27;s post) and some of my little packets are torn.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re difficult to open.</li>
            <li> They are small coming in a package of 4 incense each.</li>
            <li> and I burn a lot of other incense for reviews and this is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> my poor judgment be your reason NOT to buy this item..</li>
            <li> &#x27;s the bad part...</li>
            <li> I was very very disappointed because I thought I was getting a deal.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I really enjoyed the incense but was surprised at how small each piece was....about 3 inches and only 3 per fragrance....which made it seem rather expensive for what I got......</li>

            <li> Arrived today was very pleased great packing job Thank You!!</li>
            <li> this is my first time buying incense and i don&#x27;t really like the mayority, the only one i like was the rose.</li>
            <li> This brand of incense is my favorite. However, when I purchased these I ordered two packs not realizing they are MINI STICKS. They are not the normal sized incense sticks. I was very very disappointed because I thought I was getting a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the incense is so good that you do not need a whole stick to fill a 20x20 room with fragrance. I just wish I bought a full sized batch of incense.</li>
            <li> Ok, my advise... DONT BUY THESE..&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for samplers because i haven&#x27;t found anything i have liked.  I didn&#x27;t realize that there were only 3 sticks in each package and they are only 1.5&amp;#34; long!!  Wtf..  especially for $9.00!!&lt;br /&gt;Let my poor judgment be your reason NOT to buy this item..&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like buying a box of Whitmans sampler of assorted premium chocolates only to find 3 crumbs in each pod...&lt;br /&gt;And it would cost $30...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely discusted...  I would have returned it, but by the time I paid for postage AND return postage, my time, gas etc... I would have spent my entire refund...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;go buy something else.</li>
            <li> First off, I liked the musk scent. So that&#x27;s the good part.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the bad part...&lt;br /&gt;It took a good 15 minutes to get all of the little mini-packs off of the cardboard backing they were glue-gunned to and then to detach the packs from each other with out breaking them all or shredding the labels. That sucked.&lt;br /&gt;Then I opened them and found that many of the little packets were moldy. I found this after I burned and enjoyed the musk scent and a couple of the others (pine, maybe?). I thought one moldy pack might be a fluke, but it turned out that at least a third of the sticks in the set had mold growing on them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m throwing out my set and the set I bought for my daughter before she has a chance to open it.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you&#x27;ll get a good, fresh pack, but I&#x27;m not taking the chance again.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve uploaded a photo so you can see if you look in the product image gallery.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re not the biggest incense users. So I&#x27;ve had this little pack for years. Incense smoke burning too long bothers my lungs and I get annoyed with it, rather than feeling that it&#x27;s pleasant. Some incenses make me cough or give me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up this sampler long ago in Whole Foods because every once in awhile, I do like to use incense, especially if we accidentally burn something on the stove, or just want an exotic scent in the home. So I figured I&#x27;d give the samplers a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were hard to peel out of the box (I remember that after reading one user&#x27;s post) and some of my little packets are torn. I put them in a container with my incense tin. They don&#x27;t take up much space at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these in a little tiny Japanese incense holder...it&#x27;s so cute with these mini sticks burning in it. The scents are not overpowering, they don&#x27;t make me cough or sneeze, nor do they give me a headache. They burn just long enough to clear the air  or scent the air. The incense does linger for some time afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect for me, and I prefer these rather than buying long sticks which I extinguish half-way down anyway, or having to stay with one incense scent packet for ages until it&#x27;s used up. I&#x27;ve put these on my list to order with an upcoming Amazon order.</li>
            <li> ThIs is the best incense I&#x27;ve found; it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm and scents are faithful to standard fragrances; nice burn, low ash.</li>
            <li> I like and still use these incense many months after receiving. There is a wide variety and some I don&#x27;t like but I do know which I&#x27;d order in larger quantities now!</li>
            <li> The only good thing is some of the sticks smell good, but they are so small and hard to open and just a basic waste.</li>
            <li> I like this incense company. This was a great choice for an assortment to find the scents I like better. Lemongrass, jasmine and rose are my favorite so far!</li>
            <li> Love these incense! They are small coming in a package of 4 incense each. They fragrance of all are very good. We use them in the bathrooms instead of sprays.</li>
            <li> Being unfamiliar with incense, this was the perfect kit to start off with. I would recommend and I would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Great smells, quality sticks.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and it is the perfect size! I don&#x27;t like burning a whole stick.</li>
            <li> I love sampler packs and these short sticks scent the room the perfect amount.  great buy!</li>
            <li> These incense are wonderful.  I just wish they were a little larger. Thank you for the amazing choice in you choice of fragrance. I will be a repeat buyer. Thank you</li>
            <li> I thought that I was getting the book matches that you can carry in your purse as well. I guess they do not make the matches any more.</li>
            <li> I thought I had ordered the matchbook incense. The descriptions on the website were a bit confusing to me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really crazy about these small incense sticks, therefore would not have ordered them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re mini samples...4 or 5 in each packet...good as a starter...</li>
            <li> If you read the description you would know that these are &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; sticks.  Love this company!  Love all the scents!</li>
            <li> The sticks are extremely short which is to be expected from a sampler pack but the smells are very feint and while burning, it burned my nose and yes even when I was in another room and I burn a lot of other incense for reviews and this is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> This was different than expected.  Is easy to use and clears the air of stale orders.  This will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I loved to burn incense and my preference is more along the natural cone wood incense...but for variety I get the sample packs like this one. I love, love these....there bold pure strong scent without being over powering. I have had all of these scents before from other brands nothing has ever smelled as perfect as they do from this Auroshikha line. The scents are truly superior. That being said between the cost and the fact that they a mini sticks less than half the length of your regular incense sticks I wont purchase it as much as I would like to. It will definitely be in the rotation-give it a try it is far above the others.</li>
            <li> I bought this variety pack because I have a hard time finding my favorite scent on its own.  I adore the Aurishikha African Violet incense, but can only find it in variety packs.  The other scents are good as well.</li>
