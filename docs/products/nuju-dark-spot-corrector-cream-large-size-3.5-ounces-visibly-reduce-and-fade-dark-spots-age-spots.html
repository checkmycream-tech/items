            <li>honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to work quite as well as it has.</li>
            <li>had kind of exploded in the cap.</li>
            <li>While this has hydroquinone in it, it does not have that smell which is very strong and can burn my eyes.</li>
            <li>The Vernal Spot Corrector has been the most effective treatment of all.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this serum, it did a great job lightening my acne scars.</li>
            <li>I bought a large bottle and paid $145 for it here at Amazon after reading all the great reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li>I been using this product for two months, I love how it feels</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s reducing the intensity of my acne scars.</li>
            <li>This is truly &amp;#34; magic in a bottle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have never felt better about my skin</li>
            <li>I feel like the more products put on my skin</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>Then I will be able to write a more in-depth review.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it even more.</li>
            <li>I have had sun-spots on my face for many years, and like most people i suffered from acne as a child.</li>
            <li>Considering I bought this just for the spots, I am very impressed with the overall effect on my skin</li>
            <li>This product has done everything it advertised, and so much more.</li>
            <li>and I can sincerely say I&#x27;m seeing some improvement on my face .</li>
            <li>and then each day they faded more and more</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but a lot better.</li>
            <li>it sits on my skin the more</li>
            <li>I have used this for more than 2 months.</li>
            <li>The texture is nice and rich.</li>
            <li>There is no remaining redness from old scars; my skin tone is beautifully even and radiant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely excited and pleased with the results</li>
            <li>However, due to the size and quality I feel like this was an awesome deal!</li>
            <li>I sincerely believe that people are paid to write positive reviews, since this product is in no way as effective as these reviewers wrote, That said, here&#x27;s my true review.</li>
            <li>Excellent results in less than two months.  </li>
            <li>What I love most about this bottle is it&#x27;s large size.</li>
            <li>The bottle size is HUGE which is something that I am not used to when it comes to skincare products.</li>
            <li>and I rarely break out any more.</li>
            <li>I have only used this corrector for about a month and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and I am planning to order a 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a great improvement on the hyperpigmentation spots on my cheeks early on, like in the first 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product 4 stars because I thought it was one of the best products I have used  to eliminate my dark spots, I have tried dozens and rarely do I find one that works.</li>
            <li>Am extremely pleased to have purchase a product that does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>this product has had a significant impact in lightening these marks.</li>
            <li>The cream is rich and moisturizing, but not at all oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this spot corrector thus far.</li>
            <li>You need to stick with it - it took about three to four weeks to see a significant difference.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, product was in great condition, it seems like it is working after only one use</li>
            <li>Anyways, I really thought this could work for me because of all the good reviews, but I have given it more than enough time to do its wonders and nothing.</li>
            <li>some new.&lt;br /&gt;This product has worked quicker than I anticipated and that is not a bad thing!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>and I have ran across Nuju with great reviews from other users</li>
            <li>It did take about 3 months of daily use before I saw much improvement but with continued use my skin looks great</li>
            <li>My overall skin looks better and is more evened out.</li>
            <li>I have used cheap creams that I bought at beauty supply stores with far better results.</li>
            <li>Then I found the Nuju dark spot corrector which works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even able to use it on my extremely sensitive skin with no issues!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do!</li>
            <li>This product has actually helped me to gain better confidence in myself by improving my skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing I am on my third bottle</li>
            <li>It worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about how this smell</li>
            <li>That already made me feel like it was worth the price</li>
            <li>but so far I love the cream and will update when I see results.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase and will be buying other Nuju products in the future.</li>
            <li>I feel that it does what it is intended to do and in a pretty quick time frame.</li>
            <li>I attempted to reapply the pump on the product, but it will not stay on and pops right off after use.</li>
            <li>Came across this skincare line while browsing for a good dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and it does a good job and my acne scars are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m using Retinol-A for my red spots and it seems to be working, plus MUCH more cheaper, 25 bucks compared to 145.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>the more likely I will get acne.  </li>
            <li>I use this product in the morning and when I first get home from work</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I was seeing so many adverts for this stuff in online that I finally decided to buy a bottle.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day at first and noticed a difference in a week.</li>
            <li>Within the first couple of weeks, you see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I was seeing so many adverts for this stuff in online that I finally decided to buy a bottle.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, it even improved my overall complexion!</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to finishing the bottle and ordering more products from Nuju in the future!!!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I tried this brand.</li>
            <li>I had super high hopes that it would make my superficial acne scars fade.</li>
            <li>I had even considered getting some kind of procedure to get rid of them (to give you an idea of how bad it was) and this product is just so great</li>
            <li>What surprised me the most is that it was getting rid of the old spots that had been there for years.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cream about a month ago based on the amount of positive feedback I read.</li>
            <li>To this day, I am still looking for an effective dark spot corrector.  </li>
            <li>Day after day, week after week, month after month, I kept waiting for results but there were none even after I&#x27;ve finished what was in the large bottle.  </li>
            <li>After just one day it&#x27;s like I have new skin - my face feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I have not noticed any real difference in my scars.</li>
            <li>and I was very worried about the break out</li>
            <li>It really works with vitamin C spray as well.</li>
            <li>This did nothing for my  acne scars and made my face really shiny /oily.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>But I have really oily skin and during the summer, a lotion is not an option.</li>
            <li>This cream is also very hydrating on the skin.</li>
            <li>This cream arrived very promptly and was very well packed.  </li>
            <li>It does not do much for freckles--and it doesn&#x27;t claim to.</li>
            <li>I did, however, notice an improvement in the texture of my skin as it was much softer and even.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of using the product as directed, I noticed that the acne scars on my face were much lighter than before</li>
            <li>This cream is also very hydrating.</li>
            <li>It looks promising would continue with this product.</li>
            <li>I am very thorough when cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li>I am still using it since I do think it doing something for my hyperpigmentation, but wish the pump was not broken.</li>
            <li>There are 3 that I am really paying attention to.  </li>
            <li>The results that this product have given me are more than I expected!</li>
            <li>I clean my face with a great facial cleanser then use a facial brush when my face is completely dry and use a derma roller so my face is ready for whatever facial treatments, serums and moisturizers I may apply after cleansing.</li>
            <li>one pump is good enough, I&#x27;ll use one a half if I feel like I need it.</li>
            <li>it will lighten up my dark areas, so for that I am ok with it.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;m finding that blemishes are leaving permanent scars on my skin-</li>
            <li>With such great results on my face, I decided to try applying it to the dark spots on my chest and back</li>
            <li>While I LOVE this product for moisturizing, so far that dark spots haven&#x27;t faded that much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Update review: after trying more than 2 months there is not even a little bit difference.</li>
            <li>I was rather reluctant to order this spot corrector mainly because I have VERY sensitive skin, prone to breakouts and dryness and not to mention the price.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use as new spots form.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without it anymore.</li>
            <li>I had received a huge scratch on my thigh recently that I wanted to have removed as quickly as possible.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have high hopes for this cream as it is doing it&#x27;s job so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for probably about 6-8 weeks now...saw a big difference in the first 2 weeks .It</li>
            <li>now...saw a big difference in the first 2weeks.</li>
            <li>After using it, my spots and even the acne marks have almost completely vanished!</li>
            <li>I also had some markings from adult acne, and those spots are all gone, too!</li>
            <li>and I am in complete awe!</li>
            <li>Since using this Nuju spot corrector, I have noticed that my spots both old and new have begun to fade.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in this cream  are the same used in many other cheap creams for far less money.</li>
            <li>But after checking out several of the positive reviews, I thought that I would give it chance.</li>
            <li>Can recommend so far.  </li>
            <li>So far there is no difference at all.</li>
            <li>Feeling smooth and d sunburn above my chin is fading on such a short time .</li>
            <li>My dark spots that I had around my cheek bones have faded tremendously.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that will help your dark spots this is certainly worth</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what I expected / wanted.</li>
            <li>I purchased it hoping that it would live up to the description, and it definitely did!</li>
            <li>My dark spots and uneven skin tone are fading more each day I use this.</li>
            <li>FORWARD- after using Nuju spot spot corrector product RELIGIOUSLY for 2 months, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The only issue so far I have with this it when it arrived the product</li>
            <li>and I have tried other products, but this really lightened it up.</li>
            <li>NOT A SINGLE CHANGE.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other expensive products and dermatologists products to remove age spots and this is the first product that worked.</li>
            <li>This has done absolutely nothing to fade dark spots and used as a moisturizer made me break out.</li>
            <li>so I continue my hunt for a dark spot corrector product that REALLY works.  </li>
            <li>I generally want only those spots to lighten up.</li>
            <li>Since am a Caribbean girl and the place is hot year round</li>
            <li>This is a thin lotion and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and I see a few less fine lines when using.  </li>
            <li>They are not deep, they are very superficial and I have some other red spots left by the acne.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Anyways, I really thought this could work for me because of all the good reviews, but I have given it more than enough time to do its wonders and nothing.</li>
            <li> some new.&lt;br /&gt;This product has worked quicker than I anticipated and that is not a bad thing!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> and I have ran across Nuju with great reviews from other users</li>
            <li> It did take about 3 months of daily use before I saw much improvement but with continued use my skin looks great</li>
            <li> My overall skin looks better and is more evened out.</li>
            <li> I have used cheap creams that I bought at beauty supply stores with far better results.</li>
            <li> Then I found the Nuju dark spot corrector which works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even able to use it on my extremely sensitive skin with no issues!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> This product has actually helped me to gain better confidence in myself by improving my skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing I am on my third bottle</li>
            <li> It worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about how this smell</li>
            <li> That already made me feel like it was worth the price</li>
            <li> but so far I love the cream and will update when I see results.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase and will be buying other Nuju products in the future.</li>
            <li> I feel that it does what it is intended to do and in a pretty quick time frame.</li>
            <li> I attempted to reapply the pump on the product, but it will not stay on and pops right off after use.</li>
            <li> Came across this skincare line while browsing for a good dark spot corrector.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and it does a good job and my acne scars are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m using Retinol-A for my red spots and it seems to be working, plus MUCH more cheaper, 25 bucks compared to 145.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> the more likely I will get acne.  </li>
            <li> I use this product in the morning and when I first get home from work</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I was seeing so many adverts for this stuff in online that I finally decided to buy a bottle.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day at first and noticed a difference in a week.</li>
            <li> Within the first couple of weeks, you see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I was seeing so many adverts for this stuff in online that I finally decided to buy a bottle.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, it even improved my overall complexion!</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to finishing the bottle and ordering more products from Nuju in the future!!!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried this brand.</li>
            <li> I had super high hopes that it would make my superficial acne scars fade.</li>
            <li> I had even considered getting some kind of procedure to get rid of them (to give you an idea of how bad it was) and this product is just so great</li>
            <li> What surprised me the most is that it was getting rid of the old spots that had been there for years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream about a month ago based on the amount of positive feedback I read.</li>
            <li> To this day, I am still looking for an effective dark spot corrector.  </li>
            <li> Day after day, week after week, month after month, I kept waiting for results but there were none even after I&#x27;ve finished what was in the large bottle.  </li>
            <li> After just one day it&#x27;s like I have new skin - my face feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and I have not noticed any real difference in my scars.</li>
            <li> and I was very worried about the break out</li>
            <li> It really works with vitamin C spray as well.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my  acne scars and made my face really shiny /oily.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> But I have really oily skin and during the summer, a lotion is not an option.</li>
            <li> This cream is also very hydrating on the skin.</li>
            <li> This cream arrived very promptly and was very well packed.  </li>
            <li> It does not do much for freckles--and it doesn&#x27;t claim to.</li>
            <li> I did, however, notice an improvement in the texture of my skin as it was much softer and even.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using the product as directed, I noticed that the acne scars on my face were much lighter than before</li>
            <li> This cream is also very hydrating.</li>
            <li> It looks promising would continue with this product.</li>
            <li> I am very thorough when cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li> I am still using it since I do think it doing something for my hyperpigmentation, but wish the pump was not broken.</li>
            <li> There are 3 that I am really paying attention to.  </li>
            <li> The results that this product have given me are more than I expected!</li>
            <li> I clean my face with a great facial cleanser then use a facial brush when my face is completely dry and use a derma roller so my face is ready for whatever facial treatments, serums and moisturizers I may apply after cleansing.</li>
            <li> one pump is good enough, I&#x27;ll use one a half if I feel like I need it.</li>
            <li> it will lighten up my dark areas, so for that I am ok with it.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;m finding that blemishes are leaving permanent scars on my skin-</li>
            <li> With such great results on my face, I decided to try applying it to the dark spots on my chest and back</li>
            <li> While I LOVE this product for moisturizing, so far that dark spots haven&#x27;t faded that much.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Update review: after trying more than 2 months there is not even a little bit difference.</li>
            <li> I was rather reluctant to order this spot corrector mainly because I have VERY sensitive skin, prone to breakouts and dryness and not to mention the price.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use as new spots form.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without it anymore.</li>
            <li> I had received a huge scratch on my thigh recently that I wanted to have removed as quickly as possible.  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have high hopes for this cream as it is doing it&#x27;s job so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for probably about 6-8 weeks now...saw a big difference in the first 2 weeks .It</li>
            <li> now...saw a big difference in the first 2weeks.</li>
            <li> After using it, my spots and even the acne marks have almost completely vanished!</li>
            <li> I also had some markings from adult acne, and those spots are all gone, too!</li>
            <li> and I am in complete awe!</li>
            <li> Since using this Nuju spot corrector, I have noticed that my spots both old and new have begun to fade.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this cream  are the same used in many other cheap creams for far less money.</li>
            <li> But after checking out several of the positive reviews, I thought that I would give it chance.</li>
            <li> Can recommend so far.  </li>
            <li> So far there is no difference at all.</li>
            <li> Feeling smooth and d sunburn above my chin is fading on such a short time .</li>
            <li> My dark spots that I had around my cheek bones have faded tremendously.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that will help your dark spots this is certainly worth</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I expected / wanted.</li>
            <li> I purchased it hoping that it would live up to the description, and it definitely did!</li>
            <li> My dark spots and uneven skin tone are fading more each day I use this.</li>
            <li> FORWARD- after using Nuju spot spot corrector product RELIGIOUSLY for 2 months, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The only issue so far I have with this it when it arrived the product</li>
            <li> and I have tried other products, but this really lightened it up.</li>
            <li> NOT A SINGLE CHANGE.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other expensive products and dermatologists products to remove age spots and this is the first product that worked.</li>
            <li> This has done absolutely nothing to fade dark spots and used as a moisturizer made me break out.</li>
            <li> so I continue my hunt for a dark spot corrector product that REALLY works.  </li>
            <li> I generally want only those spots to lighten up.</li>
            <li> Since am a Caribbean girl and the place is hot year round</li>
            <li> This is a thin lotion and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and I see a few less fine lines when using.  </li>
            <li> They are not deep, they are very superficial and I have some other red spots left by the acne.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone that has pesky dark spots they need to get rid of!</li>
            <li> I have a moderate amount of dark spots, mostly old,</li>
            <li> The only one that really worked for me in the past was a laser treatment.  </li>
            <li> so I feel this bottle is going to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> It feels very soft and less dry.  </li>
            <li> If you are embarrassed by old scars don&#x27;t be dissuaded by the price of this product- a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that it is rather pricey, but in my case I have only limited areas that need treatment so the bottle is going to last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have been amazed with my results and will continue to use it for as long as needed.</li>
            <li> I feel sad when I see different between the first one and and second , it was cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old white caucasian who has been using this cream two times daily for the past 2 months and a half</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other products claiming to help fade dark spots but the other products only resulted in severely red, irritated, burning skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brighteners and dark spot corrector and none come even close to performing like this product, It really does even skin tone, and without drying skin out.</li>
            <li> then but I have not had a single one since I have used this cream.</li>
            <li> Tiny dark spots around my face disappeared in a week or so.</li>
            <li> The dark spots on my cheeks was always a big concern.</li>
            <li> My husband is using it for almost a month and his dark sports looks same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for about 4 weeks so still hopeful but have also added Retin A (purchased n Mexico) to see if I can get those dark spots to fade.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about a week, but My biggest dark spot mid forehead area is so much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> the freckles became less obvious.</li>
            <li> I have purchased numerous spot corrector in the past with hopes to see some noticeable results in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> it keep my skin soft and moist through out the day and my sun spots slowly faded away not completely</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time out in the sun and noticed that I was starting to get little spots.</li>
            <li> When I apply this cream to my face it feels really oily, but it will not make your acne worse</li>
            <li> Spots are getting a bit lighter but it&#x27;s taking some time which I expected.  </li>
            <li> Saw minimal results</li>
            <li> I have only been using the cream for a few days, twice a day, and already feel my skin&#x27;s improvement.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Overall, my skin was incredibly uneven and in no way radiant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was such a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time in the sun</li>
            <li> Over time, the work that it does on extreme discoloration has lessened and I have moved on to another product for that.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> not sure what it does but from my experience, it&#x27;s a waste of good money on a product that is worthless.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s doing nothing to my dark spot</li>
            <li> I do have some dark spots on the side of my face and will continue to use this diligently to see if this cream does fade the spots.  </li>
            <li> this rate all of my dark spots should be gone before my daughters&#x27; wedding in January.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a solution to my dark spots and acne scars.</li>
            <li> and I can say all my dark spots are basically gone</li>
            <li> so I have not had time to test for the dark spot correcting properties</li>
            <li> I only use it once a day at night because it kinda makes my makeup a bit wonky when I use this under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Did not fade the dark sports at all.</li>
            <li> Well it works, but I got one problem with this thing: after using it for a week, my neck looks kinda dark now.</li>
            <li> The dark spots that I had on my cheek bones are almost nonexistent and I am not even close to being half way through with this bottle.</li>
            <li> Only a very small amount is needed</li>
            <li> My skin is less oily now</li>
            <li> I ill continue to use it and come back to review the product later.    </li>
            <li> Pores also are less noticeable from using this product.</li>
            <li> No significant change in my dark spots seen yet.</li>
            <li> and I pretty much hate the sun, so not following instructions</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money, I&#x27;ve used half bottle</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get rid of some dark spots I have on my forehead, cheekbones and nose, and this product worked wonders!</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad dark spots from acne that I had trouble concealing even with makeup.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I hated them I had tried so many products.</li>
            <li> I used this spot corrector twice a day, everyday for a month</li>
            <li> It sits on the skin and does not easily absorb, but in my mind it makes me feel the longer</li>
            <li> I wasted 150 bucks!</li>
            <li> I usually get breakouts every now and</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this product the spots are practically gone!</li>
            <li> I have use that in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid-30&#x27;s who suffered from horrible acne as a young teen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick, and doesn&#x27;t just evaporate.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this didn&#x27;t do anything to lighten my acne scars or dark spots.</li>
            <li> I had really bad acne when I was younger</li>
            <li> My face was ALWAYS red and bumpy and my acne scars were bad.</li>
            <li> Totally waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> i am not happy with this product and the price tag.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is extremely thin and runny.</li>
            <li> My spots are lighter &amp; don&#x27;t get worse when I go tanning</li>
            <li> There should be a penalty for leaving false reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been so amazed with the results, and the acne scars began fading in mere weeks of my using it..</li>
            <li> For $5.00, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> They are too expensive for me</li>
            <li> It irritated my face so bad, caused redness and burning feeling for almost a week with just one application.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed on this product.</li>
            <li> I did not want to leave any reviews until I was finished with the three months treatment but again, I am really disappointed on this product and its price, and so, I wanted to share the fact that it may not work for all skin types.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I hate the sun spots on my face</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The spot is not fading yet let see in a month.</li>
            <li> I used it for a month and notice no difference! i am not happy with this product and the price tag. I wasted 150 bucks!</li>
            <li> I been using this product for two months, I love how it feels and I love that it&#x27;s reducing the intensity of my acne scars. I&#x27;m on my second bottle now. I&#x27;ve tried a few other brighteners and dark spot corrector and none come even close to performing like this product, It really does even skin tone, and without drying skin out. It also clears up my skin, I get fewer breakouts when I use it.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed on this product. I had super high hopes that it would make my superficial acne scars fade. They are not deep, they are very superficial and I have some other red spots left by the acne. I&#x27;m a 23 year old white caucasian who has been using this cream two times daily for the past 2 months and a half and I have not noticed any real difference in my scars. They are still there and so are the red spots and I pretty much hate the sun, so not following instructions is not the problem. When I apply this cream to my face it feels really oily, but it will not make your acne worse, that&#x27;s a good thing. Anyways, I really thought this could work for me because of all the good reviews, but I have given it more than enough time to do its wonders and nothing. Now I&#x27;m using Retinol-A for my red spots and it seems to be working, plus MUCH more cheaper, 25 bucks compared to 145. I did not want to leave any reviews until I was finished with the three months treatment but again, I am really disappointed on this product and its price, and so, I wanted to share the fact that it may not work for all skin types. It didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews are fake. This has done absolutely nothing to fade dark spots and used as a moisturizer made me break out. The lotion itself is extremely thin and runny.</li>
            <li> I started using NuJu on and off during which I had a massive breakout in my skin. I have a very sensitive skin and I was very worried about the break out but I noticed after just one week that my skin became brighter the freckles became less obvious. I took photos before and after and I was very impressed. This is truly &amp;#34; magic in a bottle&amp;#34;. Use it but drink lots of water and wash well before and after. I use it at night and I put sun block in the morning. It really works with vitamin C spray as well. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month now and it has done wonders for my oily, acne prone skin! I had pretty bad dark spots from acne that I had trouble concealing even with makeup. After trying every product under the sun I found this one. It did take about 3 months of daily use before I saw much improvement but with continued use my skin looks great and I don&#x27;t think I will ever stop using it. My skin is less oily now and I rarely break out any more. I have never felt better about my skin and I have this product to thank for it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and I already see my facial spots lightening. I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> It irritated my face so bad, caused redness and burning feeling for almost a week with just one application. Had to return it.</li>
            <li> Excellent results in less than two months.  I had a quarter size sun spot on my cheek and I have tried other products, but this really lightened it up.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my  acne scars and made my face really shiny /oily. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> To be honest and truthful this product is the best ever. Does exactly what it says. I got results in two days no lie. I bought it for myself and bought a second one for a friend. It worth every penny. Am extremely pleased to have purchase a product that does exactly what it says. Since am a Caribbean girl and the place is hot year round I use sun screen as recommended. It&#x27;s super!!!</li>
            <li> Did nothing to the age spot after being used for three months.</li>
            <li> Light weight smells very pleasant just be patient it works evenly over time : great customer service as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks now and I can honestly say that my imperfections and blemishes are fading away as the days go. My overall skin looks better and is more evened out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this didn&#x27;t do anything to lighten my acne scars or dark spots. I used it religiously for about a month too.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, product was in great condition, it seems like it is working after only one use, i can&#x27;t wait to keep using it. I was offered this at a discount so i am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream every night for 6 weeks and I have noticed a great improvement on the hyperpigmentation spots on my cheeks early on, like in the first 3 weeks.  The ones on my forehead have been reduced but not as dramatically as the ones on the cheeks. I usually get breakouts every now and then but I have not had a single one since I have used this cream. The texture of my skin has also improved a lot. I will definitely keep on using this and buy another bottle when it&#x27;s finished. It&#x27;s quite sticky so I decided not to use it during the day,</li>
            <li> Not crazy about how this smell but it makes my skin feel amazing.  Spots are getting a bit lighter but it&#x27;s taking some time which I expected.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> did not work well for me. Saw minimal results</li>
            <li> I like this product. I feel that it does what it is intended to do and in a pretty quick time frame. The texture is nice and rich. I am very happy with this purchase and will be buying other Nuju products in the future.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money, I&#x27;ve used half bottle and it&#x27;s doing nothing to my dark spot</li>
            <li> I received this item at a reduced price in return for my review but my review is my honest opinion. I gave this product 4 stars because I thought it was one of the best products I have used  to eliminate my dark spots, I have tried dozens and rarely do I find one that works. I would have given this 5 stars if it could of replaced my moisturizer.  This product provided visible results within just a week. I just wish this product could also work as a moisturizer. I used it by itself twice a day and after about 4 days it was obvious that I was not using a moisturizer. I prefer to have one product that does it all instead of having to use multiple products. I feel like the more products put on my skin the more likely I will get acne.  I use this product in the morning and when I first get home from work and then I use my nightly moisturizer before I go to bed. What I love most about this bottle is it&#x27;s large size. Only a very small amount is needed so I feel this bottle is going to last me a long time. My dark spots and uneven skin tone are fading more each day I use this. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this serum, it did a great job lightening my acne scars. Over time, the work that it does on extreme discoloration has lessened and I have moved on to another product for that. But I have really oily skin and during the summer, a lotion is not an option. This serum provides moisture. It also helps to keep my complexion brighter when I&#x27;ve overdone it on the beach. I love this stuff and I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I was rather reluctant to order this spot corrector mainly because I have VERY sensitive skin, prone to breakouts and dryness and not to mention the price. I&#x27;ve tried several other products claiming to help fade dark spots but the other products only resulted in severely red, irritated, burning skin. But after checking out several of the positive reviews, I thought that I would give it chance. I&#x27;ve only been using the product on my face for several days and I&#x27;m already beginning to see the dark/red spots from acne scars and sun spots beginning to diminish!! I can&#x27;t believe it!! Plus, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all! With such great results on my face, I decided to try applying it to the dark spots on my chest and back and I&#x27;ve also started to see great results on both of these areas!!! I&#x27;m extremely excited and pleased with the results already!!I I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This serum is a miracle worker! After just one day it&#x27;s like I have new skin - my face feels so soft and smooth. Tiny dark spots around my face disappeared in a week or so. And heaven help me if I run out - within a week I can tell I&#x27;m not using it anymore. This is a must-have for me!</li>
            <li> Came across this skincare line while browsing for a good dark spot corrector. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;m finding that blemishes are leaving permanent scars on my skin- this product has had a significant impact in lightening these marks. The cream is rich and moisturizing, but not at all oily. I have been so amazed with the results, and the acne scars began fading in mere weeks of my using it.. If you&#x27;re looking for something that will help your dark spots this is certainly worth trying- I have been amazed with my results and will continue to use it for as long as needed.</li>
            <li> I was seeing so many adverts for this stuff in online that I finally decided to buy a bottle. I&#x27;ve been using it for probably about 6-8 weeks now...saw a big difference in the first 2 weeks .It does diminish / lightens any dark/ sun spots. This cream is also very hydrating on the skin. I will continue to use as new spots form. I&#x27;m very pleased with this spot corrector thus far.</li>
            <li> This cream arrived very promptly and was very well packed.  Beautiful jar, and It also smells great.  I have only been using the cream for a few days, twice a day, and already feel my skin&#x27;s improvement.  It feels very soft and less dry.  I do have some dark spots on the side of my face and will continue to use this diligently to see if this cream does fade the spots.  Then I will be able to write a more in-depth review.  I have high hopes for this cream as it is doing it&#x27;s job so far.  Can recommend so far.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Not seeing any inprovement</li>
            <li> This product does work, however, it also makes me break-out (which I never do otherwise).</li>
            <li> Horrible product. Never buy it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews and I&#x27;m deeply suspicious. I bought this corrector cream believing it would lighten my age spots and some freckles. Used it twice a day as directed. Wear sun screen always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After four weeks, nothing. After six weeks, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what it does but from my experience, it&#x27;s a waste of good money on a product that is worthless.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have a moderate amount of dark spots, mostly old, some new.&lt;br /&gt;This product has worked quicker than I anticipated and that is not a bad thing!&lt;br /&gt;At this rate all of my dark spots should be gone before my daughters&#x27; wedding in January.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day at first and noticed a difference in a week. I now use it just once a day and see continued improvement.  My skin is softer and it does a good job and my acne scars are much less noticeable. I&#x27;m even able to use it on my extremely sensitive skin with no issues! I mix it with my dramatically different moisturizer and it makes it last longer.It does not do much for freckles--and it doesn&#x27;t claim to. I agree with other reviewers that it is rather pricey, but in my case I have only limited areas that need treatment so the bottle is going to last quite a while.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do! I had really bad acne when I was younger and I was looking for a solution to my dark spots and acne scars. Within the first couple of weeks, you see a noticeable difference. I did, however, notice an improvement in the texture of my skin as it was much softer and even. After 3 weeks of using the product as directed, I noticed that the acne scars on my face were much lighter than before and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I was seeing so many adverts for this stuff in online that I finally decided to buy a bottle. I&#x27;ve been using it for probably about 6-8weeks now...saw a big difference in the first 2weeks. This cream is also very hydrating.</li>
            <li> Since using this Nuju spot corrector, I have noticed that my spots both old and new have begun to fade. I have only used this corrector for about a month and am happy with the results. What surprised me the most is that it was getting rid of the old spots that had been there for years. Great product!!! I will be reordering!!</li>
            <li> My spots are lighter &amp; don&#x27;t get worse when I go tanning but the summer will tell more!!</li>
            <li> This bottle’s size is unlike anything that I have ever seen before for a spot corrector. It’s ginormous! That already made me feel like it was worth the price but then I started using the product daily and I fell in love with it even more. The dark spots that I had on my cheek bones are almost nonexistent and I am not even close to being half way through with this bottle. I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> There should be a penalty for leaving false reviews. I sincerely believe that people are paid to write positive reviews, since this product is in no way as effective as these reviewers wrote, That said, here&#x27;s my true review. I purchased this cream about a month ago based on the amount of positive feedback I read. BIG mistake. A total waste of money. Been using this faithfully for about a month...NOT A SINGLE CHANGE. I had received a huge scratch on my thigh recently that I wanted to have removed as quickly as possible.  I have used cheap creams that I bought at beauty supply stores with far better results. This is way overpriced. The ingredients in this cream  are the same used in many other cheap creams for far less money. $145.00? I&#x27;m back to using Aatra. For $5.00, you can&#x27;t go wrong. Save your money!</li>
            <li> I have had sun-spots on my face for many years, and like most people i suffered from acne as a child. So recently I decided to try a product to either reduce or remove these skin imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting this product to work quite as well as it has. After using it, my spots and even the acne marks have almost completely vanished! What&#x27;s more, it even improved my overall complexion! Considering I bought this just for the spots, I am very impressed with the overall effect on my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the product you need for spot removal, truly impressive.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible! I purchased it hoping that it would live up to the description, and it definitely did! I was hoping to get rid of some dark spots I have on my forehead, cheekbones and nose, and this product worked wonders! I used it for two months, twice a day, and now the spots aren’t even noticeable! I also had some markings from adult acne, and those spots are all gone, too! This product has done everything it advertised, and so much more. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that has pesky dark spots they need to get rid of!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid-30&#x27;s who suffered from horrible acne as a young teen. I still suffer from stress related acne and had the scares to prove it. My face was ALWAYS red and bumpy and my acne scars were bad. Overall, my skin was incredibly uneven and in no way radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAST FORWARD- after using Nuju spot spot corrector product RELIGIOUSLY for 2 months, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. There is no remaining redness from old scars; my skin tone is beautifully even and radiant. I look in the mirror and am amazed that my skin looks the way it does. If you are embarrassed by old scars don&#x27;t be dissuaded by the price of this product- a little goes a long way with this product. After doing some research I found out this is the biggest spot treatment bottle on the market today!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of things including microdermabrasion and peels. The Vernal Spot Corrector has been the most effective treatment of all. You need to stick with it - it took about three to four weeks to see a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of sun spots on my face for years and I hated them I had tried so many products. Then I found the Nuju dark spot corrector which works great. My daughter gave me this Nuju one for my birthday and oh my goodness! I have never looked back! It&#x27;s amazing I am on my third bottle and I can say all my dark spots are basically gone and I had a lot of them. I had even considered getting some kind of procedure to get rid of them (to give you an idea of how bad it was) and this product is just so great I cannot live without it anymore.</li>
            <li> Several reviews on amazon mentioned they noticed difference within two weeks. I have been using this product twice a day for the past two weeks. So far there is no difference at all. A bit disappointed. I ill continue to use it and come back to review the product later.    Update review: after trying more than 2 months there is not even a little bit difference. Totally waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Hi  I feel sad when I see different between the first one and and second , it was cream but the second it is liquid</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 2days and I can sincerely say I&#x27;m seeing some improvement on my face . Feeling smooth and d sunburn above my chin is fading on such a short time . It looks promising would continue with this product.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I expected / wanted. I spend a lot of time out in the sun and noticed that I was starting to get little spots. After a few weeks of using this product the spots are practically gone!</li>
            <li> I used to have lots of scarring from acne and within a couple weeks I started to notice the scars fading. Before I knew it my skin had cleared up and I&#x27;ve had people tell me how my skin has improved! This product has actually helped me to gain better confidence in myself by improving my skin! I use it at night and in the morning- one pump is good enough, I&#x27;ll use one a half if I feel like I need it. I wake up with younger looking skin (I&#x27;m only 28 by the way so even at 28, this will still make me feel even younger!). Pores also are less noticeable from using this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other expensive products and dermatologists products to remove age spots and this is the first product that worked. I had noticeable results in about a week and then each day they faded more and more and now they are gone. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t give it any star if I could.  I bought a large bottle and paid $145 for it here at Amazon after reading all the great reviews about this product.  It was such a waste of money.  Buyers be warned.  This does not work for all.  I am very thorough when cleansing my face.  I clean my face with a great facial cleanser then use a facial brush when my face is completely dry and use a derma roller so my face is ready for whatever facial treatments, serums and moisturizers I may apply after cleansing. I even have facial sauna every now and then before applying any skincare product.  Day after day, week after week, month after month, I kept waiting for results but there were none even after I&#x27;ve finished what was in the large bottle.  To this day, I am still looking for an effective dark spot corrector.  It seems everything out there is a joke.  The only one that really worked for me in the past was a laser treatment.  They are too expensive for me so I continue my hunt for a dark spot corrector product that REALLY works.  I hope manufacturers will stop selling products at prices that are too steep but don&#x27;t work at all.:(</li>
            <li> I have purchased numerous spot corrector in the past with hopes to see some noticeable results in a short period of time. The results that this product have given me are more than I expected! I used this spot corrector twice a day, everyday for a month and I am in complete awe! My dark spots that I had around my cheek bones have faded tremendously. The bottle size is HUGE which is something that I am not used to when it comes to skincare products. However, due to the size and quality I feel like this was an awesome deal! I am looking forward to finishing the bottle and ordering more products from Nuju in the future!!!</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time in the sun and I hate the sun spots on my face and I have ran across Nuju with great reviews from other users so I gave it a try. I have been using for 5months now and I love it. it keep my skin soft and moist through out the day and my sun spots slowly faded away not completely but a lot better. I will continue to use Nuju. It&#x27;s a great product and I am planning to order a 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> Been using about a week and see a difference already!</li>
            <li> This cream feels great on my skin and absorbs into my skin well leaving my face feeling hydrated. I have only been using it briefly so I have not had time to test for the dark spot correcting properties but so far I love the cream and will update when I see results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a discount to share my experience. While this has hydroquinone in it, it does not have that smell which is very strong and can burn my eyes. I have use that in the past. This is a thin lotion and easy to apply. I only use it once a day at night because it kinda makes my makeup a bit wonky when I use this under my makeup.It sits on the skin and does not easily absorb, but in my mind it makes me feel the longer it sits on my skin the more it will lighten up my dark areas, so for that I am ok with it. I only apply it to my hyperpigmentation. I generally want only those spots to lighten up. I have only been using this for about a week, but My biggest dark spot mid forehead area is so much less noticeable. I am so happy about this. The only issue so far I have with this it when it arrived the product had kind of exploded in the cap. I attempted to reapply the pump on the product, but it will not stay on and pops right off after use. I am still using it since I do think it doing something for my hyperpigmentation, but wish the pump was not broken.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I tried this brand. The dark spots on my cheeks was always a big concern. I asked for recommendation in the store and the sales person showed me an item that ended up not working. I figure it was up to me to find a spot corrector that works. Based on some online research and browsing I came across this product. It was a bit pricey, but after using it for one week, I can see obvious results. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Did not fade the dark sports at all. I got rashes in my face after using it and could not continue. My husband is using it for almost a month and his dark sports looks same.</li>
            <li> I have used this for more than 2 months. No significant change in my dark spots seen yet. It does serve as a good moisturizer however</li>
            <li> While I LOVE this product for moisturizing, so far that dark spots haven&#x27;t faded that much.  There are 3 that I am really paying attention to.  But if you want a superior overnight moisturizer, this is it!  It&#x27;s really thick, and doesn&#x27;t just evaporate.  Hold in the moisture and I see a few less fine lines when using.  I&#x27;ve only been using for about 4 weeks so still hopeful but have also added Retin A (purchased n Mexico) to see if I can get those dark spots to fade.</li>
            <li> Well it works, but I got one problem with this thing: after using it for a week, my neck looks kinda dark now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a week so it is too soon to know if it works.</li>
    </ol>
