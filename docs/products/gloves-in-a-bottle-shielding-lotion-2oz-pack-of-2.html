            <li>If you use it correctly, and daily, it is awesome.</li>
            <li>It has a fairly strong floral odor.  </li>

            <li>For really chapped hands do yourself a favor and try the 2 oz which you can probably obtain at the hospital or Amazon and see the amazing results.  </li>

            <li>Maybe I need to use this with other lotions or hand creams, but I really wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
            <li>I already purchased the full size b4</li>

            <li>I generally don&#x27;t like hand lotions because most make my palms sweat.</li>

            <li>The lotion itself has good effects on the skin; however, I have a hard time believing this product is &amp;#34;fragrance free.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>and my hands get beat up from washing them so much.</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>I asked at the hospital if they could recommend anything for my very sore hands.  </li>
            <li>It really does help with keeping hands from cracking.</li>
            <li>but does not moisturize much.  </li>
            <li>I like that it soaks in and stays on, but does not seem to moisturize much.  </li>
            <li>Smells funny, but absorbs quickly without being too greasy and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>They wash their hands so many times a day that this is the only lotion they have found that actually works by coating their skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend \\&quot;Gloves</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>You can use it at a red light and are ready to hold the steering wheel by the time the light turns green!</li>
            <li>My hands were so chapped, I had two band aids on two fingers on the right hand and one on the left hand.  </li>
            <li>I tend to use double the amount they recommend (&amp;#34;a dime-sized amount&amp;#34;), then wave my hands around until it dries.</li>
            <li>Beautiful lotion---Just too expensive!</li>
            <li>I ordered smaller samples previously from the company and I fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li>so I wash my hands a lot, and this stuff will usually last half my shift or more, which says a lot.</li>
            <li>After many trips to the dermatologist over the years and much money spent on trying out different prescription lotions, creams, and other medications, I had all but given up that there was something out there that could help my hands feel &#x27;close to normal&#x27; again.&lt;br /&gt;THEN</li>
            <li>A little bit of this and your hands become smooth and soft again.</li>
            <li>I might use this product if I have absolutely nothing else left in the house.</li>

            <li> Because I wash my hands from 7 to 15 times daily they are chapped and dry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it provided long term moisture or feel that  my hands have improved.</li>
            <li> I also rub it into my cuticle area to lessen the chance of dry cuticles (hangnails).</li>
            <li> but it keeps them from getting dry and chapped after hours of drawing.</li>
            <li> Gloves in a bottle does nothing for my extremely dry hands, gave me no type of relief at all.</li>
            <li> It solves dry hands, elbows, whatever ails you.</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry hands</li>
            <li> Bottle\\&quot; if you have rough dry skin or skin cracking due to contact with the weather or water.</li>
            <li> When knitting no transfer to the yarn and keeps fabrics from getting oily.  </li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why it is called gloves in a bottle--it does not feel much different from other lotions I have used.  </li>
            <li> When I use this beforehand it takes less scrubbing to remove the buildup from the color sticks.</li>
            <li> Before, they were very dry and rough but after a few days using gloves in a bottle it appeared and felt much smoother and less painful.</li>
            <li> Particularly in this cold winter weather.</li>
            <li> I got the small bottles for travel.</li>
            <li> I got two small bottles to keep in the glove box of both vehicles.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because I had used it in past and like it.  </li>
            <li> Will buy small bottles for friends just to introduce to them.  </li>
            <li> After a couple months with my skin cracking from the weather and water (I had my hands in water at least twice a day), I tried \\&quot;Gloves In A Bottle.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> No more irritation after using this!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this lotion! I&#x27;m an RN and my hands get beat up from washing them so much. I had such a bad reaction I even went to a dermatologist (who didn&#x27;t help). No more irritation after using this! Stays on even after hand washing :)))</li>
            <li> The lotion itself has good effects on the skin; however, I have a hard time believing this product is &amp;#34;fragrance free.&amp;#34;  It has a fairly strong floral odor.  I might use this product if I have absolutely nothing else left in the house.</li>
            <li> Was so thin.  Did nothing for me. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am a potter my hands are in mud and water all day so these are just what I needed next time going to order the bigger bottle!!m</li>
            <li> I have used the lotion for about 2 weeks now--nothing spectacular about it.  I am not sure why it is called gloves in a bottle--it does not feel much different from other lotions I have used.  I was expecting a lotion that lasted longer or made my hands feel coated/protected in some way. I have not noticed that.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Really heals dry skin</li>
            <li> These have helped my paint-sensitive son a lot in school. He applies then paints and none of the paint absorbs into his skin.</li>
            <li> Bought these for stocking stuffers and kept some for myself--very nice product, especially in our AZ climate which has almost no humidity.</li>
            <li> I ordered smaller samples previously from the company and I fell in love with this product. It really does a great job of shielding the skin, and helping it to retain its own moisture.&lt;br /&gt;As an eczema sufferer, this has made a big difference in the overall feeling of breakouts on my face. Before, they were very dry and rough but after a few days using gloves in a bottle it appeared and felt much smoother and less painful.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t like hand lotions because most make my palms sweat. After a couple months with my skin cracking from the weather and water (I had my hands in water at least twice a day), I tried \\&quot;Gloves In A Bottle.\\&quot;  This stuff makes your hands feel smooth, repairs cracking skin, etc.  And this stuff did not make my palms sweat. I highly recommend \\&quot;Gloves In A Bottle\\&quot; if you have rough dry skin or skin cracking due to contact with the weather or water.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from psoriasis on my hands now for several years.  After many trips to the dermatologist over the years and much money spent on trying out different prescription lotions, creams, and other medications, I had all but given up that there was something out there that could help my hands feel &#x27;close to normal&#x27; again.&lt;br /&gt;THEN a friend recommended that I try GLOVES IN A BOTTLE!  What an amazing product!  It not only has helped my hands feel softer, it helps protect my hands from the number one problem facing psoriasis sufferers -- water!  I still use the prescription medication twice a day as I&#x27;m supposed to, but use GLOVES IN A BOTTLE many times a day!  My hands have improved so much that I have purchased several of the large bottles and keep a small bottle in my purse and one in my car!  This shielding skin care is MAGIC!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am not at the point of carrying lotion places but this is definitely&lt;br /&gt;my number one choice product to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years because my husband and his staff use it in his dental office. They wash their hands so many times a day that this is the only lotion they have found that actually works by coating their skin. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I already purchased the full size b4 and I love it on my hands &amp; on my feet after shower and put socks on. It&#x27;s non greasy and absorbs quickly in the skin. I got the small bottles for travel. And I can always refill it.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff to use and if you wear gloves (latex or nitrile) it does not damage to gloves. A little bit of this and your hands become smooth and soft again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It goes on very smoothly and then it feels like it evaporates! No need to rub and rub to get it to absorb. I got two small bottles to keep in the glove box of both vehicles.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and odorless.  Great for crafters. When knitting no transfer to the yarn and keeps fabrics from getting oily.  Even my husband uses it. Small size great for your purse or desk at work.  Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in the wintertime on the U.S. East Coast, and now in Minnesota. It really works well. I tend to use double the amount they recommend (&amp;#34;a dime-sized amount&amp;#34;), then wave my hands around until it dries. I also rub it into my cuticle area to lessen the chance of dry cuticles (hangnails).</li>
            <li> Purchased this because I had used it in past and like it.  Could not find locally.</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry hands and this helps somewhat to prevent cracking in the winter time.  Still have some issues, but have definitely seen improvement since purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like I have something on my hands that I need to wash off.  I am always aware when I have it on which is distracting.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best thing for us, non greasy, absorbs quickly, really softens and moisturized dry skin.  This size is good for keeping in the car.  You can use it at a red light and are ready to hold the steering wheel by the time the light turns green!</li>
            <li> From someone who suffers from psoriasis winter time can be rough gloves in a bottle is a godsend.  It lives up to its name it&#x27;s like putting a protective glove on your hand it keeps it from drying out</li>
            <li> Highly recommended especially when you go out in planes etc</li>
            <li> great product... I have eczema on my hands and it helps to shield my condition from the elements.  I work with horses and this also helps keep dirt and grime out of my affected areas..</li>
            <li> My hands were so chapped, I had two band aids on two fingers on the right hand and one on the left hand.  I asked at the hospital if they could recommend anything for my very sore hands.  They recommended this product and after applying it about 9:30 AM my hands showed no signs of sores or bleeding.several hours after applying it and I recommend this product for everyone, especially during winter. I was told that you need only apply it once a day as there is some type of water resistance in the lotion.  try it you won&#x27;t be sorry.  For really chapped hands do yourself a favor and try the 2 oz which you can probably obtain at the hospital or Amazon and see the amazing results.  If you don&#x27;t have a miracle result, send an e mail and vent!!</li>
            <li> I keep one in the house and one in the car.  It really does help with keeping hands from cracking.</li>
            <li> When I use this beforehand it takes less scrubbing to remove the buildup from the color sticks. You still have to wash your hands with soap but it keeps them from getting dry and chapped after hours of drawing.</li>
            <li> Smells funny, but absorbs quickly without being too greasy and lasts a long time. I&#x27;m a server so I wash my hands a lot, and this stuff will usually last half my shift or more, which says a lot.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to use this with other lotions or hand creams, but I really wasn&#x27;t that impressed. I don&#x27;t think it provided long term moisture or feel that  my hands have improved.</li>
            <li> but does not moisturize much.  I like that it soaks in and stays on, but does not seem to moisturize much.  Maybe that&#x27;s what it suppose to do.  I put on lotion then put this on top and that seems to keep the lotion on my skin.</li>
            <li> It smells like Elmer&#x27;s glue and didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize as well as Skin MD shielding lotion. I tried this one as it was slightly cheaper than Skin MD, but Skin MD not only smells better, it works better.</li>
            <li> Leaves a sticky film that clumps. It also is not pleasant smelling. I&#x27;m an RN who lives/works in northern MI, so between washing my hands constantly and the cold weather I needed a quality lotion/protectant. This is not it  :(</li>
            <li> Beautiful lotion---Just too expensive!</li>
            <li> Was told by my nursing friend who must wash her hands constantly that Eucerin works better.</li>
            <li> I have used this for awhile. If you use it correctly, and daily, it is awesome. Particularly in this cold winter weather.</li>
            <li> I had a place on my body that itched all the time and no matter what I used from prescriptions from my dermatologist to over the counter products,  I could not get relief.  Now I&#x27;m itch free and I highly recommend Gloves in a Bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of like lighter fluid/mothballs. However, from a moisturizing perspective it can&#x27;t be beat. It&#x27;s not greasy/oily and one or two applications well rubbed in convert dry hands to smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this an extra star for the sole reason of not having a horrible smell. Gloves in a bottle does nothing for my extremely dry hands, gave me no type of relief at all. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle but was expecting my hands to gradually heal. They not only did not heal but they didn&#x27;t keep any moisture at all from the lotion.</li>
            <li> tried this product and decided to look for it at Amazon.  Because I wash my hands from 7 to 15 times daily they are chapped and dry.  This product last through about 4 hand washings.  Has helped roughness of my upper arms too.  Will buy small bottles for friends just to introduce to them.  I know they will like it.</li>
            <li> Item is as described very happy with it would buy again</li>
            <li> I love Gloves in a bottle and these little travel sizes are fantastic.  It solves dry hands, elbows, whatever ails you.</li>
