            <li>When the Yves Saint Laurent rep said she thought they were going to stop carrying this and didn&#x27;t have any, I worried I couldn&#x27;t get any more.  </li>
            <li>I have had more women and men as well, ask me what this is</li>
            <li>and they all love it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of the opium poppy...</li>
            <li>And I love this very unique cologne.</li>
            <li>Old world, smells so good on a man you could just snuggle into their neck and take in the smell for hours!</li>
            <li>This fragrance isn&#x27;t mainstream but it is quite good and very underrated.</li>
            <li>whats wores is i rely love this colone and dont even know if they still make the original.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to see EDT at JFK duty free, but it doesn&#x27;t smell ANYTHING like the original.</li>
            <li>It has a good smell but the ingredients must have been changed because the smell isnt the same as it was a couple years ago, ive been using this for many years</li>
            <li>Not easy to find anymore but very happy with this find.</li>
            <li>Once again, the item is exactly as listed and the price was even better.  </li>
            <li>We love this mens cologne - my husband went through the first bottle over time and asked me to please reorder it.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to have this cologne again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique and it stands alone.</li>
            <li>The smell is unique to Opium and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>all the day lasts, is smooth and tremendous surrounding scent...</li>
            <li>Are true.</li>
            <li>Really, this is a good masculine cologne.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Good paclaging fragrance what was to ne expected</li>
            <li>Still smells similar to the original, but very cheap.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted and ordered and came quickly.  </li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>This right here is a manly scent so try it out.</li>
            <li>not same as old style  but still good</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful Cologne for men, it has a peppery scent at first but then becomes mildly peppery a lots of spice.</li>
            <li>If you like something light and easy that lasts a long time - this is your fragrance.</li>
            <li>Some like this fragrance very much.  </li>
            <li>Pour Homme is a true oriental classic.  </li>
            <li>ok, so my man hasn&#x27;t tried it as it a Christmas present.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Yves Saint Laurent Opium pour Homme since it was first introduced in 1995.  </li>
            <li>You put to much on and your co-workers will let you know!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t none of you buy it, because my husband is the only one who&#x27;s going to smell sexy and delish...</li>
            <li>Has gotten very pricy over the years , but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>i have used opium for many years and have recommended it several time to my friends.i hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li>I have I found it legally except in this Eau De Toilette Spray from Yves Saint Laurent!  </li>
            <li>Use with moderation cause it will last all day and then some,one of my top 5 favorites.</li>
            <li>Very classy, though I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be popular with the younger crowd.</li>
            <li>It is very mild and is more of a personal experience only to be shared by the those that get close to you.</li>
            <li>It has a mild sweetness to it but the sweet tone is very low; It has more a high spice smell to it than the peppery and sweet scent.</li>
            <li>This is a long lasting fragrance that smells just as good at night as when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It used to be that two sprays were almost too much</li>
            <li>I know this sounds very sweet and gourmand-like, but while the overall composition is bold, the sweetness is restrained and stops well short of being too powdery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad other people like it&#x27;s smell</li>
            <li>Older ladies in asia use a lotion or oil or something that smells like this very much(black currant?).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Until that day, this is decent but pricey.</li>
            <li>Opium has high quality and the ability to turn heads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to say the least.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know where this new stuff comes from.</li>
            <li>I suspect that, while it is the real Opium in the original packaging, it may be a bit old since it does not smell, or last, like the last one I bought at a department store.</li>
            <li>It smells so mature and classic.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>you need something for a man, not a boy-man, no, real man, buy this and experience true character and confidence.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s what I love about this cologne, It smells like a high end cologne in small doses!</li>
            <li>It was easy to order online and was received a day or so earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>and i found that this is a verry watered down version of my original product.</li>
            <li>It clearly isn&#x27;t unisex.    </li>
            <li>if used properly you don&#x27;t need much, but I&#x27;ve been complimented on it frequently, so</li>
            <li>Nearly 1/2 the price of department stores and</li>
            <li>This will not overwhelm a room or make young children&#x27;s eyes water.   </li>
            <li>You only need 3 to 5 sprays in my humble opinion and the fragrance gets better as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>Of course this recent purchase for my 88 yr old father and wouldn&#x27;t dream of doing that!</li>
            <li>It goes on a little strong, but wait for the \\&quot;dry down\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It is a subtle, clean, fresh, and long lasting cologne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon sent this to me on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard faster than they promised - barely had a chance to look for it in the mail.  </li>
            <li>i even gone as far as putting on a lot to see if maybe i will smell the same but it dosent.</li>
            <li>with the original a small cople of sprays would last all day.</li>
            <li>Being asian however, this reminds me too much of old asian ladies.  </li>

            <li> It smells so mature and classic.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> you need something for a man, not a boy-man, no, real man, buy this and experience true character and confidence.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I love about this cologne, It smells like a high end cologne in small doses!</li>
            <li> It was easy to order online and was received a day or so earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> and i found that this is a verry watered down version of my original product.</li>
            <li> It clearly isn&#x27;t unisex.    </li>
            <li> if used properly you don&#x27;t need much, but I&#x27;ve been complimented on it frequently, so</li>
            <li> Nearly 1/2 the price of department stores and</li>
            <li> This will not overwhelm a room or make young children&#x27;s eyes water.   </li>
            <li> You only need 3 to 5 sprays in my humble opinion and the fragrance gets better as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Of course this recent purchase for my 88 yr old father and wouldn&#x27;t dream of doing that!</li>
            <li> It goes on a little strong, but wait for the \\&quot;dry down\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It is a subtle, clean, fresh, and long lasting cologne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon sent this to me on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard faster than they promised - barely had a chance to look for it in the mail.  </li>
            <li> i even gone as far as putting on a lot to see if maybe i will smell the same but it dosent.</li>
            <li> with the original a small cople of sprays would last all day.</li>
            <li> Being asian however, this reminds me too much of old asian ladies.  </li>
            <li> As with most comments above, it DOES attract the ladies, especially when it is cold.</li>
            <li> The fruity black current and anise top flows into a spicy heart of ginger and pepper that drys down to a subtly balsamic and woody vanilla.  </li>
            <li> think YSL should have a perfume for men, not just the eau de toilet, thus the 4 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Frankly, it does not smell completely genuine, yet I apologize if I am wrong.  </li>
            <li> Opium for men is long discontinued, end of story.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find now at a decent price of even 40.00 dollars.</li>
            <li> overpowering, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> on the other hand, do to keep other women away.</li>
            <li> this is not the same i paid 66 bucs for alchohol this sucks.</li>
            <li> The ones that talk about it being watered down...</li>
            <li> It smells (disgusting) like hot peppers when you first put it on.    </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to hear that YSL has discontinued it but thrilled to see that Amazon still has bottles on offer.</li>
            <li> its not available in stores</li>
            <li> I started using this a few years ago but the price of it has almost tripled since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I wasted money on TWO bottles.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to replace Escada POUR Homme since it was discontinued a few years ago</li>
            <li> Ladies usually pull me closer to grab the scent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to come by</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to always get it when you want or need it.</li>
            <li> , unfortunately they&#x27;re all my age (I will volunteer:</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Opium.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for a mistake like this.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but I like the smell.</li>
            <li> this is a stupid requirement</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very good i like the opium</li>
            <li> This is such a manly fragrance. Old world, smells so good on a man you could just snuggle into their neck and take in the smell for hours! Of course this recent purchase for my 88 yr old father and wouldn&#x27;t dream of doing that! lol&lt;br /&gt;Not overpowering, but a little goes a long way.I bought this for my dad many years ago and it&#x27;s the only&lt;br /&gt;one he will wear anymore.</li>
            <li> ok, so my man hasn&#x27;t tried it as it a Christmas present.  But I know I love this fragrance!  Received in record time!</li>
            <li> since I used this product, a lot of people have been asking me about it. I&#x27;m glad other people like it&#x27;s smell</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! Provocative glances from the opposite sex abound, unfortunately they&#x27;re all my age (I will volunteer: over 50). Really, this is a good masculine cologne. A hint of tobacco, so it doesn&#x27;t smell fruity. And the price is right.</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling colognes available.</li>
            <li> I have never used any perfume or deodorant and not one person has ever said I smell, but while wearing this scent I find women kissing my neck or face while saying hello, almost always comment I smell nice. I will continue to use this lure.</li>
            <li> I suspect that, while it is the real Opium in the original packaging, it may be a bit old since it does not smell, or last, like the last one I bought at a department store.</li>
            <li> Very nice oriental spice EDT</li>
            <li> In greatness of nasal pleasures it delivers Opium can only be compared with Fahrenheit by Christian Dior.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000E7YKI2 Opium By Yves Saint Laurent For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces]]    Awesome price. Nearly 1/2 the price of department stores and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Once again, the item is exactly as listed and the price was even better.  Cannot beat shopping on Amazon for the things we want.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent price and good aroma. all the day lasts, is smooth and tremendous surrounding scent... I recommend 100%</li>
            <li> Love this cologne! (so does my girlfriend----so, yay!)  ;-)</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Yves Saint Laurent Opium pour Homme since it was first introduced in 1995.  It is a wonderful scent and just about every time I wear it I am asked what my frangrance is.  This is a long lasting fragrance that smells just as good at night as when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> No one will ever confuse this for a woman&#x27;s perfume.    It clearly isn&#x27;t unisex.    2 sprays max, this stuff is POTENT like Fahrenheit but even SPICIER!    It smells (disgusting) like hot peppers when you first put it on.    After 5 minutes the cinnamon kicks in and makes it great.      After an hour, it&#x27;s cinnamon and vanilla.      It lasts over 24 hours, and is just vanilla at the end.    Women I don&#x27;t know get closer just to a get a whiff.    This is for manly men only.</li>
            <li> My husband wears this and all the women … including me …. love it!!!  Every woman should spoil her man and buy him this.  You will be happy!!!  So will he.</li>
            <li> It has a good smell but the ingredients must have been changed because the smell isnt the same as it was a couple years ago, ive been using this for many years and I can and my wife can tell its not the same. I did email Yves about my issue and was told it was discountinued. But it still has a nice smell but someone has changed it.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little strong, but wait for the \\&quot;dry down\\&quot;.  The fragrance improves as the hours go by. Wow! This is truly an exceptional scent.  It is now one of my favorites!  Compliments will abound with this one! Very classy, though I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be popular with the younger crowd. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I love about this cologne, It smells like a high end cologne in small doses! You put to much on and your co-workers will let you know! You put the right amount on your co-workers will also let you know in a more pleasant way! Plus this cologne has lasting power, last all day and night. Couldn&#x27;t tell you what it smell&#x27;s like but it does smell sexy!</li>
            <li> its not available in stores and we love it  what else can I say  enough said!!  this is a stupid requirement</li>
            <li> We love this mens cologne - my husband went through the first bottle over time and asked me to please reorder it.  It smells great  and many people ask what he&#x27;s wearing so there you have it.........</li>
            <li> Some like this fragrance very much.  Not me.  Being asian however, this reminds me too much of old asian ladies.  Older ladies in asia use a lotion or oil or something that smells like this very much(black currant?).  Maybe if ur not asian ull like this.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff since the &#x27;80&#x27;s. Kind of pricey now, but well worth it. I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how good it smells.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah my man loves it and it smells great on him and yes he does turn heads when he wears it .WOW!!</li>
            <li> I started using this a few years ago but the price of it has almost tripled since I started using it. It is hard to find now at a decent price of even 40.00 dollars. I think it is the best smell ever.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as great for me as it does on my friend.  Different body chemistries, I suppose.</li>
            <li> Opium is the bomb. I bought mine from a department store but couldn&#x27;t pass up an opportunity to post a review here. The smell is soooo good, I find myself putting it on even when I&#x27;m home alone. You can call me vain, but the smell is irresistible. I feckin&#x27; love it!&lt;br /&gt; As with most comments above, it DOES attract the ladies, especially when it is cold. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Opium. Even my boss at work asked me about it and I decided not to let him in on what I&#x27;m wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need something for a man, not a boy-man, no, real man, buy this and experience true character and confidence. I&#x27;ll keep buying this to my last day.</li>
            <li> Everything was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for his birthday, he loves it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance for my husband. He loves it always has. I had been searching for it in stores for sometime, even in Europe, but to no avail. It was easy to order online and was received a day or so earlier than expected. It was a good deal for the amount. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The ones that talk about it being watered down... Are true. I was excited to have this cologne again but after an hour you cannot smell it at all. It used to be that two sprays were almost too much and it would last all day. Now you use 5 sprays and it doesn&#x27;t last at all. I wasted money on TWO bottles.</li>
            <li> Excellent I love this fragrance since it has been discontinued it&#x27;s hard to come by</li>
            <li> In the first spray it had a very pleasant scent, but gradually it changes into a untoleranle odor not unlike the smell of pif-puff!</li>
            <li> We have loved this scent for many years and hope that it is never discontinued!  It&#x27;s hard to always get it when you want or need it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t none of you buy it, because my husband is the only one who&#x27;s going to smell sexy and delish... on the other hand, do to keep other women away.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance . Always get compliments when I wear it. Has gotten very pricy over the years , but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> A lot of places have discontinued this cologne - if used properly you don&#x27;t need much, but I&#x27;ve been complimented on it frequently, so I guess it smells good on me.  And anyone can tell it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; cologne.  The 3.3 ounce bottle lasts for years.  I will probably stock up before year&#x27;s end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sent this to me on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard faster than they promised - barely had a chance to look for it in the mail.  I don&#x27;t know how they do it but their shipping system seems excellent.</li>
            <li> great item. i have used opium for many years and have recommended it several time to my friends.i hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my husband for Christmas and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I love it too, on myself and on him!&lt;br /&gt;I think YSL should have a perfume for men, not just the eau de toilet, thus the 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;A deodorant and body wash or lotion for men, would be a money maker.&lt;br /&gt;Until that day, this is decent but pricey.</li>
            <li> Great item Great price all I ever use and the women love it!!!</li>
            <li> Good paclaging fragrance what was to ne expected</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I was 18 and I love the scent. It is very mild and is more of a personal experience only to be shared by the those that get close to you. This will not overwhelm a room or make young children&#x27;s eyes water.   Ladies usually pull me closer to grab the scent. It&#x27;s nice to say the least.</li>
            <li> Opium for men is long discontinued, end of story. Try and find it on YSL Web site. I don&#x27;t know where this new stuff comes from. I was very excited to see EDT at JFK duty free, but it doesn&#x27;t smell ANYTHING like the original. I&#x27;ve been using Opium Pour Homme since 1995 an still have some EDP, EDT and aftershave left. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this counterfeit.</li>
            <li> Frankly, it does not smell completely genuine, yet I apologize if I am wrong.  But I was born in Paris, and this does not really smell completely the same, Jeffrey</li>
            <li> Opium for Men is awesome. The combination of vanilla and pepper in this fragrance is unbeatable. It is a subtle, clean, fresh, and long lasting cologne. You only need 3 to 5 sprays in my humble opinion and the fragrance gets better as the day goes on. Opium for Men is a must for any fragrance collection. Women love this scent!</li>
            <li> Got this for a gift for my husband.  Love it</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful Cologne for men, it has a peppery scent at first but then becomes mildly peppery a lots of spice. It has a mild sweetness to it but the sweet tone is very low; It has more a high spice smell to it than the peppery and sweet scent. This right here is a manly scent so try it out.</li>
            <li> Always a good product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one of the best cologne on the market</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever stop making Opium for Men.  And don&#x27;t change the formula.  I love the fragrance and so does my family.  This product is # 1.  Nothing comes close.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, best price around, everyone who gives me a hug says how nice I smell.</li>
            <li> Smells like God&#x27;s taint. I suppose that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Not easy to find anymore but very happy with this find.</li>
            <li> I ordered OPIUM 3.3 oz. spray for men, but I received OPIUM 3.0 oz.for women. Too expensive for a mistake like this.</li>
            <li> Writing review about colognes and perfumes doesn&#x27;t make sense.  It&#x27;s all about your taste. And I love this very unique cologne. It smells so mature and classic.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product thinking it was the same as the one i was almost running out of. i already had a 3.3 onz bottle wich was purchased many years ago. i just used this yesterday and i found that this is a verry watered down version of my original product. this is not the same i paid 66 bucs for alchohol this sucks. and i thruw the box away so i cant return this. whats wores is i rely love this colone and dont even know if they still make the original. i even gone as far as putting on a lot to see if maybe i will smell the same but it dosent. with the original a small cople of sprays would last all day. i not shure if the seller bears any fault in this or if its just the makers falt but i feel misled</li>
            <li> Expensive, but I like the smell.</li>
            <li> Great product on time</li>
            <li> Opium has high quality and the ability to turn heads. It&#x27;s unique and it stands alone. I&#x27;m A Satisfied Customer.</li>
            <li> When the Yves Saint Laurent rep said she thought they were going to stop carrying this and didn&#x27;t have any, I worried I couldn&#x27;t get any more.  I was then worried that this item was a knock-off or not as advertised but it wasn&#x27;t.  It was exactly what I wanted and ordered and came quickly.  I love this scent!</li>
            <li> smell you can ever imagine. I have had more women and men as well, ask me what this is and they all love it.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THE PERFUME FOR YEARS SO DECIDED LAST XMAS TO PURCHASE FOR MY HUSBAND.&lt;br /&gt;BOTH OF US LOVED IT,  I WOULD RECOMMEND TO THOSE THAT LIKE ORIENTAL SCENTS.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly, great scent. I did not know that they made Opium for men. I have been looking for something to replace Escada POUR Homme since it was discontinued a few years ago and I finally found it.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.  Been using it for years.  If you like something light and easy that lasts a long time - this is your fragrance.</li>
            <li> Its not the reall deal coz after an hour u cant smell any perfume its not orginal.....</li>
            <li> Fragrance arrived on time and intact. The smell is unique to Opium and lasts all day. If you don&#x27;t know or haven&#x27;t tried it...you should.</li>
            <li> not same as old style  but still good</li>
            <li> Opium Pour Homme is a true oriental classic.  The fruity black current and anise top flows into a spicy heart of ginger and pepper that drys down to a subtly balsamic and woody vanilla.  I know this sounds very sweet and gourmand-like, but while the overall composition is bold, the sweetness is restrained and stops well short of being too powdery.  This fin de si&amp;egrave;cle masterpiece is an opulent scent every fragrance lover should try.  I was very disappointed to hear that YSL has discontinued it but thrilled to see that Amazon still has bottles on offer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but not as good as the oil.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of the opium poppy...nowhere I have I found it legally except in this Eau De Toilette Spray from Yves Saint Laurent!  I am not going to break the law to enjoy the fragrance of opium, but I will pay top dollar for this product!</li>
            <li> Use with moderation cause it will last all day and then some,one of my top 5 favorites.</li>
            <li> This is reformulated. Isn&#x27;t a powerhouse like it once was. Still smells similar to the original, but very cheap.</li>
            <li> This fragrance isn&#x27;t mainstream but it is quite good and very underrated.</li>
    </ol>
