    <ol>

            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>AWESOME PRODUCT TO BUY!!!</li>
            <li>Curls hair easily!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It did a great job setting my hair.</li>
            <li>but these rollers were great.  </li>
            <li>I was nervous after reading reviews, but these worked great.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly in my carry on luggage, and are great for travel.  </li>
            <li>The case is perfect for traveling and the curlers are light, so they would be great on a flight.</li>
            <li>These curlers heat up very quickly, and they curl my hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li>These are a great find -- I&#x27;m so glad I tried them!</li>
            <li>This product is good at curling, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>they cannot take the weight of my hair and the roller, and dont do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>However, it is a good size to pack for traveling.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Heat up quickly, work great!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this set for all of those reasons.</li>
            <li>This would make a great beginners set paired with a couple more rollers.</li>
            <li>Really nice look though.</li>
            <li>I got it because of it&#x27;s size, to fit in suitcase.. which the size is good</li>
            <li>These are good in a pinch and fit well in a packed suitcase.  </li>
            <li>heats up fine and does a nice job curling the&lt;br /&gt;hair</li>
            <li>The clips hold well much better then the plastic clips.  </li>
            <li>I love the portability of this product.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the case is really cute.</li>
            <li>I ended up using them with my claw type clips instead, but the included pins are ok.</li>
            <li>My hair will not hold a curl from a curling iron (for more then 2 hours) or from a perm (for more than a month).</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;d rather spend a lill more money but buy a better set</li>
            <li>Still have an ancient Conair set from the 80&#x27;s before they started putting in the ridge, and they hold my hair better than anything.  </li>
            <li>i love the cute case the the clips are compact, with rubber tips at the end</li>
            <li>The metal clips are holding up great (still look brand new) and stay on the roller (no bouncing off!).</li>
            <li>These clips fit around the roller, are very easy to use, and stay put.</li>
            <li>Happily the tread like bumps actually grab on to the ends of my hair better than my velvet ones do.</li>
            <li>It is easy to take on a trip or to use at home.</li>
            <li>The grips don&#x27;t tangle, yet make rolling easy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the fact that they are &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; this is just so they are compact - for travel or easy storage.</li>
            <li>I have medium length fine hair and use 19 rollers each day.  </li>
            <li>However, I liked them so much, that I just ordered another set, so that I can also use these at home every day.  </li>
            <li>I wish they were available, either with the roller set or as a separate add-on</li>
            <li>They have a good selection of sizes (3) and as long as you know where to put them, achieve lovely bouncing curls.</li>
            <li>you have fine hair - and rely on hot rollers to get your do, this is it!</li>
            <li>AND THE CURL STAYS ... WOULD RECOMMEND THIS , AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT !</li>
            <li>As someone who has been lugging around full sets of rollers for years, these are a blessing.  </li>
            <li>This one will actually look good sitting on my counter in bathroom.  </li>
            <li>My hair holds a curl from these for 8-10 hours, which is pretty good considering my straight straight hair.</li>
            <li>the curlers heat quickly and I ended up with a mass of bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>QUICK</li>
            <li>They barely got warm so of course they didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.</li>
            <li>They got very hot.  </li>
            <li>I think one of the problems is because they do not get very hot.</li>
            <li>for easy, fast styling.</li>
            <li>I bought this set several months ago and love them!</li>
            <li>Heats pretty quickly if zipped and curls well.</li>
            <li>This is also priced right.  </li>
            <li>better are the plastic scrunchie-like clips I&#x27;ve saved from another old version of a Conair hot roller product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really get hot!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This item did exactly what I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>, I think you just need to make sure that the rollers are pushed into the bases in order to heat up properly.  </li>
            <li>No guarantees that any of these hair appliances will last more than a year or two, despite what you spend</li>
            <li>The bivolt feature a real plus!</li>
            <li>You have no idea how much research I did looking for various hot rollers that would heat fast, have rollers that fit my hairstyle, fit in my carry-on bag and had DUAL VOLTAGE.</li>
            <li>The rollers barely get warm, so they simply don&#x27;t curl my hair.</li>
            <li>The grips on them are a mixture that allows the rollers to stay put, a big plus on fine hair.</li>
            <li>They do need to heat up for much longer than the recommended time.  </li>
            <li>so I expected a better product.</li>
            <li>Works for straight hair as well as curly hair.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the combs they have to help get your hair rolling.</li>
            <li>The rollers don&#x27;t heat up quickly and don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>These little hot rollers are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I did notice one set does not get as hot as the other and when I used in China I could hear a buzzing sound from one of the sets.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used hot rollers for my super fine hair for at least 30 years.</li>
            <li>There are full size rollers and enough to do your hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I ended up liking them better than the (much more expensive) hot rollers that I&#x27;ve been using daily at home.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine short hair then maybe they will be enough for your needs.</li>
            <li>So I think these are my new favorites -- for both home and travel.  </li>
            <li>Bought in the US, brought it to Australia, where I live.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Important:  You really have to keep the plastic lid DOWN while heating, which is opposite of what most curler sets recommend.  </li>
            <li>The set of curlers I received simply do not get hot.  </li>
            <li>I used it, but it just seems that the rods do not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>what I haven&#x27;t decided is if I think the rollers get hot enough to hold the curl for any length of time.</li>
            <li>I like the trendy red, black, white color combo.  </li>
            <li>The case should be large enough to insert the electrical cord.</li>
            <li>Rollers do not heat up enough to curl longer straight hair.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the curlers will not heat properly, and it will take much longer to reach temp you need.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something small that could easily be packed on a carry on.</li>
            <li>Really people, not all of us like everything in pink.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest that you wait until you get to where you are going, because I must have purchased at least 6 different adapters here in the U.S., all claiming to fit the Mediterranean area, and none of them worked.  </li>
            <li>i like this little compact hot roller set.</li>

            <li> I usually drop at least one - every time I set - just because my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t seem to get  a curl that lasted long.</li>
            <li> Sharp case with various sized rollers that can be packed</li>
            <li> I have medium thick asian hair, and i&#x27;ve barely used this over the last year.</li>
            <li> My hair only cooperates with half the rollers out there, and it worked with these.  </li>
            <li> I saw some mixed reviews, so I was a little worried....</li>
            <li> The size is compact and as other users have commented the cord is outside the little bag.  </li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair that is very hard to get it to hold a curl.</li>
            <li> Just for the heck of it, I also brought with me the other 6 adapters I had from the US and none of them worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other iterations of this product over the years</li>
            <li> /&gt;The different sized wire holders for each size roller are hard to identify and they fall off.&lt;br /&gt;MUCH</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that they have about 3 too few rollers for my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> (although sometimes they are a little cumbersome)</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t they just make it with the little prongs and leave it at that?</li>
            <li> I was looking for a travel set with larger size curlers that aren&#x27;t that horrible felt stuff, and this one was priced right.  </li>
            <li> I bought them to use for a work trip that I took this past week.</li>
            <li> I usually let them heat for about 5 minutes prior to use, and the clips that are included are useless -</li>
            <li> Small, heats up in a minute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the clips over the rollers</li>
            <li> and I did use it, but I am not thrilled by it.</li>
            <li> Other sets have been difficult because they didn&#x27;t have this feature.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it says it in the instructions.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to re-roll the curler because I can&#x27;t insert the metal clip if that dumb ridge is in the wrong place.  </li>
            <li> It seems to pull and be uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t use for travel anymore as the base cracked, so had to find a substitute.</li>
            <li> Am very disappointed in this purchase.</li>

            <li> These little hot rollers are fantastic!  I bought them to use for a work trip that I took this past week. They fit perfectly in my carry on luggage, and are great for travel.  When I bought them, I only planned to use them for travel.  However, I liked them so much, that I just ordered another set, so that I can also use these at home every day.  I ended up liking them better than the (much more expensive) hot rollers that I&#x27;ve been using daily at home.  So I think these are my new favorites -- for both home and travel.  They do need to heat up for much longer than the recommended time.  I usually let them heat for about 5 minutes prior to use, and the clips that are included are useless - but I just  use the claw clips to hold them.  These are a great find -- I&#x27;m so glad I tried them!</li>
            <li> Am very disappointed in this purchase. The rollers barely get warm, so they simply don&#x27;t curl my hair. I have had Conair products before so I expected a better product.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 sets to take to China and the rollers worked wonderfully without any issues.  I have medium length fine hair and use 19 rollers each day.  I did notice one set does not get as hot as the other and when I used in China I could hear a buzzing sound from one of the sets.  Both have held up with daily usage for the last 6 weeks.  The size is compact and as other users have commented the cord is outside the little bag.  There are 10 rollers with each set and it includes wire clips.  The clips hold well much better then the plastic clips.  The only improvement I would suggest is color coding the ends of the clips so they are easier to seperate by size and include an extra clip for each size.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the portability of this product.  However, I do not like the clips used to fasten the hair to the curler.  It seems to pull and be uncomfortable.  I wish it had the \\&quot;claw clips\\&quot;.  The hooks are flimsy, and worried that they may damage or pull my hair.</li>
            <li> You have no idea how much research I did looking for various hot rollers that would heat fast, have rollers that fit my hairstyle, fit in my carry-on bag and had DUAL VOLTAGE. I am very pleased with this set for all of those reasons. Plus, the case is really cute. Don&#x27;t forget that if you are looking specifically for dual voltage, you still need to buy the correct adapter.  I would suggest that you wait until you get to where you are going, because I must have purchased at least 6 different adapters here in the U.S., all claiming to fit the Mediterranean area, and none of them worked.  Once I got to Monte Carlo, I found one in a drug store.  Just for the heck of it, I also brought with me the other 6 adapters I had from the US and none of them worked.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. I ended up using them with my claw type clips instead, but the included pins are ok. Happily the tread like bumps actually grab on to the ends of my hair better than my velvet ones do. Heats pretty quickly if zipped and curls well.</li>
            <li> Sharp case with various sized rollers that can be packed easily.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up fine and does a nice job curling the&lt;br /&gt;hair for easy, fast styling.</li>
            <li> This product is good at curling, I recommend it. AWESOME PRODUCT TO BUY!!! Curls hair easily!!!!!! Buy this one!!!! Works for straight hair as well as curly hair.</li>
            <li> i like this little compact hot roller set. It is easy to take on a trip or to use at home. the curlers heat quickly and I ended up with a mass of bouncy curls. Recommend it for your travel curl needs</li>
            <li> I bought this set several months ago and love them! My only complaint would be that they have about 3 too few rollers for my shoulder length hair. They have a good selection of sizes (3) and as long as you know where to put them, achieve lovely bouncing curls. My hair will not hold a curl from a curling iron (for more then 2 hours) or from a perm (for more than a month). My hair holds a curl from these for 8-10 hours, which is pretty good considering my straight straight hair. I really appreciate the combs they have to help get your hair rolling. Other sets have been difficult because they didn&#x27;t have this feature. The metal clips are holding up great (still look brand new) and stay on the roller (no bouncing off!). The case is perfect for traveling and the curlers are light, so they would be great on a flight. They have enough protectiveness to shield from burns both on your scalp (or ears) and your hand while rolling. Heat up quickly, work great! This would make a great beginners set paired with a couple more rollers.</li>
            <li> The set of curlers I received simply do not get hot.  They barely got warm so of course they didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I used it, but it just seems that the rods do not get hot enough. I needed it for travel and I did use it, but I am not thrilled by it. I got it because of it&#x27;s size, to fit in suitcase.. which the size is good, I didn&#x27;t seem to get  a curl that lasted long.</li>
            <li> The rollers are for use in travel. The case should be large enough to insert the electrical cord. The rollers don&#x27;t heat up quickly and don&#x27;t get hot enough. I&#x27;ve had other iterations of this product over the years and I think the heating element in this one may not be as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different sized wire holders for each size roller are hard to identify and they fall off.&lt;br /&gt;MUCH better are the plastic scrunchie-like clips I&#x27;ve saved from another old version of a Conair hot roller product. These clips fit around the roller, are very easy to use, and stay put. I wish they were available, either with the roller set or as a separate add-on</li>
            <li> This item did exactly what I hoped it would. I wanted something small that could easily be packed on a carry on. It did a great job setting my hair. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> sUPRISED THAT THEY ORKED SO WELL... HEAT UP QUICK AND THE CURL STAYS ... WOULD RECOMMEND THIS , AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to decide if I like this product. I do know the rollers grip well and I like the clips (although sometimes they are a little cumbersome)....what I haven&#x27;t decided is if I think the rollers get hot enough to hold the curl for any length of time. I&#x27;m still hopeful though!</li>
            <li> I have medium thick asian hair, and i&#x27;ve barely used this over the last year. not because im lazy.&lt;br /&gt;2 issues :&lt;br /&gt;1. The metal clips (that holds the roller in place &amp; prevent it from falling off) are just lill U-shaped metal pins. they cannot take the weight of my hair and the roller, and dont do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;2. The roller itself doesn&#x27;t get too hot&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d rather spend a lill more money but buy a better set</li>
            <li> I saw some mixed reviews, so I was a little worried....but these rollers were great.  My hair only cooperates with half the rollers out there, and it worked with these.  The pack is small, so so easy to pack and doesn&#x27;t take up hardly any room at all.  They got very hot.  I saw some people did not think so, I think you just need to make sure that the rollers are pushed into the bases in order to heat up properly.  As someone who has been lugging around full sets of rollers for years, these are a blessing.  I would definitely recommend these!!</li>
            <li> Rollers do not heat up enough to curl longer straight hair. Others do so I know it&#x27;s just a temperature problem.  If you have fine short hair then maybe they will be enough for your needs. Really nice look though.</li>
            <li> These curlers heat up very quickly, and they curl my hair perfectly.  I get complements every time I use them..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really get hot! The clips do not hold well. However, it is a good size to pack for traveling.</li>
            <li> I was nervous after reading reviews, but these worked great. No problem with the voltage, just needed the plug adapter.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a travel set with larger size curlers that aren&#x27;t that horrible felt stuff, and this one was priced right.  I like the trendy red, black, white color combo.  Really people, not all of us like everything in pink.  This one will actually look good sitting on my counter in bathroom.  This is also priced right.  No guarantees that any of these hair appliances will last more than a year or two, despite what you spend, so I&#x27;d rather not spend a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important:  You really have to keep the plastic lid DOWN while heating, which is opposite of what most curler sets recommend.  Seriously, it says it in the instructions.  Otherwise the curlers will not heat properly, and it will take much longer to reach temp you need.  Also, I don&#x27;t care for the long ridge on the outside of curlers.  Why can&#x27;t they just make it with the little prongs and leave it at that? Sometimes I have to re-roll the curler because I can&#x27;t insert the metal clip if that dumb ridge is in the wrong place.  Still have an ancient Conair set from the 80&#x27;s before they started putting in the ridge, and they hold my hair better than anything.  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t use for travel anymore as the base cracked, so had to find a substitute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hot rollers for my super fine hair for at least 30 years. I bought this set on a whim for my second home. I&#x27;m taking them with me - and leaving my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; rollers there. The grips on them are a mixture that allows the rollers to stay put, a big plus on fine hair. The grips don&#x27;t tangle, yet make rolling easy. I usually drop at least one - every time I set - just because my hair is so fine. This doesn&#x27;t happen with these. I&#x27;ve even done my morning exercise with out them falling out! i love the cute case the the clips are compact, with rubber tips at the end so you don&#x27;t poke yourself.&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine hair - and rely on hot rollers to get your do, this is it! Don&#x27;t be fooled by the fact that they are &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; this is just so they are compact - for travel or easy storage. There are full size rollers and enough to do your hair. This is a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Small, heats up in a minute. Loved it. Bought in the US, brought it to Australia, where I live. The bivolt feature a real plus!</li>
            <li> These are good in a pinch and fit well in a packed suitcase.  It&#x27;s hard to get the clips over the rollers but I&#x27;m figuring it out.  Not crazy about the results I get but at least my hair is curly.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair that is very hard to get it to hold a curl. I ordered these and they did not work, the curl would fall out maby 1 hour later. I think one of the problems is because they do not get very hot.</li>
