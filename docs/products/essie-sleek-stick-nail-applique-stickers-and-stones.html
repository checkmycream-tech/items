            <li>You can&#x27;t just slap them on your nails and expect them to be perfect.</li>
            <li>and they still look perfect.</li>
            <li>Thank you Essie for another great product!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The syle with rhinestones and sparkle was awesome, but I will stick to Sally H and Incoco.  </li>
            <li>I have had great luck with these.</li>
            <li>I got one nail done with the Essie brand and realized I wasn&#x27;t going to be happy with the end product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried Sally Hanson before and loved them.  </li>
            <li>Everyone at work loved how they looked</li>
            <li>I applied these to my nails rather easily and they look beautiful.</li>
            <li>These nail stickers are beautiful and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>First time trying this product, i thought they were great!</li>
            <li>I see why they are sold there because they arent that amazing.  </li>
            <li>Aside from having to re-do one nail because of a bubble, they stayed on for a good amount of time and were easy to shape to my nail.</li>
            <li>They peel off very easily so don&#x27;t even attempt to wash dishes or submerge your hands in any type of liquid.</li>
            <li>They are really beautiful in the package but really suck in reality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been more than a week, and they are still on my fingers.  </li>
            <li>I did not need to put top coat on top.  </li>
            <li>These worked better than the higher-priced Jamberry wraps for me.</li>
            <li>I wish I didn&#x27;t put a top coat over them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I can get 2 manicures from a pack.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they would have lasted longer if I had not wanted a change.</li>
            <li>manicure- but just as cute.</li>
            <li>I love the way these look.</li>
            <li>There are better nail stickers out there.</li>
            <li>Very easy to fit on my nails and extras</li>
            <li>, my nails look super cute &amp; they took me about 10 mins!</li>
            <li>Application was easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy peezy orange squeezy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were peeling off within 48 hours and were not as easy to manipulate as the brands mentioned above.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In short, they&#x27;re beautiful, but the quality just isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li>These went on quite smoothly.</li>
            <li>They look cheap.</li>
            <li>I just bought these &amp; they were super easy to put on, they fit my nails pretty spot on &amp; were very easy to file off the excess.</li>
            <li>They are super cute on the first 2 days but unlike the Sally Hansen ones, they start to come off easily and start to crumple up if you have any dents in your nail bed...  </li>
            <li>Polish never lasts a full day without chipping for me.</li>
            <li>It was true polish, shaped well to my nail, and lasted for months.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought these from the dollar store and was terrifically amazed at how good there came out.</li>
            <li>If you just want to wear them for a special occasion, they&#x27;re worth it...</li>
            <li>Well, it didnt look so good back then and these Essie nail stickers dont look so hot either.</li>
            <li>By the way, don&#x27;t apply a clear coat over the top, it will damage them.</li>
            <li>it looks like I have a fresh manicure.</li>
            <li>I also could not get them smoothed out properly at the edge and was catching my nails on my sweater all day.</li>
            <li>Essie tried to match the success of sally Hansen and Incoco with their Sleek Sticks, BUT MISSED THE MARK!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really hoping these were worth the $14 price tag.</li>
            <li>I applied them last night before bed, and they&#x27;re already coming off at the free edge at 11 am!</li>
            <li>the sizes are great &amp; there&#x27;s different ones to choose from to fit your nails, i don&#x27;t feel like they are too thick</li>
            <li>Who would think that little Sally would be better than fancy Essie!</li>
            <li>With that being said, they certainly have their flaws.</li>
            <li>I really like the Incoco and OPI nail stickers because they are really easy to apply and last for almost two weeks.</li>
            <li>NO, they aren&#x27;t a fast fix to not painting your nails.</li>
            <li>the sally Hansen ones are curved on the sides and these are a straight line.  </li>
            <li>They outsell off really even</li>
            <li>Destroyed the surface of my nails!!!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased at Dollar Tree.&lt;br /&gt;Not shaped very well.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>Although you do have to take your time, it&#x27;s still a lot easier than painting your nails and cheaper than a real</li>
            <li>Some of them work really well</li>
            <li>They dont apply smoothly at all, they almost look crinkled when they are actually on your nails.</li>
            <li>Once applied, I was not able to smooth sticker, it bubbled, and there was no way to easily remove the excess around the edges of my nail.  </li>
            <li>but for the long haul, you&#x27;re better off going with the Sally Hansen nail strips that are made of actual nail polish and last a week or more.</li>
            <li>Although they are cute, I would skip these and go for the other brand!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving these a try.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand all the bad reviews because these are awesome.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not quite sure how long these will last.</li>
            <li>i have no bubbles &amp; no problem filing them down smooth.</li>
            <li>They are way too thick and did not look cute anymore</li>
            <li>I had high hopes because I actually LOVE the sally hansen nail stickers, but these are far worse.</li>
            <li>of thick and weird-feeling, but went on fairly easily and lasted very well for two weeks with only some wear at the tips.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>My right thumb had a wrinkle on application that I could not \\&quot;lift and pull\\&quot; like the other two brands to fix.</li>
            <li>There is a little wear on top, as expected.  </li>
            <li>For that price, these little guys are worth it.</li>
            <li>Bare nail hung out on the sides.  </li>
            <li>I have used sally Hanson in the past and the color fades quickly and the color comes off on the tips.  </li>
            <li>Also they&#x27;re very thick and dont stretch and stick as nice as other products.  </li>
            <li>Problem is that it was hard to file them down and when I applied a top coat over them they would get wrinkled in a spiderweb like pattern.</li>

            <li> I also typically finish my strips off with a layer of clear topcoat.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t dry out</li>

            <li> That was a complete waste of my time and my $10!</li>
            <li> Too bad, as they look super classy.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt say I have odd sized nails, yet NONE of the non-thumb sized stickers were wide enough for 4 of my nails.  </li>
            <li> Sally Hansen for instance sticks very well and are thin and lay down flat.  </li>
            <li> , i don&#x27;t see what the other reviewers are saying.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other two reviewers.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how long they will last, hopefully at least a week.</li>
            <li> I took my time to apply these, but they are really difficult to get on straight and ended up having wrinkles.</li>
            <li> but I just give my nails a little trim and</li>
            <li> I do get some tip wear with these after a few days</li>
            <li> As these started peeling in 1-2 days, I tried this and the polish instantly wrinkled up on the nail and looked even worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone else had so much trouble...</li>
            <li> these were thick and oddly shaped on the sides.  </li>
            <li> Not cute.</li>
            <li> small and had to piece.&lt;br /&gt;Kind</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> These stickers are really thick and tough to stretch over the nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never get back :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give bad reviews because you can&#x27;t take the time to slow down and put them on correctly.</li>
            <li> Total waste of a 1.00 and very disappointed in Essie.</li>
            <li> They are too thick and felt weird on my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;ve been so bad for others.</li>
            <li> But like the other reviewer was very disappointed once they were on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get all of the terrible reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> These must be the worst nail stickers/polish I have tried!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the stickers above, but did get this pair at TJ Maxx for a steal at $1.99. For that price, these little guys are worth it. I didn&#x27;t have any option in style, but I wanted to see how these compare to Jamberry. These are easier to do than Jamberry, and I like that they&#x27;re plastic. Jamberry tends to wear at the tip for me. Two kids and being a teacher, washing my hands frequently is necessary. However, I&#x27;m not quite sure how long these will last. They also smell (and look like-lol) Band-Aids!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do like them and hope to find some jazzier ones at a discount store.</li>
            <li> Application was easy.  It&#x27;s been more than a week, and they are still on my fingers.  I have smaller, shorter nails, and I constantly wash my hands.  There is a little wear on top, as expected.  The wraps were thin, and they feel light like actual polish.  I did not need to put top coat on top.  What helped me was I cleaned my nails with rubbing alcohol, pushed cuticles back, and buffed the surfaces of the nails prior to application.  These worked better than the higher-priced Jamberry wraps for me.</li>
            <li> I just bought these &amp; they were super easy to put on, they fit my nails pretty spot on &amp; were very easy to file off the excess. I read the other reviews &amp; other than not knowing how long these will last me, i don&#x27;t see what the other reviewers are saying. the sizes are great &amp; there&#x27;s different ones to choose from to fit your nails, i don&#x27;t feel like they are too thick, my nails look super cute &amp; they took me about 10 mins! i have no bubbles &amp; no problem filing them down smooth. I guess i&#x27;ll see how long these last.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt say I have odd sized nails, yet NONE of the non-thumb sized stickers were wide enough for 4 of my nails.  Bare nail hung out on the sides.  Not cute. Also they&#x27;re very thick and dont stretch and stick as nice as other products.  Sally Hansen for instance sticks very well and are thin and lay down flat.  Who would think that little Sally would be better than fancy Essie!</li>
            <li> These went on quite smoothly. Problem is that it was hard to file them down and when I applied a top coat over them they would get wrinkled in a spiderweb like pattern. I wish I didn&#x27;t put a top coat over them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get all of the terrible reviews for this product. I bought these to wear home for my nieces birthday party. Yes, they are not nail polish! NO, they aren&#x27;t a fast fix to not painting your nails. You have to take your time and follow the directions. You can&#x27;t just slap them on your nails and expect them to be perfect. I had  no issues with them wrinkling on my nail, but I also TOOK MY TIME! It is day number two and they still look perfect. I washed dishes, took a shower, and cleaned up dog pee yesterday, all with washing my hands multiple times. I do not see a problem with them. Yes, they will snag on things, but so will any nail decor you have on. It is a given. Don&#x27;t give bad reviews because you can&#x27;t take the time to slow down and put them on correctly. Thank you Essie for another great product!!!</li>
            <li> These must be the worst nail stickers/polish I have tried! my nails feel like a pound of polish is on them. Stick either Sally Hansen or Revlon. Total waste of a 1.00 and very disappointed in Essie.</li>
            <li> these suck.  I prefer the sally Hansen ones.  these were thick and oddly shaped on the sides.  the sally Hansen ones are curved on the sides and these are a straight line.  whose nails are that shape?  I had to use 2 per nail.  with the sally Hansen ones I can use one per nail.  I wont be buying these again.</li>
            <li> I applied these to my nails rather easily and they look beautiful. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with bubbling and I&#x27;m sure I can get 2 manicures from a pack. I just put them on so I&#x27;m not sure how long they will last, hopefully at least a week. By the way, don&#x27;t apply a clear coat over the top, it will damage them.</li>
            <li> I have had great luck with these. I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;ve been so bad for others. I always get over a week of wear from then and I&#x27;m hard on my nails. I have an infant so I wash my hands a lot and I&#x27;m constantly doing things that might chop polish. Polish never lasts a full day without chipping for me. I do get some tip wear with these after a few days but I just give my nails a little trim and it looks like I have a fresh manicure. They outsell off really even I want them to and unlike the Sally Hansen ones I don&#x27;t see any damage to my nail. I highly recommend giving these a try.</li>
            <li> I took my time to apply these, but they are really difficult to get on straight and ended up having wrinkles. They are way too thick and did not look cute anymore after all were put on.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping these were worth the $14 price tag. I applied them last night before bed, and they&#x27;re already coming off at the free edge at 11 am! I&#x27;ll stick to Sally Hansen Salon Effects, no pun intended!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other two reviewers.  I have tried Sally Hanson before and loved them.  It was true polish, shaped well to my nail, and lasted for months.  I got one nail done with the Essie brand and realized I wasn&#x27;t going to be happy with the end product.  The Essie brand is an actual sticker, not polish.  Once applied, I was not able to smooth sticker, it bubbled, and there was no way to easily remove the excess around the edges of my nail.  Although they are cute, I would skip these and go for the other brand!</li>
            <li> I actually bought these from Target. They are really beautiful in the package but really suck in reality. I really like the Incoco and OPI nail stickers because they are really easy to apply and last for almost two weeks. These stickers are really thick and tough to stretch over the nails (mine are mid-length). I also typically finish my strips off with a layer of clear topcoat. As these started peeling in 1-2 days, I tried this and the polish instantly wrinkled up on the nail and looked even worse. That&#x27;s $10 I&#x27;ll never get back :( I hope this review saves someone else some money!!</li>
            <li> I actually bought these from the dollar store and was terrifically amazed at how good there came out. I have short nails and kept them trimmed as the wrap wore off a bit with use. Everyone at work loved how they looked and I just took them off today. If I had not taken them off I&#x27;m sure they would have lasted longer if I had not wanted a change. I&#x27;m not sure why everyone else had so much trouble... I didn&#x27;t stretch any of mine, I just matched the nail sizes to mine. Easy peezy orange squeezy.</li>
            <li> Destroyed the surface of my nails!!!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased at Dollar Tree.&lt;br /&gt;Not shaped very well.&lt;br /&gt;Too small and had to piece.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of thick and weird-feeling, but went on fairly easily and lasted very well for two weeks with only some wear at the tips.&lt;br /&gt;Upon removing them, I found that the adhesive had actually eaten into the surface of my nails!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely intend to hold Essie responsible.&lt;br /&gt;Does this constitute a personal injury case?</li>
            <li> First time trying this product, i thought they were great! Aside from having to re-do one nail because of a bubble, they stayed on for a good amount of time and were easy to shape to my nail. Although you do have to take your time, it&#x27;s still a lot easier than painting your nails and cheaper than a real manicure- but just as cute.</li>
            <li> I love the way these look. But like the other reviewer was very disappointed once they were on. They are NOT nail polish like Sally Hanson and Incoco. They are too thick and felt weird on my nails. I also could not get them smoothed out properly at the edge and was catching my nails on my sweater all day. My right thumb had a wrinkle on application that I could not \\&quot;lift and pull\\&quot; like the other two brands to fix. After one day of wear I took them off. Too bad, as they look super classy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the bad reviews because these are awesome. Very easy to fit on my nails and extras don&#x27;t dry out so you can save them for another day. I&#x27;m on Day 3 and no lifting or peeling.  I have used sally Hanson in the past and the color fades quickly and the color comes off on the tips.  Will definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> You know when you were a kid and your parents bought you stickers and you wrapped them around your nail like nail polish designs? Well, it didnt look so good back then and these Essie nail stickers dont look so hot either. I had high hopes because I actually LOVE the sally hansen nail stickers, but these are far worse. I suppose its because you don&#x27;t need nail polish remover to get them off. You can just peel them off which shows. Anyhow, stay away. They look cheap. There are better nail stickers out there.</li>
            <li> These nail stickers are beautiful and easy to put on. With that being said, they certainly have their flaws. They don&#x27;t stay on long. They snag on everything because they are so thick and the edges never seem to file down quite smooth enough. The stones are also three dimensional and stick up from the applique so they tend to snag on clothes, especially sweaters. They peel off very easily so don&#x27;t even attempt to wash dishes or submerge your hands in any type of liquid. In short, they&#x27;re beautiful, but the quality just isn&#x27;t there. If you just want to wear them for a special occasion, they&#x27;re worth it...but for the long haul, you&#x27;re better off going with the Sally Hansen nail strips that are made of actual nail polish and last a week or more.</li>
            <li> Essie tried to match the success of sally Hansen and Incoco with their Sleek Sticks, BUT MISSED THE MARK!&lt;br /&gt;They were peeling off within 48 hours and were not as easy to manipulate as the brands mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;The syle with rhinestones and sparkle was awesome, but I will stick to Sally H and Incoco.  That was a complete waste of my time and my $10!</li>
            <li> I actually bought these for $1 at my local Dollar Tree.  I see why they are sold there because they arent that amazing.  Some of them work really well and others dont.  They dont apply smoothly at all, they almost look crinkled when they are actually on your nails.</li>
            <li> They are super cute on the first 2 days but unlike the Sally Hansen ones, they start to come off easily and start to crumple up if you have any dents in your nail bed...  Meh.  Youi have to think of them like an accessory to an outfit.</li>
