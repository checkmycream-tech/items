            <li>Perfect ......it works</li>
            <li>Perfect Image for not thinking of user safety.</li>
            <li>This is a great sample pack from Perfect Image.  </li>
            <li>I will say it is a great sample pack from Perfect Image.</li>
            <li>Great opportunity to test which best suits you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have the sample pack where I could try each of the chemical peels and see which one works for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this starter pack..</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m sure wish peels I will purchase and which works best.</li>
            <li>It has instructions and ingredients along with what each peel is good for.</li>
            <li>i loved the lactic acid..</li>
            <li>Products seem good though</li>
            <li>Each of them is good for 2-3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>but i think cellbone is way better!</li>
            <li>good collection of samples, but lacks more detailed &amp;#34;how to use&amp;#34; instructions.</li>
            <li>Love the face wash.</li>
            <li>ok peels</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s quite potent</li>
            <li>If you want to try there different range of peel products without having to buy each and every one of them, then this is the perfect sampler to go with.</li>
            <li>Love this collection.</li>
            <li>pretty good light peel</li>
            <li>As long as you know what you&#x27;re doing, these give AMAZING results!!  </li>
            <li>And with gel consistency it is not that easy to just pour the peel.</li>
            <li>Too little, but great for trying some out!</li>
            <li>Little acids that one can try- AWESOME idea!</li>
            <li>My skin was silky smooth.</li>
            <li>if you know what you&#x27;re doing, theses acids are really cool to work with..</li>
            <li>My face actually did not look too good a couple days after</li>
            <li>The good kthing is you get to try different ones before you buy full size.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin and prone to allergies, so testing the products before committing to buying a full size is very important for me.</li>
            <li>So far I have used the 50% lactic peel two times and I could use it one more time.</li>
            <li>This is a nice way to check out different types of products before committing to any one.</li>
            <li>I feel that the largest positive to this product is that it allows you to try out all the peels before committing to the full size product.</li>
            <li>I know the higher and more intense peels must come with very detail</li>
            <li>Enjoy this because it let me try so many different products at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC alternative to paying $60+ dollars for professional peels!</li>
            <li>well anyways, first thing is that my skin hasn&#x27;t felt smoother.</li>
            <li>Since there&#x27;s so many samples, read my individual assessment of each.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very risky</li>
            <li>HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>it made me peel and gave me new skin.. just gotta be careful to not peel every night and also wear really strong SPF till you renew your skin.</li>
            <li>I did however still like it, this gave me a way to test some new peels.</li>
            <li>I can only give a four star rating right now because I am only on my first bottle of peel.</li>
            <li>I do recommend reading instructions before using, especially if it&#x27;s your first time doing a peel.</li>
            <li>I love to try several different peels without committing to big size bottles.</li>
            <li>I love the opportunity to try several different peels without buying big size bottles.</li>
            <li>Less of the tca and ones that were more fluid</li>
            <li>This far I have tried the pineapple enzyme peel</li>
            <li>and they are more absorbed/more widely distributed on the cotton round (if that makes sense).</li>
            <li>It only came with one little postcard size bit of info on what each peel is and general instructions that is pretty much what I got from Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bottles are super tiny, didn&#x27;t expect them to be so small.</li>

            <li> but I do think now my pores look a little smaller.  </li>

            <li> Yay :-/</li>
            <li> The cleanser should be in a different container the consistency makes it difficult to get out of the teeny bottle it comes in.  </li>
            <li> But at least I know it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> I mean ever!</li>
            <li> have to give a two stars because people can mess up badly.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Too little, but great for trying some out!</li>
            <li> I can only give a four star rating right now because I am only on my first bottle of peel. So far I have used the 50% lactic peel two times and I could use it one more time. So I&#x27;m looking at I could use one bottle three times. I&#x27;m happy to have the sample pack where I could try each of the chemical peels and see which one works for me. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, it saves me a lot of money because I can now do my peels at home. I do recommend reading instructions before using, especially if it&#x27;s your first time doing a peel.</li>
            <li> This is a great sample pack from Perfect Image.  If you want to try there different range of peel products without having to buy each and every one of them, then this is the way to go.  Each bottle contains maybe 2 or 3 peels, enough to give you a feel for each peel.</li>
            <li> A Great way to see which product works for you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for about a month. I have some spots left over from a pregnancy mask. Yay :-/ well anyways, first thing is that my skin hasn&#x27;t felt smoother. I mean ever! And I think the spots are starting to break up. I know this will take quite awhile but I&#x27;ve tried almost everything except laser treatment. I&#x27;ll post in another couple months.</li>
            <li> I feel that the largest positive to this product is that it allows you to try out all the peels before committing to the full size product.</li>
            <li> It has instructions and ingredients along with what each peel is good for. I have used 3 peels, they burned so I left on for only 1-2 minutes. My skin was silky smooth. I thought the pinapple enzym would be safest so I left it on for 5 minutes and when I used a washcloth to get it off a few patches of skin came off. I&#x27;m hoping to fully heal in a week but will try each treatment for 1-2 minutes and if need be do multiple mini treatments. I also use an Amazon purchased boar hair brush and I expect to get 5+ treatments per bottle! I would def recommend using a brush and not a cotton pad. I only use 4 drops and dip the tips of the brush in a dish with serum.</li>
            <li> Perfect ......it works</li>
            <li> if you know what you&#x27;re doing, theses acids are really cool to work with.. i loved the lactic acid.. it made me peel and gave me new skin.. just gotta be careful to not peel every night and also wear really strong SPF till you renew your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this starter pack.. Now I&#x27;m sure wish peels I will purchase and which works best.</li>
            <li> Bottles are super tiny, didn&#x27;t expect them to be so small. Products seem good though but for $30 I thought they&#x27;d be a little bigger. Love the face wash.</li>
            <li> Enjoy this because it let me try so many different products at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Little acids that one can try- AWESOME idea! You guys ROCK!</li>
            <li> good collection of samples, but lacks more detailed &amp;#34;how to use&amp;#34; instructions.</li>
            <li> ok peels but i think cellbone is way better! The good kthing is you get to try different ones before you buy full size. I will say my fav out of this pack was the 50% Lacti acid... pretty good light peel and it works</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was leaking when it arrived.  The cleanser should be in a different container the consistency makes it difficult to get out of the teeny bottle it comes in.  This far I have tried the pineapple enzyme peel and it&#x27;s quite potent I burned my face in a couple spots! But at least I know it&#x27;s working.  My face actually did not look too good a couple days after but I do think now my pores look a little smaller.  4 stars for the ability to sample the various peels.</li>
            <li> Since there&#x27;s so many samples, read my individual assessment of each.  As for this sample pack, it&#x27;s well packaged.  I&#x27;m super disappointed it didn&#x27;t come with detail instruction.  I had to do research on each from the various amazon description/reviews/website for all the tips and caution/warnings since I didn&#x27;t want to burn my skin.  I wish it came with all the instruction for each individual ones.  I know the higher and more intense peels must come with very detail instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very risky they didn&#x27;t include the instructions.  It only came with one little postcard size bit of info on what each peel is and general instructions that is pretty much what I got from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to give a two stars because people can mess up badly.  Tsk tsk Perfect Image for not thinking of user safety.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC alternative to paying $60+ dollars for professional peels! As long as you know what you&#x27;re doing, these give AMAZING results!!  HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> I love to try several different peels without committing to big size bottles. Because there are no directions in the package, you can damage your skin. I will say it is a great sample pack from Perfect Image. If you want to try there different range of peel products without having to buy each and every one of them, then this is the perfect sampler to go with. I have tried all of them and the only one that I do not like is the Pineapple Pumpkin Enzyme Peel because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this collection. Great opportunity to test which best suits you.</li>
            <li> This is a nice way to check out different types of products before committing to any one. However, because of a lack of directions in the package, you can do some damage to your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to see how these work</li>
            <li> This really is a tiny sample pack. I got 2 MAYBE 3 peels out of this vial size. Less of the tca and ones that were more fluid and they are more absorbed/more widely distributed on the cotton round (if that makes sense). So it was eeally just enough to see how your skin tolerates them and the immediate effects. No chance at seeing results over time. I did however still like it, this gave me a way to test some new peels. The TCA , enzyme and salicylic acids are my favorites for my cystic acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I love the opportunity to try several different peels without buying big size bottles. I have a sensitive skin and prone to allergies, so testing the products before committing to buying a full size is very important for me. This sample pack has 6 different peels in glass bottles with droppers. Each of them is good for 2-3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be the length of droppers: they are a bit too short to extract the entire content of bottles. And with gel consistency it is not that easy to just pour the peel.</li>
