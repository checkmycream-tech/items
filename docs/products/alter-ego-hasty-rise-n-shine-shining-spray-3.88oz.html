            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>(get the shipment to the seller FAST) and keep you happy. :-)</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Great smell with intense shine.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Great shine doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair, love it!</li>
            <li>This product has a light fragrance which isn&#x27;t overly scented or strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, lasts long, smells good, and leaves my hair shiny and looking heathy.</li>
            <li>A must have, worth every cent!</li>
            <li>I thought it contained alcohol because it had a unique smell, so I put it on my hair product shelf.  </li>
            <li>It sat for 2.5 years, and then I pulled it out one day, did research on the ingredients--mainly the first three ingredients--and was satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I miss the purple top -- this one is definitely different, but ok!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain you&#x27;ll be pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and since i ran out, i miss it so much.</li>
            <li>Love this product, but it goes fast.</li>
            <li>I am VERY--I repeat--VERY particular about what I put in my hair, so I did research on the ingredients that the product is made of and was pleased.  </li>
            <li>Great shine and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
            <li>It creates an awesome shine and by far does NOT weigh the hair down and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It may be a bit costly, but it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This is better than oil sheen because it is not heavy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>a five!&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived exactly as selected and was SHIPPED phenomenally quick.</li>
            <li>I refuse to use any other product after Hasty Lux bright &amp; shine glossing spray.</li>
            <li>I am back to order two more bottles.</li>
            <li>I actually just really love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate being able to receive a product shortly after online purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really serves the purpose well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s highly concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>and i had to give up on returning it and getting new one, too much hassle.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot at all and it lasts a long time while creating a unique sheen to the hair shaft.  </li>
            <li>and this contributes to the drying, so spraying a little of this product on my hair before AND after heat styling does helps my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I then curl and after I wrap my hair for bed, I spray a little more.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that isn&#x27;t heavy, doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering odor, and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>love it but only use a little or too oily really makes the hair shine</li>
            <li>This is exactly what my hair needs especially when wrapping at night or unwrapping in the am.</li>
            <li>It is so light weight on my hair and does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>The bottle is large and should last me AWHILE!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and keep your hair shiny and not over glossed.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>have thin color treated hair and this product gives me great shine without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>light  and adds a subtle shine without looking like doll hair weave.</li>

            <li> Will definitely purchase again because I can&#x27;t get the other one anymore.</li>
            <li> It left my hair with a lot of shine, but it was not weighted down.  </li>
            <li> Any hair spray when overly-used can weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday as it can weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I emphasize on using A LITTLE of this spray...</li>
            <li> I spray a little to my hair while it is damp</li>
            <li> but it is not to be used with a heavy hand.  </li>
            <li> that amazon has it because few stores sell it and</li>
            <li> My hair has a naturally dull-brown color so even with moisturizing, conditioning and sprays it&#x27;s difficult to keep a long-lasting shine.</li>
            <li> just a few spritzes will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Feels and looks heavy on my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have relatively thin hair</li>
            <li> I am not too crazy for the scent, but if want shine without the heavy build up like an oil sheen, try this.</li>
            <li> This is a product that was difficult to find in hair salons and beauty supply stores.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read the reviews and I bought this product. It gave me good results and nice smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this one time and i ran out. I am back to order two more bottles. This product is the best thing i have ever used to give my hair shine. It does so much more than that. I love the smell and since i ran out, i miss it so much. A must have, worth every cent!</li>
            <li> It does shine...but it is not to be used with a heavy hand.  Feels and looks heavy on my thin hair.  The bottle is large and should last me AWHILE! smells good too.</li>
            <li> really serves the purpose well</li>
            <li> This is a great product that isn&#x27;t heavy, doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering odor, and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. I plan on keeping this in my cabinet. It&#x27;s a very nice product.</li>
            <li> Great experience with this glossing spray. It left my hair with a lot of shine, but it was not weighted down.  I have relatively thin hair and I am in the process of transitioning from a perm.  Very light and pleasant smell.  Great purchase and it was actually cheaper than my local Dominican salon (even with shipping!)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite glossing spray from Alter EGO. It&#x27;s not heavy and keep your hair shiny and not over glossed.  And it smells good.</li>
            <li> Love the product.Light sheen with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> My beautician used this on my hair, and since then, I had to have it. It is well worth the money spent. It gives the hair a great shine, not too oily and even better, it smells great. Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> love it but only use a little or too oily really makes the hair shine</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found that will add shine, and remove the frizz but will not build up. Also, everywhere I go people ask what perfume I am wearing because of the wonderful scent this product has. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my hair needs especially when wrapping at night or unwrapping in the am. I don&#x27;t use it everyday as it can weigh your hair down. I use it every 3 days or when I think my hair is lacking shine. Oh and it smells so good too!!!</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a hair type, and this stuff works so well.  It creates an awesome shine and by far does NOT weigh the hair down and is not greasy.  I am VERY--I repeat--VERY particular about what I put in my hair, so I did research on the ingredients that the product is made of and was pleased.  It may be a bit costly, but it is worth the money.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot at all and it lasts a long time while creating a unique sheen to the hair shaft.  Try it . . . I&#x27;m certain you&#x27;ll be pleased.  A stylist used this on my hair about three years ago in Rhode Island, and I purchased a bottle for about $18 (it hurt to pay that after paying for the hairdo I must say).  I thought it contained alcohol because it had a unique smell, so I put it on my hair product shelf.  It sat for 2.5 years, and then I pulled it out one day, did research on the ingredients--mainly the first three ingredients--and was satisfied.  I plan to keep this product on my shelf and use it.</li>
            <li> I was using the Lux bright and shine with that lavender top and I absolutely loved it. Now that they changed to this different bottle that is smaller it&#x27;s ok. Will definitely purchase again because I can&#x27;t get the other one anymore. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Gives hair shine without any weight on hair .</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product. Not greasy&lt;br /&gt;Very light  and adds a subtle shine without looking like doll hair weave.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is so light weight on my hair and does not weigh it down. I spray this on and just go!!! love this product and soo thnakful that amazon has it because few stores sell it and the ones that actually ave it, aways sell out.</li>
            <li> So I tried this product out after reading a bunch of great reviews. My hair has a naturally dull-brown color so even with moisturizing, conditioning and sprays it&#x27;s difficult to keep a long-lasting shine. But I&#x27;ve found that this product IN COMBINATION with the Alter Ego garlic conditioner and revitalizing leave-in lotion does give my hair the moisture and balanced, light-weight sheen &amp; texture. I often use a lot of heat on my hair (dryer, ceramic irons, etc.) and this contributes to the drying, so spraying a little of this product on my hair before AND after heat styling does helps my hair look shiny and healthy. I emphasize on using A LITTLE of this spray...just a few spritzes will do the trick. It&#x27;s highly concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much. Any hair spray when overly-used can weigh the hair down. SO again i say, use sparingly and you&#x27;ll enjoy it! It smells great too!</li>
            <li> I like the shine it gives to my hair plus the smell.  I love it.</li>
            <li> i always use this because its very light and not oily</li>
            <li> Finally found this item on Amazon. My stylist used it and she couldn&#x27;t remember where it was from. Smells amazing and is light weight so it doesn&#x27;t make the hair oily looking or feeling. I actually just really love the way it smells. Like hair perfume.</li>
            <li> I miss the purple top -- this one is definitely different, but ok!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  The shine is unbeleivable and it smells great.  Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! I spray a little to my hair while it is damp and then I wrap and sit under the dryer. I then curl and after I wrap my hair for bed, I spray a little more. This is better than oil sheen because it is not heavy. I am not too crazy for the scent, but if want shine without the heavy build up like an oil sheen, try this.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Great shine and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> This is a product that was difficult to find in hair salons and beauty supply stores. I&#x27;m rating this product a five!&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived exactly as selected and was SHIPPED phenomenally quick. I really appreciate being able to receive a product shortly after online purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin color treated hair and this product gives me great shine without weighing it down. This product has a light fragrance which isn&#x27;t overly scented or strong. I will definitely purchase from this seller again because they know how to handle their business (get the shipment to the seller FAST) and keep you happy. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about the products I put in my hair due to some hair products being to heavy and never lasting. When I went to a hair salon, the beautician used this product on my hair and I fell in love with it. It&#x27;s very light, lasts long, smells good, and leaves my hair shiny and looking heathy. I refuse to use any other product after Hasty Lux bright &amp; shine glossing spray. This product should be rated #1 on the hair beauty list. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but it goes fast. Now I see why my salon is so stingy when they use it on my hair. Beautiful shine. I&#x27;ve already reordered. Word to the wise: Buy 2</li>
            <li> Great shine doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair, love it!</li>
            <li> Product is great, I&#x27;ve used it before but the spray pump is defective and i had to give up on returning it and getting new one, too much hassle.</li>
            <li> Great smell with intense shine. Perfect for use throughout the day! Great travel size and would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love Ego Hasty Rise N Shine Shining Spray. I purchased it before. It smells amazing and leaves your hair with a wonderful shine.</li>
