    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>this stuff is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;m very happy with this and have been using it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s perfect for spiking</li>
            <li>Have bought this 3 times now as it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Excellent hold on your hair that is not too spikey...</li>
            <li>, so it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li>Its hold isnt too great</li>
            <li>It works and smells great.  </li>
            <li>It has great holding power.  </li>
            <li>but if you like the textured, re-adjustable kind of wax, this is awesome stuff.</li>
            <li>Great product, smells good, and has great hold.</li>
            <li>After I finished that one, I tried another Gatsby product but found myself wanting to buy more of the perfect hold wax.</li>
            <li>The price is nice too!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and excellent</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It has a good texture and easy to wash off</li>
            <li>And i finally found Gatsby perfect hold wax...</li>
            <li>From the Gatsby products I have used, I like the more liquidy type as that was easier to apply (so I thought).</li>
            <li>I will order some more</li>
            <li>And I LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these hair &amp;#34;waxes&amp;#34; although I wouldn&#x27;t call it a wax consistency as it is more of a cream.  </li>
            <li>I once was able to go 3 days without washing or reapplying and just refreshed with water to reshspe...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many gatsby product</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Lasts for many hours.</li>
            <li>It still doesnt hold as well as my got-2-be invincible hair gel, but it does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>perfect for long trips or camping!  </li>
            <li>this washes out easy.</li>
            <li>You can comb your hair again even hours after applying, without the product flaking and falling off, it doesn&#x27;t melt when you sweat like gel and hair sprays, it does smell pretty nice, and it doesn&#x27;t stink if you sweat.</li>
            <li>guess its good for styling, but I wouldnt buy this again when their are other, cheaper and more effective options out there.</li>
            <li>F&#x27;king right : )</li>
            <li>I dare say, it&#x27;s the best Japanese import since Japanese porn,</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my hair super tacky and I can still brush my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li>It holds your hair very well in the style you want because its easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Extra strong may be a better description, but the hair is still super pliable when this stuff is in.  </li>
            <li>all these products do exactly as they claim to!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have that strong a hold,but for a casual look this wax is the best.</li>
            <li>I give it 5 stars only because my son buys the stuff with his own $$$.</li>
            <li>it smells pretty nice too, like you just stepped out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Very good, if you have thin hair like me, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and not sticky like typical hair wax.</li>
            <li>the product still works but the hold isnt strong enough for me.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as the Moving Rubber from the same maker.</li>
            <li>And you dont need much, dime sized amount works wonders, and it holds your hair in place ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>and you dont get much out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Comparable to Shu Emura but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>What my son wants.</li>
            <li>Great value as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It is matte without a powder residue but it would be nice if there was just a small hint of shine in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>This is not really a wax; it is a putty/cream and not all that strong holding either.</li>
            <li>Not so much in appearance in the jar, but as a styling wax they are nearly equivalent.</li>
            <li>but it is extremely baby fine and</li>
            <li>It also is a more soft hold in the sense that my hair isn&#x27;t stiff, which I like a lot.</li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t like this at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, last all day, at least in my hair, my hair is from 2\\&quot; to 3 1/2\\&quot; long.</li>
            <li>Driving with the car window down totally ruined my hair when I used this stuff, but I was able to get in front of a mirror and fix it in 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good price and the same product I get from a retail store, only it&#x27;s a few $ cheaper!</li>
            <li>Only thing great about this product is the smell, but dont get me wrong</li>
            <li>but you dont need that much, just scrap some with your thumbnail and that should be enough.</li>
            <li>For straight long hair such as mine, this product is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting to much because of the price,but was surprised to see it work</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t personally use it, but there must be some reason he sticks with this particular brand.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know about curly hair, or fine hair, but if you have thick straight hair and feel my pain, look no further.</li>
            <li>That is just about the only suggestion I have so far.  </li>
            <li>I was actually quite surprised that this stuff held my hair in place with about 80% efficiacy over the course of a 12 hour period, which included me running on the treadmill and sweating profusely.  </li>
            <li>He keeps his hair short and wants the hair upright, not laying down.</li>

            <li> have been using this product for quiet long no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I recommend the grey moving rubber for a stronger hold.</li>
            <li> I have VERY STRAIGHT, VERY THICK hair and NOTHING worked.</li>
            <li> After using it once or twice I left it alone until I finished all of my other Gatsby products (had the pink, green, and grey ones).</li>
            <li> I purchased the formula for short, meddium, and heavy hold</li>
            <li> The pink &amp;#34;Moving Rubber&amp;#34; is stronger.</li>
            <li> And unlike the other Gatsby products (the pink, green, blue, and purple round ones)</li>
            <li> Like the other people have posted here, this isn&#x27;t an &amp;#34;extra hard&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I thought the &#x27;extra hard&#x27; meant extra hard.  </li>
            <li> the only way i can describe it is it has the texture consistency of sumo tech with the hold power of crew Fiber, holds better than sumo without the shine and doesnt leave your hair thick with crap like Fiber does..</li>
            <li> Works well, not too heavily fragranced or sticky, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> It holds well with the least amount compared to any other Gatsby hair product I have used.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair stiff</li>
            <li> Yes it comes with very little product</li>
            <li> This thing is hard to find.</li>
            <li> It works well as a styling wax, but it isn&#x27;t very hard.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I thought the &#x27;extra hard&#x27; meant extra hard.  It works well as a styling wax, but it isn&#x27;t very hard.  I also got the Moving Rubber &#x27;Spiky edge&#x27;, and these two products are VERY similar.  Not so much in appearance in the jar, but as a styling wax they are nearly equivalent.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It holds your hair very well in the style you want because its easy to work with. Yes it comes with very little product but you dont need that much, just scrap some with your thumbnail and that should be enough. overall 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> I have VERY STRAIGHT, VERY THICK hair and NOTHING worked. Bumble and bumble sumo tech/ sumo wax, redken for men, amer crew., bed head for men, aveda list goes on, ive tried almost every type of wax/paste/clay out there form $6-$30. And i finally found Gatsby perfect hold wax...the only way i can describe it is it has the texture consistency of sumo tech with the hold power of crew Fiber, holds better than sumo without the shine and doesnt leave your hair thick with crap like Fiber does.. this stuff is PERFECT. And you dont need much, dime sized amount works wonders, and it holds your hair in place ALL DAY. i don&#x27;t know about curly hair, or fine hair, but if you have thick straight hair and feel my pain, look no further.</li>
            <li> Very good, if you have thin hair like me, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t like this at first. From the Gatsby products I have used, I like the more liquidy type as that was easier to apply (so I thought). After using it once or twice I left it alone until I finished all of my other Gatsby products (had the pink, green, and grey ones). After that I started using this product. It holds well with the least amount compared to any other Gatsby hair product I have used. It also is a more soft hold in the sense that my hair isn&#x27;t stiff, which I like a lot. After I finished that one, I tried another Gatsby product but found myself wanting to buy more of the perfect hold wax.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for quiet long no complaints at all. I will order some more</li>
            <li> This product works well!</li>
            <li> For straight long hair such as mine, this product is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting to much because of the price,but was surprised to see it work so well!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have that strong a hold,but for a casual look this wax is the best.</li>
            <li> This thing is hard to find. My friend recommended it and before I realized it&#x27;s on Amazon, I had to go to specialty Japanese stores around NYC to find this. That said, I&#x27;m very happy with this and have been using it for 3 years now. It&#x27;s not greasy, not overly sticky, a tiny bit holds a lot and gives texture and volume. And I LOVE the smell. I get a lot of compliments from girls about how it smells. And unlike the other Gatsby products (the pink, green, blue, and purple round ones) this washes out easy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these hair &amp;#34;waxes&amp;#34; although I wouldn&#x27;t call it a wax consistency as it is more of a cream.  I purchased the formula for short, meddium, and heavy hold so I can transition from one to another as my hair grows out.  I have a lot of hair but it is extremely baby fine and all these products do exactly as they claim to!  I have tried several dozen products and none have come close to the workability or usability as this.  It is matte without a powder residue but it would be nice if there was just a small hint of shine in my opinion.  That is just about the only suggestion I have so far.  The fragrance is light and pleasant.  I once was able to go 3 days without washing or reapplying and just refreshed with water to reshspe...perfect for long trips or camping!  Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many gatsby product but I gotta say I am not impress with this one. Its hold isnt too great and you dont get much out of the bottle. Only thing great about this product is the smell, but dont get me wrong the product still works but the hold isnt strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> Good price and the same product I get from a retail store, only it&#x27;s a few $ cheaper!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, last all day, at least in my hair, my hair is from 2\\&quot; to 3 1/2\\&quot; long. You can comb your hair again even hours after applying, without the product flaking and falling off, it doesn&#x27;t melt when you sweat like gel and hair sprays, it does smell pretty nice, and it doesn&#x27;t stink if you sweat. It makes your hair stiff so it&#x27;s perfect for spiking, it doesn&#x27;t make the hair stick together, unless you want it to. In case anyone is wondering it doesn&#x27;t make your hair shiny. I dare say, it&#x27;s the best Japanese import since Japanese porn, F&#x27;king right : )</li>
            <li> Received quickly. Works well, not too heavily fragranced or sticky, not too heavy. Comparable to Shu Emura but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It works and smells great.  It has great holding power.  It doesn&#x27;t clump up.  You don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot.  Lasts for many hours.</li>
            <li> This is not really a wax; it is a putty/cream and not all that strong holding either. I don&#x27;t see the \\&quot;extra hard\\&quot; feature in this product.</li>
            <li> It has a good texture and easy to wash off and it holds the style but in big amounts. The price should be around 7 to 9 dollars.</li>
            <li> Have bought this 3 times now as it works perfectly. Excellent hold on your hair that is not too spikey...ie not jersey shorish.&lt;br /&gt;Also it smells pretty nice too, like you just stepped out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as the Moving Rubber from the same maker. The pink &amp;#34;Moving Rubber&amp;#34; is stronger.</li>
            <li> I was actually quite surprised that this stuff held my hair in place with about 80% efficiacy over the course of a 12 hour period, which included me running on the treadmill and sweating profusely.  It still doesnt hold as well as my got-2-be invincible hair gel, but it does a pretty good job.  The downfall is whenever I touch my hair it feels like slime or slippery moldable wax.  There is no extra hard-ness to this product.  Extra strong may be a better description, but the hair is still super pliable when this stuff is in.  Driving with the car window down totally ruined my hair when I used this stuff, but I was able to get in front of a mirror and fix it in 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess its good for styling, but I wouldnt buy this again when their are other, cheaper and more effective options out there.</li>
            <li> Holds well without making your hair have a greasy look. Smells nice and not sticky like typical hair wax. The price is nice too!</li>
            <li> Great product, smells good, and has great hold. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair super tacky and I can still brush my fingers through my hair. Of course after you style it, if you want extra hold, you will need to use hair spray but if you like the textured, re-adjustable kind of wax, this is awesome stuff. Great value as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Like the other people have posted here, this isn&#x27;t an &amp;#34;extra hard&amp;#34;  product. The effect is gone after an hour for me. I recommend the grey moving rubber for a stronger hold.</li>
            <li> Same stuff I get at Mitsuwa, so it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> What my son wants. I give it 5 stars only because my son buys the stuff with his own $$$. I don&#x27;t personally use it, but there must be some reason he sticks with this particular brand. He keeps his hair short and wants the hair upright, not laying down. Not my style, but he likes it.</li>
