    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A nice, light scent for warmer weather. Lasts well without being overpowering. I&#x27;ve been a fan of, &#x27;In Red&#x27; and next I&#x27;ll try, &#x27;In Black&#x27;.</li>
            <li> First of all Amazon saved me a great deal of MONEY on this purchase! I went to mall other day and everywhere i saw this cologne i was told $49.99 retail price! Lying PUNKS! Got on Amazon and it cost me 15 BUCKS! Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, This is a great smelling cologne if you enjoy that citrusy smell. I wear it almost everyday and i get ton of compliments. Its totally competes with Dolce and Gabbana. Only bad thing is the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long. Id say a good 6 hours max!  Bottom line is, with the price and the smell this is a Must buy!</li>
            <li> Many complements of this sent!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!!! Nothing but complements!!</li>
            <li> In Blue smells pretty nice.  The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last too long though.  The initial smell fades away into the smoother-calm smell within about 1 hr. I saw this at the mall and went and got it from amazon at a cheaper price.  Amazon is amazing. It has everything!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son and he likes it. The packaging was good. Fragrance is pleasant.  It&#x27;s not too strong and not to light that one has to use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> excelent,i love it!!!!</li>
            <li> bought these for my brother per his request. He really seems to like it. Even bought one for his friend.</li>
            <li> Anoother case of getting what you pay for.  Average cologne.  Not top shelf or what you buy at a high end store.  Avon type cologne.</li>
            <li> Love the scent -- smells really clean.  Not musky at all and it will get a woman&#x27;s attention.  I get complimented all the time when shopping.  Get it guys -- you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> The price was too good to pass up and I purchased two of them for my husband who wears this all the time.  Also, delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh smelling&lt;br /&gt;All brands have this eternity type version and this is it</li>
            <li> Great masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not good I want my money back</li>
            <li> Love this smell, nice and clean,  you can get a lot of decent men&#x27;s fragrance&#x27;s (in large amounts, 3.4oz or larger) at amazon. This is&lt;br /&gt;the only place I buy mine.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  The fragrance last all day on my husband.  Can&#x27;t miss with purchasing this as it almost smells like Armani.</li>
            <li> Like for so many of us \\&quot;Fragrance Shoppers\\&quot;, we tend to (from time to time) just stumble across that unpolished piece of coal in the vast diamond mine of established, usually EXPENSIVE, well-known scent gurus. Well let me save (hopefully) some people.... even if it&#x27;s just ONE person a lot of searching, debating, wondering and undo curiosity about what their next scent is going to be. If you\\&quot;re the type of person who cares even a little bit about your appearance, grooming habits and personal hygiene &#x3D; What kind of impression you make/leave !!! Then you DEFINITELY want to  aquire this line of really distinctive fragrances by, Ms. Ewen without delay and let your diamond shine.</li>
            <li> I like this cologne so much, great for the summer to make sure you&#x27;re not stinky  Update: I go through this cologne at least twice as fast as any other.</li>
            <li> I bought this in addition to the In Red that I have used before and I must say I have a daily dilemma , Is today a Blue or Red day. In Blue smells so good and I get compliments on it everyday I wear it. Definitely a must have and it helps a lot that its not overpriced</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It sticks for a long time.  My friend and I bought it on the same day.</li>
            <li> Best cologne ever smells so good and so cheap on here at the mall it&#x27;s about $60 absolutely satisfied with this cologne</li>
            <li> In Blue comes out of no where and smacks down the scent of a lifetime. All I want to do is go rent a Porsche and drive down the coast with the finest girl I don&#x27;t know. The scent isn&#x27;t found anywhere but online which sucks. I also liked The Black Version of In Blue. I will say I can&#x27;t wait til my next bottle. Just like Visa you shouldn&#x27;t leave your home without it.</li>
            <li> As the writer mention above me it is really just that good. I get compliments everywhere I go with this fragance. It may seem that the scent has disappeared after 20-30 minutes however the compliment will continue to come along during the day. For the price, it is a great value - it is the ultimate true sleeper scent for men!!!</li>
            <li> I got this to gift my brother and he loved it!! The fragrance was not too strong or too mild, but pleasant. Surely will recommend...</li>
