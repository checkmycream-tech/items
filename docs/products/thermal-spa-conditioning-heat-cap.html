    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>my hair felt so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good hat</li>
            <li>The heat is evenly distributed and the fit is great.</li>
            <li>After, it started to return but it was still a nice result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and he was thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>Rather than wearing a warm towel around my head for 2-hours, I read that wearing a heat cap would help speed up the setting process.</li>
            <li>I did try turning it around as another reviewer suggested but that kind of defeats the purpose of the product, I wanted something that would heat evenly all over.</li>
            <li>Conditioners, protein packs, etc are so much more effective when applied and covered with plastic and heat.  </li>
            <li>The heat cap itself is just okay.</li>
            <li>It is still better than having to lug my hooded dryer out.</li>
            <li>the hair is changed better.</li>
            <li>But ,  i believe it makes it better .</li>
            <li>It worked much better for me.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s ok on the sides and on top of my head.</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;ll get heat from 3/4 of the top part of the cap.</li>
            <li>but I wish one more was added</li>
            <li>Perhaps, it would have been a better product</li>
            <li>had it been designed to fit the shape of the head--a bonnet-style cap would have been much more effective.  </li>
            <li>The heat settings were pretty good</li>
            <li>At first I gave this a 4 star, but the more I use it, the more I love it.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;liner&#x27; is merely a cheap plastic cap.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about how warm this product got....not effective for deep conditioning AT ALL.</li>
            <li>But be sure you get the right conditioner.</li>
            <li>Apparently, some work needs to be done to make this product more effective.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, I&#x27;ll stick to hot towels until I find something better.</li>
            <li>If I had to describe how warm it got, I would suggest you sit on a chair for awhile, get up, and touch the back of your hand to the chair, or think about how warm your bed feels when you first get out of it in the morning.</li>
            <li>I got my heat cap SUPER FAST!!!</li>
            <li>It really does make conditioning a better experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been awhile.</li>
            <li>but it was too much to move around or to get comfortable with.</li>
            <li>I bought this for convience although I already own a big, bulky casket dryer</li>
            <li>I was expecting the cap to give me the same type of secure, adjustable fit of a bonnet hair dryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This heating cap was way better than the other available here or in the beauty supply houses.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s kind of small fit, if you want to use rollers that is.</li>
            <li>With this heating cap, I place a scarf around my edges and lay back with my favorite show and a snack.</li>
            <li>This is good though because you don&#x27;t want heat to escape, but at the same time, you have to roll them very high up on your head because the bottom back of the cap doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>This fit me pretty well; although I don&#x27;t use the protective liner because it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and shiny, and 100% de poofed.</li>
            <li>He said it worked exactly as the older model and was just what he needed.</li>
            <li>My head is 21 inches, in case anyone wants to reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I said, the sides and front heat up quite nicely, so much so that you will need to protect your ears from the heat.</li>
            <li>When I contacted the seller they confirmed that Mastex only makes one type of heating cap.  </li>
            <li>About 6 months ago the whole thing got dunked in water and stopped working, though I didn&#x27;t expect it would work after that.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cap thinking it was a better cap than the other one on Amazon for $19.99.  </li>
            <li>Because I am extremely allergic to the chemicals used in most hair dyes, I use a henna-based, color hair dye instead.</li>
            <li>Though the sides and front get hot, the back does not get hot</li>
            <li>/&gt;i prefer the texture of more fluffy like vaginsil.</li>
            <li>To make this work for me I had to pile all 2 1/2 feet of my oil slicked hair on top of my head which was not exactly easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for a new one.)</li>
            <li>I bought this a few years back to use with hot oil treatments for my baby fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>Only the top of it heats up (the back never did) not including the three or so inches where it connects to the back.</li>
            <li>Just gets a little above warm at the highest temperature and the back (nape)</li>
            <li>so you have to adjust it to get complete coverage.</li>
            <li>He had bought a different brand and was highly dissatisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>My hair grows kind of slow, but all the sudden, I have extra length</li>
            <li>Wear one of those thin plastic hair caps (the kind beauty stores sell in a package of 10 bonnets for 99 cents) and set your hair dryer at a low setting.</li>
            <li>The beauty shop owner I bought this for has been in business for over 40 years at this location and his old cap had finally quit working.  </li>
            <li>There is about 2-3 inches of non-heated space in the back, near the nape</li>
            <li>However, the cap was a tight fit for me and it did NOT come all the way down the sides or back of my head.</li>

            <li> The other one (black style) fit like some alien helmet and heating was not as even.</li>

            <li> Now I just use a bit of hair gel on my dry hair in the morning to pull out waves that get scrunched up over night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my head is small or something (I typically wear medium sized hats) but to get it near enough to my scalp to work I had to tighten it all the way</li>
            <li> Once per week with keratin or conditioner, and the other with a smoothing serum.</li>
            <li> And the weird shape of this thing makes it difficult to slide it backwards so that some of the heat from the top gets distributed to the back.   </li>
            <li> I will write another review on the product after a few weeks of using it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too bulky and stiff.</li>
            <li> I had to wrap a towel around that part of my neck to prevent my skin being rubbed raw.</li>
            <li> No more wetting and drenching in mousse to fight the crown of frizz effect that us wavy/curlies get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I think my hair is growing faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I purchased a defective product or not.</li>
            <li> But the cap is completely cold at the back.</li>
            <li> At this time I&#x27;m unable to share my opinion because I  have not had the opportunity to use the product.</li>
            <li> I was terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my hair felt so good.</li>
            <li> This fit me pretty well; although I don&#x27;t use the protective liner because it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. Without the liner plastic cap, the hair sets and dries. At first I gave this a 4 star, but the more I use it, the more I love it. I used the BKT from Organix, and my normally thick wavy hair stayed de poofed and de frizzed, and very soft, for nearly a week. After, it started to return but it was still a nice result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of small fit, if you want to use rollers that is. This is good though because you don&#x27;t want heat to escape, but at the same time, you have to roll them very high up on your head because the bottom back of the cap doesn&#x27;t get hot. Without rollers, there&#x27;s plenty of room, however. My head is 21 inches, in case anyone wants to reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. It really does make conditioning a better experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been awhile. I&#x27;ve been using the cap twice per week. Once per week with keratin or conditioner, and the other with a smoothing serum. My hair is super soft and shiny, and 100% de poofed. No more wetting and drenching in mousse to fight the crown of frizz effect that us wavy/curlies get. Now I just use a bit of hair gel on my dry hair in the morning to pull out waves that get scrunched up over night. I&#x27;m not sure, but I think my hair is growing faster. My hair grows kind of slow, but all the sudden, I have extra length and it isn&#x27;t stopping.</li>
            <li> I got my heat cap SUPER FAST!!! That I give a 5! The heat cap itself is just okay. It doesn&#x27;t heat in the back so you have to adjust it to get complete coverage. It is still better than having to lug my hooded dryer out. I just wish it heated up evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I purchased a defective product or not. Though the sides and front get hot, the back does not get hot AT ALL. I can feel the coils at the back so I know heat is supposed to be flowing through there. But the cap is completely cold at the back. And the weird shape of this thing makes it difficult to slide it backwards so that some of the heat from the top gets distributed to the back.   As I said, the sides and front heat up quite nicely, so much so that you will need to protect your ears from the heat. I&#x27;ve used this product weekly for a couple of months and I think I will give it away. Time to invest in a counter-top steamer or some such product.</li>
            <li> Every head of hair needs one of these.  Conditioners, protein packs, etc are so much more effective when applied and covered with plastic and heat.  It cuts the time necessary to wait for the conditioner to work as well.  I would never be without this cap.</li>
            <li> This product works also same as treatment in the hair salon. I know that it is not easy to see fast the hair is changed better. But ,  i believe it makes it better .</li>
            <li> The beauty shop owner I bought this for has been in business for over 40 years at this location and his old cap had finally quit working.  He had bought a different brand and was highly dissatisfied with it.  He uses it to set color in the hair of his clients.  I bought him this one and he was thrilled with it.  He said it worked exactly as the older model and was just what he needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cap thinking it was a better cap than the other one on Amazon for $19.99.  These are the same cap!  This seller has a different picture than the other seller.  When I contacted the seller they confirmed that Mastex only makes one type of heating cap.  I gave this one three stars because I feel that this should never have happened on Amazon.  I will write another review on the product after a few weeks of using it.  So save yourself 10.00 bucks.</li>
            <li> Because I am extremely allergic to the chemicals used in most hair dyes, I use a henna-based, color hair dye instead. Rather than wearing a warm towel around my head for 2-hours, I read that wearing a heat cap would help speed up the setting process. I receive the cap in a timely fashion. It functioned properly. However, the cap was a tight fit for me and it did NOT come all the way down the sides or back of my head. I was terribly disappointed. I was expecting the cap to give me the same type of secure, adjustable fit of a bonnet hair dryer. I did not care for the chin strap at all. I would recommend instead that you purchase either a bonnet hair dryer or the \\&quot;Belson\\&quot; jet bonnet hair attachment (matte gold style). Wear one of those thin plastic hair caps (the kind beauty stores sell in a package of 10 bonnets for 99 cents) and set your hair dryer at a low setting. It worked much better for me.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like it. it&#x27;s too bulky and stiff. and the heat is not distributed well.&lt;br /&gt;i prefer the texture of more fluffy like vaginsil.</li>
            <li> I thought this product got a  lot warmer than it actually does.If I had to describe how warm it got, I would suggest you sit on a chair for awhile, get up, and touch the back of your hand to the chair, or think about how warm your bed feels when you first get out of it in the morning. That&#x27;s about how warm this product got....not effective for deep conditioning AT ALL.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good hat but it doesn&#x27;t heat in the back, it&#x27;s ok on the sides and on top of my head.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:1938686462 Reflections of Mamie - A Story of Survival]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This heating cap was way better than the other available here or in the beauty supply houses.  The heat is evenly distributed and the fit is great. The other one (black style) fit like some alien helmet and heating was not as even. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. But be sure you get the right conditioner.</li>
            <li> At this time I&#x27;m unable to share my opinion because I  have not had the opportunity to use the product. I&#x27;m still waiting on the instructions.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years back to use with hot oil treatments for my baby fine straight hair. It only sort of works. Only the top of it heats up (the back never did) not including the three or so inches where it connects to the back. So you&#x27;ll get heat from 3/4 of the top part of the cap. To make this work for me I had to pile all 2 1/2 feet of my oil slicked hair on top of my head which was not exactly easy. I don&#x27;t know if my head is small or something (I typically wear medium sized hats) but to get it near enough to my scalp to work I had to tighten it all the way but when I did this the plastic corners in the back jabbed into the back of my neck and they hurt! I had to wrap a towel around that part of my neck to prevent my skin being rubbed raw. I did try turning it around as another reviewer suggested but that kind of defeats the purpose of the product, I wanted something that would heat evenly all over. The heat settings were pretty good but I wish one more was added, I ended up switching between the low and medium settings to get a temperature that worked for my hair treatments. About 6 months ago the whole thing got dunked in water and stopped working, though I didn&#x27;t expect it would work after that. I haven&#x27;t replaced it and I don&#x27;t plan to. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, I&#x27;ll stick to hot towels until I find something better.</li>
            <li> Apparently, some work needs to be done to make this product more effective.  The heating elements work fine, but the design is flawed.  Perhaps, it would have been a better product had it been designed to fit the shape of the head--a bonnet-style cap would have been much more effective.  The &#x27;liner&#x27; is merely a cheap plastic cap.  Expedient customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.  Performance is just so so.  Just gets a little above warm at the highest temperature and the back (nape) doesn&#x27;t heat at all.  I&#x27;ll keep it (I have to turn it around to hit all the spots on my head) but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.  I suspect it won&#x27;t last too long either (probably 6 months I&#x27;ll be looking for a new one.)</li>
            <li> Some of these reviews would discourage a shopper from buying this and almost did the same to me. There is about 2-3 inches of non-heated space in the back, near the nape but I didn&#x27;t find it to be a big deal. If you flip the cap around to where the nape is in the front, your entire head will be covered by heat. I bought this for convience although I already own a big, bulky casket dryer but it was too much to move around or to get comfortable with. With this heating cap, I place a scarf around my edges and lay back with my favorite show and a snack. I gave it 4 stars because I shouldn&#x27;t have to wear it backwards lol.</li>
