            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has a much better price than my salon.</li>
            <li>This is a MUCH better deal through Amazon.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than just pretty good...</li>
            <li>Smell preferences are very personal and this shampoo smells very pleasant to me.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is good for cleaning, without using too much.  </li>
            <li>, I recommend this one for gals who like me, have fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is color-treated, fine</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>My hair gets clean and has volume after washing.</li>
            <li>I love the whole kenra line.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for fine, limp hair, you have body that lasts through the day!</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is the only kind my husband will use.</li>
            <li>very satisfied....received quickly</li>
            <li>I never get an oily buildup and my hair is light ans soft.  </li>
            <li>I have had it all of my life, and I have never been able to find a shampoo and conditioner that would ACTUALLY give my hair volume, make it soft, and make it healthy without weighing it down...</li>
            <li>Due to this, boosting volume is my number one priority, even more so than color maintenance.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older my hair has gotten thinner and this shampoo gives it volume.</li>

            <li>This product is a guaranteed  winner if you have normal hair.</li>
            <li>so it gets weighted down easily.</li>
            <li>I have tons of baby fine hair previously losted it&#x27;s fullness quite rapidly,but with the Kenra Volume Shampoo, my hair does not lose it fullness or shape.</li>
            <li>, I wish the price was better and hard to find sometimes...</li>
            <li>Also get compliments on my hair asking if I just went to get my hair done by a professional.</li>
            <li>The only negative that I can say about this product is that the scent is like Peach Rings candy, and I don&#x27;t really like my hair smelling sweet like that.</li>
            <li>I have fine but thick hair, this spray holds my hair in place without feeling sticky.</li>

            <li> The day I used it, my hair had volume and cooperated with the styling process in a way it had not done for a long time.</li>
            <li> So, I made the decision to go back to Kenra once the supermarket shampoo was empty.</li>
            <li> Kenra&#x27;s Volumizing shampo works wonders on my thick straight hair.  </li>
            <li> However, I still had a little Kenra left.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to wash my hair every other day.  </li>
            <li> I had used a lot of products cheap and very expensive.  </li>
            <li> It can be used every day, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li> Your hair isn&#x27;t dried out and it has shine, which I noticed that with other products it doesn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li> Quite expensive at salons, which is the only place locally we can buy it.  </li>
            <li> I also do not need to use a conditioner after shampooing, I have a few tangles but very little hair loss compared to other products.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Kenra Volumizing shampoo and conditioner combo a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> As we know ladies, we all need to change shampoos for a couple of weeks every few months.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little as my hair is a medium length.</li>
            <li> I used it faithfully for years before deciding it was too expensive and moved to a cheaper, supermarket shampoo.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only brand of hair products I use, based on a recommendation from a beautician.</li>
            <li> Received shampoo in a timely manner and am very happy with the company and the shampoo</li>
            <li> I love the whole kenra line. Their stuff rocks my socks off!!! I literally would be a giant ball of frizz without this miracle product!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, limp hair. I have had it all of my life, and I have never been able to find a shampoo and conditioner that would ACTUALLY give my hair volume, make it soft, and make it healthy without weighing it down...until now. I ordered the Kenra Volumizing shampoo and conditioner combo a few weeks ago and I can already tell the difference! My hair is so healthy now, and my color and highlights look as good as ever!    The only negative that I can say about this product is that the scent is like Peach Rings candy, and I don&#x27;t really like my hair smelling sweet like that. I will probably try out Schwartzkopf hair products after my Kenra runs out, but until then, I am EXTREMELY happy with the product and recommend it to everyone!    Ladies with fine, baby hair, There is hope for us!!</li>

            <li> The Kenra Products deliver! This shampoo is great for fine, limp hair, you have body that lasts through the day! Your hair isn&#x27;t dried out and it has shine, which I noticed that with other products it doesn&#x27;t have.  It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of its vitality.  I don&#x27;t even need conditioner with this one, I recommend this one for gals who like me, have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  As I have gotten older my hair has gotten thinner and this shampoo gives it volume.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great. It is the only kind my husband will use. It makes your hair feel silky and adds volume. It can be used every day, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair. I highly recommend it. Amazon has a much better price than my salon.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen the volumizing I had hoped and  wanted..but it&#x27;s better than just pretty good...it does add some body to my hair.</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair! I use a cleansing shampoo in between the use Kenra.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Quite expensive at salons, which is the only place locally we can buy it.  This is a MUCH better deal through Amazon.</li>

            <li> Kenra&#x27;s Volumizing shampo works wonders on my thick straight hair.  Gives my hair a beautiful shine and volume.  I can&#x27;t wait to wash my hair every other day.  Also get compliments on my hair asking if I just went to get my hair done by a professional.</li>
            <li> Just what my wife wanted in a larger size.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo along with the volumizing conditioner for about a year now and it&#x27;s absolutely fabulous. My hair is color-treated, fine and I have a lot of it so it gets weighted down easily. Due to this, boosting volume is my number one priority, even more so than color maintenance. This shampoo does the trick. Smell preferences are very personal and this shampoo smells very pleasant to me. It also lathers well, even though it&#x27;s sulfate-free. My hair gets clean and has volume after washing. I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> a great product I have been this shampoo for many years over 10 years for sure, I wish the price was better and hard to find sometimes...</li>
            <li> I have issues with my hair being oily.  But not with this.  I never get an oily buildup and my hair is light ans soft.  I never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Kenra! I used it faithfully for years before deciding it was too expensive and moved to a cheaper, supermarket shampoo. However, I still had a little Kenra left. The day I used it, my hair had volume and cooperated with the styling process in a way it had not done for a long time. So, I made the decision to go back to Kenra once the supermarket shampoo was empty. It was very convenient to order it through Amazon, and it came on time and in perfect condition. Whoever packaged it took obvious care and pride in their work.</li>
            <li> I have fine but thick hair, this spray holds my hair in place without feeling sticky. Wind and rain can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Mess up your hair using this hair spray.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thinning hair.  I had used a lot of products cheap and very expensive.  I found this product gives me a lot of body and moisture.  I also do not need to use a conditioner after shampooing, I have a few tangles but very little hair loss compared to other products.  I will definitely be buying this again.  It takes very little as my hair is a medium length.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is good for cleaning, without using too much.  It&#x27;s pricier than I typically use, but it cleans well and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and a good price. The product was delivered very quickly and in good condition. This product is a guaranteed  winner if you have normal hair.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a few years and really like it.  I am in a swimming pool 6 days a week and this shampoo works for me</li>
            <li> Great purchase...very satisfied....received quickly</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and have loved this shampoo for years. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Kendra makes GREAT products. I have been using this product for several years now and like it.  As we know ladies, we all need to change shampoos for a couple of weeks every few months.  For me this is a standard.</li>
