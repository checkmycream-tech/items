    <ol>

            <li>Great Buy Product as described!</li>
            <li>Smell is still awesome...</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t a very good smelling cologne in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It smells very good.</li>
            <li>Great gift for a really good price compared to store pricing!</li>
            <li>What a great deal.</li>
            <li>NICE PRICE AND LOVE NOT HAVING TO HUNT FOR BEST PRICE IN ALL THE STORES</li>
            <li>Price is awsome, and the sent is great, I personally love it, so it was great for a gift! :)</li>
            <li>if i smelt it on someone else i would think it would smell good.</li>
            <li>but good for evening getaways.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume!</li>
            <li>Every time my daughter wear this perfume she get compliments I will get it for myself as well smells amazing</li>
            <li>Not to mention the fragrance is one of a kind.</li>
            <li>I loved this perfume , yes its a bit strong</li>
            <li>not as good as the original ck one</li>
            <li>Love the perfume, easily one of my top five of all time(Sweet/musk/jasmine)!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a body spray than cologne.</li>
            <li>I love ck</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it that moment</li>
            <li>I would appreciate it even more</li>
            <li>I just loved it and the price is worth paying for</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>In terms of the strength and length of the scent, it&#x27;s almost more like a \\&quot;body splash\\&quot; than an eau de toilette, which already fade faster than eau de parfums.</li>
            <li>I just love it ....</li>
            <li>I always have compliments when I wear it, and I wear it every days :)</li>
            <li>Love this cologne.</li>
            <li>Product came perfectly packaged as expected.</li>
            <li>SHIPPED OUT VERY QUICK.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SWEET SMELL OF THIS ONE.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING NICE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Doesnt smell like it is the original perfume smells like alcohol</li>
            <li>and then it only smells good for about a minute</li>
            <li>if you are into sweet vanilla scents, this is your perfume.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh,I bought it for my friends,and she loves the perfume very much,and it&#x27;s value the price,so lovely</li>
            <li>I mean... it does kind of remind me of 7th grade, but,, hey.. its still good stuff.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this very light, but fragrant perfume doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really sweet and has a distinctly summery quality.</li>
            <li>a rich fragrance, delivery was estimated, thank you very much</li>
            <li>it smells so fresh</li>
            <li>but it was worth the try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it is a nice big bottle.</li>
            <li>It has an amazing scent that lasts for a really long time.</li>
            <li>smells good but a little</li>
            <li>I first found this scent in one of those magazine inserts.  </li>
            <li>Same as the department stores, but a better price.</li>
            <li>Its probably good for everyday use and for a woman, too musky for a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Scent wares off pretty fast though.</li>
            <li>the scent is airy, soft and sweet and not too floral.</li>
            <li>Was packaged well and easy to open!</li>
            <li>I gove this perfume 3 stars because I personally do not like too sweet scents.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very musky, not floral like, its very very light, someone has to come close up to you to smell it, does not stay on all day and requires quite a few sprays to get the scent going.</li>
            <li>Love the product but doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li>I found it to be nearly 30% cheaper than in store cost.</li>
            <li>Nice and subtle.. Not ever powering but lasting.</li>
            <li>The only draw back of this perfume is that the scent fades really quicky.</li>

            <li> If you like the Escada fragrance line (Rockin&#x27; Rio, Island Kiss, etc), it&#x27;s hard to imagine that you wouldn&#x27;t like this scent.</li>

            <li> theres something wrong with it</li>

            <li> So CK Shock Women&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very musky, not floral like, its very very light, someone has to come close up to you to smell it, does not stay on all day and requires quite a few sprays to get the scent going. Its probably good for everyday use and for a woman, too musky for a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not stain your clothing which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I have very sensitive skin and this very light, but fragrant perfume doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Not to mention the fragrance is one of a kind. Perfect for any season!</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING NICE PRODUCT</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about returning it because it&#x27;s so weak I think they refilled the bottle with another with water and a tiny touch of the scent. You spray it on, it drips all over the place and then it only smells good for about a minute and then you can&#x27;t smell it anymore- theres something wrong with it</li>
            <li> What a great deal. Same as the department stores, but a better price.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t a very good smelling cologne in my opinion. For the price it&#x27;s just not a top smell in women&#x27;s colognes</li>
            <li> smells good but a little but like cologne. if i smelt it on someone else i would think it would smell good.</li>
            <li> I love ck I never herd of ck shock till my client at work had it she sprayed it on an I fell in love with it that moment it smells so fresh and it sticks with u</li>
            <li> this smells like pepper</li>
            <li> Love the perfume, easily one of my top five of all time(Sweet/musk/jasmine)! Only problem (and someone mentioned this earlier) is that it only lasts like 1 hrs.</li>
            <li> I loved this perfume , yes its a bit strong (that&#x27;s y its named shock i guess) but good for evening getaways. I would appreciate it even more ( that&#x27;s y the 3 star rating) if the cap could fit back into the bottle hole after the spray tube had been inserted, it makes it inconvenient to take off the spray tube and then screw the cap lid when you want to take it during travel.</li>
            <li> SHIPPED OUT VERY QUICK. LOVE THE SWEET SMELL OF THIS ONE. NICE PRICE AND LOVE NOT HAVING TO HUNT FOR BEST PRICE IN ALL THE STORES</li>
            <li> a rich fragrance, delivery was estimated, thank you very much</li>
            <li> Nice and subtle.. Not ever powering but lasting. I like the way my clothes smell at the end of the day after wearing this perfume. I mean... it does kind of remind me of 7th grade, but,, hey.. its still good stuff.</li>
            <li> not as good as the original ck one</li>
            <li> It has an amazing scent that lasts for a really long time. I just loved it and the price is worth paying for</li>
            <li> Product came perfectly packaged as expected. Scent wares off pretty fast though. Smell is still awesome...just requires re-application if you want it to stay though</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. It&#x27;s really sweet and has a distinctly summery quality. If you like the Escada fragrance line (Rockin&#x27; Rio, Island Kiss, etc), it&#x27;s hard to imagine that you wouldn&#x27;t like this scent. It may be a little bit \\&quot;younger\\&quot; smelling than those fragrances. The only draw back of this perfume is that the scent fades really quicky.

            <li> Great gift for a really good price compared to store pricing! Was packaged well and easy to open! Would def order again!</li>

            <li> Love the product but doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  would not buy again but it was worth the try.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they&#x27;ll improve it??</li>
            <li> It smells very good. It doesnt last long on. the scent is airy, soft and sweet and not too floral.</li>
            <li> Doesnt smell like it is the original perfume smells like alcohol</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. It is not to over powering yet the scent stays with you. And it is a nice big bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells so fresh,I bought it for my friends,and she loves the perfume very much,and it&#x27;s value the price,so lovely</li>
            <li> Every time my daughter wear this perfume she get compliments I will get it for myself as well smells amazing</li>
            <li> Only reason I bought this was because of the price. I found it to be nearly 30% cheaper than in store cost.</li>
