            <li>But luckily i had some laying around.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty</li>
            <li>but i think there worth it</li>
            <li>The only thing about them is that it has a nice design with a touch of silver glitter.</li>
            <li>It took a while to arrive but differently worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Overall,  I am happy with design and look of nail, only wish they were full cover.</li>
            <li>, i did not think it looked right</li>
            <li>I just started out in my nail business and it is so much fun receiving all the pretty nails.</li>
            <li>I will buy my next designed nails here for sure.</li>
            <li>Anyway, when i first took out the nail, i will admit they were a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li>The first set i did</li>
            <li>I did my nails again last night, and they turned out ok.</li>
            <li>I do recommend these for someone who likes this design, but i am more of a solid color girl.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>These are really pretty nails.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>So Beauty representatives were very supportive regarding missing glue.  </li>
            <li>my only thing is that the silver color is barley noticeable but work great non the less.</li>
            <li>I really like these nails took a while to get them</li>
            <li>I received these in the mail today and I was really looking forward to getting them but as soon as I opened the package</li>
            <li>My friends and I really like these.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what comes next.</li>
            <li>They are very flimsy and thin, they are cheap and easily bendable and we will not order again or recommend that anyone else orders these.</li>
            <li>I saw some people complaining about how thin the these where, which they are thinner than other, however, I much prefer it since they fit seamlessly on your nail, which is great when you use clear acrylic over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave one star for the half of the nails that were decent and one star for the cheap price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how pretty they are on my customers.</li>
            <li>one thing everyones nail bed differs so the fitting of the nails are either way to little or way to big</li>
            <li>fast shipping, only took 10 days.</li>
            <li>From far meh...</li>
            <li>but they are same as in pic and clear acrylic will serve them well</li>
            <li>The picture shows a nice delicate glitter design that seems to follow the black design.</li>

            <li> Generally, nails will last me 1 week.  </li>
            <li> The downside is not enough wide nails and way too many small, narrow ones nails.</li>
            <li> It recommend to anyone who does artificial nails to get them they looked so elegant</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and strong, and i can use the excess tips again because they dont snap or bend when cutting.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected.</li>
            <li> but they were not as expected.</li>
            <li> So If you  break or lose a wide nail you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> About half of the ones I received were flooded with glitter, so much that it&#x27;s hard to even see the black design.</li>
            <li> These are tips not full cover and are a little fragile.</li>
            <li> The nails are too thin and the black is very transparent and see thru.</li>
            <li> , Just ordered a few days ago and am waiting on all of them to arrive, but like I said in the last 2 reviews on the other nail tips I ordered I just wish I would&#x27;ve known sooner that it would take a month to a month and a half to get here.</li>
            <li> Had to lay the acrylic on a bit thick this time (the last time i didn&#x27;t use alot of acrylic, so when it came to filing, the design came off).</li>
            <li> ONLY complaint is that a few seemed to be a bit lacking in color or the design was messed up.</li>
            <li> I am very active at work and at  home , so my nails get a workout.  </li>
            <li> and they came in little bags with a size on .</li>
            <li> just payed a few bucks</li>
            <li> But that was only 5 out of the 50, not great but not the end of the world.</li>
            <li> They are pretty ugly from close...</li>
            <li> I found it hard to chose from all the colors.</li>
            <li> they felt a little thinner than the False nails</li>
            <li> very small nails out</li>
            <li> nail bed no an serious issue but just concerned.</li>
            <li> Way too thin.</li>
            <li> These nail tips are really thin &amp; flimsy</li>
            <li> I like the faint sparkle they have.  </li>
            <li> These arrived on time but they are useless.</li>
            <li> These ails are very thin and are not sparkled at all.</li>
            <li> The Nails are EXTREMELY thin!!</li>
            <li> Idk if I will use these too bad to</li>
            <li> I could not use was a bad investment for buying part of the shipping cost and q q</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>

            <li> I just received my order. I really like these nails took a while to get them but i think there worth it</li>
            <li> I actually recieved this product ahead of time. Then when I applied the tips they turned out AWESOME.. This was surely a GREAT buy:-)</li>
            <li> Not what i expected. The nails are too thin and the black is very transparent and see thru. I love the design but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Way too thin. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> These ails are very thin and are not sparkled at all. I was really disappointed. And the glue is not included. But besides there being no glitter I like the look of the nails</li>
            <li> Love them.  Wish there were more.  Got them early so loved it.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, only took 10 days. Many compliments on them. didnt see in picture but there is glittler on them, not a lot, but a hint. They look great.</li>
            <li> I put these nails on 6 days ago.  They have not cracked, chipped or broke.  I am very active at work and at  home , so my nails get a workout.  Generally, nails will last me 1 week.  I like the faint sparkle they have.  They are very pretty.</li>
            <li> I received these in the mail today and I was really looking forward to getting them but as soon as I opened the package I was disappointed. These nail tips are really thin &amp; flimsy it will take a lot of acrylic to not make them breakable. The only thing about them is that it has a nice design with a touch of silver glitter. Idk if I will use these too bad to</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get these but they were not as expected. The picture shows a nice delicate glitter design that seems to follow the black design. About half of the ones I received were flooded with glitter, so much that it&#x27;s hard to even see the black design. I tried getting some off with remover but it didn&#x27;t work. I gave one star for the half of the nails that were decent and one star for the cheap price.</li>
            <li> I just started out in my nail business and it is so much fun receiving all the pretty nails. I am very happy with these nails. They look awesome and delivery was really fast. They were here before the date that was posted. I found it hard to chose from all the colors. I am excited to see what comes next. I have ordered more items and they are all great. I can&#x27;t say enough about how pretty they are on my customers. I am very very pleased with your company. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love the C curve. Beautiful design. The downside is not enough wide nails and way too many small, narrow ones nails. So If you  break or lose a wide nail you&#x27;re done. Still I would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> They are pretty ugly from close... From far meh...</li>
            <li> They are very pretty my only thing is that the silver color is barley noticeable but work great non the less.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this nails tips they come 12  days after i buy  and they came in little bags with a size on . they are very easy to get your nail size if you already know .thank you.</li>
            <li> Fancy, elegant, and cute. They are sturdy and strong, and i can use the excess tips again because they dont snap or bend when cutting.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this pattern and now that I have them on they are beautiful. As another reviewer said, these are slightly thinner, but with acrylic they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I recommend these this product to self taught manicurist.having this design done in a salon cost easily $65.00.&lt;br /&gt;I just payed a few bucks did them my self and ive gotten alot of compliments from them. It took a while to arrive but differently worth the wait. I will buy my next designed nails here for sure.</li>
            <li> As i&#x27;m just looking at the title, i realized that it says Plus glue. I did not get my glue! But luckily i had some laying around. Anyway, when i first took out the nail, i will admit they were a bit flimsy. Did not think they were going to hold up. The first set i did, i did not think it looked right (I&#x27;m not use to pattern design nails such as these- i normally go solid colors.) So i ended up taking that set off that night. (yes after i spent all that time doing them lol). I did my nails again last night, and they turned out ok. Had to lay the acrylic on a bit thick this time (the last time i didn&#x27;t use alot of acrylic, so when it came to filing, the design came off). I used a bit more this time and it held. I do recommend these for someone who likes this design, but i am more of a solid color girl.&lt;br /&gt;But if you like them, go for it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is in cosmo and was doing nails last week. Product is great and will be ordering more of there.</li>
            <li> Love these nail tips one thing everyones nail bed differs so the fitting of the nails are either way to little or way to big and I had to use another pack to fit my clients nail bed no an serious issue but just concerned.</li>
            <li> I loved this product came on time. It recommend to anyone who does artificial nails to get them they looked so elegant</li>
            <li> loved the style very elegant will buy again</li>
            <li> My friends and I really like these. Thanks they look awesome.</li>
            <li> All the nails look beautiful, Just ordered a few days ago and am waiting on all of them to arrive, but like I said in the last 2 reviews on the other nail tips I ordered I just wish I would&#x27;ve known sooner that it would take a month to a month and a half to get here.</li>
            <li> they felt a little thinner than the False nails Im use to but they are same as in pic and clear acrylic will serve them well</li>
            <li> Does not appear as stated.</li>
            <li> The Nails are EXTREMELY thin!!</li>
            <li> Beautifully designed nails.  Cannot see in picture but design also has a light sparkle of silver glitter.  So Beauty representatives were very supportive regarding missing glue.  These are tips not full cover and are a little fragile. Overall,  I am happy with design and look of nail, only wish they were full cover.</li>
            <li> These arrived on time but they are useless. They are very flimsy and thin, they are cheap and easily bendable and we will not order again or recommend that anyone else orders these.</li>
            <li> Such a great buy...it arrived in a timely manner</li>
            <li> These are really pretty nails.</li>
            <li> Great tips ! Reasonably priced! Would definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> very small nails out I could not use was a bad investment for buying part of the shipping cost and q q I pay, that purchase was not feasible for me.</li>
            <li> I love the pattern, it is beautiful, ornate and has a simple glitter overlay. I saw some people complaining about how thin the these where, which they are thinner than other, however, I much prefer it since they fit seamlessly on your nail, which is great when you use clear acrylic over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint is that a few seemed to be a bit lacking in color or the design was messed up. But that was only 5 out of the 50, not great but not the end of the world.</li>
