            <li> I do love how it smells but my daughter had a slight reaction from it, nothing major.</li>
            <li> Used this to make a coconut line sugar scrub, and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> My order came quickly and the oil is great so far.  Made a blend with lime for my diffuser and it smells heavenly!  Will buy from Plant Therapy again.</li>
            <li> I love plant therapy oils!  Lime is fabulous smelling. The sticker label on the top is great when I am searching for my many oils and I just love that they list what the oil is good for right on the bottle!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good price.  I used this in conjunction with other essential oils to make beard balm and oil.</li>
            <li> I used the essential oil in cold process soap and it turned out great.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling. Not over powering. Lovely oil!</li>
            <li> smells and taste just like lime</li>
            <li> This lime oil smells great, and the price is better than others on this site. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Smells great! In my opinion, this smells like actual limes. I didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;Skittles&amp;#34; scent at all as someone else reviewed, and instead found it to smell limey. When I run out, this is a definite repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy&#x27;s quality. Can&#x27;t be beat for the price either. I use this often and love the smell.</li>
            <li> Pros - this is probably the best, most authentic smelling Lime essential oil that I&#x27;ve tried yet. It smells fantastic !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - I know that citrus oil scents don&#x27;t usually last long, but this particular Lime scent seems to completely vanish.....in  about 3 to five minutes ! . . . .regardless of any carrier oil used, or even if used straight, POOF, it completely disappears. Even if extra amounts are used in a diffuser it still only produces a very, very light odor.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s too bad, because this Lime is divine.</li>
            <li> Strongest lime oil of all the brands I&#x27;ve used. Love it in my diffuser. When I use at the office it makes everyone happy. Not perfumy. Very nice.</li>
            <li> love their price compare to other companies.... use it after shower in almond oil for skin hydration</li>

            <li> Good product, good price.</li>

            <li> I received the Lime very fast. The product however sells different then the lime I have had in the past. The smell to me is not as good and refreshing as the Products I have gotten in the past from other Places. It could be just the strength it is also. I am not cutting it down in anyway it still has a great Lime sent to it but not what I would like, Still a nice product though.</li>
            <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
