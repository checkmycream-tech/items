    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best spray is Klorane.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Completely works and with a great lemony scent!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read hit or miss reviews with this product and was hoping for the best.</li>
            <li>In the store this is a lot cheaper than on Amazon, but it&#x27;s definitely a great product!</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Extremely happy with this for my hair type.</li>
            <li>This product looked great</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Make sure to rub in well and then use a brush to help it blend!</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, though.  </li>
            <li>It also has a nice citrus smell.</li>
            <li>I found it works great and leaves my hair with a fresh citrus</li>
            <li>My favorite thing is that it isn&#x27;t sticky at all.</li>
            <li>Pssssst from drugstores works remarkably better.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo ever</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo ever!</li>
            <li>Ive tried MANY dry shampoos and this one is simply amazing!!</li>
            <li>It works great on days when i don&#x27;t wash my hair, and completely takes care of the grease.</li>
            <li>but no complaints has a really nice fresh smell to it as well and not so chalky as some of the others on the market.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>The slightest puff of air will send it flying everywhere but it cleans up easy.</li>
            <li>It also is easy to blend into your hair by using a lightly damp towel then brushing it through.</li>
            <li>This is very powdery, so make sure you use over a tub or the sink!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell nice either and the dispenser isn&#x27;t convenient it spills too much.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and light!</li>
            <li>I love love it so much, but recommend you put the product in a shaker bottle.</li>
            <li>As far as powder dry shampoos (vs spray) go, I think Bumble &amp; Bumble Pret a Powder is the best.  </li>
            <li>, it leaves my hair clean, fresh and full.</li>
            <li>It smells so pleasant and subtle, that it neutralizes hair odor without emitting any noticeable smell of its own.</li>
            <li>Get so much for your money and it lasts forever!!</li>
            <li>I bought mine at my local Lush store after reading great reviews online.  </li>
            <li>It is made with natural ingredients, which is super important to me.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, but this is more than double the price direct from the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One application lasts for several days, keeps hair looking fresh, and when you shower, it easily rinses out of your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased that it doesn&#x27;t significantly lighten my dark hair or make it look very powdery.</li>
            <li>Hard to apply but works amazingly well!</li>
            <li>I really like using this between baking soda washes (trying the &amp;#34;no &#x27;poo&amp;#34</li>
            <li>(so that it&#x27;s on both hands), then bring my head to my hands (vs taking my hands to my head and dropping some of the powder) and gently pat.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Especially for those that have thinning hair or miniaturization....should be diligent about washing your hair more frequently.</li>
            <li>It does not leave any residue on your hair, or make it dry and full of static electricity, like some other brands do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy this again though I do wish they had other scents available.</li>
            <li>put a small amount in my hands (mostly fingertips), flip my head over and massage it into my scalp and roots.</li>
            <li>The lush powder will last me much longer and it works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I just bought the Lush powder a couple months ago.</li>
            <li>I use an old sprinkle bottle.</li>
            <li>Just looked very ashy (white)</li>
            <li>For $26 it is a complete rip off.  </li>
            <li>You eventually get so good at application, you hardly make any mess at all.</li>
            <li>Only used it twice so far</li>
            <li>At first, the amount of powder that came out of the container was a concern for me, but I&#x27;ve used less than 1/4 in 3 months.</li>
            <li>It is only $7 in Lush stores and $14 for the larger bottle.</li>

            <li> Also, if you have clogged follicles, you have to be very careful about putting extra things on your scalp.  </li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb oils as well as sprayable dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product for anyone with long, thin hair with dry ends but an oily scalp.</li>
            <li> I usually go for the spray dry shampoos but they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Turns my dark hair a dingy grey color, does not blend in as advertised.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t absorb oil that well after few hours my hair gets greasy,  flat and lifeless</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I now wash my hair every other day and use this for touchups after working out.</li>
            <li> SOooooooo not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> To apply, I squeeze a little out onto one hand, pat my other hand onto that</li>
            <li> But the mess from the powder may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair, so was afraid it would leave a visible white powder in my hair; but using just a little (you can always do it a second time)</li>
            <li> Is heavy and cakey and does not blend in well.  </li>
            <li> Not sure i would buy again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why they are charging $25 for this product on amazon.</li>
            <li> :/  </li>
            <li> Also the scent is very subtle, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to spread through hair.  </li>
            <li> But unfortunately it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t absorb oil that well after few hours my hair gets greasy,  flat and lifeless I wash my hair every other day. Doesn&#x27;t smell nice either and the dispenser isn&#x27;t convenient it spills too much.</li>

As far as powder dry shampoos (vs spray) go, I think Bumble &amp; Bumble Pret a Powder is the best.  The best spray is Klorane.</li>
            <li> I bought this to extend the time between washes. I find it works the same as baby powder.  Not sure i would buy again.  The scent is nice, though.  Goes on easily.  Also, if you have clogged follicles, you have to be very careful about putting extra things on your scalp.  Especially for those that have thinning hair or miniaturization....should be diligent about washing your hair more frequently.</li>
            <li> This is very powdery, so make sure you use over a tub or the sink! The slightest puff of air will send it flying everywhere but it cleans up easy. I really like using this between baking soda washes (trying the &amp;#34;no &#x27;poo&amp;#34; thing). It seems to take quite a lot to get my hair to the point that it doesn&#x27;t look shiny at the roots though. I&#x27;m pleased that it doesn&#x27;t significantly lighten my dark hair or make it look very powdery. Also the scent is very subtle, not overpowering. I&#x27;d buy this again though I do wish they had other scents available.</li>

            <li> I LOVE this product, but this is more than double the price direct from the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely works and with a great lemony scent! I now wash my hair every other day and use this for touchups after working out. My hair is medium brown and the product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair white-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Application tip: At first, the amount of powder that came out of the container was a concern for me, but I&#x27;ve used less than 1/4 in 3 months. To apply, I squeeze a little out onto one hand, pat my other hand onto that (so that it&#x27;s on both hands), then bring my head to my hands (vs taking my hands to my head and dropping some of the powder) and gently pat. May seem obvious, but it took me a bit to get the hang of it.]</li>

            <li> Best dry shampoo ever</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb oils as well as sprayable dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Once I figured out how to use this product. I found it works great and leaves my hair with a fresh citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a small amount in my hands (mostly fingertips), flip my head over and massage it into my scalp and roots. I have dark hair, so was afraid it would leave a visible white powder in my hair; but using just a little (you can always do it a second time) No powdery look, couldn&#x27;t see it all all! I really like this product, it leaves my hair clean, fresh and full. And the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo ever!</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product for anyone with long, thin hair with dry ends but an oily scalp. I have used batiste, psst, and a few other aerosols, but this whoops their butts in actually absorbing all the oil. It is heavier feeling that those products which adds volume, but absorbs all the grease so I avoid a stringy look that i still have with aerosols. Before this, I couldn&#x27;t skip a day of washing my hair. Now I can skip 2 or three days. It smells so pleasant and subtle, that it neutralizes hair odor without emitting any noticeable smell of its own. I love love it so much, but recommend you put the product in a shaker bottle. I use an old sprinkle bottle. Extremely happy with this for my hair type. But the mess from the powder may not be for everyone. It doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit and anything that misses my head, I swipe up with a tissue. You eventually get so good at application, you hardly make any mess at all. Get so much for your money and it lasts forever!! My favorite thing is that it isn&#x27;t sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Turns my dark hair a dingy grey color, does not blend in as advertised. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is excellent.  It does not leave any residue on your hair, or make it dry and full of static electricity, like some other brands do.  One application lasts for several days, keeps hair looking fresh, and when you shower, it easily rinses out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used many, many dry shampoos and this one is the worst.  It is difficult to spread through hair.  Is heavy and cakey and does not blend in well.  SOooooooo not worth the price.  Pssssst from drugstores works remarkably better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read hit or miss reviews with this product and was hoping for the best. But unfortunately it did not work for me. Just looked very ashy (white) and I did not like the texture.  :/  I tried to return the product and the seller denied my request - saying they only take back unopened items.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works great on days when i don&#x27;t wash my hair, and completely takes care of the grease. Make sure to rub in well and then use a brush to help it blend! In the store this is a lot cheaper than on Amazon, but it&#x27;s definitely a great product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful. I can read and understand all of the ingredients. It also has a nice citrus smell.</li>
            <li> Ive tried MANY dry shampoos and this one is simply amazing!! It is made with natural ingredients, which is super important to me. It also is easy to blend into your hair by using a lightly damp towel then brushing it through. The smell is fresh and light! Great product!</li>
            <li> This product looked great so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  For $26 it is a complete rip off.  It&#x27;s basically talcum powder that smells like lime.  And it doesn&#x27;t work.  AND the retailer will not take it back even if you&#x27;ve only tried a dab of it.  I&#x27;m stuck with it but I will warn everyone else it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
