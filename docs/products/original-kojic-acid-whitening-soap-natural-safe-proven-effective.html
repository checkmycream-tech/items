            <li>Did not work soap melted very fast</li>
            <li>I placed an order on the first of March.</li>
            <li>Rinse and pass the cotton dipped in the solution if you felt a tingle that was kind of strong or became kind of painful.</li>
            <li>I also learned from skin products and companies that it usually can take up to 3 months to see good results.</li>
            <li>sure to put it in paper towel to keep it dry</li>
            <li>It is a bit irritating at first but gets better more you use it.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think it worked for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does work really</li>

            <li> it really is working.trying to build confidence because this has been a problem with me for a long time.the dark spots  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this soap for a few weeks, but in the first few uses it removed calluses from my hands and feet, and it&#x27;s actually improved my skin texture.</li>
            <li> like they both took a little color off of my dark spots and after a certain point, would not finish the job.  </li>
            <li> My skin is super smooth now, and it&#x27;s starting to fade some sun damage I&#x27;d had in my chest for years from a very bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> You can use anything else as long as it&#x27;s moisturizer, because this soap does dry your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt a sensation when putting it on my back and on  other  skin spots that are damaged within five-six seconds.</li>
            <li> After using Kojic my dark spots are all fading and some have actually disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Not suitable for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Be careful though</li>
            <li> The soap arrived on time between the expected days of 7/25 - 7/30.</li>
            <li> Softened my rough ares like my knees and elbows.  </li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t stay wet when your not using it.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount of lather on your hands, lukewarm water to rinse.</li>
            <li> This is something I could not achieve with the other brands.  </li>
            <li> One is an exfoliation cloth and the other has a buffer on one side and exfoliation on the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try other methods too.</li>
            <li> other scar tissue</li>
            <li> but I stopped using it every day and used it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> I am multiracial with medium dark skin.  </li>
            <li> After drying off, use porcelena dark spot correction with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Will take a little while to work.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> It arrived on the 28th, however, being a spoiled prime member, the wait killed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing tons of research on this product</li>
            <li> I understand that it might take few ttys before seeing results.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin very tight and burns a little</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m one of those people), I cut my soap into 5 pieces and put 4 in a small tupperware bowl.</li>
            <li> Pass your hands over your face once and wait to see if you feel hard tingle or burn.</li>
            <li> I can see results slowly</li>
            <li> , it gave me a really painful inflammation but</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It gave me more black spots</li>
            <li> Enjoyed this product very much. Makes my complexion really looking refined, clear  and healthy. Would definately recommed.</li>
            <li> I received it and I have started to use it immediately. I felt a sensation when putting it on my back and on  other  skin spots that are damaged within five-six seconds. One sore on my leg from falling.  I will use it - EXCEPT, never  on the face, hand and neck. After all it is called soap.  Luckily, I still have beautiful face/ body skin  no need to even try it as a soap on the non-damaged area spots anyway. It is ACID.. I honestly think that this stuff works. I will update this after one month&#x27;s time. I like it. Give it a try only on your damaged crust sore skin spots.  Recommends, but not for the face. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Did not work soap melted very fast</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it worked for me</li>
            <li> Delivered so fast!!!! And the product is just as its described. No lies.  Be careful though, it gave me a really painful inflammation but its only because i have sensitive skin.  USE AT NIGHT or on a day only at home. Before you use have a solution of baking soda and water, also some cotton balls. Just in case.  Only a small amount of lather on your hands, lukewarm water to rinse. Pass your hands over your face once and wait to see if you feel hard tingle or burn. If you feel a burn only use this soap on your body!!!.  If a light tingle or no tingle lather caress face from chin up and let it sit on skin one minute. Rinse and pass the cotton dipped in the solution if you felt a tingle that was kind of strong or became kind of painful. Neutral moisturizer. Petroleum jelly is the best to protect. This product works true to its description.  High quality.</li>
            <li> It was darkening my complexion</li>
            <li> I have purchased almost every  skinlighting  product out there. This seems to work well. I have reordered twice.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 3 weeks and noticed some difference in complexion I am hoping the age spots will diminish more with continued use. It is a bit irritating at first but gets better more you use it.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this soap for a few weeks, but in the first few uses it removed calluses from my hands and feet, and it&#x27;s actually improved my skin texture. My skin is super smooth now, and it&#x27;s starting to fade some sun damage I&#x27;d had in my chest for years from a very bad sunburn. I am Caucasian with VERY fair skin. I don&#x27;t know about it making my skin any lighter but as an exfoliant it&#x27;s awesome. DO moisturizer after ever use. That&#x27;s a must.</li>
            <li> So far, so good... I&#x27;ve read not to over do it.  One to two times a week.  Listen to your skin.</li>
            <li> i love it works very well fading my acne scars and evening out my skin did not bother my skin</li>
            <li> I am multiracial with medium dark skin.  Kojic has my skin toned and tightened.  This product is slowly erasing my lifelong dark spots better than proactiv dark spot corrector and better than Clinique even better clinical dark spot corrector.  How do I know, we&#x27;ll used two bottles of both products and its like they both took a little color off of my dark spots and after a certain point, would not finish the job.  After using Kojic my dark spots are all fading and some have actually disappeared.  This is something I could not achieve with the other brands.  Absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work as well as thought it would, i used it every day in the shower but i saw no results it was a waste of money and i don&#x27;t reccomend buying it</li>
            <li> The soap smell great and appears to be working on my skin. However  was reallly.dismayed that got only  one bar when my invoice was paid  fot two bars.</li>
            <li> Im waiting for the replacement yet.</li>
            <li> The soap arrived on time between the expected days of 7/25 - 7/30. It arrived on the 28th, however, being a spoiled prime member, the wait killed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing tons of research on this product (I&#x27;m one of those people), I cut my soap into 5 pieces and put 4 in a small tupperware bowl. I read there was suppose to be stinging and itchiness, but I haven&#x27;t experience any of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a light skinned black american (or &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; as I&#x27;m often called.) My skin is golden gram bear color and it&#x27;s sensitive. I&#x27;ve got stretch marks, discoloration on my left arm from driving, and acne scaring on my face. All the miscoloration is 3 shades darker than the rest of me. Original purpose was to make my whole body lighter, but I decided against it. This isn&#x27;t the first and only lightener product I have and/or used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAYS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this soap every night (well almost....I missed 3 days. No big deal.) I use 2 different types of washcloths. One is an exfoliation cloth and the other has a buffer on one side and exfoliation on the other. Here are my steps:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash using the buffer cloth and shower gel&lt;br /&gt;2. rinse off&lt;br /&gt;3. switch cloths and use the koji acid soap. Lather and scrub for 3 minutes. (why? safety and the fact i&#x27;ll rub my skin raw.)&lt;br /&gt;4. Rinse and get out&lt;br /&gt;5. After drying off, use porcelena dark spot correction with moisturizer. This is my product of choice. You can use anything else as long as it&#x27;s moisturizer, because this soap does dry your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work really, just need to give it time depending on your skin absorption level and renewal cycle (14-30 days.) Now my diet is crappy, but i rarely drink caffeine. I&#x27;ve only used it on my marks and left arm and they&#x27;re 45% gone. Plus, my 1st bar slice is still lasting. It&#x27;ll be gone after another week. I also learned from skin products and companies that it usually can take up to 3 months to see good results. After around 6-9 months and no results, stop using it because then it&#x27;s not working for YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this in 2 more weeks. I&#x27;ll try other methods too.</li>
            <li> Great product! Softened my rough ares like my knees and elbows.  Also fades my age spots and smooths wrinkles. My mother is taking a strong dose of Chemo that has left her skin dark with discoloration and she loves this product.</li>
            <li> I never see any change</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the kojic acid soap for results. I can see results slowly so I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> OMG! it is the best soap what I had ever-it working-making skiing healthy, my pores r smaller now -only couple weeks Im using and already can see big different on skin, more white and smooth. I will buy more</li>
            <li> It really brightens up your complexion</li>
            <li> It worked but not as strong as i wanted it.</li>
            <li> Just got it today, It smelled like orange (mild) and the moment I held the soap it started to tingle my fingers, then I put water on the top of my hand and put the soap, it began to burn and i rinsed it off. I saw lightness but then it turned red all over my hand. Not suitable for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> so far so good I have used this soap since October 25th 2014 its working it really is working.trying to build confidence because this has been a problem with me for a long time.the dark spots  nothing seems to work but this is working going to call my sister now so she can try it</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results of using this product. I saw immediate results as I used it twice a day.</li>
            <li> My skin has lightened but still have ache marks,and other scar tissue</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it five stars but I have yet to receive it. I placed an order on the first of March. It said I would be getting it between the 11th and 14th. That time has came and gone and I still don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t seen effective results, but I will buy another one in hope that the next one works. I understand that it might take few ttys before seeing results. I have the patience to do so and I will follow up with a second review. Overall, they shipment came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for three weeks now, and I didn&#x27;t see any improvement on my skin. I didn&#x27;t like the fact that I felt burning and itchiness after using this product. I was using this product to fade my acne on my back away but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I have to keep on using it to see results. So I will not continue using this soap because of the side effects. It might work for you because everyone skin is different.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Will take a little while to work.</li>
            <li> Nice but after but not remove scar but good for oily skin</li>
            <li> i used it once and i cant stop itching..i used a moisturizing body lotion since using this soap but it doesnt help..i think im gonna use if only on my face</li>
            <li> Great! my face is really clearing up...it makes my skin very tight and burns a little but I stopped using it every day and used it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to put it in paper towel to keep it dry so it won&#x27;t stay wet when your not using it.</li>
