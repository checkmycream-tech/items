            <li>You can find some really good deals on it on Amazon too.</li>
            <li>Good package.</li>
            <li>Also, I think this could be a good body wash too.</li>
            <li>Lost a good amount of product on the packaging material.:-</li>

            <li>Lathers good.</li>
            <li>Cleans good.</li>
            <li>It was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>Good stuff ...</li>
            <li>so I asked her to give my shampoo a shot and, surprisingly,</li>
            <li>Good nourishing shampoo.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend because he had mentioned he used it years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>This product burns so good.  </li>
            <li>Good item.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a wonderful smell and gets your hair squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>I like this invigorating shampoo---it&#x27;s fresh herb odor, and I find it is the best shampoo for my thinning, permed hair.</li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>

            <li>Will be glad to do business with them again!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and the fact it comes with a pump!</li>
            <li>It has a wonderfully clean scent and does a beautiful job.</li>
            <li>It felt very good and fun.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a shame because I liked the smell and tingle.</li>
            <li>Thanks and have a great day!!</li>
            <li>Smells nice as well.</li>
            <li>Has a nice mint scent to it.  </li>
            <li>Kind of like when I have a peppermint in my mouth.</li>
            <li>And the price from Viv is really good because the salon charges A LOT more for something this size (33.8 oz.).</li>
            <li>This is a nice product...</li>
            <li>It makes my head tingle and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and helps with dandruff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always liked the smell</li>
            <li>Very invigorating on the scalp and smells great!</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo, but it says it&#x27;s color-safe, yet the label says it contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which means it is NOT color-safe.</li>
            <li>It has a distinctive smell that I recognize as Tea Tree oil but others have liked and described it as &amp;#34;minty.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Feels really nice  after shower and makes itching stop</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li>I have bought the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo and it was great.</li>
            <li>The scent and the cool sensation on your scalp are great.</li>
            <li>The scent and the feel are very refreshing and lovely.</li>
            <li>love this product, as well as the conditioner, and I am so glad that Amazon carries them both!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got unruly hair, combination hair, a tricky scalp, or are just looking for something pampering to make your shower more relaxing yet refreshing, this it is!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that this shampoo does an excellent job of cleaning my hair and leaving it with a clean, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Excellent shampoo for folks with sensitive scalp and problems with dandruff or Psoriasis...</li>
            <li>One of the to three shampoo I tried so far, Really awesome.</li>
            <li>Works great without drying hair and leaves scalp peppermint-y fresh and tingly.</li>
            <li>found the most effective way to use this shampoo is to lather up my hair with this shampoo, masssage my scalp, and leave it in while I wash the rest of my face and body.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing feeling and good smell, a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Feels so good and cool too.  </li>
            <li>I received it quickly and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fix it 100%, but alleviates most of the itch and a lot of the flaking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love how the tea tree tingles my scalp.  </li>
            <li>My teens use it and love it, too.  </li>
            <li>Tea Tree Shampoo is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I use probably 20% more than my day-in-day-out brand (Treseme).    </li>
            <li>I understand there are many knock offs (fakes) of this shampoo</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care if this shampoo costs more than others.</li>
            <li>This is stronger than most dandruff shampoos that just sit there and do nothing.  </li>
            <li>love the scent and everything.</li>
            <li>I love how it tingles the hair folicles and my hair has grown alot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and really love it.</li>
            <li>It is of course better than the $3 Suave shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I still have doubt whether this is authentic Paul Mitchel product.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re wanting a more floral, citrus or neutral scent, you probably won&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>It feels and smells great, and the minty scent is very \\&quot;invigorating,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo.</li>
            <li>After many attempts, I was at the end of my rope, contemplating the chain-saw as a solution.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you work it into the branches nearest the trunk.  </li>
            <li>All I can smell is peppermint, which is not my favorite way to start my day.  </li>
            <li>It works just great, got rid of the itch plus the minty smell is very energizing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and the wonders it does to my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this use this everywhere.</li>
            <li>Enjoy, I know I do!</li>
            <li>We love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I attribute that as a sign of it working its magic.</li>
            <li>Love the tingly feeling it provides the scalp.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>perfect shampoo just wish they made this in a bigger size</li>
            <li>the menthol is refreshing, BUT I don&#x27;t feel that it works at all to help control</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I found it refreshing</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite shampoo</li>
            <li>They should advertize this more for Dandruff sufferers.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the better shampoos around at the moment.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This size bottle also lasts me about a year or more.</li>
            <li>Will be buying another bottle for sure.</li>
            <li>Leaves a lovely tingly feeling after each wash.  </li>
            <li>He shampoos daily, and finds the tea tree to be best.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>For some reason, the bottle I got was more watery than hers and the tingle factor of mine wasn&#x27;t as intense as what I experienced with her bottle.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not too sure.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell as well.</li>
            <li>Love this Shampoo /</li>
            <li>Im burning out on the eucalyptus smell, and it takes alot since it doesn&#x27;t lather up any better than a conditioner would.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different shampoos over the years, but this ones feels the best.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it makes hair shine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was better than the brand I was using, but my scalp still itches and is flaky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a thinning spot on the top of my head for years.</li>
            <li>Must be something about the tingling/stimulating sensation in the shampoo that keeps more hair from falling out.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo for my children.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this stuff for many years.</li>
            <li>I actually love this product BUT......</li>
            <li>Otherwise, enjoy!</li>
            <li>Refreshing  for my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>Love the tingling sensation and the minty smell of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>After trying this stuff when I got my haircut last I was quite impressed.</li>
            <li>Would say it is better for men than women</li>
            <li>It has a great smell and it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells and makes your scalp tingle when shampooing with it.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and my hair was smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>My rigorous first shampoo application reguires a second application followed-up with a good rinse for best results...</li>
            <li>/&gt;3 stars for being pretty good shampoo anyway</li>
            <li>As someone who works long hours, having the chance to use this in the morning to wake you up is priceless.</li>
            <li>This is a good product if you don&#x27;t mind the higher price.</li>
            <li>My best friend is a hairdresser and she recommend this for dry itchy winter scalp.</li>
            <li>My wife finds that it smells nice and calms her mild frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>The very first time I used this, my head felt AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and really keeps their hair clean.  </li>
            <li>This 33.8 oz bottle did not have the word \\&quot;cleanse\\&quot; on it, yet that is what I thought I ordered, but more importantly it did not have the tingling sensation when used.</li>
            <li>Besides lost revenue, off-market products could cost the company something even more important: its reputation for quality.</li>
            <li>Make sure the vendor sends this in a secure package.  </li>
            <li>If you want an all-purpose shampoo that is all-around good for you, shell out for this one.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much</li>
            <li>Super Fast shipping, Great Item.</li>
            <li>This shampoo arrived very quickly and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>The tea tree shampoo keeps my scalp clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an easy product to find in my town.</li>
            <li>Received my order very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love the clean invigorating feel after cleaning my hair with the Tea Shampoo.</li>
            <li>It smells strong in the shower, but I never notice it after my hair drys.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong minty tea tree fragrance and it rinses well.</li>
            <li>Also the strong minty/eucalyptus fragrance isn&#x27;t for everyone.  </li>
            <li>However, the tea tree oil smell is strong.</li>
            <li>Why is it so strong??</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast, and packaged nicely, nothing leak and damaged.</li>
            <li>We love the Tea Tree Special, but the shampoo that I rec&#x27;d today was the Lemon Sage thickening shampoo...plus, it is a busted bottle that is all over the inside of the box....</li>
            <li>- he is soft and nice smelling!</li>
            <li>Better still, it leaves the scalp with a lingering cool sensation.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair feeling cool and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s over priced, but - it delivers a fantastic result - Clean, tingly scalp and shiny, easy to manage hair.  </li>
            <li>(PS: his Dermatologist said to wash hair every other day; I use this on myself every day and it is perfect, gentle and effective).</li>
            <li>This fine shampoo has cleared up my folliculitis.  </li>
            <li>Love this..purchased first bottle from bath works...much better pricing on Amazon</li>
            <li>Super price and value!</li>
            <li>They do work wonderfully for my very thick and \\&quot;mind of its own in humidity\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li>their phenomenal success, De Joria and Mitchell continue to face business challenges.</li>
            <li>But this(and the conditioner, which I also bought) do a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>the tea tree tingle is fabulous on the scalp...like \\&quot;toothpaste for your hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Smooth, shiny, and</li>
            <li>our favorite family shampoo - rarely stings the eyes but cleans very well with a nice scent.</li>
            <li>If anyone knows what it feels like on your scalp with the Genuine product, then you know what i mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff works great, especially if you have dandruff like I do.</li>
            <li>It also leaves the whole bathroom smelling nice.</li>
            <li>(For best results, I think you really need to use both on a regular basis.)  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>So these small sample sizes were perfect.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo i received was the ORIGINAL stuff.</li>
            <li>Its is 100% original and it gives a tingling effect on your scalp.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>First, it really helped my flaking head; it has that nice dispenser plunger, so I don&#x27;t have to fool around with picking up the bottle; it takes very little shampoo (one pump) to get a really good lather; and it feels good on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>It gets your head squeaky clean</li>
            <li>If it makes a squeak, it&#x27;s clean).    </li>
            <li>I have never gotten my hair to feel so clean.</li>
            <li>and it made my hair feel clean</li>
            <li>I also leaves your scalp feeling clean and it got rid of my dandruff.</li>
            <li>like the smell and clean feeling that it gives.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-does not require a lot to clean a lot of hair, so you won&#x27;t run out quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>My hair is thinning (not bald) and it give my hair a clean and shinning finish.</li>
            <li>Using the Tea Tree shampoo first removes all hair product and leaves my hair very clean.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is the not bad at all, I changed different type of shampoos all the time from amazon, so far this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li>We tried it and, no kidding, within 3 washes (rinse repeat until under control, then drop down to wash/rinse), his dandruff was GONE - for good!</li>
            <li>I have been using the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special \\&quot;Cleanse\\&quot; shampoo for years.</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo, 33.8 Ounce  -</li>
            <li>Tea Tree Special Shampoo Liter 33.8 oz</li>
            <li>Toxic cancer chemicals found in Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special Shampoo.</li>
            <li>B000MD65FO Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo, 33.8 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>I have used Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo exclusively for almost 20 years.</li>
            <li>full list of products that contain the chemical Concamide Diethanolamine (Cocamide DEA) can be found here:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It feels cool because of the menthol.</li>
            <li>(Tea Tree Shampoo does have a clarifying effect, so the suggestion about using a deep conditioner afterwards is a good one</li>
            <li>either that or do as I do and use a more gentle shampoo after).  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is fantastic and worth the money.</li>
            <li>The scent is very minty and refreshing.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product is that it controls the oily hair.  </li>
            <li>I find the scent refreshing, the gentle tingling refreshing, and the pump very convenient.</li>
            <li>That was over a year ago and we continue to use it every other day to keep him squeaky clean and smelling great</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, you can feel it working on your scalp, the smell is crisp and refreshing, would highly recommend it, the whole family is using it!!</li>
            <li>The large bottle with pump lasts over one year, so it is very cost effective.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair squeaky clean and has a minty fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Some tea tree shampoos remind me of my dog&#x27;s shampoo - this one is super and distinctively</li>
            <li>Luckily it was wrapped in a plastic bag, but it was still a mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick shipping-great product.</li>
            <li>I found the peppermint overwhelms the shampoo, not crazy about the cool mint tingle effect.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I like the smell of the new one even more</li>
            <li>My new favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Rich lather, stimulating tingle, cool and refreshing scent, and leaves your hair deeply cleaned without brittle dryness.</li>
            <li>Rinsing it out at the end of the shower leaves your head feeling clean, fresh, and very minty!</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo does exactly what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li>With this shampoo and matrix conditioning balm paired with the teatree matching conditioner (using them both at the same time), my hair after two weeks is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s genuine Paul Mitchell, and works very well.  </li>
            <li>It is such an amazing</li>
            <li>Not to mention the invigorating scent of the lavender and peppermint, it stimulates my senses to wake myself more quickly in my early morning routines.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Well worth  </li>
            <li>But, I gave this 3 stars because my hair was soft and healthy and it worked on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is kind of like a cross between that of eucalyptus and mint.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but you do get what you pay for (still worth it)</li>
            <li>I love it for the deep clean</li>
            <li>Good product just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>the smell, but it is really herbal sweet smell .</li>
            <li>I originally thought I had dandruff, but all the dandruff shampoos did was dry out my scalp even more.</li>
            <li>I rediscovered this shampoo after a recent trip to my mother-in-law&#x27;s, and liked it so much I decided to get some for myself.  </li>
            <li>I use this in rotation with my regular shampoo 1-2x a week (since it&#x27;s a bit pricey), and I love the fresh scent and tingling feeling.</li>
            <li>De Joria says that the knockoffs would not give customers the same results as authentic Paul Mitchell products, even though they may look the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I contacted the person who sent me the shampoo, and at first I was asked to let them know what the number of the box was that the shampoo was sent in......when I was able to confirm that, they sent my the second bottle.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist recommended this shampoo to me 6 years ago, when I first started getting highlights, and I have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li>I had explained to him about my problem with occasional dandruff, and I wanted something that would be safe to use on color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>it refreshes your head and mind ;-)</li>
            <li>The chemical, cocamide diethanolamine (cocamide DEA), a chemically-modified form of coconut oil used as a thickener or foaming agent in many products, was listed by California as a known carcinogen last</li>
            <li>the tingle from the shampoo, though is marginally weaker than the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely an eye opener in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I have found it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>First started using this on my child for severe case of dandruff (brought on after surgery from head trauma).</li>
            <li>but this definitely works much better.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says and never disappoints.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a more intense green and instead of tingling it feels more like burning.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First encountered this at my barber&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed finding this volume for the price but packaging left something to be desired.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo definitely cleans your hair more thoroughly than anything else along with taking care of dray scalp.</li>
            <li>Bought this a couple months ago for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years (it&#x27;s the BEST!)and the first time I have purchased this type product</li>
            <li>Then one of my friends recommended this shampoo to me, which really works!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance that is neither male nor female.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to use very much at a time or very often.  </li>
            <li>aroma and skin tingling effect are very noticeable upon first use.</li>
            <li>It conditions my oily scalp and leaves my hair soft and full with body.  </li>
            <li>The 33.8 oz size is a good bargin which lasts for quite some time because it takes just a small dab to shampoo your scalp and hair...</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I applied a bit too much, the menthol was so strong, I couldn&#x27;t open my eyes.</li>
            <li>Online stores, beauty supply companies and even large retail chains have been inundated with \\&quot;look-alike\\&quot; products and knockoffs.</li>
            <li>People at work use this product, but I didn&#x27;t want to buy a large bottle if it didn&#x27;t work for my hair.  </li>
            <li>or I&#x27;m allergic to a certain ingredient, because I&#x27;m not allergic to anything, really.  </li>
            <li>The only downside I&#x27;ve experienced is that there&#x27;s a little camphor or menthol or something in it that stings if it gets in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and will last months.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, no leaks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleans up really well.</li>
            <li>This is a quote from legal zoom.com&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the ads, John Paul De Joria warns consumers that if the product didn&#x27;t come from a Paul Mitchell salon, it is not the real thing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my whole family loves it now and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My scalp gets very itchy from time to time.</li>
            <li>Nothing has really helped.</li>
            <li>Works really well for my oily hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>These products are not the REAL Paul Mitchell...</li>
            <li>Works very well at controlling flaking and dandruff.  </li>
            <li>My husband started requesting this shampoo- highly unusual for this manly dude.</li>
            <li>The tea tree and mint really invigorate the skalp and wake the body up in the morning.</li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews I was really hoping this shampoo would be for me.  </li>
            <li>so you aren&#x27;t getting out too much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that problem much anymore.  </li>
            <li>Being a guy, a very manly one, I&#x27;ve shunned &amp;#34;beauty products&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>As it was purchased directly from Amazon and not a 3rd party seller, I would assume that this bottle was the authentic product, and not a knock-off -</li>
            <li>You may notice that you need more Tea Tree Shampoo than some other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using the matching conditioner with any shampoo you purchase, however this shampoo and conditioner is not enough for my hair to leave it smooth and the matrix conditioning balm is truly a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that tends to be oily.  </li>
            <li>Love the pump; much easier to use than shaking a bottle upside down.  </li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to use as much, especially since it&#x27;s much more expensive than products you can find readily available at a grocery</li>
            <li>HOWEVER I bought mine at a beauty supply store and it actually says on the bottle that if its not sold at a professional salon than do not trust that it is a true Paul Mitchell product!</li>
            <li>my hair was dry, it was much more manageable, soft, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>The opposite is true.</li>
            <li>It used to be a favorite but a few other products have come on line that are even better.</li>
            <li>However the pump barely works (have to pump it 15-20 times to get the right amount)</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, fine, greasy hair, and wear a hardhat in a hot environment almost daily.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This gets rid of it in no time and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers very nicely and so a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusively, this shampoo comes highly recommended from my side.</li>
            <li>Combined with the conditioner at every other wash, my hair is amazing and my scalp is healing and getting back to normal.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair very clean, and makes my hair a lot less greasy.</li>
            <li>I am not going so far as to accuse them of it not being the real Paul Mithchell product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive for shampoo, but it has kept me from growing balder/older looking, and my hair always feels great after using it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, JC Penny no longer carries this, so I was so happy to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I had a baby six months ago and it takes some time for your hormones to return to normal.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be good to have a big pump in the shower instead of buying small bottles all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So right now I bought a bigger one for my boy</li>
            <li>it will be delayed for the new year, and maybe beyond my imagination-----forever</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the last 4 years and it is really soothing and very cooling shampoo</li>
            <li>I had ordered and paid for TWO bottles, and at first, I was only sent one bottle.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why, but I just absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>He used to try much small bottle of it and most of dandruff go away.</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy the authentic brand, fake or imitations won&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li>After trying it out again, he said he won&#x27;t ever go back to using any other shampoo again :)</li>
            <li>So, I started buying it on a pretty regular basis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the box was dropped many times before we received it.</li>
            <li>however, after using for a couple of weeks, i noticed that my hair doesnt feel as clean as it did with other paul mitchell products.</li>
            <li>In case you have dry scalp this is a worth while buy.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo may be good to remove residue from hair every couple weeks or so, but certainly not good for daily use.  </li>
            <li>However, when I washed it out, all the shampoo washes down your back and it hurt my back with a cooling/burning feeling like the kind you get with frost-bite.  </li>
            <li>So the product will last for a long time and be worth the price!</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t recommend this as a daily use shampoo, use it more like an &#x27;in-between&#x27; shampoo as it tends to dry out your hair/scalp with regular</li>
            <li>Which is a hassle since I bought this extra large bottle.</li>
            <li>It smells &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; and it makes your scalp feel &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; but found out later that it may cause cancer (according to a list of shampoos that have a certain ingredient).</li>
            <li>This shampoo works, pure and simple.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the shampoo, although it is a little expensive.</li>
            <li>Helps keep her scalp clear and hair shiny.</li>
            <li>It was clear color and has no menthol.</li>
            <li>It took no time at all to clear this up.  </li>
            <li>Helped clear acne on my head.  </li>
            <li>20 yr old</li>
            <li>Cleans hair and leaves it soft and get rid of the dandruff from my scalp.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product ON OCTOBER 19TH ago buying directly from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I am a frequent Amazon.com customer.</li>
            <li>I sent it back for a refund, but shipping ended up costing as much as the shampoo itself.</li>
            <li>You can ONLY get the real thing at a salon...</li>
            <li>If not bought in a salon the product could be counterfeit, old etc.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>This shampoo Leave my hair soft .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Guess my scalp is too sensitive.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is one of the few available to which I am not allergic.  </li>
            <li>cool, slightly tingly feeling on scalp.</li>
            <li>cannot say good enough things about this shampoo, leaves your scalp feeling tingly and clean, hair looks rejuvenated, you only have to use a small drop, so this bottle will last you for a long long time if used properly, def worth the price, look at it this way you can buy the cheap stuff for $5-10 a bottle and buy a lot of them repeatedly for poor to medium results or cough up the $40</li>
            <li>The mint is refreshing and subtle.  </li>
            <li>I use this shampoo first and Nexxus Simply Silver or Platinum Pro second.  </li>
            <li>I doubt I could use this as an every day shampoo or even every other, its more like a once a week type shampoo due to the mega cleaning it does.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product and would definitely buy again.  </li>
            <li>so it is a bit pricey but well worth it, especially if you have dry scalp or dandruff.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, coarse hair that frizzes and is very prone to static.  </li>
            <li>This large bottle has lasted me a very long time.</li>
            <li>Very good product for men with thick or thin hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as I expected it to be and in a large bottle with a pump.</li>
            <li>anyone is looking for a barely used liter of this</li>
            <li>When I do not want to wash my hair so frequently, I use the conditioner only in between after workouts.</li>
            <li>you can actually feel the cleaning action ...</li>
            <li>Really unhappy and will never order from this shipper again, even though the product itself is a good one.</li>
            <li>, we couldn&#x27;t get the pump to open/work properly and ultimately the topmost part of it came off completely from us trying.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oils totally burn my eyes even if they only go near my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am still looking for a shampoo that will not dry out my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually get the pump top version when I have it (due to the cost, I usually only use it when I want to slurge on myself or when it&#x27;s a gift).    </li>
            <li>/&gt;-dispenses not too much, not too little on each use</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely not worth the high price tag...</li>

            <li> Good package.</li>
            <li> Also, I think this could be a good body wash too.</li>
            <li> Lost a good amount of product on the packaging material.:-</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> Lathers good.</li>
            <li> Cleans good.</li>
            <li> It was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Good price too.</li>
            <li> Good stuff ...</li>
            <li> so I asked her to give my shampoo a shot and, surprisingly,</li>
            <li> Good nourishing shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he had mentioned he used it years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li> This product burns so good.  </li>
            <li> Good item.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has a wonderful smell and gets your hair squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> I like this invigorating shampoo---it&#x27;s fresh herb odor, and I find it is the best shampoo for my thinning, permed hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo for almost a month now and am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Let the shampoo work its magic!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Will be glad to do business with them again!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and the fact it comes with a pump!</li>
            <li> It has a wonderfully clean scent and does a beautiful job.</li>
            <li> It felt very good and fun.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a shame because I liked the smell and tingle.</li>
            <li> Thanks and have a great day!!</li>
            <li> Smells nice as well.</li>
            <li> Has a nice mint scent to it.  </li>
            <li> Kind of like when I have a peppermint in my mouth.</li>
            <li> And the price from Viv is really good because the salon charges A LOT more for something this size (33.8 oz.).</li>
            <li> This is a nice product...</li>
            <li> It makes my head tingle and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and helps with dandruff.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always liked the smell</li>
            <li> Very invigorating on the scalp and smells great!</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo, but it says it&#x27;s color-safe, yet the label says it contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which means it is NOT color-safe.</li>
            <li> It has a distinctive smell that I recognize as Tea Tree oil but others have liked and described it as &amp;#34;minty.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Feels really nice  after shower and makes itching stop</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li> I have bought the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo and it was great.</li>
            <li> The scent and the cool sensation on your scalp are great.</li>
            <li> The scent and the feel are very refreshing and lovely.</li>
            <li> love this product, as well as the conditioner, and I am so glad that Amazon carries them both!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got unruly hair, combination hair, a tricky scalp, or are just looking for something pampering to make your shower more relaxing yet refreshing, this it is!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that this shampoo does an excellent job of cleaning my hair and leaving it with a clean, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo for folks with sensitive scalp and problems with dandruff or Psoriasis...</li>
            <li> One of the to three shampoo I tried so far, Really awesome.</li>
            <li> Works great without drying hair and leaves scalp peppermint-y fresh and tingly.</li>
            <li> found the most effective way to use this shampoo is to lather up my hair with this shampoo, masssage my scalp, and leave it in while I wash the rest of my face and body.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing feeling and good smell, a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Feels so good and cool too.  </li>
            <li> I received it quickly and in good shape.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fix it 100%, but alleviates most of the itch and a lot of the flaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love how the tea tree tingles my scalp.  </li>
            <li> My teens use it and love it, too.  </li>
            <li> Tea Tree Shampoo is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I use probably 20% more than my day-in-day-out brand (Treseme).    </li>
            <li> I understand there are many knock offs (fakes) of this shampoo</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if this shampoo costs more than others.</li>
            <li> This is stronger than most dandruff shampoos that just sit there and do nothing.  </li>
            <li> love the scent and everything.</li>
            <li> I love how it tingles the hair folicles and my hair has grown alot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and really love it.</li>
            <li> It is of course better than the $3 Suave shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I still have doubt whether this is authentic Paul Mitchel product.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re wanting a more floral, citrus or neutral scent, you probably won&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> It feels and smells great, and the minty scent is very \\&quot;invigorating,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo.</li>
            <li> After many attempts, I was at the end of my rope, contemplating the chain-saw as a solution.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you work it into the branches nearest the trunk.  </li>
            <li> All I can smell is peppermint, which is not my favorite way to start my day.  </li>
            <li> It works just great, got rid of the itch plus the minty smell is very energizing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the wonders it does to my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this use this everywhere.</li>
            <li> Enjoy, I know I do!</li>
            <li> We love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I attribute that as a sign of it working its magic.</li>
            <li> Love the tingly feeling it provides the scalp.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> perfect shampoo just wish they made this in a bigger size</li>
            <li> the menthol is refreshing, BUT I don&#x27;t feel that it works at all to help control</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I found it refreshing</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite shampoo</li>
            <li> They should advertize this more for Dandruff sufferers.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the better shampoos around at the moment.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> This size bottle also lasts me about a year or more.</li>
            <li> Will be buying another bottle for sure.</li>
            <li> Leaves a lovely tingly feeling after each wash.  </li>
            <li> He shampoos daily, and finds the tea tree to be best.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> For some reason, the bottle I got was more watery than hers and the tingle factor of mine wasn&#x27;t as intense as what I experienced with her bottle.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not too sure.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> Love this Shampoo /</li>
            <li> Im burning out on the eucalyptus smell, and it takes alot since it doesn&#x27;t lather up any better than a conditioner would.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different shampoos over the years, but this ones feels the best.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it makes hair shine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was better than the brand I was using, but my scalp still itches and is flaky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a thinning spot on the top of my head for years.</li>
            <li> Must be something about the tingling/stimulating sensation in the shampoo that keeps more hair from falling out.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for my children.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this stuff for many years.</li>
            <li> I actually love this product BUT......</li>
            <li> Otherwise, enjoy!</li>
            <li> Refreshing  for my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> Love the tingling sensation and the minty smell of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> After trying this stuff when I got my haircut last I was quite impressed.</li>
            <li> Would say it is better for men than women</li>
            <li> It has a great smell and it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells and makes your scalp tingle when shampooing with it.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and my hair was smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> My rigorous first shampoo application reguires a second application followed-up with a good rinse for best results...</li>
            <li> /&gt;3 stars for being pretty good shampoo anyway</li>
            <li> As someone who works long hours, having the chance to use this in the morning to wake you up is priceless.</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you don&#x27;t mind the higher price.</li>
            <li> My best friend is a hairdresser and she recommend this for dry itchy winter scalp.</li>
            <li> My wife finds that it smells nice and calms her mild frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> The very first time I used this, my head felt AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and really keeps their hair clean.  </li>
            <li> This 33.8 oz bottle did not have the word \\&quot;cleanse\\&quot; on it, yet that is what I thought I ordered, but more importantly it did not have the tingling sensation when used.</li>
            <li> Besides lost revenue, off-market products could cost the company something even more important: its reputation for quality.</li>
            <li> Make sure the vendor sends this in a secure package.  </li>
            <li> If you want an all-purpose shampoo that is all-around good for you, shell out for this one.</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping, Great Item.</li>
            <li> This shampoo arrived very quickly and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li> The tea tree shampoo keeps my scalp clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an easy product to find in my town.</li>
            <li> Received my order very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Love the clean invigorating feel after cleaning my hair with the Tea Shampoo.</li>
            <li> It smells strong in the shower, but I never notice it after my hair drys.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong minty tea tree fragrance and it rinses well.</li>
            <li> Also the strong minty/eucalyptus fragrance isn&#x27;t for everyone.  </li>
            <li> However, the tea tree oil smell is strong.</li>
            <li> Why is it so strong??</li>
            <li> It arrived very fast, and packaged nicely, nothing leak and damaged.</li>
            <li> We love the Tea Tree Special, but the shampoo that I rec&#x27;d today was the Lemon Sage thickening shampoo...plus, it is a busted bottle that is all over the inside of the box....</li>
            <li> - he is soft and nice smelling!</li>
            <li> Better still, it leaves the scalp with a lingering cool sensation.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair feeling cool and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s over priced, but - it delivers a fantastic result - Clean, tingly scalp and shiny, easy to manage hair.  </li>
            <li> (PS: his Dermatologist said to wash hair every other day; I use this on myself every day and it is perfect, gentle and effective).</li>
            <li> This fine shampoo has cleared up my folliculitis.  </li>
            <li> Love this..purchased first bottle from bath works...much better pricing on Amazon</li>
            <li> Super price and value!</li>
            <li> They do work wonderfully for my very thick and \\&quot;mind of its own in humidity\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> their phenomenal success, De Joria and Mitchell continue to face business challenges.</li>
            <li> But this(and the conditioner, which I also bought) do a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> the tea tree tingle is fabulous on the scalp...like \\&quot;toothpaste for your hair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Smooth, shiny, and</li>
            <li> our favorite family shampoo - rarely stings the eyes but cleans very well with a nice scent.</li>
            <li> If anyone knows what it feels like on your scalp with the Genuine product, then you know what i mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, especially if you have dandruff like I do.</li>
            <li> It also leaves the whole bathroom smelling nice.</li>
            <li> (For best results, I think you really need to use both on a regular basis.)  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> So these small sample sizes were perfect.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo i received was the ORIGINAL stuff.</li>
            <li> Its is 100% original and it gives a tingling effect on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> First, it really helped my flaking head; it has that nice dispenser plunger, so I don&#x27;t have to fool around with picking up the bottle; it takes very little shampoo (one pump) to get a really good lather; and it feels good on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It gets your head squeaky clean</li>
            <li> If it makes a squeak, it&#x27;s clean).    </li>
            <li> I have never gotten my hair to feel so clean.</li>
            <li> and it made my hair feel clean</li>
            <li> I also leaves your scalp feeling clean and it got rid of my dandruff.</li>
            <li> like the smell and clean feeling that it gives.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-does not require a lot to clean a lot of hair, so you won&#x27;t run out quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning (not bald) and it give my hair a clean and shinning finish.</li>
            <li> Using the Tea Tree shampoo first removes all hair product and leaves my hair very clean.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is the not bad at all, I changed different type of shampoos all the time from amazon, so far this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li> We tried it and, no kidding, within 3 washes (rinse repeat until under control, then drop down to wash/rinse), his dandruff was GONE - for good!</li>

            <li> It feels cool because of the menthol.</li>
            <li> (Tea Tree Shampoo does have a clarifying effect, so the suggestion about using a deep conditioner afterwards is a good one</li>
            <li> either that or do as I do and use a more gentle shampoo after).  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic and worth the money.</li>
            <li> The scent is very minty and refreshing.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is that it controls the oily hair.  </li>
            <li> I find the scent refreshing, the gentle tingling refreshing, and the pump very convenient.</li>
            <li> That was over a year ago and we continue to use it every other day to keep him squeaky clean and smelling great</li>

            <li> The large bottle with pump lasts over one year, so it is very cost effective.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair squeaky clean and has a minty fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Some tea tree shampoos remind me of my dog&#x27;s shampoo - this one is super and distinctively</li>
            <li> Luckily it was wrapped in a plastic bag, but it was still a mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick shipping-great product.</li>
            <li> I found the peppermint overwhelms the shampoo, not crazy about the cool mint tingle effect.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I like the smell of the new one even more</li>
            <li> My new favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Rich lather, stimulating tingle, cool and refreshing scent, and leaves your hair deeply cleaned without brittle dryness.</li>
            <li> Rinsing it out at the end of the shower leaves your head feeling clean, fresh, and very minty!</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo does exactly what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> With this shampoo and matrix conditioning balm paired with the teatree matching conditioner (using them both at the same time), my hair after two weeks is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s genuine Paul Mitchell, and works very well.  </li>
            <li> It is such an amazing</li>
            <li> Not to mention the invigorating scent of the lavender and peppermint, it stimulates my senses to wake myself more quickly in my early morning routines.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Well worth  </li>
            <li> But, I gave this 3 stars because my hair was soft and healthy and it worked on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is kind of like a cross between that of eucalyptus and mint.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but you do get what you pay for (still worth it)</li>
            <li> I love it for the deep clean</li>
            <li> Good product just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> the smell, but it is really herbal sweet smell .</li>
            <li> I originally thought I had dandruff, but all the dandruff shampoos did was dry out my scalp even more.</li>
            <li> I rediscovered this shampoo after a recent trip to my mother-in-law&#x27;s, and liked it so much I decided to get some for myself.  </li>
            <li> I use this in rotation with my regular shampoo 1-2x a week (since it&#x27;s a bit pricey), and I love the fresh scent and tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> De Joria says that the knockoffs would not give customers the same results as authentic Paul Mitchell products, even though they may look the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I contacted the person who sent me the shampoo, and at first I was asked to let them know what the number of the box was that the shampoo was sent in......when I was able to confirm that, they sent my the second bottle.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this shampoo to me 6 years ago, when I first started getting highlights, and I have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> I had explained to him about my problem with occasional dandruff, and I wanted something that would be safe to use on color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> it refreshes your head and mind ;-)</li>
            <li> The chemical, cocamide diethanolamine (cocamide DEA), a chemically-modified form of coconut oil used as a thickener or foaming agent in many products, was listed by California as a known carcinogen last</li>
            <li> the tingle from the shampoo, though is marginally weaker than the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely an eye opener in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I have found it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> First started using this on my child for severe case of dandruff (brought on after surgery from head trauma).</li>
            <li> but this definitely works much better.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says and never disappoints.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a more intense green and instead of tingling it feels more like burning.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First encountered this at my barber&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed finding this volume for the price but packaging left something to be desired.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo definitely cleans your hair more thoroughly than anything else along with taking care of dray scalp.</li>
            <li> Bought this a couple months ago for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years (it&#x27;s the BEST!)and the first time I have purchased this type product</li>
            <li> Then one of my friends recommended this shampoo to me, which really works!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant fragrance that is neither male nor female.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to use very much at a time or very often.  </li>
            <li> aroma and skin tingling effect are very noticeable upon first use.</li>
            <li> It conditions my oily scalp and leaves my hair soft and full with body.  </li>
            <li> The 33.8 oz size is a good bargin which lasts for quite some time because it takes just a small dab to shampoo your scalp and hair...</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I applied a bit too much, the menthol was so strong, I couldn&#x27;t open my eyes.</li>
            <li> Online stores, beauty supply companies and even large retail chains have been inundated with \\&quot;look-alike\\&quot; products and knockoffs.</li>
            <li> People at work use this product, but I didn&#x27;t want to buy a large bottle if it didn&#x27;t work for my hair.  </li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m allergic to a certain ingredient, because I&#x27;m not allergic to anything, really.  </li>
            <li> The only downside I&#x27;ve experienced is that there&#x27;s a little camphor or menthol or something in it that stings if it gets in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and will last months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, no leaks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleans up really well.</li>
            <li> This is a quote from legal zoom.com&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the ads, John Paul De Joria warns consumers that if the product didn&#x27;t come from a Paul Mitchell salon, it is not the real thing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my whole family loves it now and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My scalp gets very itchy from time to time.</li>
            <li> Nothing has really helped.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my oily hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> These products are not the REAL Paul Mitchell...</li>
            <li> Works very well at controlling flaking and dandruff.  </li>
            <li> My husband started requesting this shampoo- highly unusual for this manly dude.</li>
            <li> The tea tree and mint really invigorate the skalp and wake the body up in the morning.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I was really hoping this shampoo would be for me.  </li>
            <li> so you aren&#x27;t getting out too much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that problem much anymore.  </li>
            <li> Being a guy, a very manly one, I&#x27;ve shunned &amp;#34;beauty products&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> As it was purchased directly from Amazon and not a 3rd party seller, I would assume that this bottle was the authentic product, and not a knock-off -</li>
            <li> You may notice that you need more Tea Tree Shampoo than some other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using the matching conditioner with any shampoo you purchase, however this shampoo and conditioner is not enough for my hair to leave it smooth and the matrix conditioning balm is truly a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that tends to be oily.  </li>
            <li> Love the pump; much easier to use than shaking a bottle upside down.  </li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to use as much, especially since it&#x27;s much more expensive than products you can find readily available at a grocery</li>
            <li> HOWEVER I bought mine at a beauty supply store and it actually says on the bottle that if its not sold at a professional salon than do not trust that it is a true Paul Mitchell product!</li>
            <li> my hair was dry, it was much more manageable, soft, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> The opposite is true.</li>
            <li> It used to be a favorite but a few other products have come on line that are even better.</li>
            <li> However the pump barely works (have to pump it 15-20 times to get the right amount)</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, fine, greasy hair, and wear a hardhat in a hot environment almost daily.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This gets rid of it in no time and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers very nicely and so a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusively, this shampoo comes highly recommended from my side.</li>
            <li> Combined with the conditioner at every other wash, my hair is amazing and my scalp is healing and getting back to normal.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair very clean, and makes my hair a lot less greasy.</li>
            <li> I am not going so far as to accuse them of it not being the real Paul Mithchell product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive for shampoo, but it has kept me from growing balder/older looking, and my hair always feels great after using it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, JC Penny no longer carries this, so I was so happy to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had a baby six months ago and it takes some time for your hormones to return to normal.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li> and I thought it would be good to have a big pump in the shower instead of buying small bottles all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So right now I bought a bigger one for my boy</li>
            <li> it will be delayed for the new year, and maybe beyond my imagination-----forever</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 4 years and it is really soothing and very cooling shampoo</li>
            <li> I had ordered and paid for TWO bottles, and at first, I was only sent one bottle.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why, but I just absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> He used to try much small bottle of it and most of dandruff go away.</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy the authentic brand, fake or imitations won&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li> After trying it out again, he said he won&#x27;t ever go back to using any other shampoo again :)</li>
            <li> So, I started buying it on a pretty regular basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the box was dropped many times before we received it.</li>
            <li> however, after using for a couple of weeks, i noticed that my hair doesnt feel as clean as it did with other paul mitchell products.</li>
            <li> In case you have dry scalp this is a worth while buy.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo may be good to remove residue from hair every couple weeks or so, but certainly not good for daily use.  </li>
            <li> However, when I washed it out, all the shampoo washes down your back and it hurt my back with a cooling/burning feeling like the kind you get with frost-bite.  </li>
            <li> So the product will last for a long time and be worth the price!</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t recommend this as a daily use shampoo, use it more like an &#x27;in-between&#x27; shampoo as it tends to dry out your hair/scalp with regular</li>
            <li> Which is a hassle since I bought this extra large bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; and it makes your scalp feel &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; but found out later that it may cause cancer (according to a list of shampoos that have a certain ingredient).</li>
            <li> This shampoo works, pure and simple.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the shampoo, although it is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> Helps keep her scalp clear and hair shiny.</li>
            <li> It was clear color and has no menthol.</li>
            <li> It took no time at all to clear this up.  </li>
            <li> Helped clear acne on my head.  </li>
            <li> 20 yr old</li>
            <li> Cleans hair and leaves it soft and get rid of the dandruff from my scalp.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product ON OCTOBER 19TH ago buying directly from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent Amazon.com customer.</li>
            <li> I sent it back for a refund, but shipping ended up costing as much as the shampoo itself.</li>
            <li> You can ONLY get the real thing at a salon...</li>
            <li> If not bought in a salon the product could be counterfeit, old etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> This shampoo Leave my hair soft .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Guess my scalp is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is one of the few available to which I am not allergic.  </li>
            <li> cool, slightly tingly feeling on scalp.</li>
            <li> cannot say good enough things about this shampoo, leaves your scalp feeling tingly and clean, hair looks rejuvenated, you only have to use a small drop, so this bottle will last you for a long long time if used properly, def worth the price, look at it this way you can buy the cheap stuff for $5-10 a bottle and buy a lot of them repeatedly for poor to medium results or cough up the $40</li>
            <li> The mint is refreshing and subtle.  </li>
            <li> I use this shampoo first and Nexxus Simply Silver or Platinum Pro second.  </li>
            <li> I doubt I could use this as an every day shampoo or even every other, its more like a once a week type shampoo due to the mega cleaning it does.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product and would definitely buy again.  </li>
            <li> so it is a bit pricey but well worth it, especially if you have dry scalp or dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair that frizzes and is very prone to static.  </li>
            <li> This large bottle has lasted me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Very good product for men with thick or thin hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as I expected it to be and in a large bottle with a pump.</li>
            <li> anyone is looking for a barely used liter of this</li>
            <li> When I do not want to wash my hair so frequently, I use the conditioner only in between after workouts.</li>
            <li> you can actually feel the cleaning action ...</li>
            <li> Really unhappy and will never order from this shipper again, even though the product itself is a good one.</li>
            <li> , we couldn&#x27;t get the pump to open/work properly and ultimately the topmost part of it came off completely from us trying.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oils totally burn my eyes even if they only go near my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am still looking for a shampoo that will not dry out my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually get the pump top version when I have it (due to the cost, I usually only use it when I want to slurge on myself or when it&#x27;s a gift).    </li>
            <li> /&gt;-dispenses not too much, not too little on each use</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely not worth the high price tag...</li>
            <li> The price might be a little high but don&#x27;t let that hinder you.</li>
            <li> It takes very little if you give it time to really work into your hair and lather well.  </li>
            <li> Minty fresh is not a good ocular condition.</li>
            <li> but in all my years of using amazon, this is my first complaint.</li>
            <li> Disappointed since I was hoping for a Tea Tree shampoo, I&#x27;ve had good luck with Bronners Tea Tree products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;The Center for Environmental Health (CEH) revealed independent testing on Tuesday finding a cancer-causing chemical in 98 shampoos, soaps and other personal care products sold by major national retailers.</li>
            <li> It is dry skin, definitely not dandruff.</li>
            <li> I was all of a sudden having some dry scaly patches on my scalp and my hair stylist recommended this shampoo instead of dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for numerous years and find that I never have a dry scalp or dandruff.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended it, because I was complaining about having such a dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> Previously I have read up a of review on certain Paul Mitchell products not genuine being sold in amazon, I was quite taken back.</li>
            <li> I recommend either using it every other shampoo or use an extra deep conditioner to go with this.</li>
            <li> I bought  it at a beauty supply store after getting the hard sell to buy some at a Supercuts(the whole reason I bought it  at a beauty supply store</li>
            <li> Hopefully this will stop my itchy scalp in the long run.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally oily, but after using this shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily, but it also doesn&#x27;t feel dried out.  </li>
            <li> I just recently started getting it online because where i used to get it closed down.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I finally broke down and bought the big bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long time user of this product!</li>
            <li> There are other competitors out there who use a similar formula to create the tingly feeling and smell.</li>
            <li> Now it is a pricey compared to other shampoos, which may make you second guess this purchase.</li>
            <li> My skin (on my scalp) is soooo dry</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair like some dandruff shampoos do.  </li>
            <li> if you have dry, color treated or damaged hair...</li>
            <li> It does strip your hair of oil and product build up, so if you have dry hair, use a conditioner in conjunction with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo may be clarifying, but I have not found my hair to be dry and unmanageable at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend for dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found to calm the snowfall on my head.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but leaves my hair feeling really clean.  </li>
            <li> /get rid of dry scalp and/or</li>
            <li> Helps with dry scalp or dandruff and feels &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; when applied.</li>
            <li> Also, when I wash my hair, it feels as though my head is freezing until I dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I was struggling with dry scalp and breakouts of scalp acne.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my hair too dry</li>
            <li> I use it every single day, along with the conditioner, which works well also.  </li>
            <li> Figured, WHY NOT, worth a try, nothing else is working and this kid has been thru enough, he doesn&#x27;t need smelly flaky dandruff to boot.</li>
            <li> I reside in a hot and dusty locality, with lots of minerals.  </li>
            <li> my dry scalp is gone, along with the flakes!  </li>
            <li> Conditioners were the same, and no combination seemed to make it any less problematic.  </li>
            <li> I have slightly oily, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> The shipping package was also inadequate and so the pump was damaged, product had leaked all over the box creating a mess, a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is a die-hard fan of the Aussie line of hair products and rarely tries anything else.</li>
            <li> I have used a Paul Mitchell green tea shampoo before that really left a head &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo occasionally for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s expensive, I use it every other or every third shampoo, and that seems to be frequent enough to work.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and suffered from dandruff for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buying on Amazon.com cost me at least half less what i would normally</li>
            <li> I also have allergies to coconut, wheat, and avocado, so a lot of other moisturizing shampoos were not an option.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get extremely bubbly or foamy, but it still cleans well, without leaving any residue.</li>
            <li> I used Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo and conditioner in the past, and I&#x27;ve bought it beforehand in smaller containers from retailers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, my scalp seems calmer (always itching due to hair color).</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY oily hair and was told to try this product</li>
            <li> While it appears expensive it doesn&#x27;t require two applications per use and it doesn&#x27;t need a large amount to work.</li>
            <li> Because of that cost per use is probably less that other products.</li>
            <li> only problem I have had with this product is that it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> You may want to get the conditioner to try it out, but I find that it&#x27;s not worth the added expense.</li>
            <li> the shampoo looks pretty scary with green streaks in it.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the price.  </li>
            <li> It was slowly getting larger until I started using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful not to get it in your eyes!!  </li>
            <li> so i had plenty of cleanup to do since it had run down onto the bottle, making a slippery mess...</li>
            <li> Mitchell ), so I have had previous experience with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Allow it to soak for half a day.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately the product, while in the same bottle, doesn&#x27;t seem the same.</li>
            <li> It strips every drop of product or oil from your hair, so when you are done shampooing your hair is a matted mess and straw-like.  </li>
            <li> A slimy mess.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately had just purchased a bottle when I found the new stuff.</li>
            <li> A little tingle before you rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> This is a bit harsh for my hair</li>
            <li> It is a bit harsh and drying on the hair, however.  </li>
            <li> It seemed every shampoo I tried either dried out my hair or made it greasy.  </li>
            <li> I cannot wait until a year or so until I can cut off my dead ends and start anew with my hair.</li>
            <li> While doing research online, discovered tea tree benefits and after a few clicks, found Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you have never used Tea Tree shampoo, you don&#x27;t know what you are missing.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo a few days ago and when i put it in my hair it felt like silk.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few shampoos that relieve my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Your scalp will start to feel tingly and minty after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> have used this shampoo for approximately 2 months and my scalp is the it has been in several years.</li>
            <li> and now I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my time with another shampoo.</li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s used it a few times)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When we opened it the pump was already in the bottle and taped down, not like usual where pumps are taped to the side for placement buy the consumer.</li>
            <li> I think I use 4-5 squirts and with my thick hair, I usually have to use about twice that for other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> To tame my hair is no easy feat!  </li>
            <li> For some time I was buying this shampoo at local authorized retailer ( which unfortunately stopped selling&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I ended buying this</li>
            <li> I have use this shampoo for the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> Now we will have to pour the shampoo from this bottle into a smaller bottle anyway, so that defeats the purpose of the big pump bottle. :(</li>
            <li> Also note that Amazon was not able to ship it without the shampoo leaking.</li>
            <li> usually buy at Sportsclips.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s expensive, but just a little bit goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> The brand they&#x27;ve worked hard to build is now under attack from bootleggers.</li>
            <li> Bottle lasts her at least 6 months.  </li>
            <li> For years my Belgian neighbors have complained (lots of arguing) about the lackluster foliage on the tea tree in my front yard.  </li>
            <li> To rinse, ignite the dead branches near the base of the tree and call the fire department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I always came back disappointed as they were never able to exceed this shampoo.</li>
            <li> We did however receive a broken pump so its hard to get the shampoo out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from a bad scalp, this shampoo will definitely reduce your problems.</li>
            <li> bad part is i&#x27;m totally hooked on the stuff.  </li>
            <li> sometimes after a hard workout I take it as shower gel...fantastic!</li>
            <li> it is too bad that there is no real economy in buying it online as opposed to through a beauty retailer, at least from what I have seen.</li>
            <li> I used this for 10 years and my dandruff got progressively worse.</li>
            <li> However, the reason that I&#x27;m giving this 2/5 stars is because it arrived with a broken pump, so I couldn&#x27;t get the shampoo out of the bottle the way it was designed to be used.</li>
            <li> Problem is the pump is always broken by the time it arrives.</li>
            <li> Do you have thin and oily hair?</li>
            <li> The cap was partially broken.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a bad case, just a few ingrown hairs every now and again.</li>
            <li> Is this product a fake?</li>
            <li> the one I bought online is either fake or Paul Mitchell changed something, because it&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am beyond angry and wonder if there is a civil lawsuit to join!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t heed comments about the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It may be on the expensive side when you compare it to any \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; shampoo out there, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really disturbing to feel all that tingling around my eyes as I take a shower.</li>
            <li> Expensive,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and will discontinue use since learning of this horrible finding.</li>
            <li> My hair cutting place uses this shampoo and each time they washed my hair, my scalp felt like it was tingling a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this shampoo has helped my scalp problems, but it has made my hair horribly unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very expensive in my opinion for shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair was shedding badly and I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> But after two months of using every day, I still have really bad dandruff and an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> So I was disappointed in the supplier.</li>
            <li> Making weekly purchases and I am severely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> It feels like your scalp got blasted by a york peppermint patty or something!</li>
            <li> I hate going to a salon just to get this stuff too.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed....</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> cannot say good enough things about this shampoo, leaves your scalp feeling tingly and clean, hair looks rejuvenated, you only have to use a small drop, so this bottle will last you for a long long time if used properly, def worth the price, look at it this way you can buy the cheap stuff for $5-10 a bottle and buy a lot of them repeatedly for poor to medium results or cough up the $40 once a year for this product and have great results...</li>
            <li> My skin (on my scalp) is soooo dry it itches all the time and, of course, flakes.  It is dry skin, definitely not dandruff. I&#x27;ve tried everything I have heard about without luck. This stuff works the best of all. Doesn&#x27;t fix it 100%, but alleviates most of the itch and a lot of the flaking. Feels good, it tingles on your scalp. But the smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering like some I&#x27;ve tried. I also use the same type of conditioner with it.</li>
            <li> Only thing my wife will use.  I hate going to a salon just to get this stuff too.  Fast shipping, no leaks.  Bottle lasts her at least 6 months.  Helps keep her scalp clear and hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent  service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and love it.  I received it quickly and in good shape.  No problems, and I will order again.</li>
            <li> This is a bit harsh for my hair so I try to use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans up really well.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because it was recommended that I use something with Tea Tree oil in it to help me with my problem scalp.  I&#x27;m not sure if this shampoo has helped my scalp problems, but it has made my hair horribly unmanageable.  It strips every drop of product or oil from your hair, so when you are done shampooing your hair is a matted mess and straw-like.  This shampoo may be good to remove residue from hair every couple weeks or so, but certainly not good for daily use.  And for heaven&#x27;s sake, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.  Minty fresh is not a good ocular condition.</li>
            <li> My new favorite shampoo.  I love how the tea tree tingles my scalp.  Not to mention the invigorating scent of the lavender and peppermint, it stimulates my senses to wake myself more quickly in my early morning routines.  It conditions my oily scalp and leaves my hair soft and full with body.  This shampoo is worth every penny.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 25 years.  It is great for itchy scalp, dandruff, dermatitis, etc.  My teens use it and love it, too.  You just have to be careful not to get it in your eyes!!  It smells strong in the shower, but I never notice it after my hair drys.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair like some dandruff shampoos do.  My hubby uses it, too.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Shampoo is my favorite. I usually get the pump top version when I have it (due to the cost, I usually only use it when I want to slurge on myself or when it&#x27;s a gift).    It has a pleasant fragrance that is neither male nor female. It gets your head squeaky clean (You can tell if shampoo did its job by pressing your fingers around a bit of hair and pulling. If it makes a squeak, it&#x27;s clean).    You may notice that you need more Tea Tree Shampoo than some other shampoos. I use probably 20% more than my day-in-day-out brand (Treseme).    You may want to get the conditioner to try it out, but I find that it&#x27;s not worth the added expense. I&#x27;d rather get 2 shampoos than 1 shampoo and a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great product. However the pump barely works (have to pump it 15-20 times to get the right amount) so I have to pour out the shampoo each time. Which is a hassle since I bought this extra large bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special \\&quot;Cleanse\\&quot; shampoo for years. I would purchase at a local Paul Mitchell authorized salon. The experience that you get when using this shampoo is an invigorating \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; sensation on your scalp. This 33.8 oz bottle did not have the word \\&quot;cleanse\\&quot; on it, yet that is what I thought I ordered, but more importantly it did not have the tingling sensation when used. I understand there are many knock offs (fakes) of this shampoo so I emailed the company with my concern but received no response from them. Why would they not respond? Is this product a fake? I am not going so far as to accuse them of it not being the real Paul Mithchell product but I am suspicious if the product does not perform like the reall product and they did not respond to my email. This is a quote from legal zoom.com&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Despite their phenomenal success, De Joria and Mitchell continue to face business challenges. The brand they&#x27;ve worked hard to build is now under attack from bootleggers. Online stores, beauty supply companies and even large retail chains have been inundated with \\&quot;look-alike\\&quot; products and knockoffs. De Joria estimates that bootlegging costs the company millions in revenue each year. Besides lost revenue, off-market products could cost the company something even more important: its reputation for quality. De Joria says that the knockoffs would not give customers the same results as authentic Paul Mitchell products, even though they may look the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem has become so pervasive that the company has launched an anti-bootleg campaign online and on TV. In the ads, John Paul De Joria warns consumers that if the product didn&#x27;t come from a Paul Mitchell salon, it is not the real thing.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Caveat Emptor!</li>
            <li> I had ordered and paid for TWO bottles, and at first, I was only sent one bottle.  I contacted the person who sent me the shampoo, and at first I was asked to let them know what the number of the box was that the shampoo was sent in......when I was able to confirm that, they sent my the second bottle.  So I was disappointed in the supplier.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used. I have never gotten my hair to feel so clean. It also makes hair washing pleasurable. The scent and the cool sensation on your scalp are great. I don&#x27;t care if this shampoo costs more than others. I am a fan for life.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 4 years and it is really soothing and very cooling shampoo</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great.  This is stronger than most dandruff shampoos that just sit there and do nothing.  It tingles the scalp.  It has a strong minty tea tree fragrance and it rinses well. It is a bit harsh and drying on the hair, however.  I recommend either using it every other shampoo or use an extra deep conditioner to go with this.</li>
            <li> great shampoo. love the scent and everything.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this shampoo to me 6 years ago, when I first started getting highlights, and I have been using it ever since.  I had explained to him about my problem with occasional dandruff, and I wanted something that would be safe to use on color-treated hair.  He suggested the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo.  I find that it works beautifully; it keeps the flakes at bay without ruining the color.  I use it every single day, along with the conditioner, which works well also.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree products.  In fact, when I ran out of the shampoo and had to try a different shampoo in a pinch, I ended up eventually switching back to the Tea Tree.  The Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner seem to be the only products that take care of the flakes and don&#x27;t leave greasy residue in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have had with this product is that it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.  A lot of times you can only get it in salons, which is more expensive, and not every salon carries it.  Some salons and stores may only carry the conditioner, but not the shampoo.  (For best results, I think you really need to use both on a regular basis.)  So that&#x27;s why I just order it online.  I buy the big bottle and use it to refill the smaller one I have.  (Obviously the smaller bottle makes travel easier.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, as well as the conditioner, and I am so glad that Amazon carries them both!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for dandruff, itchy scalp!&lt;br /&gt;I have color treated hair and had no problems using this shampoo&lt;br /&gt;It does have a great smell and does leave your scalp tingling.&lt;br /&gt;My 20 yr old and I are both amazed.</li>
            <li> For some time I was buying this shampoo at local authorized retailer ( which unfortunately stopped selling&lt;br /&gt;Paul Mitchell ), so I have had previous experience with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;And the one I bought online is either fake or Paul Mitchell changed something, because it&lt;br /&gt;isn&#x27;t so good as it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for being pretty good shampoo anyway</li>
            <li> I bought  it at a beauty supply store after getting the hard sell to buy some at a Supercuts(the whole reason I bought it  at a beauty supply store but I digress..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. I like the smell, and the tingling does go away after a while.But this(and the conditioner, which I also bought) do a fantastic job. Well worth  the extra price, IMO.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo, 33.8 Ounce  - I love this product! I use it for the face to minimize redness and i washed my dog with it this weekend - he is soft and nice smelling!</li>
            <li> I used this for 10 years and my dandruff got progressively worse. My head itched non-stop by the time I switched to Pura D&#x27;or Argan Oil Premium Organic Shampoo Scalp &amp; Dandruff Treatment .&lt;br /&gt;I realize now it was the Sodium Lauryl Sulfate &amp; Sodium Laureth Sulfate that was causing all of the issues.&lt;br /&gt;It is a shame because I liked the smell and tingle. Luckily I like the smell of the new one even more and it is about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is looking for a barely used liter of this let me know I unfortunately had just purchased a bottle when I found the new stuff.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I have ever used</li>
            <li> my salon uses this shampoo and i loved it, so i bought some for myself. the tea tree tingle is fabulous on the scalp...like \\&quot;toothpaste for your hair\\&quot;. however, after using for a couple of weeks, i noticed that my hair doesnt feel as clean as it did with other paul mitchell products. i have highlights added to my hair, and need to use good conditioner with it. the tea tree shampoo doesnt make my hair \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot;, even after two wash/rinses. and in another day my hair is somewhat greasy. i am now using it with another paul mitchel conditioning shampoo, and i am happy with it.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this to me after several problems with my scalp.  It seemed every shampoo I tried either dried out my hair or made it greasy.  Conditioners were the same, and no combination seemed to make it any less problematic.  I also have allergies to coconut, wheat, and avocado, so a lot of other moisturizing shampoos were not an option.  The very first time I used this, my head felt AMAZING.  The lavender is incredible, but not overwheling.  The mint is refreshing and subtle.  It takes very little if you give it time to really work into your hair and lather well.  I think I use 4-5 squirts and with my thick hair, I usually have to use about twice that for other shampoos.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to use as much, especially since it&#x27;s much more expensive than products you can find readily available at a grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my hair was dry, it was much more manageable, soft, and shiny.  I have very thick, coarse hair that frizzes and is very prone to static.  To tame my hair is no easy feat!  Combined with the conditioner at every other wash, my hair is amazing and my scalp is healing and getting back to normal.  I love this stuff!  I used to balk at paying $4.00 for a bottle of shampoo, but this has converted me, and I doubt I will ever go back to grocery store shampoo.  If you&#x27;ve got unruly hair, combination hair, a tricky scalp, or are just looking for something pampering to make your shower more relaxing yet refreshing, this it is!  Thank you, Paul Mitchell!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and love it!!  Hope when I need more, I can find a good deal again!!!  Thanks and have a great day!!</li>
            <li> I had a baby six months ago and it takes some time for your hormones to return to normal.  My hair was shedding badly and I started using this product.  It helped my hair return to it&#x27;s normal Ph and also it promotes hair growth.  I love how it tingles the hair folicles and my hair has grown alot.  I would recomend this shampoo to everyone especially those with chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> it is the greatest stuff ever.  it is too bad that there is no real economy in buying it online as opposed to through a beauty retailer, at least from what I have seen.</li>
            <li> exacty as ordered gret product</li>
            <li> best ever! it refreshes your head and mind ;-) sometimes after a hard workout I take it as shower gel...fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and really love it. It smells good and makes your scalp feel refreshed. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000MD65FO Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo Liter 33.8 oz With Pump]]    Excellent shampoo for folks with sensitive scalp and problems with dandruff or Psoriasis... The 33.8 oz size is a good bargin which lasts for quite some time because it takes just a small dab to shampoo your scalp and hair... My rigorous first shampoo application reguires a second application followed-up with a good rinse for best results...</li>
            <li> People at work use this product, but I didn&#x27;t want to buy a large bottle if it didn&#x27;t work for my hair.  So these small sample sizes were perfect.  They do work wonderfully for my very thick and \\&quot;mind of its own in humidity\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I ended buying this but my whole family loves it now and won&#x27;t use anything else. You can only get it in salons so it is a bit pricey but well worth it, especially if you have dry scalp or dandruff. Also, if you have a child in school, it will help keep lice away. You can find some really good deals on it on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this in place of Head And Shoulders to keep his dandruff under control. I love it for the deep clean it gives my scalp and hair, and its invigorating scent. If you want an all-purpose shampoo that is all-around good for you, shell out for this one.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo does exactly what I wanted it for. An excellent product.</li>
            <li> With this shampoo and matrix conditioning balm paired with the teatree matching conditioner (using them both at the same time), my hair after two weeks is amazing. Smooth, shiny, and I cannot wait until a year or so until I can cut off my dead ends and start anew with my hair. I highly recommend using the matching conditioner with any shampoo you purchase, however this shampoo and conditioner is not enough for my hair to leave it smooth and the matrix conditioning balm is truly a miracle worker. Pricey but if you cannot afford this plus coloring your hair, you should not color your hair. Shampoo and conditioner is the utmost importance in your hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> Toxic cancer chemicals found in Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special Shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and will discontinue use since learning of this horrible finding. I am beyond angry and wonder if there is a civil lawsuit to join!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The Center for Environmental Health (CEH) revealed independent testing on Tuesday finding a cancer-causing chemical in 98 shampoos, soaps and other personal care products sold by major national retailers. The chemical, cocamide diethanolamine (cocamide DEA), a chemically-modified form of coconut oil used as a thickener or foaming agent in many products, was listed by California as a known carcinogen last year.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A full list of products that contain the chemical Concamide Diethanolamine (Cocamide DEA) can be found here:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo. Cleans hair and leaves it soft and get rid of the dandruff from my scalp. Smells nice as well.</li>
            <li> the shampoo looks pretty scary with green streaks in it. When I first used it, I applied a bit too much, the menthol was so strong, I couldn&#x27;t open my eyes. I didn&#x27;t feel tingling sensation. It feels cool because of the menthol. It is of course better than the $3 Suave shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. I still have doubt whether this is authentic Paul Mitchel product. I&#x27;ve ordered Paul Mitchel Tee Tree Shampoo from drugstore.com. It was clear color and has no menthol. I&#x27;d rather there&#x27;s no menthol in it. I don&#x27;t like mint flavor.</li>
            <li> We love the Tea Tree Special, but the shampoo that I rec&#x27;d today was the Lemon Sage thickening shampoo...plus, it is a busted bottle that is all over the inside of the box....very disappointed....</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shampoo for my hair type.  I have long, fine hair that tends to be oily.  I use this shampoo first and Nexxus Simply Silver or Platinum Pro second.  Using the Tea Tree shampoo first removes all hair product and leaves my hair very clean.  The second shampoo with Nexxus tones my blonde hair and softens it a bit (Tea Tree Shampoo does have a clarifying effect, so the suggestion about using a deep conditioner afterwards is a good one if you have dry, color treated or damaged hair...either that or do as I do and use a more gentle shampoo after).  Also the strong minty/eucalyptus fragrance isn&#x27;t for everyone.  I personally like it but if you&#x27;re wanting a more floral, citrus or neutral scent, you probably won&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> It has helped fight dandruff and reduce hairloss for my hubby. Once a week usage for me keeps dandruff at bay. I dont use the conditioner, just the shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic and worth the money. It doesn&#x27;t get extremely bubbly or foamy, but it still cleans well, without leaving any residue. It does strip your hair of oil and product build up, so if you have dry hair, use a conditioner in conjunction with this shampoo. It feels and smells great, and the minty scent is very \\&quot;invigorating,\\&quot; as described on the package. It&#x27;s great to wake up in the morning and feel refreshed by washing your hair with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Bottle leaking in box pump dosnt work and someone taped it .</li>
            <li> our favorite family shampoo - rarely stings the eyes but cleans very well with a nice scent. Some tea tree shampoos remind me of my dog&#x27;s shampoo - this one is super and distinctively not like you&#x27;re dog&#x27;s shampoo!</li>
            <li> I was all of a sudden having some dry scaly patches on my scalp and my hair stylist recommended this shampoo instead of dandruff shampoo. Over my life I have used EVERY (almost) shampoo out there. This shampoo may be clarifying, but I have not found my hair to be dry and unmanageable at all. The opposite is true. My hair is shinier than I can remember in years. I do use the accompanying conditioner. When I do not want to wash my hair so frequently, I use the conditioner only in between after workouts. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo. But had leaked during shipping. And I still can&#x27;t get the pump to work</li>
            <li> I ordered this product ON OCTOBER 19TH ago buying directly from Amazon.com. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT TO DATE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 45 days of waiting for my order I have just received notification that the delivery is FURTHER DELAYED. If amazon was not going to supply the product why allow me to place order AND WAIT LIKE AN IDIOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is despicable in my opinion. I am a frequent Amazon.com customer. Making weekly purchases and I am severely disappointed. (THEREFORE THE ONE STAR RATING)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[EDIT] 03 Jul 2013,&lt;br /&gt;The product did arrive about two weeks after I posted this comment. I used Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo and conditioner in the past, and I&#x27;ve bought it beforehand in smaller containers from retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying on Amazon.com cost me at least half less what i would normally pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shampoo i received was the ORIGINAL stuff. I&#x27;m really happy with it. If anyone knows what it feels like on your scalp with the Genuine product, then you know what i mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very cool, slightly tingly feeling on scalp. The scent is very minty and refreshing. Hair feels great afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For women who colour their hair, ive read it works well at preserving and protecting the colour as well as keeping their scalp healthy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(REVIEW CHANGED TO FIVE STARS, Product was authentic)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000MD65FO Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo, 33.8 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I have bought the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo and it was great. Previously I have read up a of review on certain Paul Mitchell products not genuine being sold in amazon, I was quite taken back. But after trying it, I realised that it was the same. Its is 100% original and it gives a tingling effect on your scalp. One of the to three shampoo I tried so far, Really awesome.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, especially if you have dandruff like I do. Glad I bought it !!</li>
            <li> I have used this before, in fact ever since I tried it,, it is all I use.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service, item was shipped promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years after it was recommended by our stylist.  It is refreshing, moisturizing, and keeps both hair and scalp in excellent condition.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo.  Has a nice mint scent to it.  Love the pump; much easier to use than shaking a bottle upside down.  Also, my scalp seems calmer (always itching due to hair color).</li>
            <li> This fine shampoo has cleared up my folliculitis.  I didn&#x27;t have a bad case, just a few ingrown hairs every now and again. It took no time at all to clear this up.  It also leaves the whole bathroom smelling nice.</li>
            <li> I reside in a hot and dusty locality, with lots of minerals.  For years my Belgian neighbors have complained (lots of arguing) about the lackluster foliage on the tea tree in my front yard.  After many attempts, I was at the end of my rope, contemplating the chain-saw as a solution.  Then someone in my group suggested Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo, and I gave it a try.  Now I get nothing but compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, mix one 55-gallon drum of Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo with 5000 gallons of lukewarm rainwater and apply generously to your tea tree using an aircraft de-icing boom-truck.  Make sure you work it into the branches nearest the trunk.  Allow it to soak for half a day.  To rinse, ignite the dead branches near the base of the tree and call the fire department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> It smells &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; and it makes your scalp feel &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; but found out later that it may cause cancer (according to a list of shampoos that have a certain ingredient). I sent it back for a refund, but shipping ended up costing as much as the shampoo itself.</li>
            <li> Great salon quality for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Love the tingle from the shampoo, though is marginally weaker than the first time I used it.  I just think my scalp is used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for dry scalp.  As a balding male, i can use a teardrop a day and this bottle will undoubtedly last me a year.</li>
            <li> This shampoo arrived very quickly and was well packaged.  It&#x27;s genuine Paul Mitchell, and works very well.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t heed comments about the fragrance.  It&#x27;s advertised as lavender, and peppermint.  All I can smell is peppermint, which is not my favorite way to start my day.  I&#x27;ll order a different PM shampoo next time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found to calm the snowfall on my head. Because it&#x27;s expensive, I use it every other or every third shampoo, and that seems to be frequent enough to work. I can tell if I haven&#x27;t used it frequently enough, because my scalp lets me know.</li>
            <li> Works great! My best friend is a hairdresser and she recommend this for dry itchy winter scalp. It works just great, got rid of the itch plus the minty smell is very energizing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the wonders it does to my hair. However, the reason that I&#x27;m giving this 2/5 stars is because it arrived with a broken pump, so I couldn&#x27;t get the shampoo out of the bottle the way it was designed to be used. The entire pump mechanism came out of the bottle when I tried to fix it. I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the seller&#x27;s fault or a shipping issue, but I was thoroughly dissatisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo once a week.  I use my regular shampoo the rest of the time.  The tea tree shampoo keeps my scalp clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> My scalp gets very itchy from time to time. Nothing has really helped. I wanted to give this a try. Bought it from Merchant BuySalon on Nov 6th. Received it on Nov 13th. Good package. Bottle was not leaked or damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read people have tingling feels after using it, and some people didn&#x27;t. Well, I have experienced the tingling. It felt very good and fun. Kind of like when I have a peppermint in my mouth. Hopefully this will stop my itchy scalp in the long run. Also, I think this could be a good body wash too.</li>
            <li> Great value and awesome size.I have use this shampoo for the past 20 years. It is TOPS above head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I love this use this everywhere. Talk about a tingle that makes you want to mingle! Enjoy, I know I do!</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but I just absolutely love this shampoo.  Expensive, but leaves my hair feeling really clean.  My hair is naturally oily, but after using this shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily, but it also doesn&#x27;t feel dried out.  Must be the mint...</li>
            <li> Bottle cap leaked in the packaging. Was not sealed to prevent. Lost a good amount of product on the packaging material.:-(</li>
            <li> I feel refreshed whenever I use this. The minty aroma&#x27;s invigoration is the perfect way to wake up and greet the day.</li>
            <li> We love this shampoo.  Works really well for my oily hair.  Has eliminated all the flakes my husband used to get.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from a bad scalp, this shampoo will definitely reduce your problems. I have used Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo exclusively for almost 20 years. It may be on the expensive side when you compare it to any \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; shampoo out there, but this works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma and skin tingling effect are very noticeable upon first use. I attribute that as a sign of it working its magic. Definitely an eye opener in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I have found it at Amazon. It&#x27;s not an easy product to find in my town.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I have used is years.  Love the tingly feeling it provides the scalp. Alivates my dandruff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as I expected it to be and in a large bottle with a pump. Smells good. Lathers good. Cleans good.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, fine, greasy hair, and wear a hardhat in a hot environment almost daily. This shampoo leaves my hair very clean, and makes my hair a lot less greasy. It also has a great tingly feel when washing, and smells great. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I order this all the time and shampoo is great. Problem is the pump is always broken by the time it arrives.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. It cleans the scalp well and leaves a minty scent. Tingly. And the price from Viv is really good because the salon charges A LOT more for something this size (33.8 oz.). I have med/short hair and this lasted me 5 months. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> perfect shampoo just wish they made this in a bigger size</li>
            <li> I like this invigorating shampoo---it&#x27;s fresh herb odor, and I find it is the best shampoo for my thinning, permed hair. I have been using this shampoo for six months now.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the price.  This shampoo has a wonderful smell and gets your hair squeaky clean.  However, the tea tree oil smell is strong.</li>
            <li> Horrible! You can&#x27;t unscrew the pump assembly to make it work. A slimy mess. Do NOT buy his product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product... the menthol is refreshing, BUT I don&#x27;t feel that it works at all to help control/get rid of dry scalp and/or dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not worth the high price tag...</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It makes my head tingle and smells nice.  Also it cleans my hair.</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping, Great Item. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works great without drying hair and leaves scalp peppermint-y fresh and tingly. First started using this on my child for severe case of dandruff (brought on after surgery from head trauma). He has TONS of allergies and we could not find anything, over the counter or dermatologist recommended, that worked. While doing research online, discovered tea tree benefits and after a few clicks, found Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree shampoo. Figured, WHY NOT, worth a try, nothing else is working and this kid has been thru enough, he doesn&#x27;t need smelly flaky dandruff to boot. We tried it and, no kidding, within 3 washes (rinse repeat until under control, then drop down to wash/rinse), his dandruff was GONE - for good! That was over a year ago and we continue to use it every other day to keep him squeaky clean and smelling great (PS: his Dermatologist said to wash hair every other day; I use this on myself every day and it is perfect, gentle and effective).</li>
            <li> Hello, I am a Paul Mitchell trained stylist... PLEASE DO NOT buy any Paul Mitchell products: online, grocery stores etc.  These products are not the REAL Paul Mitchell... You can ONLY get the real thing at a salon... This is called \\&quot;product diversion\\&quot; and it something the beauty industry fights on a daily basis...If not bought in a salon the product could be counterfeit, old etc.</li>
            <li> If you have never used Tea Tree shampoo, you don&#x27;t know what you are missing.  Helps with dry scalp or dandruff and feels &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; when applied.</li>
            <li> I use this when I get an itchy head or dandruff starts to appear. This gets rid of it in no time and I highly recommend it. I doubt I could use this as an every day shampoo or even every other, its more like a once a week type shampoo due to the mega cleaning it does.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for several years now.  I can&#x27;t say enough for how well it cleans the hair, without stripping, and cools the scalp with a plesant tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run and workout during the day and I&#x27;ve found that this shampoo does an excellent job of cleaning my hair and leaving it with a clean, fresh scent.  Better still, it leaves the scalp with a lingering cool sensation.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband b/c he loves the product and I thought it would be good to have a big pump in the shower instead of buying small bottles all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First - when it arrived, it had leaked all over the place during shipping. Luckily it was wrapped in a plastic bag, but it was still a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, we couldn&#x27;t get the pump to open/work properly and ultimately the topmost part of it came off completely from us trying. Now we will have to pour the shampoo from this bottle into a smaller bottle anyway, so that defeats the purpose of the big pump bottle. :( Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great cleans your hair great.</li>
            <li> Long time user of this product!</li>
            <li> great value at this size.  The tea tree in the shampoo is just invigorating and helps me to wake up in the morning.  Make sure the vendor sends this in a secure package.  The last one leaked but the vendor worked with me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair feeling cool and refreshing.  It was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Works very well at controlling flaking and dandruff.  would highly recommend this product and would definitely buy again.  Good price too.</li>
            <li> Good stuff ... you can actually feel the cleaning action ... and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> This a great shampoo, my hair dresser used it on me and I found it refreshing and it made my hair feel clean and I immediately asked her what she was using and she said \\&quot; Tea Tree by Paul Mitchell\\&quot;. I used it in combination with my detangler shampoo.</li>
            <li> Very soothing on your skin I use it on my whole body especially when I&#x27;m tired. It does a great job on my hair too</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  It works so well to get a deep cleanse on the hair and scalp.  Don&#x27;t need to use very much at a time or very often.  The scent and the feel are very refreshing and lovely.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite shampoo so I got it for him as a present. It&#x27;s also very expensive in my opinion for shampoo. When we opened it the pump was already in the bottle and taped down, not like usual where pumps are taped to the side for placement buy the consumer. The shipping package was also inadequate and so the pump was damaged, product had leaked all over the box creating a mess, a complete waste of money. Really unhappy and will never order from this shipper again, even though the product itself is a good one.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing. As someone who works long hours, having the chance to use this in the morning to wake you up is priceless. There are other competitors out there who use a similar formula to create the tingly feeling and smell. I have tried those competitors because of their low price. However, I always came back disappointed as they were never able to exceed this shampoo. It is such an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;  Now it is a pricey compared to other shampoos, which may make you second guess this purchase. However, let me say that you only need a very tiny amount to cause a big lather build up. So the product will last for a long time and be worth the price!</li>
            <li> We have been using the Tea Tree Shampoo for several years now. It smells great and makes you feel clean. When you use it in the morning you will wake up guaranteed!</li>
            <li> My husband started requesting this shampoo- highly unusual for this manly dude. The tea tree and mint really invigorate the skalp and wake the body up in the morning. The shower smells so nice afterward too!</li>
            <li> It leaves your scalp feeling tingly. I also leaves your scalp feeling clean and it got rid of my dandruff.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I was really hoping this shampoo would be for me.  But after two months of using every day, I still have really bad dandruff and an itchy scalp. Also, when I wash my hair, it feels as though my head is freezing until I dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The best treatment for Dandruff. They should advertize this more for Dandruff sufferers. I tried every shampoo in the market but this definitely works much better.</li>
            <li> Received my order very quickly.  Awesome product!  I highly recommend.  Have tried similar products but went back to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s brand.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> This large bottle has lasted me a very long time. The pumps keep the amount at a minimum so you aren&#x27;t getting out too much. It smells nice and helps with dandruff.</li>
            <li> I routinely get ingrown hairs on my scalp and head.  I had heard that this shampoo helped minimize the damaged hair growth and soften my hair.  I have been using the shampoo for almost a month now and am very pleased with the product. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Super price and value!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband who has dandruff.  Well, he HAD dandruff.  The Tea Tree shampoo is great if you have dandruff.  The smell is awesome - it&#x27;s minty.  My husband&#x27;s hair looks great!</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is that it controls the oily hair.  It does not prevent lice, like I read in some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> It works as needed with my doctor.</li>
            <li> PM Tea Tree shampoo never disappoints. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I find the scent refreshing, the gentle tingling refreshing, and the pump very convenient. I am very happy with the shampoo, although it is a little expensive. Also note that Amazon was not able to ship it without the shampoo leaking.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the not bad at all, I changed different type of shampoos all the time from amazon, so far this is one of the best.  It arrived very fast, and packaged nicely, nothing leak and damaged.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo a few days ago and when i put it in my hair it felt like silk.  However, when I washed it out, all the shampoo washes down your back and it hurt my back with a cooling/burning feeling like the kind you get with frost-bite.  I don&#x27;t know if my skin is sensitive or I&#x27;m allergic to a certain ingredient, because I&#x27;m not allergic to anything, really.  But, I gave this 3 stars because my hair was soft and healthy and it worked on my hair.  It has a great scent to it, also.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the better shampoos around at the moment. It does exactly what it says and never disappoints. The price might be a little high but don&#x27;t let that hinder you. It is worth every penny!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my opinion and some advice regarding this shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Be frugal. This shampoo lathers very nicely and so a small amount goes a long way. A quarter dollar-sized amount will be enough for men&#x27;s short/medium hair and a bit larger amount will do it for longer/women&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; The scent of this shampoo is very good and soothing. It refreshes you. The scent is kind of like a cross between that of eucalyptus and mint.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; When properly messaged into the scalp, it gives a tingling sensation (menthol). I found it very handy in shaking off the grogginess in the morning!!!&lt;br /&gt;&gt; It leaves your hair feeling smooth and clean. However, I don&#x27;t recommend this as a daily use shampoo, use it more like an &#x27;in-between&#x27; shampoo as it tends to dry out your hair/scalp with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; For awesome results follow it up with [[ASIN:B000UPOBRI Paul Mitchell Leave-in Moisturizer Conditioner]]. The accompanying Tea Tree Conditioner doesn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; My girlfriend is a die-hard fan of the Aussie line of hair products and rarely tries anything else. Once she had this itching problem with the scalp that just won&#x27;t go away so I asked her to give my shampoo a shot and, surprisingly, two days later it was gone!! So I guess this shampoo works wonders for some scalp problems as well.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; ALWAYS buy this shampoo from a salon. Paul Mitchell doesn&#x27;t guarantee the authenticity of this product when bought from elsewhere (it says so on the back of the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&gt; You also buy this shampoo for a cause; every purchase leads to a tree planted somewhere in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusively, this shampoo comes highly recommended from my side.</li>
            <li> They use this at the place I get my haircut and I&#x27;ve always liked the smell so I bought it from Amazon. unfortunately the product, while in the same bottle, doesn&#x27;t seem the same. It&#x27;s a more intense green and instead of tingling it feels more like burning.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I have been using this for a month or so and I love it.  A little tingle before you rinse it out.  my dry scalp is gone, along with the flakes!  I think I have found my shampoo!</li>
            <li> Great price! Lasts my husband about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my stylist was sold out and I just couldn&#x27;t wait.  He had used this on my hair earlier in the week and I loved it so much I couldn&#x27;t wait for his shippment to come in.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> First encountered this at my barber&#x27;s. Rich lather, stimulating tingle, cool and refreshing scent, and leaves your hair deeply cleaned without brittle dryness. Great product!</li>
            <li> The tea tree oils totally burn my eyes even if they only go near my eyes. It&#x27;s really disturbing to feel all that tingling around my eyes as I take a shower. Why is it so strong??</li>
            <li> I found the peppermint overwhelms the shampoo, not crazy about the cool mint tingle effect.  Disappointed since I was hoping for a Tea Tree shampoo, I&#x27;ve had good luck with Bronners Tea Tree products.</li>
            <li> Love this..purchased first bottle from bath works...much better pricing on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a couple years and wont stop anytime soon. I originally thought I had dandruff, but all the dandruff shampoos did was dry out my scalp even more. I saw this recommended online and it solved all of my problems. I use this maybe once or twice a week and it keeps my scalp moisturized. This size bottle also lasts me about a year or more.</li>
            <li> Good product just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected. I have used a Paul Mitchell green tea shampoo before that really left a head &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;. This isn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> This is the best one for dandruff for my boyfriend. He used to try much small bottle of it and most of dandruff go away. So right now I bought a bigger one for my boy</li>
            <li> Ordered this product over 2 months ago, but still not even close to shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And AMAZON sent me email a month ago said they will work on it, but no!&lt;br /&gt;Now it will be delayed for the new year, and maybe beyond my imagination-----forever</li>
            <li> Enjoyed finding this volume for the price but packaging left something to be desired.  Arrived leaking into the box so i had plenty of cleanup to do since it had run down onto the bottle, making a slippery mess...</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever! The shampoo I hoard and dole out in tiny sample bottles so the rest of the family doesn&#x27;t use it all up. Smells and feels awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband and I can&#x27;t quit using it myself. Will be buying another bottle for sure.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping-great product.</li>
            <li> Leaves a lovely tingly feeling after each wash.  I like the menthol and tea tree oil scent.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another type of shampoo again!</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised. This is one of the few shampoos that relieve my itchy scalp. While it appears expensive it doesn&#x27;t require two applications per use and it doesn&#x27;t need a large amount to work. Because of that cost per use is probably less that other products.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo my husband will use.  He shampoos daily, and finds the tea tree to be best.</li>
            <li> Do you have thin and oily hair? Then this shampoo is your savior!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the most effective way to use this shampoo is to lather up my hair with this shampoo, masssage my scalp, and leave it in while I wash the rest of my face and body. Your scalp will start to feel tingly and minty after a few minutes. Let the shampoo work its magic! Rinsing it out at the end of the shower leaves your head feeling clean, fresh, and very minty! The bottle is huge and will last months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great as well, like mint chocochip ice cream! Absolutely no complaints. Make sure you buy the authentic brand, fake or imitations won&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li> In case you have dry scalp this is a worth while buy.  This shampoo definitely cleans your hair more thoroughly than anything else along with taking care of dray scalp.</li>
            <li> Love the clean invigorating feel after cleaning my hair with the Tea Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Expensive, but well worht it. Very invigorating on the scalp and smells great!</li>
            <li> Very good product for men with thick or thin hair.  Very refreshing feeling and good smell, a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo, but it says it&#x27;s color-safe, yet the label says it contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which means it is NOT color-safe.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works, pure and simple.  Sure it&#x27;s over priced, but - it delivers a fantastic result - Clean, tingly scalp and shiny, easy to manage hair.  I&#x27;m just an aging hippy with shoulder-length+ hair - works for me!</li>
            <li> I rediscovered this shampoo after a recent trip to my mother-in-law&#x27;s, and liked it so much I decided to get some for myself.  For some reason, the bottle I got was more watery than hers and the tingle factor of mine wasn&#x27;t as intense as what I experienced with her bottle.  As it was purchased directly from Amazon and not a 3rd party seller, I would assume that this bottle was the authentic product, and not a knock-off - but I&#x27;m not too sure.</li>
            <li> The best to scalp &amp; dandruf</li>
            <li> It kept away the dandruff and smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also cheaper than the tingly lube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Paul! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this shampoo.  I was struggling with dry scalp and breakouts of scalp acne.  Since using this product for several months I no longer have those issues!  Love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> Love this Shampoo / it seems to last forever. When (if) it runs out - I will buy another bottle!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for numerous years and find that I never have a dry scalp or dandruff. It has a distinctive smell that I recognize as Tea Tree oil but others have liked and described it as &amp;#34;minty.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Im burning out on the eucalyptus smell, and it takes alot since it doesn&#x27;t lather up any better than a conditioner would.  Back to my store-bought stuff after i&#x27;m done with it</li>
            <li> Great deal for this product.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because this shampoo feels great on my scalp. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different shampoos over the years, but this ones feels the best.</li>
            <li> This is a great tea tree based shampoo. The large bottle with pump lasts over one year, so it is very cost effective.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it makes hair shine.  The smell of the shampoo is delightful.  The peppermint tingles your scalp.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great shampo and I like the tingling feeling you get on your scalp after you use it!</li>
            <li> Good nourishing shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am still looking for a shampoo that will not dry out my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was better than the brand I was using, but my scalp still itches and is flaky.</li>
            <li> This product, unlike others I&#x27;ve tried \\&quot;massages or invigorates\\&quot; the scalp. It smells great too. The gal that cuts my hair introduced the product to me years ago.&lt;br /&gt;As a guy with really short hair I use this because I like the sensation and the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he had mentioned he used it years ago and loved it. After trying it out again, he said he won&#x27;t ever go back to using any other shampoo again :)</li>
            <li> My hairdresser got me started using this. Well, actually my wife did, after she got a sample from our hairdresser (yes, we both use the same lady!). I&#x27;ve had a thinning spot on the top of my head for years. It was slowly getting larger until I started using this shampoo. Must be something about the tingling/stimulating sensation in the shampoo that keeps more hair from falling out. It&#x27;s expensive for shampoo, but it has kept me from growing balder/older looking, and my hair always feels great after using it.</li>
            <li> I have slightly oily, coarse hair.  This shampoo leaves my hair squeaky clean and has a minty fresh scent.  The tingling sensation is like a peppermint for your scalp.  I&#x27;ve used this shampoo occasionally for a few weeks now and I like it.  My wife finds that it smells nice and calms her mild frizzy hair.  This is a good product if you don&#x27;t mind the higher price.</li>
            <li> My barber felt this would help with the continuos issue I had with my scalp breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this shampoo for approximately 2 months and my scalp is the it has been in several years.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for my children.  They use it for dandruff.  It smells great and really keeps their hair clean.  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY oily hair and was told to try this product and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I was actually told to try this a year ago but decided not to bc of the price and now I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my time with another shampoo. HOWEVER I bought mine at a beauty supply store and it actually says on the bottle that if its not sold at a professional salon than do not trust that it is a true Paul Mitchell product!</li>
            <li> I use this in rotation with my regular shampoo 1-2x a week (since it&#x27;s a bit pricey), and I love the fresh scent and tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> Have been using this stuff for many years. I just recently started getting it online because where i used to get it closed down.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell and clean feeling that it gives.</li>
            <li> I actually love this product BUT......It was shipped in with another order and the plastic around shampoo was torn and shampoo leaked out. It was all over the box too. The cap was partially broken. I cleaned it up and will use the balance...but in all my years of using amazon, this is my first complaint. How about a discount on this item? Make it at no cost.</li>
            <li> Bought this a couple months ago for the first time.  My hair stylist recommended it, because I was complaining about having such a dry scalp.  I don&#x27;t have that problem much anymore.  I like almost everything about this product.  First, it really helped my flaking head; it has that nice dispenser plunger, so I don&#x27;t have to fool around with picking up the bottle; it takes very little shampoo (one pump) to get a really good lather; and it feels good on my scalp.  The only downside I&#x27;ve experienced is that there&#x27;s a little camphor or menthol or something in it that stings if it gets in my eyes.  So don&#x27;t do that!  Otherwise, enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for a number of years, and I think it is one of the best.  I intend to try the mint shampoo next.</li>
            <li> this was recommended to me by a friend and it has done everything they said it would and then some</li>
            <li> This product burns so good.  Yes, it takes some time to get used to.  It burns your scalp, your eyes, the inside of your nose (If you wash your face with it) but it heals up your head like nothing else.  If you have any cuts, scrapes or red spots on your head, they will be gone almost overnight.  Dandruff... phhhttt, Gone.  After a month of use, you will never want to try anything else.</li>
            <li> Refreshing  for my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Like the smell, but it is really herbal sweet smell . If you do not like that do not buy it.  My hair is bleached, dyed and frizzy  This shampoo Leave my hair soft .&lt;br /&gt;. I use it with  P. M. tea tree leave in conditioner.  I will buy it  again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for over 4 years and it&#x27;s great.  This bottle size will probably serve my needs for most of a year so the value is difficult to beat.</li>
            <li> Love the tingling sensation and the minty smell of this shampoo.  It&#x27;ll wake you up and invigorate you in the morning.  It leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Feels really nice  after shower and makes itching stop</li>
            <li> The stylist at the JC Penny Salon used to use this on me all the time and I liked it! So, I started buying it on a pretty regular basis. Yes it&#x27;s expensive, but just a little bit goes a very long way! It feels great on my scalp... there&#x27;s a minty cooling sensation. Unfortunately, JC Penny no longer carries this, so I was so happy to find it here on Amazon. One problem though... mine leaked in shipping. I blame the seller for this... not the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> My hair cutting place uses this shampoo and each time they washed my hair, my scalp felt like it was tingling a bit. So I finally broke down and bought the big bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-leaves your hair and scalp feeling clean&lt;br /&gt;-tingly feeling for your scalp&lt;br /&gt;-great scent (if you like tea tree)&lt;br /&gt;-does not require a lot to clean a lot of hair, so you won&#x27;t run out quickly&lt;br /&gt;-pump-action (if this size was the traditional snap open lid, you&#x27;d get carpal tunnel)&lt;br /&gt;-dispenses not too much, not too little on each use&lt;br /&gt;-wife approved (she&#x27;s used it a few times)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but you do get what you pay for (still worth it)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years (it&#x27;s the BEST!)and the first time I have purchased this type product online- usually buy at Sportsclips. Had an initial problem with shipping damage by FEDEX and seller replaced in a timely fashion. Will be glad to do business with them again!</li>
            <li> A hairdresser recommended this product to my son who recommended it to me and it is the best shampoo I have used.</li>
            <li> Helped clear acne on my head.  Feels so good and cool too.  I found this when i went to a sportsclip and they used it.&lt;br /&gt;The bad part is i&#x27;m totally hooked on the stuff.  I wanted to use it once/wk but now end up using it daily.  I wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> Being a guy, a very manly one, I&#x27;ve shunned &amp;#34;beauty products&amp;#34; the majority of my life. After trying this stuff when I got my haircut last I was quite impressed. It feels like your scalp got blasted by a york peppermint patty or something! I don&#x27;t know if that sensation actually does anything or not but it feels great!</li>
            <li> Got it something like 3 weeks after I ordered it. The price was well below everyone else but if I needed shampoo within that week, I&#x27;d be stealing some from the girlfriend.</li>
            <li> My fiance loves this shampoo!!! He has used this bottle for over a year, and still has some left. Great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> It used to be a favorite but a few other products have come on line that are even better. Would say it is better for men than women&lt;br /&gt;as it leaves my hair too dry</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and the fact it comes with a pump!</li>
            <li> he loves it and has me purchase it. he uses nothing else, for several years.&lt;br /&gt;  that is all, filling in the amount of words required.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I personally use it as all over body/hair wash. Have been using it for years. Will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband he loves it. It has a great smell and it cleans very well. I would recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good item.  I love how it smells and makes your scalp tingle when shampooing with it.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, you can feel it working on your scalp, the smell is crisp and refreshing, would highly recommend it, the whole family is using it!!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. My hair is thinning (not bald) and it give my hair a clean and shinning finish. The tingle feels awesome on my scalp. I&#x27;ve used this product fro years.</li>
            <li> Irritated my scalp, cannot use. Guess my scalp is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and suffered from dandruff for a long time. Then one of my friends recommended this shampoo to me, which really works! In addition I like the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is one of the few available to which I am not allergic.  It has a wonderfully clean scent and does a beautiful job.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this shampoo. It smells really good and my hair was smooth and clean. We did however receive a broken pump so its hard to get the shampoo out of the bottle. I&#x27;m not sure if the box was dropped many times before we received it.</li>
