            <li>I am 51, &amp;#34;olive complected&amp;#34;, but generally fair skinned.  </li>

            <li>Very happy with my purchase, the price is such a good deal.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love this lotion,  Out of all the ones I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>The gentleman who introduced me to this also mentioned the price for this on Amazon is MUCH better than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I first purchased this lotion from a reputable tanning salon and LOVED it....</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and it rubs on well-just be sure to while off your hands and not wear light clothes right after tanning.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best so far.</li>
            <li>lol i told the girl awhile back</li>
            <li>I used it over a few days, and it produced the best tan I have had in YEARS!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li>Not bad,  </li>
            <li>Product was shipped quickly and I had no problems would recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>I decided to take a chance on this with just the few reviews that it had and so happy I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being the first thing ive bought on amazon</li>
            <li>your prices are 1/2 the prices of tanning salons and they are the real thing!</li>
            <li>Works really well in a bronzing tanning bed!</li>
            <li>Fast service!  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, if you want to enhance the color you can achieve in a short session outside, you will be VERY pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This product warns on the label that it &amp;#34;does NOT contain sunscreen&amp;#34;, so certainly use with caution.  </li>
            <li>but This is 100% real le moment tanning lotion..</li>
            <li>Pretty disappointed that my lotion came in shrink wrap that was perfectly slit open at the top.</li>
            <li>Only other thing to be aware of is that it will discolor fabrics, like light colored towels you may be lying on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First things first, I&#x27;m Hawaiian and German.</li>
            <li>When I do, I usually put on SPF of 50 or more.  </li>
            <li>It clearly could have been tampered with and may not be 100%</li>
            <li>Does make skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have to say this one really works, almost instant results.</li>
            <li>After 3 sessions I was super dark and bronze.</li>
            <li>well she tried to tell me &amp;#34;oh check the ingrediants the lotions on line have water as the first few ingrediants&amp;#34; there not the real thing&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>The second bottle I purchased was totally different lotion, was even a different color when it came out of the bottle,  The first bottle was chocolate brown in color</li>
            <li>I normally do not get out in the sun too much at all.</li>
            <li>the high quality lotion I expected.</li>
            <li>and it will really get you dark, but i wont spend about 80.00 for it there</li>
    </ol>

            <li> the salesperson said that that was normal, not sure about the lighter color stuff.</li>
            <li> long</li>
            <li> I have tried it in multiple level beds and have had little to no results.</li>
            <li> So I get very dark, and in the winter time, I get very white!</li>
            <li> u walk in white walk out black.!</li>
            <li> and I was so dark darker</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s been about a week and a half since I&#x27;ve gone tanning</li>
            <li> some of the color will wash off in the shower but the longer you wait to shower the less run off there is.</li>
            <li> i was a little scared</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> i wont waste my $ buying lotions at my salon..</li>
            <li> The lotion I got from this seller was nowhere near the same... TOTAL disappointment!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been at least 3 months since I had gone tanning, and within a week I was so dark with this lotion.</li>
            <li> and Ive never been this dark!!</li>
            <li> one thing I&#x27;d like to point out is, the lotion is very dark and thick.</li>
            <li> This makes u at least 3-4 shades darker it</li>
            <li> I mean I went 4 weeks without tanning and tanned with this</li>
            <li> Was a bit disappointed when I ordered another bottle a few months later.  </li>
            <li> and she can&#x27;t stop talkin about how dark she is!!!!</li>
            <li> Product stinks.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with product.</li>

            <li> Leaves your skin orange and streaky.. This product was a waste of money. I only used it three times.. Save your money...</li>
            <li> Great product, great buying experience</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t that good. Kinda manly. And the lotion rubs off on clothes. Can see the lotion wash off in the shower. Does make skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking at buying this tanning lotion stop reading this and purchase. Now! This is amazing. Matter of fact buy 3 because this will be the only lotion you ever need or will ever want to use again. The smell is great, the consistency, everything. After 3 sessions I was super dark and bronze. I will never use another lotion again. Of course with any bronzing lotion you can have some discoloration of your hands but with this its not sticky and doesn&#x27;t transfer! I leave the lotion on for a couple hours after tanning because my skin loves it! It has become even softer and hydrated! I can&#x27;t say enough good things. Trust me, buy this and you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Mine just came by ups this morning.  GREAT product for GREAT price !!! Being the first thing ive bought on amazon i was a little scared but This is 100% real le moment tanning lotion.. This is the gucci or loui of all lotions.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion only three times and Ive never been this dark!! Love it</li>
            <li> Great product just love it!!!</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with product. Seller was great. Product stinks.</li>
            <li> I got it for my gf and she can&#x27;t stop talkin about how dark she is!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried several lotions over the years.  This is the absolute best so far.</li>
            <li> cant wait to try this lady at my tanning salon said this is the best lotion and it will really get you dark, but i wont spend about 80.00 for it there, i always buy my tanning lotions here your prices are 1/2 the prices of tanning salons and they are the real thing! lol i told the girl awhile back i get my lotions cheaper elsewhere... well she tried to tell me &amp;#34;oh check the ingrediants the lotions on line have water as the first few ingrediants&amp;#34; there not the real thing&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;  well when the salons lotions were like 40 percent off i got a bottle of there lotion, then i bought another one from this site.. so i went home and compared the labels.. they were identical!!!! i wont waste my $ buying lotions at my salon.. i buy 3 lotions here at a time and im good for like 5 or 6 months. cant wait to try this!!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion,  Out of all the ones I have tried over the years. I have to say this one really works, almost instant results. Was a bit disappointed when I ordered another bottle a few months later.  The second bottle I purchased was totally different lotion, was even a different color when it came out of the bottle,  The first bottle was chocolate brown in color the second bottle was a lot lighter in color (no instant bronze effect) I had a friend have the same experience, maybe the second bottle was defective or something.  I know it should be the darker color because I used a sample from the local tanning salon and the salesperson said that that was normal, not sure about the lighter color stuff.</li>
            <li> Awsome &amp; great price !</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazing</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I first purchased this lotion from a reputable tanning salon and LOVED it.... Excellent color! The lotion I got from this seller was nowhere near the same... TOTAL disappointment!! I have tried it in multiple level beds and have had little to no results. Would NOT recommend purchasing!!!</li>
            <li> Not bad,  but I&#x27;ve had better. It Will get on your clothes !</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but will stain your hands..</li>
            <li> Works really well in a bronzing tanning bed! Product was shipped quickly and I had no problems would recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> This is the s***. Idk how else to put it lol u walk in white walk out black.! This makes u at least 3-4 shades darker it last supperrrr long I mean I went 4 weeks without tanning and tanned with this and I was so dark darker then I&#x27;ve ever been it is amazing (:</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase and it arrived when it was suppose to. Definitely five stars</li>
            <li> Product was packaged perfectly, in sealed bag.. Very happy with my purchase, the price is such a good deal. I will buy again</li>
            <li> I decided to take a chance on this with just the few reviews that it had and so happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;First things first, I&#x27;m Hawaiian and German. So I get very dark, and in the winter time, I get very white! It&#x27;s been at least 3 months since I had gone tanning, and within a week I was so dark with this lotion. Now it&#x27;s been about a week and a half since I&#x27;ve gone tanning and I still have good color.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I&#x27;d like to point out is, the lotion is very dark and thick. However, once you rub the lotion in your hands a bit you&#x27;ll see that it thins out. Don&#x27;t be like me and think you have to have a ton and then you&#x27;re stuck trying to spread and rub it in forever! (lol)&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, and I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> A fellow traveler introduced me to Le Moment when I was in Cancun back in May of 2015.  I used it over a few days, and it produced the best tan I have had in YEARS!  I am 51, &amp;#34;olive complected&amp;#34;, but generally fair skinned.  I normally do not get out in the sun too much at all. When I do, I usually put on SPF of 50 or more.  This product warns on the label that it &amp;#34;does NOT contain sunscreen&amp;#34;, so certainly use with caution.  Nevertheless, if you want to enhance the color you can achieve in a short session outside, you will be VERY pleased with the results.  Only other thing to be aware of is that it will discolor fabrics, like light colored towels you may be lying on.  You will also want to wash your hands after applying.  The gentleman who introduced me to this also mentioned the price for this on Amazon is MUCH better than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed that my lotion came in shrink wrap that was perfectly slit open at the top. It clearly could have been tampered with and may not be 100% the high quality lotion I expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase!!!</li>
            <li> While not the most amazing tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, this is over all a great product! It has a ton of bronzes for a great color pay off with just one use-some of the color will wash off in the shower but the longer you wait to shower the less run off there is. The smell is nice and it rubs on well-just be sure to while off your hands and not wear light clothes right after tanning. I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Fast service!  The best bronzing tanning lotion!  This is my absolute favorite tanning lotion!!!</li>
