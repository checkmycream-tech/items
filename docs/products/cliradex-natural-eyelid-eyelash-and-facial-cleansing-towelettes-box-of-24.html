            <li>Fantastic delivery on this product which is costly all over the network but does a wonderful job as a specialty item.  </li>
            <li>I now use a wipe or two during the week to maintain the good results.  </li>
            <li>Each packet is good for one application.</li>

            <li>Eight week treatment with Cliradex wipes at night and warm compresses for 4 mins in the morning was completely successful for treating demodex mite infestation.  </li>
            <li>:) I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are healthy looking again, too!</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing for itchy and watery eyes.</li>
            <li>My eyes feel amazing.</li>
            <li>lipiflow - sounds like an amazing system).  </li>
            <li>Leaves nice warmth after use.</li>
            <li>Using it for Eye Mite control along with Trader Joes Tea Tree Tingle shampoo and it is controlling them nicely.</li>
            <li>eyes with warm water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said he had Cliradex samples in his office but never gave them out because no came into his office with the kind of eyelash symptoms he was looking for.</li>
            <li>He said he had Cliradex samples in his office but never gave them out because no came into his office with the kind of eyelash symptoms he was looking for.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need to use warm compresses.</li>
            <li>My eye doc thought this would be effective for demodex that she diagnosed.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I was kind of paranoid to try them.</li>
            <li>I had to rinse my eyes immediately with warm water to stop the burning...</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve done more harm than good trying these out.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Because of the wonderful results from this product, I finally took out the bottle of tea tree oil</li>
            <li>My issue is that it just isn&#x27;t making the redness in my eyes any better.</li>
            <li>I would have gladly paid the $40</li>
            <li>The Combination for me seems to be magic.</li>
            <li>Also, I found that products with collodial oatmeal helped me more than this.  </li>
            <li>I love them for my eyelids, nose, and eyebrows to relieve rosacea and blepharitis.</li>
            <li>The cornea specialist promised me that although it would burn, tea tree is not blinding :).</li>
            <li>I  know I won&#x27;t be :)</li>
            <li>I am glad my doctor gave me a couple of samples to try the product.  </li>
            <li>I suffer also from rosacea and acne and have tried many things, some of which have helped and others not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Especially at first</li>
            <li>Nothing works better than cliradex</li>
            <li>I need to order more</li>
            <li>I then put Theratears Sterilid gel on my lashes, top and bottom, and do NOT rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>My review is for me, your results may be better.</li>
            <li>have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>I love these wipes.</li>
            <li>This is NOT an immediate &amp;#34;Fix&amp;#34; as it take many applications to get results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going well however and there aren&#x27;t many alternatives</li>
            <li>Make sure you can tolerate the cooling menthol effect.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>This product has made great improvement on my 85 yr old mother&#x27;s eyelids!</li>
            <li>Those items were, Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap, Cliradex wipes, using an all natural anti-reddening cream and having a great sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash off the Cliradex at night, but I do give my eyes a good cleansing in the morning to remove it, first with an OcuSoft scrub, then with a clean washcloth (no soap).</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy on the eyes and provides comfort to the eye(s).</li>
            <li>It was just way too strong for my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I found it way to strong.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more of a sweet sting that comes from tea tree.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most pleasant experience, but it has made a big difference in the health of my eye lids</li>
            <li>me, that&#x27;s a huge huge YES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the itchyness until around week 4...</li>
            <li>I am 2 days into using this product and am blown away by the fantastic results.</li>
            <li>Although I am still uncertain if this is what I am experiencing, he gave me a free sample of the Cliradex wipes.</li>
            <li>To make them more economical, I took a tip from another reviewer and cut each wipe in four pieces with a well-cleaned scissors.</li>
            <li>The occusoft scrub did nothing on its own but worked really well with this product.</li>
            <li>Everything went smooth.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works to clear demodex mites from eyelashes and eyebrows, take off makeup, or use for a good pick me up in the morning.</li>
            <li>If these were more reasonably priced I would give it more stars</li>
            <li>It makes my eyes feel better right</li>
            <li>Very pricey!!!</li>
            <li>I sound like an infomercial, but I&#x27;m that excited.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and the product Is very drying</li>
            <li>Effective as advertised, but the price is too high.</li>
            <li>so, so excited.</li>
            <li>SO EXCITED about this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll gladly pay it if I can continue to see the same amazing results.</li>
            <li>I had been told to clean my eyes with baby soap, which I had been doing, for five years.</li>
            <li>It helps a great deal if you hold a warm, moist, clean washcloth over your eyes for a few minutes to loosen up any crusty bits first.</li>
            <li>just cool, clean feeling and no itch.</li>
            <li>But on a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being you want to claw your eyeballs right out of your head), I went from a 10 to a 3 or 4 after using one wipe!</li>
            <li>I had better luck with straight tea tree oil, which didn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
            <li>saw my ophthalmologist recently and he was flabbergasted at how good my eyelashes looked.</li>
            <li>I saw my ophthalmologist recently and he was flabbergasted at how good my eyelashes looked.</li>
            <li>but mom is not rubbing her eyes as much and seems to see better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural oils create a tingly sensation, and have a nice smell.</li>
            <li>When I stopped using them for a good 4 or 5 months, my blepharitis came back again.</li>
            <li>I wish that my eye doctor would carry these and they were sold at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My optometrist recommended this and after trying other things I gave in and was happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Cliradex&lt;br /&gt;Cliradex Eyelid, Eyelash, and Facial Cleansing...has completely gotten rid of my itching eye lashes  Strong smell but great product</li>
            <li>The boxes were pretty beat up, but the product was fine.</li>
            <li>No longer blurry and redness is quickly going away.</li>
            <li>Quick and as described</li>
            <li>When I read that people with Demodex have 10x as many mites as normal and tend to have acne, rosacea, and blepharitis, I immediately searched for a product to help me.</li>
            <li>At night, I clean my eyes with Cetaphyl, hot water, and an Equate Exfoliating cleansing towelette (rinsing the towelette first with clean water)  </li>
            <li>WELL WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>and I have not had to constantly tend to them by either wetting the lid or putting in drops or warm compresses.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly nice that no one has commented on my eyes being red since about a week after I began using this product.</li>
            <li>I have also been using a warm eye bag in the evening prior to Cliradex.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the most natural solution short of making your own.</li>
            <li>Either way...the relief I get is well worth it.</li>
            <li>It is the only product on the market that is immediately effective.  </li>
            <li>because dealing directly with the maker was some $6.00 more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Is all this worth it?</li>
            <li>It also works great as a natural facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It does burn/sting a lot but leaves my skin and eyes clean, soft and free from papules and irritation.  </li>
            <li>Good as any other wipe</li>
            <li>I have used every other day w/ good results...</li>
            <li>This is working for me right now, and I hope this routine helps someone else.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve missed a few days) but the difference is amazing!</li>
            <li>First, there are 24 packets in here, not a months worth.</li>
            <li>As pointed out in the comment section, one box of 24 is not exactly a months worth, but don&#x27;t get too hung up on that as 3.4 weeks should be fine in most cases.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please talk with your doc first though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is an immediate burn upon application from the vapors, but I actually found it to be refreshing in the way that Listerine burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cliradex has helped my eyes and skin become much healthier!</li>
            <li>My skin looks better and my pores are getting smaller.</li>
            <li>I am an artist, and need crisp vision to do my work.</li>
            <li>Wait until the stinging stops to open your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;--Do not use more than three wipe motions on each eye.</li>
            <li>Used hot compresses like my eyeMD told me too</li>
            <li>(100+push up of hot water) &amp; Cliradex.</li>
            <li>Got rid of it fast without antibiotic!</li>
            <li>It sting pretty severely when applied, though that dissipates withing 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>After just 2-3 weeks of using these every night on my lids, eyebrows, nose, cheeks, and rest of face (in that order -- lids first, then eyebrows, etc...), I am cured.</li>
            <li>Yet, my rosacea is already looking better, and I haven&#x27;t had a big pimple since I started.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking using a fresh wipe on my face will improve the rosacea and breakouts just as much as it improved my eyelids.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I remember to blink much more during the day.  </li>
            <li>as I know thereare many suffering with similar problems who are looking for answers.  </li>
            <li>but my eyelids were severely blistered and swollen after first use of this product.</li>
            <li>but I was able to cut each piece into smaller strips and used it for my eyelid.  </li>
            <li>but the individual envelopes can be used more that once, just reinsert, fold over and use again.</li>
            <li>I say to anyone who has my problems -- is manning up to one minute a day of pain that gets better every day worth being CURED of the hassle and pain of blepharitis and dry eyes?&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stings a bit when applying morning and evening, but kills the little buggers and provides exceptional relief.</li>
            <li>I have used them for just over 2 months; twice a day to keep the lashes clean and clear of debris.</li>
            <li>Well, I noticed an improvement on the first day, and it&#x27;s been about 6 weeks now and my vision is the most stable it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li>I need to wipe more than my eyelashes especially at night when my whole face would itch.</li>
            <li>and I do not see it available in any of the major chain drug stores.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time that very night.</li>
            <li>and it works pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Two full weeks of treatment has completely cleared her up</li>
            <li>Significant swelling lasting more than an hour likely indicates an allergic reaction and the product should be discontinued.  </li>
            <li>10 drops of coconut oil to one drop of pure tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I have taken Tobradex gel, Tobradex drops, have done the tea tree oil and baby shampoo cleanse, have done warm compresses, and finally scalding hot compresses and this is the only thing that keeps the recurring dots at bay.  </li>
            <li>My rigid gas permeable contacts are back in service, and feel just fine.</li>
            <li>It is very good, but expensive for one use at a time.</li>
            <li>In fact my eyes look normal for the first time in my life...</li>
            <li>I followed the directions very thoroughly, though and did not rub it on lower eyelid.</li>
            <li>The very next day my eyes remained pain free.</li>
            <li>Works better than the wet compresses/lid hygiene protocol I had been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>With that said I will most likely buy a few more boxes because I&#x27;d rather have some relief than no relief.</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t see how these are helping my blepharitus at all after 1 month of use.</li>
            <li>I could absolutely tell a difference as well.</li>
            <li>Do not take the whole wipe out of the sleeve and then cut it.</li>
            <li>They feel very \\&quot;menthol-y\\&quot; on the eyelid.</li>
            <li>These wipes really work.</li>
            <li>I learned that too much Cliradex sitting on my lids will gum up the meibomian glands on the eyelids (where the oil comes out).</li>
            <li>your face with a gentle fragrance-free cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;--Heat</li>
            <li>If you put too much of the Cliradex on your lids, it can plug up your meibomian glands on your eyelids (where the oil comes out).&lt;br /&gt;--Do not wash off the Cliradex.</li>
            <li>your face with a gentle fragrance-free cleanser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really made him think.</li>
            <li>It really made him think.</li>
            <li>For 42.99 I guess I expected more.</li>
            <li>I am concerned with using something that stings so much on my eye lids.</li>
            <li>They really do.</li>
            <li>it really helps with my blepharitis/mgd.  </li>
            <li>They were very helpful; would use them again, if needed</li>
            <li>Much improvement.</li>
            <li>I do not think it is harmful, but having to add drops 4 times a day really makes this condition take over your life.  </li>
            <li>Close your eyes and gently dab/swipe around the lid lash area.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the reimbursment for the postage.  </li>
            <li>My eyes do not itch as much.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how much these toilettes&#x27; burned my eyelids..</li>
            <li>Downside, you really need to use as directed.</li>
            <li>Thanks Dr. Tseng...</li>
            <li>a much needed product.</li>
            <li>Although expensive, I am thrilled to be able to purchase Ciradex through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Reduce paper packaging waste and save money by compounding your own 5 ounces of eyelid cleanser for about $17.</li>
            <li>The pads are convenient and effective but the solution seems harsh and has a burning effect on application the eyes.</li>
            <li>Let me warn you that the first time I used the wipe my eyes were very sensitive to them.</li>
            <li>I used it every other day as the wipes are potent.</li>
            <li>The burn is a little overwhelming the first week</li>
            <li>I do my top lids first and wait a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Excellent but very expensive</li>
            <li>I will know by this winter whether this routine is largely successful as my eyes are much worse in the winter.  </li>
            <li>When I first received these, I tried them once and completely gave up.</li>
            <li>I use a computer most of the day and people blink less when they work on computers.  </li>
            <li>Instead of purchasing two boxes, I would cut each towelette package and save half  for later use (should be more than adequate).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no doc and only one lucky user of these things.</li>
            <li>My blepharitis quickly improved upon daily usage.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working very well so far!</li>
            <li>This stuff is supposed to be incredible for eye health and was developed by the doctors who have done extensive research on ocular rosacea and other dry eye issues.</li>
            <li>If you are suffering from blepharitis then I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Price is high for what we get.</li>
            <li>Came highly recommendment by our eye doctor.  </li>
            <li>Eyes seem a little better.</li>
            <li>but it was after I started using this that my dry eye significantly dropped to the point where I forget eye drops now.</li>
            <li>Leave eyes slightly dry, but worth it!</li>
            <li>It was very gradual until one day I realized that I didn&#x27;t have to remove my contacts as frequently.</li>
            <li>My left eye feels HEALTHY in a way it has not felt in a LONG time.</li>
            <li>This is normal and most will become acclimated after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I had red, dry, flakey eyelids most of my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, because I use OcuSoft more regularly, which is another product for general eye health.  </li>
            <li>The feeling lasts for the entire day and I can finally work comfortably in the office again.</li>
            <li>I really gave this a good try, but unfortunately, I had to discontinue use.  </li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Even so, the vapors may be enough to cause tearing at first.</li>
            <li>However, I went back to using a full wipe each night because I felt like I needed the total amount of solution one wipe provides.</li>
            <li>My eye doctor told me it was from a mite that lives in the follicle of the eye lash and that this was the only thing available to get rid of them so far it is working they are not completely cleared up</li>
            <li>As far as the other reviews regarding the &amp;#34;burning.&amp;#34; When I first started using the wipes, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a sting literally at all.</li>
            <li>Also, I have tried using pure tea tree oil dabbing with a cotton ball and a drop of water on my eyelids at night  and did not have near the same results.</li>
            <li>one packet of Cliradex wipes, cut it in half with a clean scissors (you can feel where the wipe is in the packet).</li>
            <li>Cliradex helped clear up my eyes.</li>
            <li>Please also note I plan to find a doctor with the lipiflow system to help clear these glands (you can google</li>
            <li>My nose was quite swollen and that has gone done considerably as well as marked improvement in blackheads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased 3 boxes so far.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>Received as stated and so far product seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a 58 year old woman with rosacea).</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the last thing I wanted to happen, the whole point of using Cliradex is to kill my demodex mites that are causing dysfunction in the glands.</li>
            <li>He said he had never seen signs of mites, and he was quite surprised that this product worked for me.</li>
            <li>He said he had never seen signs of mites, and he was quite surprised that this product worked for me.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t completely eradicated the demodex even after using it for two months.</li>
            <li>Does the same thing much cheaper.</li>
            <li>None of these have affected me so far since I began this regimen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s improving so far</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does take several weeks for you to really feel a difference.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m retired and on a fixed income)</li>
            <li>Second, I think it&#x27;s very costly.</li>
            <li>I only have to use rewetting drops a few times a day, and mostly if I&#x27;m in on over-heated or over-A/C building.</li>
            <li>Might be a good product but way too expensive AND had to pay £23 unexpected duty for UK delivery.  </li>
            <li>so I can only say this product is okay because it does not cure it simply acts as a barrier if you are extremely diligent about using it.  </li>
            <li>Finally a product that has tremendously improved my blepharitis and dry eye.</li>
            <li>Stings for a few minutes but is well worth it!</li>
            <li>I have tried the OcuSoft pads in the past and these Cliradex pads are much better for my personal case of mild-moderate blepharitis.</li>
            <li>There are lots of reviews that pretty much say how I feel,  but what I wanted to add was that I have a little personal fan in my bathroom, and after wiping my eyes (I am fairly aggressive - no screwing around since these are expensive)</li>
            <li>One REALLY LONG minute, but really, it&#x27;s just a minute.</li>
            <li>I  hope this is useful for any other Rosacea sufferers out there!</li>
            <li>However, I have been amazed at how much these eye wipes have helped me in such a short time.</li>
            <li>Prior to Cliradex, I was using Restasis daily, as well as using retaine eye drops five or so times a day, and still not finding much relief .</li>
            <li>My eyes began to burn and itch so severely that I could barely stand it!</li>
            <li>It does help clean the lashes, and I have a persistent little sty that it keeps away, but maybe something cheaper will do the same.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, because I have a bad problem .</li>
            <li>The key was learning how often to use the wipe, how much of it to leave on the lids, and how long.</li>
            <li>as directed, because if this stuff gets in your eyes, I am pretty sure you will be an unhappy camper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which goes to show that someone can be having demodex issues without it being visibly apparent.</li>
            <li>essential oil is a compound in natural Tea Tree Oil that at 25% concentration kills Demodex faster than 25% TTO.</li>
            <li>I used them last year for about 4 or 5 months and my blepharitis almost completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>Put the extras in a plastic ziplock.&lt;br /&gt;--If doing this for the first time, sit down to apply the wipe since it will sting for about two minutes.</li>
            <li>The first night, I had to sit down on my bathroom floor because my legs were shaking from the pain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still highly recommend buying these to try them out if you have dry eye!it&#x27;s looked since I was 10 years</li>
            <li>No real apparent change to my rosacea but still too early to tell after a life of the problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still highly recommend buying these to try them out if you have dry eye!</li>
            <li>Eyes were feeling hot, dry and very itchy; was diagnosed with extreme dry eye and demodex.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, although a little expensive.</li>
            <li>After seeing several eye Drs with no help, finally this new product was suggested as it had just arrived in the medical office.</li>
            <li>I went through a whole box, cutting each wipe in half, so I think I gave it a fair try.</li>
            <li>With your index finger, wipe back and forth with three motions (left, right, left) and then do the other eye, then use the wipe on your eyebrows, nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>Smells a little funny, but follow the directions</li>
            <li>It stings for the first five minutes and it is pretty painful but in my opinion it is worth the pain.</li>
            <li>price really needs to come down substantially.</li>
            <li>My eye doctor told me that my particular problem with eye irritation was due to stuff on the eyelids, not the eyes.</li>
            <li>First few times it stings and skin around eyes is red, but then by the end of week my skin had adjusted - no sting, no redness -</li>
            <li>purchased a few months ago and have been applying directly to my face and WOW!</li>
            <li>Those little mites really did a number on my eyes and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had clear skin, zero redness, zero irritation and extremely minimal flushing.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Fantastic delivery on this product which is costly all over the network but does a wonderful job as a specialty item.  </li>
            <li> I now use a wipe or two during the week to maintain the good results.  </li>
            <li> Each packet is good for one application.</li>
            <li> Thirty would be more ideal from a patient standpoint.  </li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;vd package in a couple of days, everything is good to go.  </li>
            <li> Eight week treatment with Cliradex wipes at night and warm compresses for 4 mins in the morning was completely successful for treating demodex mite infestation.  </li>
            <li> :) I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are healthy looking again, too!</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing for itchy and watery eyes.</li>
            <li> My eyes feel amazing.</li>
            <li> lipiflow - sounds like an amazing system).  </li>
            <li> Leaves nice warmth after use.</li>
            <li> Using it for Eye Mite control along with Trader Joes Tea Tree Tingle shampoo and it is controlling them nicely.</li>
            <li> eyes with warm water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He said he had Cliradex samples in his office but never gave them out because no came into his office with the kind of eyelash symptoms he was looking for.</li>
            <li> He said he had Cliradex samples in his office but never gave them out because no came into his office with the kind of eyelash symptoms he was looking for.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need to use warm compresses.</li>
            <li> My eye doc thought this would be effective for demodex that she diagnosed.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was kind of paranoid to try them.</li>
            <li> I had to rinse my eyes immediately with warm water to stop the burning...</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve done more harm than good trying these out.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Because of the wonderful results from this product, I finally took out the bottle of tea tree oil</li>
            <li> My issue is that it just isn&#x27;t making the redness in my eyes any better.</li>
            <li> I would have gladly paid the $40</li>
            <li> The Combination for me seems to be magic.</li>
            <li> Also, I found that products with collodial oatmeal helped me more than this.  </li>
            <li> I love them for my eyelids, nose, and eyebrows to relieve rosacea and blepharitis.</li>
            <li> The cornea specialist promised me that although it would burn, tea tree is not blinding :).</li>
            <li> I  know I won&#x27;t be :)</li>
            <li> I am glad my doctor gave me a couple of samples to try the product.  </li>
            <li> I suffer also from rosacea and acne and have tried many things, some of which have helped and others not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Especially at first</li>
            <li> Nothing works better than cliradex</li>
            <li> I need to order more</li>
            <li> I then put Theratears Sterilid gel on my lashes, top and bottom, and do NOT rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> My review is for me, your results may be better.</li>
            <li> have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes.</li>
            <li> This is NOT an immediate &amp;#34;Fix&amp;#34; as it take many applications to get results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going well however and there aren&#x27;t many alternatives</li>
            <li> Make sure you can tolerate the cooling menthol effect.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> This product has made great improvement on my 85 yr old mother&#x27;s eyelids!</li>
            <li> Those items were, Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap, Cliradex wipes, using an all natural anti-reddening cream and having a great sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash off the Cliradex at night, but I do give my eyes a good cleansing in the morning to remove it, first with an OcuSoft scrub, then with a clean washcloth (no soap).</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy on the eyes and provides comfort to the eye(s).</li>
            <li> It was just way too strong for my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I found it way to strong.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more of a sweet sting that comes from tea tree.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most pleasant experience, but it has made a big difference in the health of my eye lids</li>
            <li> me, that&#x27;s a huge huge YES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the itchyness until around week 4...</li>
            <li> I am 2 days into using this product and am blown away by the fantastic results.</li>
            <li> Although I am still uncertain if this is what I am experiencing, he gave me a free sample of the Cliradex wipes.</li>
            <li> To make them more economical, I took a tip from another reviewer and cut each wipe in four pieces with a well-cleaned scissors.</li>
            <li> The occusoft scrub did nothing on its own but worked really well with this product.</li>
            <li> Everything went smooth.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works to clear demodex mites from eyelashes and eyebrows, take off makeup, or use for a good pick me up in the morning.</li>
            <li> If these were more reasonably priced I would give it more stars</li>
            <li> It makes my eyes feel better right</li>
            <li> Very pricey!!!</li>
            <li> I sound like an infomercial, but I&#x27;m that excited.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong and the product Is very drying</li>
            <li> Effective as advertised, but the price is too high.</li>
            <li> so, so excited.</li>
            <li> SO EXCITED about this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll gladly pay it if I can continue to see the same amazing results.</li>
            <li> I had been told to clean my eyes with baby soap, which I had been doing, for five years.</li>
            <li> It helps a great deal if you hold a warm, moist, clean washcloth over your eyes for a few minutes to loosen up any crusty bits first.</li>
            <li> just cool, clean feeling and no itch.</li>
            <li> But on a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being you want to claw your eyeballs right out of your head), I went from a 10 to a 3 or 4 after using one wipe!</li>
            <li> I had better luck with straight tea tree oil, which didn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
            <li> saw my ophthalmologist recently and he was flabbergasted at how good my eyelashes looked.</li>
            <li> I saw my ophthalmologist recently and he was flabbergasted at how good my eyelashes looked.</li>
            <li> but mom is not rubbing her eyes as much and seems to see better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural oils create a tingly sensation, and have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> When I stopped using them for a good 4 or 5 months, my blepharitis came back again.</li>
            <li> I wish that my eye doctor would carry these and they were sold at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My optometrist recommended this and after trying other things I gave in and was happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Cliradex&lt;br /&gt;Cliradex Eyelid, Eyelash, and Facial Cleansing...has completely gotten rid of my itching eye lashes  Strong smell but great product</li>
            <li> The boxes were pretty beat up, but the product was fine.</li>
            <li> No longer blurry and redness is quickly going away.</li>
            <li> Quick and as described</li>
            <li> When I read that people with Demodex have 10x as many mites as normal and tend to have acne, rosacea, and blepharitis, I immediately searched for a product to help me.</li>
            <li> At night, I clean my eyes with Cetaphyl, hot water, and an Equate Exfoliating cleansing towelette (rinsing the towelette first with clean water)  </li>
            <li> WELL WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> and I have not had to constantly tend to them by either wetting the lid or putting in drops or warm compresses.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly nice that no one has commented on my eyes being red since about a week after I began using this product.</li>
            <li> I have also been using a warm eye bag in the evening prior to Cliradex.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the most natural solution short of making your own.</li>
            <li> Either way...the relief I get is well worth it.</li>
            <li> It is the only product on the market that is immediately effective.  </li>
            <li> because dealing directly with the maker was some $6.00 more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Is all this worth it?</li>
            <li> It also works great as a natural facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It does burn/sting a lot but leaves my skin and eyes clean, soft and free from papules and irritation.  </li>
            <li> Good as any other wipe</li>
            <li> I have used every other day w/ good results...</li>
            <li> This is working for me right now, and I hope this routine helps someone else.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve missed a few days) but the difference is amazing!</li>
            <li> First, there are 24 packets in here, not a months worth.</li>
            <li> As pointed out in the comment section, one box of 24 is not exactly a months worth, but don&#x27;t get too hung up on that as 3.4 weeks should be fine in most cases.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please talk with your doc first though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is an immediate burn upon application from the vapors, but I actually found it to be refreshing in the way that Listerine burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cliradex has helped my eyes and skin become much healthier!</li>
            <li> My skin looks better and my pores are getting smaller.</li>
            <li> I am an artist, and need crisp vision to do my work.</li>
            <li> Wait until the stinging stops to open your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;--Do not use more than three wipe motions on each eye.</li>
            <li> Used hot compresses like my eyeMD told me too</li>
            <li> (100+push up of hot water) &amp; Cliradex.</li>
            <li> Got rid of it fast without antibiotic!</li>
            <li> It sting pretty severely when applied, though that dissipates withing 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> After just 2-3 weeks of using these every night on my lids, eyebrows, nose, cheeks, and rest of face (in that order -- lids first, then eyebrows, etc...), I am cured.</li>
            <li> Yet, my rosacea is already looking better, and I haven&#x27;t had a big pimple since I started.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking using a fresh wipe on my face will improve the rosacea and breakouts just as much as it improved my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I remember to blink much more during the day.  </li>
            <li> as I know thereare many suffering with similar problems who are looking for answers.  </li>
            <li> but my eyelids were severely blistered and swollen after first use of this product.</li>
            <li> but I was able to cut each piece into smaller strips and used it for my eyelid.  </li>
            <li> but the individual envelopes can be used more that once, just reinsert, fold over and use again.</li>
            <li> I say to anyone who has my problems -- is manning up to one minute a day of pain that gets better every day worth being CURED of the hassle and pain of blepharitis and dry eyes?&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stings a bit when applying morning and evening, but kills the little buggers and provides exceptional relief.</li>
            <li> I have used them for just over 2 months; twice a day to keep the lashes clean and clear of debris.</li>
            <li> Well, I noticed an improvement on the first day, and it&#x27;s been about 6 weeks now and my vision is the most stable it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> I need to wipe more than my eyelashes especially at night when my whole face would itch.</li>
            <li> and I do not see it available in any of the major chain drug stores.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time that very night.</li>
            <li> and it works pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Two full weeks of treatment has completely cleared her up</li>
            <li> Significant swelling lasting more than an hour likely indicates an allergic reaction and the product should be discontinued.  </li>
            <li> 10 drops of coconut oil to one drop of pure tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I have taken Tobradex gel, Tobradex drops, have done the tea tree oil and baby shampoo cleanse, have done warm compresses, and finally scalding hot compresses and this is the only thing that keeps the recurring dots at bay.  </li>
            <li> My rigid gas permeable contacts are back in service, and feel just fine.</li>
            <li> It is very good, but expensive for one use at a time.</li>
            <li> In fact my eyes look normal for the first time in my life...</li>
            <li> I followed the directions very thoroughly, though and did not rub it on lower eyelid.</li>
            <li> The very next day my eyes remained pain free.</li>
            <li> Works better than the wet compresses/lid hygiene protocol I had been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> With that said I will most likely buy a few more boxes because I&#x27;d rather have some relief than no relief.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t see how these are helping my blepharitus at all after 1 month of use.</li>
            <li> I could absolutely tell a difference as well.</li>
            <li> Do not take the whole wipe out of the sleeve and then cut it.</li>
            <li> They feel very \\&quot;menthol-y\\&quot; on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> These wipes really work.</li>
            <li> I learned that too much Cliradex sitting on my lids will gum up the meibomian glands on the eyelids (where the oil comes out).</li>
            <li> your face with a gentle fragrance-free cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;--Heat</li>
            <li> If you put too much of the Cliradex on your lids, it can plug up your meibomian glands on your eyelids (where the oil comes out).&lt;br /&gt;--Do not wash off the Cliradex.</li>
            <li> your face with a gentle fragrance-free cleanser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really made him think.</li>
            <li> It really made him think.</li>
            <li> For 42.99 I guess I expected more.</li>
            <li> I am concerned with using something that stings so much on my eye lids.</li>
            <li> They really do.</li>
            <li> it really helps with my blepharitis/mgd.  </li>
            <li> They were very helpful; would use them again, if needed</li>
            <li> Much improvement.</li>
            <li> I do not think it is harmful, but having to add drops 4 times a day really makes this condition take over your life.  </li>
            <li> Close your eyes and gently dab/swipe around the lid lash area.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the reimbursment for the postage.  </li>
            <li> My eyes do not itch as much.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how much these toilettes&#x27; burned my eyelids..</li>
            <li> Downside, you really need to use as directed.</li>
            <li> Thanks Dr. Tseng...</li>
            <li> a much needed product.</li>
            <li> Although expensive, I am thrilled to be able to purchase Ciradex through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Reduce paper packaging waste and save money by compounding your own 5 ounces of eyelid cleanser for about $17.</li>
            <li> The pads are convenient and effective but the solution seems harsh and has a burning effect on application the eyes.</li>
            <li> Let me warn you that the first time I used the wipe my eyes were very sensitive to them.</li>
            <li> I used it every other day as the wipes are potent.</li>
            <li> The burn is a little overwhelming the first week</li>
            <li> I do my top lids first and wait a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Excellent but very expensive</li>
            <li> I will know by this winter whether this routine is largely successful as my eyes are much worse in the winter.  </li>
            <li> When I first received these, I tried them once and completely gave up.</li>
            <li> I use a computer most of the day and people blink less when they work on computers.  </li>
            <li> Instead of purchasing two boxes, I would cut each towelette package and save half  for later use (should be more than adequate).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no doc and only one lucky user of these things.</li>
            <li> My blepharitis quickly improved upon daily usage.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working very well so far!</li>
            <li> This stuff is supposed to be incredible for eye health and was developed by the doctors who have done extensive research on ocular rosacea and other dry eye issues.</li>
            <li> If you are suffering from blepharitis then I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Price is high for what we get.</li>
            <li> Came highly recommendment by our eye doctor.  </li>
            <li> Eyes seem a little better.</li>
            <li> but it was after I started using this that my dry eye significantly dropped to the point where I forget eye drops now.</li>
            <li> Leave eyes slightly dry, but worth it!</li>
            <li> It was very gradual until one day I realized that I didn&#x27;t have to remove my contacts as frequently.</li>
            <li> My left eye feels HEALTHY in a way it has not felt in a LONG time.</li>
            <li> This is normal and most will become acclimated after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I had red, dry, flakey eyelids most of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, because I use OcuSoft more regularly, which is another product for general eye health.  </li>
            <li> The feeling lasts for the entire day and I can finally work comfortably in the office again.</li>
            <li> I really gave this a good try, but unfortunately, I had to discontinue use.  </li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Even so, the vapors may be enough to cause tearing at first.</li>
            <li> However, I went back to using a full wipe each night because I felt like I needed the total amount of solution one wipe provides.</li>
            <li> My eye doctor told me it was from a mite that lives in the follicle of the eye lash and that this was the only thing available to get rid of them so far it is working they are not completely cleared up</li>
            <li> As far as the other reviews regarding the &amp;#34;burning.&amp;#34; When I first started using the wipes, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a sting literally at all.</li>
            <li> Also, I have tried using pure tea tree oil dabbing with a cotton ball and a drop of water on my eyelids at night  and did not have near the same results.</li>
            <li> one packet of Cliradex wipes, cut it in half with a clean scissors (you can feel where the wipe is in the packet).</li>
            <li> Cliradex helped clear up my eyes.</li>
            <li> Please also note I plan to find a doctor with the lipiflow system to help clear these glands (you can google</li>
            <li> My nose was quite swollen and that has gone done considerably as well as marked improvement in blackheads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 boxes so far.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> Received as stated and so far product seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a 58 year old woman with rosacea).</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the last thing I wanted to happen, the whole point of using Cliradex is to kill my demodex mites that are causing dysfunction in the glands.</li>
            <li> He said he had never seen signs of mites, and he was quite surprised that this product worked for me.</li>
            <li> He said he had never seen signs of mites, and he was quite surprised that this product worked for me.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t completely eradicated the demodex even after using it for two months.</li>
            <li> Does the same thing much cheaper.</li>
            <li> None of these have affected me so far since I began this regimen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s improving so far</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does take several weeks for you to really feel a difference.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m retired and on a fixed income)</li>
            <li> Second, I think it&#x27;s very costly.</li>
            <li> I only have to use rewetting drops a few times a day, and mostly if I&#x27;m in on over-heated or over-A/C building.</li>
            <li> Might be a good product but way too expensive AND had to pay £23 unexpected duty for UK delivery.  </li>
            <li> so I can only say this product is okay because it does not cure it simply acts as a barrier if you are extremely diligent about using it.  </li>
            <li> Finally a product that has tremendously improved my blepharitis and dry eye.</li>
            <li> Stings for a few minutes but is well worth it!</li>
            <li> I have tried the OcuSoft pads in the past and these Cliradex pads are much better for my personal case of mild-moderate blepharitis.</li>
            <li> There are lots of reviews that pretty much say how I feel,  but what I wanted to add was that I have a little personal fan in my bathroom, and after wiping my eyes (I am fairly aggressive - no screwing around since these are expensive)</li>
            <li> One REALLY LONG minute, but really, it&#x27;s just a minute.</li>
            <li> I  hope this is useful for any other Rosacea sufferers out there!</li>
            <li> However, I have been amazed at how much these eye wipes have helped me in such a short time.</li>
            <li> Prior to Cliradex, I was using Restasis daily, as well as using retaine eye drops five or so times a day, and still not finding much relief .</li>
            <li> My eyes began to burn and itch so severely that I could barely stand it!</li>
            <li> It does help clean the lashes, and I have a persistent little sty that it keeps away, but maybe something cheaper will do the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, because I have a bad problem .</li>
            <li> The key was learning how often to use the wipe, how much of it to leave on the lids, and how long.</li>
            <li> as directed, because if this stuff gets in your eyes, I am pretty sure you will be an unhappy camper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which goes to show that someone can be having demodex issues without it being visibly apparent.</li>
            <li> essential oil is a compound in natural Tea Tree Oil that at 25% concentration kills Demodex faster than 25% TTO.</li>
            <li> I used them last year for about 4 or 5 months and my blepharitis almost completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> Put the extras in a plastic ziplock.&lt;br /&gt;--If doing this for the first time, sit down to apply the wipe since it will sting for about two minutes.</li>
            <li> The first night, I had to sit down on my bathroom floor because my legs were shaking from the pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still highly recommend buying these to try them out if you have dry eye!it&#x27;s looked since I was 10 years</li>
            <li> No real apparent change to my rosacea but still too early to tell after a life of the problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still highly recommend buying these to try them out if you have dry eye!</li>
            <li> Eyes were feeling hot, dry and very itchy; was diagnosed with extreme dry eye and demodex.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, although a little expensive.</li>
            <li> After seeing several eye Drs with no help, finally this new product was suggested as it had just arrived in the medical office.</li>
            <li> I went through a whole box, cutting each wipe in half, so I think I gave it a fair try.</li>
            <li> With your index finger, wipe back and forth with three motions (left, right, left) and then do the other eye, then use the wipe on your eyebrows, nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Smells a little funny, but follow the directions</li>
            <li> It stings for the first five minutes and it is pretty painful but in my opinion it is worth the pain.</li>
            <li> price really needs to come down substantially.</li>
            <li> My eye doctor told me that my particular problem with eye irritation was due to stuff on the eyelids, not the eyes.</li>
            <li> First few times it stings and skin around eyes is red, but then by the end of week my skin had adjusted - no sting, no redness -</li>
            <li> purchased a few months ago and have been applying directly to my face and WOW!</li>
            <li> Those little mites really did a number on my eyes and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had clear skin, zero redness, zero irritation and extremely minimal flushing.</li>
            <li> For the do-it-yourself individual or those on a budget, try mixing a small 2oz bottle of pure tea tree oil (melaleuca alternifolia) into a 40oz shampoo (like a baby shampoo) and doing a 1-2 minute scrub of your lashes, once again taking care not to get any into your eye.</li>
            <li> I had itchy, irritated eyes due to demodex and this product is helping clear up the problem.  </li>
            <li> At least for me, more is not better.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t really have dry eye, I do have a little</li>
            <li> Needless to say this dry eye issue was much more than a distraction, it affected my quality of life.</li>
            <li> I will try it long way next time.</li>
            <li> It is unclear how long one can continue using the wipes on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> She had struggled 3 months with very swollen, red eyelids and extremely  flakey skin and scalp, and within a few days of using the wipes (and coconut oil on face/scalp) we saw noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with dry eyes several years ago and had to stop wearing contacts.</li>
            <li> a Thermalon Dry Eye Compress in a microwave for 20 seconds, lay on your back on the bed with the compress on both eyes for five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;--Then</li>
            <li> a Thermalon Dry Eye Compress in a microwave for 20 seconds, lay on your back on the bed with the compress on both eyes for five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;--Then</li>
            <li> So, after extensive research...and I mean very extensive, I discovered that there were four items which came highly recommended by Rosacea sufferers all over the world.</li>
            <li> that has solved my dry eye  finally after two years of constant use of eye drops and wet compresses</li>
            <li> gently massage both eyelids with your index finger, using a back and forth motion with your eyes closed, not pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> gently massage both eyelids with your index finger, using a back and forth motion with your eyes closed, not pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> Either way, I plan on buying these as long as I need them.</li>
            <li> Hoping this product stays around for a long time.</li>
            <li> Please note that I express these glands, particularly in my left eye, once a day as recommended by two doctors, but I am not really nuts about doing this because I think this could cause long-term damage to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I still use Refresh eye drops occasionally during the day, and my eyes will get a little red some evenings.</li>
            <li> The wipes seem to be preventing further problems with my eyes along with other treatments the doctor wanted me to use.</li>
            <li> My optometrist recommended I try this for dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Once dry, the burning was gone.</li>
            <li> Just what the Dr ordered to address dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I was also prescribed prescription eye drops for my dry eyes that felt like they were always burning.</li>
            <li> I would recommended Cliradex to anyone with dry eye and demodicosis.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with blepharitis and chronic dry eye for about 15 years.</li>
            <li> I use this for my eye lids to keep the dry partials out from my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my rosacea, blepharitis and dry eye conditions and have been using them for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I thought I was suffering from dry eye disease.</li>
            <li> I have tried: regular lid scrubs, warm compresses, omega-3 oils, Restasis, antihistamine drops, numerous artificial tear types, and &amp;#34;pulses&amp;#34; of steroid eye drops used for a few weeks every few months.</li>
            <li> Now I only have to take a few deep breaths.</li>
            <li> I put the other half back inside the package and use it the next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mainly writing this to let people know that other reviews regarding the painful nature of this product may not be true for everyone.</li>
            <li> I had suffered from dry eye in my left eye that left me with blurry vision and eye discomfort for the past three years.</li>
            <li> , I keep my eyes closed for about fifteen seconds after applying to let it dry some before opening them.</li>
            <li> The product does burn a little, but it bothers me much less now that my eyes are less sensitive overall.</li>
            <li> They looked slightly red and felt a little dry by evening time.</li>
            <li> No burning if you use it with closed eyes (closed but not squeezed) and let it dry before eyes opening.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, and it only has 24 in the box.</li>
            <li> Then I pull my lower lids down a bit to apply product directly on the lid margins, and hold lid down a few seconds for the product to dry</li>
            <li> Takes a few weeks to see improvement, so be patient and apply gently, don&#x27;t rub too hard.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oils will get into your eyes regardless how careful you are.</li>
            <li> Also, keep your eyes closed for 1 minute.</li>
            <li> Although expensive, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Using one whole wipe for your eyes is unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Use the wipe with your eyes closed, and leave the solution on your eyes for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> This helped instantly but was messy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Be careful not to touch your eye with the wipes, as it will sting a bit.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth the price.</li>
            <li> I also use Burt&#x27;s bees baby shampoo mixed with a few drops of tea tree oil when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> eyes closed, but don&#x27;t squint when applying.</li>
            <li> The essential oils don&#x27;t hurt but are not comfortable if it goes in the eye.</li>
            <li> As recommended by another reviewer, I cut the wipes (while in the sleeve) in half and stick the unused half in a ziploc for the next night.</li>
            <li> The video on their site says to just swipe it gently a few times on upper lid, with eyes closed and it seeps down to the lower lash area.  </li>
            <li> Just keep your eye closed tightly when applying and let dry before opening your eye.</li>
            <li> TTO is very difficult to use around the eyes, so finding these products is hugely helpful.  </li>
            <li> BUT just like some of the other reviewers have said -</li>
            <li> + if it took the redness away, but after six months...time to explore other options.</li>
            <li> (I kept them closed for 2 minutes!)  </li>
            <li> you are suffering and on the fence due to expense, I think you owe it to yourself to find s way to give it a try</li>
            <li> Other wipes, which do not contain tea tree oil, do not work.</li>
            <li> I store the two extra pieces in a small, plastic 3 x 2\\&quot; pill bag I got on Amazon in a package of 100.</li>
            <li> I used baby shampoo on other days.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other reviews, I didn&#x27;t experience unbearable stinging and pain.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t handle the extreme burning.  </li>
            <li> Looking for other options.</li>
            <li> Burns the eyes so be careful and keep your eyes closed!!</li>
            <li> He directed that I firmly close my eyes, wipe them (lids, lashes, and underneath) and let them dry 1-2 minutes to prevent it from getting into my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is expensive, but my eyelashes are, after a few weeks of using these, finally filling in and looking fairly normal again.</li>
            <li> but once I get my issues under control perhaps I can use it every other day to make the expense less of a problem.</li>
            <li> Expensive but really works if you have blepharitist.</li>
            <li> and it was not effective at treating my red, scaly, rash covered face.</li>
            <li> My dry eye just kept getting worse, along with my rosacea, and I finally put the two together and found the information on demodex mites and this tea tree oil treatment for my eyes.</li>
            <li> This burns upon contact and then settles down.  </li>
            <li> One half of a wipe did not do it for me.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, some of them helped slightly and temporarily, but nothing like Cliradex.</li>
            <li> You can also cut these in half.</li>
            <li> Which goes to show that someone can be having demodex issues without it being visibly apparent.r towel under cold tap water and gently wipe your lids with your eyes closed.  </li>
            <li> I also cut the wipe in half...</li>
            <li> Went through half the box and used 2x a day towards the end in combination with Occusoft eyelid scrubs for severe conditions.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the advice from one reviewer who says cut in half.  </li>
            <li> The benefits of using this are less redness in my eyes, less itching of my eyelids</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on a tight budget, you can cut a pad in half or thirds while it&#x27;s still in the packet and save tightly wrapped in a baggie.</li>
            <li> Seal tight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to review a product like this with certainty because of the varying conditions that affect dry eye</li>
            <li> The smell is a little musty but it does go away.</li>
            <li> Does burn a little.</li>
            <li> So, I bought a little $15 mini fan on Amazon, and I would run the fan on my face after I used the wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s WELL WORTH the less than 2 minutes of that painful sensation.</li>
            <li> Put Systane Preservative-Free Vial drops in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;--Throughout the day, as needed, run a paper towel under cold tap water and gently wipe your lids with your eyes closed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wash hands and sissors with antibacterial soap before cutting the wipe; and store it back into the package and wrap in a tiny baggie.</li>
            <li> Since getting contacts a bit over a year ago I have had nothing but trouble because of my eye condition.  </li>
            <li> you may consider adding a few drops of water to the towelettes just before using.</li>
            <li> I would wake up every morning with crustiness on my eye lashes and my eyes would water heavily sometimes.</li>
            <li> I have had these recurring flesh colored dots on my waterline for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> : I was asked a few times in the comments if these continue to help me.</li>
            <li> and I noticed it dried out my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I will stick to using these wipes every few months to keep my eye problems in check.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not cheap but it works.</li>
            <li> Just a really grateful woman who has suffered for years and years and is finally free!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small tiny downside -- these hurt and sting terribly.</li>
            <li> Buy Terpinen-4-ol (T4O) and plain mineral oil.</li>
            <li> I did try the cutting in half of the wipes, but the wipes are small to begin with and for me, cutting them in half just didn&#x27;t do the trick especially when I wanted to wipe down my whole face.</li>
            <li> My eyelids were red and itchy, my eyes were painful and gritty and</li>
            <li> Alas, I could not wear make up - my eyes were so dry.</li>
            <li> My eyes were producing very little oil, so my optometrist recommended using Cliradex once a day before bed for 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> last note- some reviews talked about how expensive the wipes are.</li>
            <li> I read about tea tree oil but was afraid to put the oil on my lids directly.</li>
            <li> No more baby shampoo lid scrubs.</li>
            <li> No more antibiotic/steroid drops, antihistamine drops, NOTHING.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely still uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> i am only giving it 4 stars because it is outrageously expensive.  </li>
            <li> The blockage of these glands causes my eyes to produce excessive, burning tears.  </li>
            <li> I was told to use this 4 times a day, but it is my goal to use it no more than once a day.  </li>
            <li> A small bottle of mineral oil is about $4 at Target or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give them five stars is because they are way too expensive.</li>
            <li> However, I must say that my colleagues often miss or mistake demodex for other conditions (e.g. seborrheic or bacterial blepharitis, for which I would recommend the less expensive OCuSOFT product).  </li>
            <li> These wipes do help my dry eye condition, but they are expensive.</li>
            <li> Some people may also find T4O less irritating than TTO.    </li>
            <li> Yes, they sting a little, but if you use them as directed, the stinging is brief and not that bad.</li>
            <li> If you have suffered from chronic blepharitis/MGD over the years as I have, you owe it to yourself to at least try this product.</li>
            <li> I heard a tip about cutting the entire package in four pieces, instead of the wipe – I&#x27;m going to try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, I don&#x27;t know about you, but they burned me like my face was on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive for only 24 days.</li>
            <li> gave this product 4 stars because of the ridiculous cost.</li>
            <li> Horrible tiny wipes in the size of two inches by two inches (could you make it ANY SMALLER !!??) - burn and sting skin, did not provide any relief...</li>
            <li> Little expensive but works..</li>
            <li> But every day gets a little less painful.</li>
            <li> I use my eyes very hard every day, I&#x27;m on the computer 8-12 hours</li>
            <li> but I did it wrong because I ended up with very uneven halves.</li>
            <li> I tried cutting the packet in half</li>
            <li> Some even suggested cutting them in half to save money.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the skin around my eyes would burn like crazy, so I would fan them until it dried.</li>
            <li> Much to costly-ineffective and has a terrible odor</li>
            <li> My problems got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> but nothing dramatic has happened.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have mites, but I have dry eyes that are annoying.  </li>
            <li> Helps a lot, but is not a cure unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> Though it is a bit expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;A bit expensive</li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> I imagine that&#x27;s the &amp;#34;die off&amp;#34; of a million bacteria and mites exploding as the tea tree oil extract in the wipes hits their disgusting little cells.</li>
            <li> If I could get away with cutting them into quarters I would.</li>
            <li> Burns like crazy</li>
            <li> My triggers WERE alcohol, heat, sun, cold and exercise.</li>
            <li> I went from using artificial tears every 10-15 minutes all day every day to using them MAYBE once or twice per day now.</li>
            <li> I had to fan my face like crazy after I use them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also started cutting the wipes into four pieces.</li>
            <li> Cliradex is very expensive</li>
            <li> It became impossible to wear my contacts.</li>
            <li> They sting like crazy!</li>
            <li> That is very dangerous.</li>
            <li> I have problems with my eyes caused by blocked meibomian glands (the glands at the base of the eyelashes that release oil for the tear surface).  </li>
            <li> It was annoying, but works.</li>
            <li> Cliradex made my eyelids burn really bad!  </li>
            <li> Burned my eyelids and around my eyes terribly.  </li>
            <li> Had a terrible mybomian gland infection for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> These wipes have resolved a horrible problem</li>
            <li> This stuff made me miserable-</li>
            <li> /&gt;But my itchy eyes have been driving me insane, so I tried them again.</li>
            <li> You have to be prepared to endure chemical burn for a very doubtful result.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product has made great improvement on my 85 yr old mother&#x27;s eyelids! Even the doctor could see the change as soon as he walked in the room.. My brother in law was so impressed he ordered himself some too :) I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I got these based upon test samples from my eye doc. I had red, dry, flakey eyelids most of my life. Since getting contacts a bit over a year ago I have had nothing but trouble because of my eye condition.  After using these wipes, no issues. In fact my eyes look normal for the first time in my life...I&#x27;m almost 50!!!&lt;br /&gt;Note: These wipes do burn when you use them. The tea tree oils will get into your eyes regardless how careful you are. Plus the latent vapor from the wipes will temporarily make your eyes burn and tear up for a minute or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the issues I describe, these wipes may work.&lt;br /&gt;Please talk with your doc first though. I&#x27;m no doc and only one lucky user of these things.</li>
            <li> No burning if you use it with closed eyes (closed but not squeezed) and let it dry before eyes opening.</li>
            <li> I am 2 days into using this product and am blown away by the fantastic results. My dry eye just kept getting worse, along with my rosacea, and I finally put the two together and found the information on demodex mites and this tea tree oil treatment for my eyes. Yes, the wipes do STING BUT just like some of the other reviewers have said - it&#x27;s WELL WORTH the less than 2 minutes of that painful sensation. WELL WORTH IT. My eyes haven&#x27;t felt this good in months and I have not had to constantly tend to them by either wetting the lid or putting in drops or warm compresses. I tried cutting the packet in half but I did it wrong because I ended up with very uneven halves. I will try it long way next time. Because of the wonderful results from this product, I finally took out the bottle of tea tree oil purchased a few months ago and have been applying directly to my face and WOW! My nose was quite swollen and that has gone done considerably as well as marked improvement in blackheads. I am finally feeling like there is hope!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to review a product like this with certainty because of the varying conditions that affect dry eye but it was after I started using this that my dry eye significantly dropped to the point where I forget eye drops now. Using baby shampoo also appeared to cause &amp;#34;vision shadowing&amp;#34; for me too and that also went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an immediate burn upon application from the vapors, but I actually found it to be refreshing in the way that Listerine burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star for the cost. This product is very expensive for only 24 days.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working very well so far!</li>
            <li> This product is very effective. I use one side for each eye; wiping the eye lash, lid and brow area. If you have very sensitive skin you may consider adding a few drops of water to the towelettes just before using.</li>
            <li> I would wake up every morning with crustiness on my eye lashes and my eyes would water heavily sometimes. My eye doctor told me it was from a mite that lives in the follicle of the eye lash and that this was the only thing available to get rid of them so far it is working they are not completely cleared up but it is greatly improved and I am still using this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about six months to help with blepharitis &amp; ocular rosacea. The stinging that everyone mentions is there but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. My issue is that it just isn&#x27;t making the redness in my eyes any better. It does help clean the lashes, and I have a persistent little sty that it keeps away, but maybe something cheaper will do the same. I would have gladly paid the $40+ if it took the redness away, but after six months...time to explore other options.</li>
            <li> If you are suffering from blepharitis then I would highly recommend this product. It stings for the first five minutes and it is pretty painful but in my opinion it is worth the pain.</li>
            <li> This stuff is supposed to be incredible for eye health and was developed by the doctors who have done extensive research on ocular rosacea and other dry eye issues. While I don&#x27;t really have dry eye, I do have a little so I thought I would try it.  I was nervous because almost everyone says it stings like the dickens, but it didn&#x27;t sting at all. I followed the directions very thoroughly, though and did not rub it on lower eyelid. The video on their site says to just swipe it gently a few times on upper lid, with eyes closed and it seeps down to the lower lash area.  Also, keep your eyes closed for 1 minute. (I kept them closed for 2 minutes!)  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, because I use OcuSoft more regularly, which is another product for general eye health.  But I still plan to use this as an adjunct occasionally.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with dry eyes several years ago and had to stop wearing contacts. I have suffered daily with very red, burning eyes ever sense. My eyes began to burn and itch so severely that I could barely stand it! Recently, I saw a dermatologist about a reaccurance of rosacea. I was given a pamphlet on this condition and read that it can affect the eyes. Out of curiosity, I read up on this and found that I was experiencing almost all of the symptoms outlined. So, I made a trip to my ophthalmologist. Although I am still uncertain if this is what I am experiencing, he gave me a free sample of the Cliradex wipes. I used it for the first time that very night. WHAT A MIRACLE! The very next day my eyes remained pain free. There was no itching or burning. They looked slightly red and felt a little dry by evening time. But on a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being you want to claw your eyeballs right out of your head), I went from a 10 to a 3 or 4 after using one wipe! I&#x27;ve been using them nightly for over a week now. Let me warn you that the first time I used the wipe my eyes were very sensitive to them. It did burn a lot, but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable and it went away after about 60 seconds. Each night after, the burning sensation from the wipes lessened. Now, it is an almost pleasant experience. I look forward to using them. I still use Refresh eye drops occasionally during the day, and my eyes will get a little red some evenings. However, I have been amazed at how much these eye wipes have helped me in such a short time. If your eyes are red, itchy, and burning, give these eye wipes a try.&lt;br /&gt;One last note- some reviews talked about how expensive the wipes are. Some even suggested cutting them in half to save money. I did try this. I saw that this method is totally doable. However, I went back to using a full wipe each night because I felt like I needed the total amount of solution one wipe provides. One half of a wipe did not do it for me. I think of it this way. Yes, they arean expense. However, it is like any medication I might need. It is an expense necessary for my eyes&#x27; health. I&#x27;ll gladly pay it if I can continue to see the same amazing results. Who knows. In the future, I might find that I don&#x27;t need them every night. Maybe I&#x27;ll only need them occasionally. Either way, I plan on buying these as long as I need them. They are wonderful!</li>
            <li> If you have suffered from chronic blepharitis/MGD over the years as I have, you owe it to yourself to at least try this product. Although expensive, it is worth every penny. Over the last twenty years of suffering from MGD/blepharitis, I have tried dozens of products and dozens of home remedies. Let me tell you, some of them helped slightly and temporarily, but nothing like Cliradex. Prior to Cliradex, I was using Restasis daily, as well as using retaine eye drops five or so times a day, and still not finding much relief . I continued to suffer from severe redness and tearing. It is incredibly nice that no one has commented on my eyes being red since about a week after I began using this product. J have been using it twice a day RELIGIOUSLY for about five weeks now. I have also been using a warm eye bag in the evening prior to Cliradex. The Combination for me seems to be magic. Works better than the wet compresses/lid hygiene protocol I had been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;If you are suffering and on the fence due to expense, I think you owe it to yourself to find s way to give it a try</li>
            <li> Cliradex has helped my eyes and skin become much healthier! I had itchy, irritated eyes due to demodex and this product is helping clear up the problem.  It&#x27;s also making my lashes and eyebrows grow back.  After I&#x27;m done wiping my brows and all around my eyes, I use the Cliradex towelette on my entire face and neck. My skin looks better and my pores are getting smaller. I&#x27;ve purchased 3 boxes so far. Those little mites really did a number on my eyes and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using Dr. Bronner Tea Tree Castile soap as a face wash and it&#x27;s a very good product in the demodex battle as well.</li>
            <li> Helps a lot, but is not a cure unfortunately. Also, the price is a ripoff .. but what can you do?&lt;br /&gt;I think I will continue to buy this product, because it does seem to help.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any mites but it really has helped with the MGD and a few flaws on my face.  Multi use product. It does smell but only for a short time.</li>
            <li> I have had these recurring flesh colored dots on my waterline for a few months now.  I have taken Tobradex gel, Tobradex drops, have done the tea tree oil and baby shampoo cleanse, have done warm compresses, and finally scalding hot compresses and this is the only thing that keeps the recurring dots at bay.  The only problem is that once I skipped one treatment (was using wipes twice daily) two of the dots came back instantly so I can only say this product is okay because it does not cure it simply acts as a barrier if you are extremely diligent about using it.  With that said I will most likely buy a few more boxes because I&#x27;d rather have some relief than no relief.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t see how these are helping my blepharitus at all after 1 month of use.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing for itchy and watery eyes. It stings, but it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Leaves nice warmth after use.</li>
            <li> My optometrist recommended I try this for dry eyes. My eyes were producing very little oil, so my optometrist recommended using Cliradex once a day before bed for 6-8 weeks. He directed that I firmly close my eyes, wipe them (lids, lashes, and underneath) and let them dry 1-2 minutes to prevent it from getting into my eyes. I did as he recommended. Sometimes the skin around my eyes would burn like crazy, so I would fan them until it dried. Once dry, the burning was gone. The skin around my eyes was never red or affected by the wipes. After using Cliradex for a while, the burning stopped. I went back to my optometrist to see if my eyes had improved. He said the oil was free-flowing! No Restasis necessary! I could absolutely tell a difference as well. It was very gradual until one day I realized that I didn&#x27;t have to remove my contacts as frequently. I now don&#x27;t remove them until I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 4 stars because of the ridiculous cost. As recommended by another reviewer, I cut the wipes (while in the sleeve) in half and stick the unused half in a ziploc for the next night. Do not take the whole wipe out of the sleeve and then cut it. Using one whole wipe for your eyes is unnecessary. If I could get away with cutting them into quarters I would. Haven&#x27;t tried it yet. If you cut the wipes you&#x27;re essentially paying $21.50 for 24 uses. $43.00 for 48.</li>
            <li> It worked for me, it cleared my blepharitis up within 2 days!</li>
            <li> Much to costly-ineffective and has a terrible odor</li>
            <li> This product is great. My eye doctor told me that my particular problem with eye irritation was due to stuff on the eyelids, not the eyes. It stings a bit when applying morning and evening, but kills the little buggers and provides exceptional relief. Praise the Lord for Cliradex wipes! Other wipes, which do not contain tea tree oil, do not work.</li>
            <li> This is great for cleansing your face.  I bought it for my eyelids - it does have a sting...</li>
            <li> Using it for Eye Mite control along with Trader Joes Tea Tree Tingle shampoo and it is controlling them nicely.</li>
            <li> For over a year I was waking up with dry/red eyes that persisted throughout the day. Working in an office setting this was almost unbearable. After seeing several eye Drs with no help, finally this new product was suggested as it had just arrived in the medical office. Wow what a difference. Now I put this on my eye lids and lashes every nights before I go to bed and wake up 99% cured. The feeling lasts for the entire day and I can finally work comfortably in the office again. Also, I have tried using pure tea tree oil dabbing with a cotton ball and a drop of water on my eyelids at night  and did not have near the same results. Hoping this product stays around for a long time. If you are having similar problems with waking up with dry/red eyes that just won&#x27;t go away, then I 100% recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help me at all.</li>
            <li> Great eye cleaning pad. Be expecting a burning sensation because of the tree oil. It&#x27;s great, because I have a bad problem . My doc recommended this item.</li>
            <li> Merchandise arrived on time and was everything I was expecting</li>
            <li> Received as stated and so far product seems to be working.  The smell is a little musty but it does go away.</li>
            <li> This burns upon contact and then settles down.  It&#x27;s supposed to help with swollen, irritated eyelids.  I had better luck with straight tea tree oil, which didn&#x27;t irritate.  Also, I found that products with collodial oatmeal helped me more than this.  But I like the individual foil packets.  I&#x27;m not convinced that demodex had anything to do with my allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase mine on Amazon, but I will purchase them here or anywhere I can find them for the best price, when the box I bought runs out. My blepharitis quickly improved upon daily usage. They feel very \\&quot;menthol-y\\&quot; on the eyelid. Just keep your eye closed tightly when applying and let dry before opening your eye. I love them for my eyelids, nose, and eyebrows to relieve rosacea and blepharitis. To make them more economical, I took a tip from another reviewer and cut each wipe in four pieces with a well-cleaned scissors. I use one separate piece for each eyelid and brow. I store the two extra pieces in a small, plastic 3 x 2\\&quot; pill bag I got on Amazon in a package of 100.</li>
            <li> Just what the Dr ordered to address dry eyes.</li>
            <li> These wipes do help my dry eye condition, but they are expensive. I cut them up into several pieces and store them in the wrapper, inside a ziploc plastic bag to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with blepharitis for a couple of years.  I don&#x27;t have mites, but I have dry eyes that are annoying.  I&#x27;m trying this product and quite like it.  There are lots of reviews that pretty much say how I feel,  but what I wanted to add was that I have a little personal fan in my bathroom, and after wiping my eyes (I am fairly aggressive - no screwing around since these are expensive) I turn the fan on my face and it takes the sting away immediately.  Some days they don&#x27;t sting at all, but others they do, but the product works.  Takes the itch out, and my eyes are not as crusty.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s the most natural solution short of making your own.</li>
            <li> Expensive but really works if you have blepharitist. My optometrist recommended this and after trying other things I gave in and was happy with the results. I used it every other day as the wipes are potent. Follow directions. I used baby shampoo on other days. Big improvement.</li>
            <li> These wipes really work. I had suffered from dry eye in my left eye that left me with blurry vision and eye discomfort for the past three years. I use my eyes very hard every day, I&#x27;m on the computer 8-12 hours (I&#x27;m a 58 year old woman with rosacea). I am an artist, and need crisp vision to do my work. Needless to say this dry eye issue was much more than a distraction, it affected my quality of life. I tried all sorts of solutions, some of which I still use in my daily eye care regimen. Over the years, my ophthalmologist prescribed Azasite, which would help for a short time but then the symptoms would return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I poked around on the internet and stumbled across these wipes, and thought I would give it a try. Well, I noticed an improvement on the first day, and it&#x27;s been about 6 weeks now and my vision is the most stable it has been in a long time. I no longer have eye discomfort or pain during the day or night. My left eye feels HEALTHY in a way it has not felt in a LONG time. The key was learning how often to use the wipe, how much of it to leave on the lids, and how long. At least for me, more is not better. I learned that too much Cliradex sitting on my lids will gum up the meibomian glands on the eyelids (where the oil comes out). That&#x27;s the last thing I wanted to happen, the whole point of using Cliradex is to kill my demodex mites that are causing dysfunction in the glands. I don&#x27;t wash off the Cliradex at night, but I do give my eyes a good cleansing in the morning to remove it, first with an OcuSoft scrub, then with a clean washcloth (no soap). I only use Cliradex once a day at night. Here&#x27;s my daily regimen, learned through trial and error. Hopefully this will help you too:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEFORE BED:&lt;br /&gt;--Wash your face with a gentle fragrance-free cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;--Heat a Thermalon Dry Eye Compress in a microwave for 20 seconds, lay on your back on the bed with the compress on both eyes for five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;--Then gently massage both eyelids with your index finger, using a back and forth motion with your eyes closed, not pressing too hard. Look up while doing this.&lt;br /&gt;--Get one packet of Cliradex wipes, cut it in half with a clean scissors (you can feel where the wipe is in the packet). Depending on how you cut it, you can get three pieces to use over three days. Put the extras in a plastic ziplock.&lt;br /&gt;--If doing this for the first time, sit down to apply the wipe since it will sting for about two minutes. Have a piece of paper nearby that you can fan your face with so it dries quicker, once it dries it will stop stinging. Take the wipe and close your eyes (don&#x27;t squeeze them, just close them like you&#x27;re sleeping). With your index finger, wipe back and forth with three motions (left, right, left) and then do the other eye, then use the wipe on your eyebrows, nose and cheeks. Wait until the stinging stops to open your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;--Do not use more than three wipe motions on each eye. If you put too much of the Cliradex on your lids, it can plug up your meibomian glands on your eyelids (where the oil comes out).&lt;br /&gt;--Do not wash off the Cliradex. Leave it on all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DURING SLEEP&lt;br /&gt;--Wear EyeSeals Thermoplastic Eye Shield to trap moisture around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MORNING&lt;br /&gt;--Wash your face with a gentle fragrance-free cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;--Wash your eyes with an Ocusoft Scrub wipe (don&#x27;t get the generic, it doesn&#x27;t work as well). You can also cut these in half. Use the wipe with your eyes closed, and leave the solution on your eyes for 30 seconds. This will help get the Cliradex solution off your eyelids so your oil glands can run freely.&lt;br /&gt;--Wash eyes with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;--Heat a Thermalon Dry Eye Compress in a microwave for 20 seconds, lay on your back on the bed with the compress on both eyes for five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;--Then gently massage both eyelids with your index finger, using a back and forth motion with your eyes closed, not pressing too hard. Look up while doing this.&lt;br /&gt;--(optional) Put Systane Preservative-Free Vial drops in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;--Throughout the day, as needed, run a paper towel under cold tap water and gently wipe your lids with your eyes closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw my ophthalmologist recently and he was flabbergasted at how good my eyelashes looked. He said he had never seen signs of mites, and he was quite surprised that this product worked for me. It really made him think. He said he had Cliradex samples in his office but never gave them out because no came into his office with the kind of eyelash symptoms he was looking for. Which goes to show that someone can be having demodex issues without it being visibly apparent.r towel under cold tap water and gently wipe your lids with your eyes closed.

            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product.  It&#x27;s been working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> Horrible tiny wipes in the size of two inches by two inches (could you make it ANY SMALLER !!??) - burn and sting skin, did not provide any relief...just burning of the skin. No help.</li>
            <li> Started getting stye. Used hot compresses like my eyeMD told me too (100+push up of hot water) &amp; Cliradex. Got rid of it fast without antibiotic! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Fantastic delivery on this product which is costly all over the network but does a wonderful job as a specialty item.  Try to give a bigger price break to prime customers would help boost sales for this quality item.</li>
            <li> Burns like crazy but I can tell such a difference in my eyes. No longer blurry and redness is quickly going away. I&#x27;ve been using them at night for about 3 weeks (I&#x27;ve missed a few days) but the difference is amazing! The burn is a little overwhelming the first week but you get used to it. The cornea specialist promised me that although it would burn, tea tree is not blinding :).</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Does burn a little.</li>
            <li> This is expensive, but my eyelashes are, after a few weeks of using these, finally filling in and looking fairly normal again.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s doing the job, but its a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> It does sting but seems to help.</li>
            <li> Cliradex helped clear up my eyes.</li>
            <li> Burned my eyelids and around my eyes terribly.  I switched to Sterilid Eyelid Cleanser by TheraTears.</li>
            <li> It helps a great deal if you hold a warm, moist, clean washcloth over your eyes for a few minutes to loosen up any crusty bits first. For 42.99 I guess I expected more. First, there are 24 packets in here, not a months worth. It does sting, don&#x27;t open your eyes till the solution dries. It hasn&#x27;t completely eradicated the demodex even after using it for two months. I switched to tea tree oil mixed with coconut oil. Does the same thing much cheaper. 10 drops of coconut oil to one drop of pure tea tree oil. After using the moist washcloth put a solution of the oils on a cotton ball, don&#x27;t soak it, you don&#x27;t want it dripping. I now do this 3-4 times a week and it keeps the demodex in check.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with Rosacea and Ocular Rosacea about two months ago. I was prescribed MetroGel and it was not effective at treating my red, scaly, rash covered face. I was also prescribed prescription eye drops for my dry eyes that felt like they were always burning. So, after extensive research...and I mean very extensive, I discovered that there were four items which came highly recommended by Rosacea sufferers all over the world. Those items were, Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap, Cliradex wipes, using an all natural anti-reddening cream and having a great sunscreen.  After I stopped using the MetroGel and switched over to these four products, used day and night (sunscreen only in the morning)...I have had clear skin, zero redness, zero irritation and extremely minimal flushing. My triggers WERE alcohol, heat, sun, cold and exercise. None of these have affected me so far since I began this regimen. As far as the other reviews regarding the &amp;#34;burning.&amp;#34; When I first started using the wipes, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a sting literally at all. I wipe my eyelids, then my eyebrows, then cheeks, forehead, chin and nose. However, on week 2, I did notice some burning, but it wasn&#x27;t anything I couldn&#x27;t tolerate...and it&#x27;s more of a sweet sting that comes from tea tree. Either way...the relief I get is well worth it. I also cut the wipe in half...I put the other half back inside the package and use it the next time. You do not need an entire wipe. Give it a shot...if you don&#x27;t like them or they don&#x27;t work for you...you can send them back. I  know I won&#x27;t be :) I  hope this is useful for any other Rosacea sufferers out there!</li>
            <li> Unlike some other reviews, I didn&#x27;t experience unbearable stinging and pain. It&#x27;s not the most pleasant experience, but it has made a big difference in the health of my eye lids and I haven&#x27;t had any sties since beginning this form of treatment.</li>
            <li> Had a terrible mybomian gland infection for about 2 months. Went through half the box and used 2x a day towards the end in combination with Occusoft eyelid scrubs for severe conditions. The occusoft scrub did nothing on its own but worked really well with this product. Stings for a few minutes but is well worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s improving so far and I could feel the&lt;br /&gt;difference.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, although a little expensive.</li>
            <li> My ophthalmologist recommended I give this a try to treat chronically inflamed eyelids.  It sting pretty severely when applied, though that dissipates withing 10 minutes.  But after using for three weeks, I never saw any benefit.</li>
            <li> I really gave this a good try, but unfortunately, I had to discontinue use.  It was just way too strong for my eyes.  They burned and watered for an hour afterwards.</li>
            <li> I am glad my doctor gave me a couple of samples to try the product.  I found it way to strong.  I am concerned with using something that stings so much on my eye lids.</li>
            <li> After steroid creams and drops did nothing to improve my daughter&#x27;s blepharitis and facial dermatitis, we started using coconut oil nightly on her hair and scalp, and a blend of tea tree oil/macadamia nut oil on her eyelids. This helped instantly but was messy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered Cliradex wipes as an alternative to our home mixture and she began using them twice a day on her eyelids. She had struggled 3 months with very swollen, red eyelids and extremely  flakey skin and scalp, and within a few days of using the wipes (and coconut oil on face/scalp) we saw noticeable results. Two full weeks of treatment has completely cleared her up but she plans to continue the wipes once a day for the next month to prevent a relapse. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> These wipes have resolved a horrible problem I had that neither the dermatologist, optometrist or ophthalmologist I saw could treat without cortisone and prednisone.  It does burn/sting a lot but leaves my skin and eyes clean, soft and free from papules and irritation.  Eight week treatment with Cliradex wipes at night and warm compresses for 4 mins in the morning was completely successful for treating demodex mite infestation.  I would recommended Cliradex to anyone with dry eye and demodicosis.  I now use a wipe or two during the week to maintain the good results.  My eyelashes are healthy looking again, too!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with blepharitis and chronic dry eye for about 15 years. I have tried: regular lid scrubs, warm compresses, omega-3 oils, Restasis, antihistamine drops, numerous artificial tear types, and &amp;#34;pulses&amp;#34; of steroid eye drops used for a few weeks every few months. My problems got worse and worse. It became impossible to wear my contacts. My eyelids were red and itchy, my eyes were painful and gritty and gunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read something about Demodex mites. I suffer also from rosacea and acne and have tried many things, some of which have helped and others not. When I read that people with Demodex have 10x as many mites as normal and tend to have acne, rosacea, and blepharitis, I immediately searched for a product to help me. I read about tea tree oil but was afraid to put the oil on my lids directly. That is very dangerous. I tried this product, which is formulated for the eyelids, instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS NOW if you have a similar story to mine! After just 2-3 weeks of using these every night on my lids, eyebrows, nose, cheeks, and rest of face (in that order -- lids first, then eyebrows, etc...), I am cured. No kidding!! I went from using artificial tears every 10-15 minutes all day every day to using them MAYBE once or twice per day now. My eyes feel amazing. My rigid gas permeable contacts are back in service, and feel just fine. I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;notice&amp;#34; my eyes at all! Like when I was a kid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to use warm compresses. No more baby shampoo lid scrubs. No more antibiotic/steroid drops, antihistamine drops, NOTHING. Just wiping with Cliradex at night and leaving it on all night. That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s magic. I&#x27;m so, so, so excited. I sound like an infomercial, but I&#x27;m that excited. And I am not a corporate plug. Just a really grateful woman who has suffered for years and years and is finally free!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small tiny downside -- these hurt and sting terribly. They really do. The first night, I had to sit down on my bathroom floor because my legs were shaking from the pain. I imagine that&#x27;s the &amp;#34;die off&amp;#34; of a million bacteria and mites exploding as the tea tree oil extract in the wipes hits their disgusting little cells. It hurts. But every day gets a little less painful. Now I only have to take a few deep breaths. And the sting, no matter how severe, only lasts about 1 minute. One REALLY LONG minute, but really, it&#x27;s just a minute. Then it fades and I don&#x27;t feel it at all during the night. No problem leaving the residue on there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I say to anyone who has my problems -- is manning up to one minute a day of pain that gets better every day worth being CURED of the hassle and pain of blepharitis and dry eyes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, that&#x27;s a huge huge YES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope these never go out of production. I&#x27;ve already reordered. I want to use 2 wipes per day -- 1 for eyes and eyebrows, and one for face. I&#x27;m using 1 wipe now, and I&#x27;m focusing on eyes and eyebrows, with cheeks etc as an afterthought. Yet, my rosacea is already looking better, and I haven&#x27;t had a big pimple since I started. I&#x27;m thinking using a fresh wipe on my face will improve the rosacea and breakouts just as much as it improved my eyelids. SO EXCITED about this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy buy buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED FEBRUARY 2016: I was asked a few times in the comments if these continue to help me. Yes, they do! I have been using 2 per day (1 eyelids, 1 face) ever since. My eye doctor told me not to stop because the Demodex will simply come back. You cannot get rid of them all, and almost every human has some. So, I faithfully use these wipes every night. They still sting, by the way. Not a ton, but it&#x27;s definitely still uncomfortable. Again, though, no pain, no gain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes still feel really great using these. I only have to use rewetting drops a few times a day, and mostly if I&#x27;m in on over-heated or over-A/C building. No pain, or gunk in my eyes. My skin has cleared up and looks the bestit&#x27;s looked since I was 10 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still highly recommend buying these to try them out if you have dry eye!it&#x27;s looked since I was 10 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still highly recommend buying these to try them out if you have dry eye!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  it really helps with my blepharitis/mgd.  i am only giving it 4 stars because it is outrageously expensive.  it comes to almost $2 per wipe.  price really needs to come down substantially.</li>
            <li> Price is high for what we get. Seems to work!!</li>
            <li> My doctor diagnosed me with ocular rosacea and recommended these wipes. The wipes seem to be preventing further problems with my eyes along with other treatments the doctor wanted me to use.</li>
            <li> They were very helpful; would use them again, if needed</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t handle the extreme burning.  I went back to Ocusoft eye scrub.</li>
            <li> Easy on the eyes and provides comfort to the eye(s).</li>
            <li> Came highly recommendment by our eye doctor.  My fiance uses it and she loves it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars except for the price which is exorbitant</li>
            <li> This wipe is a MUST HAVE for the treatment of Demodex Mites on the Eye Lashes.  It is the only product on the market that is immediately effective.  I have tried them all.  It is pricey and I do not see it available in any of the major chain drug stores.  Hunt around On Line to find the best price.  One wipe can be cut into 4 parts for 4 applications. Wash hands and sissors with antibacterial soap before cutting the wipe; and store it back into the package and wrap in a tiny baggie. Seal tight.  It is unclear how long one can continue using the wipes on a daily basis.  I have used them for just over 2 months; twice a day to keep the lashes clean and clear of debris. I am seeing the eye M.D.  this week so will get an answer to this question. dj</li>
            <li> Good as any other wipe but that does not say  a lot. Vastly overpriced, In my case did not relieve sympthoms. Blepharitis is tougher than Tea tree oil</li>
            <li> Excellent but very expensive</li>
            <li> Cliradex&lt;br /&gt;Cliradex Eyelid, Eyelash, and Facial Cleansing...has completely gotten rid of my itching eye lashes  Strong smell but great product</li>
            <li> This was recomnended for by my mom&#x27;s opthomogist to remove bacteria/mites from her eyes. The smell is very strong and the product Is very drying but mom is not rubbing her eyes as much and seems to see better. We will see what the dr says.</li>
            <li> This stuff works to clear demodex mites from eyelashes and eyebrows, take off makeup, or use for a good pick me up in the morning. It&#x27;s natural oils create a tingly sensation, and have a nice smell. Leave eyes slightly dry, but worth it!</li>
            <li> Effective as advertised, but the price is too high. Looking for other options.</li>
            <li> Very pricey!!! it did what it was supposed to do, but i will not order again, can&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li> Wow. It cleans so well that my twitchy eye lid firms up</li>
            <li> If these were more reasonably priced I would give it more stars</li>
            <li> Awesome wipes ! Yes, it does take several weeks for you to really feel a difference. I have an infestation of Demodex mites and I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the itchyness until around week 4... be prepared to buy at lease two boxes. I did try the cutting in half of the wipes, but the wipes are small to begin with and for me, cutting them in half just didn&#x27;t do the trick especially when I wanted to wipe down my whole face. I need to wipe more than my eyelashes especially at night when my whole face would itch. Also, please make these wipes cheaper !</li>
            <li> This does sting.  Especially at first but it&#x27;s the only product o t c or  prescription that has solved my dry eye  finally after two years of constant use of eye drops and wet compresses etc I have relief.  Nothing works better than cliradex</li>
            <li> Quick and as described</li>
            <li> Great product that arrived on time!</li>
            <li> Excellent item. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Eye doctor recommended.  Much improvement.</li>
            <li> This stuff made me miserable- it turned the skin around my eyes and my eyes red.  They swelled shut.  I ended up back at the eye doctor.&lt;br /&gt;I would not touch it again with a 10 foot pole.</li>
            <li> Might be a good product but way too expensive AND had to pay £23 unexpected duty for UK delivery.  Will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> It was very effective.  I need to order more</li>
            <li> Burns the eyes so be careful and keep your eyes closed!!</li>
            <li> I have problems with my eyes caused by blocked meibomian glands (the glands at the base of the eyelashes that release oil for the tear surface).  The blockage of these glands causes my eyes to produce excessive, burning tears.  Here is my current routine:  At night, I clean my eyes with Cetaphyl, hot water, and an Equate Exfoliating cleansing towelette (rinsing the towelette first with clean water)  I then put Theratears Sterilid gel on my lashes, top and bottom, and do NOT rinse it off.  I also rub it on my eyelids and eyebrows.  Recently, I added Cliradex wipes to this routine (wash with Cetaphyl and towelette, wipe eyes/lashes and entire face with Cliradex, use gel as described above).  I devised this routine based on the theory that perhaps I have demodex mites.  Both of these products contain tea tree oil which has been shown in numerous studies to reduce these mites.  TTO is very difficult to use around the eyes, so finding these products is hugely helpful.  Please note that I express these glands, particularly in my left eye, once a day as recommended by two doctors, but I am not really nuts about doing this because I think this could cause long-term damage to my eyes.  Please also note I plan to find a doctor with the lipiflow system to help clear these glands (you can google lipiflow - sounds like an amazing system).  During the day, I am using Systane once a day.  I was told to use this 4 times a day, but it is my goal to use it no more than once a day.  I do not think it is harmful, but having to add drops 4 times a day really makes this condition take over your life.  Lastly, I remember to blink much more during the day.  I use a computer most of the day and people blink less when they work on computers.  This is working for me right now, and I hope this routine helps someone else.  I will know by this winter whether this routine is largely successful as my eyes are much worse in the winter.  I will try to update this review in the spring as I know thereare many suffering with similar problems who are looking for answers.  Although expensive, I am thrilled to be able to purchase Ciradex through Amazon.  I also plan to give to my son for his acne.  I appreciate the advice from one reviewer who says cut in half.  I am going to try that.</li>
            <li> This is a convenient product, if a bit pricey, for the treatment of demodex folliculorum (a tiny mite that lives in the meibomian glands or eyelash follicles of the lids). You should, of course, see your optometrist or ophthalmologist to confirm any eye related diagnoses. However, I must say that my colleagues often miss or mistake demodex for other conditions (e.g. seborrheic or bacterial blepharitis, for which I would recommend the less expensive OCuSOFT product).  The manufacturer recommended course is to use the wipes twice daily for one month. One box contains 24 packets. Instead of purchasing two boxes, I would cut each towelette package and save half  for later use (should be more than adequate). As pointed out in the comment section, one box of 24 is not exactly a months worth, but don&#x27;t get too hung up on that as 3.4 weeks should be fine in most cases.  Be careful not to touch your eye with the wipes, as it will sting a bit. Close your eyes and gently dab/swipe around the lid lash area. Even so, the vapors may be enough to cause tearing at first. This is normal and most will become acclimated after a few uses. Your lids may be mildly red, but this should be temporary. Significant swelling lasting more than an hour likely indicates an allergic reaction and the product should be discontinued.  For the do-it-yourself individual or those on a budget, try mixing a small 2oz bottle of pure tea tree oil (melaleuca alternifolia) into a 40oz shampoo (like a baby shampoo) and doing a 1-2 minute scrub of your lashes, once again taking care not to get any into your eye.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the reimbursment for the postage.  The boxes were pretty beat up, but the product was fine.</li>
            <li> I noticed this helped me after about a week of use as directed. It does sting the eyes and I noticed it dried out my eyelids. I also noticed my eyes were watery for several minutes after using. The benefits of using this are less redness in my eyes, less itching of my eyelids and I no longer have to gritty, burning sensation throughout the day that I used to have. I began using my eye makeup again several days after beginning to use these wipes and found that my eye makeup did not bother me like it used to. My eyelashes are growing in also. It is expensive but once I get my issues under control perhaps I can use it every other day to make the expense less of a problem.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered.  Received when promised!!</li>
            <li> Have used the box. No real apparent change to my rosacea but still too early to tell after a life of the problem. Eyes seem a little better.</li>
            <li> I do like this and it does work. I use this for my eye lids to keep the dry partials out from my eyes. It is very good, but expensive for one use at a time. Each packet is good for one application. I bought through Amazon because dealing directly with the maker was some $6.00 more. My usage is daily and my insurance does not apply for this Ingredient. My review is for me, your results may be better. Buy via Amazon and your cost is a bit cheaper. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very good to helping me dray eye . Little expensive but works..</li>
            <li> A must for the treatment for Demodex control !</li>
            <li> When I first received these, I tried them once and completely gave up. They sting like crazy! I did not think there was any way I could tolerate the burning. I mean, I don&#x27;t know about you, but they burned me like my face was on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my itchy eyes have been driving me insane, so I tried them again. I had to fan my face like crazy after I use them. So, I bought a little $15 mini fan on Amazon, and I would run the fan on my face after I used the wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started cutting the wipes into four pieces. It was annoying, but works. Then I would just store them in a Ziploc bag. I heard a tip about cutting the entire package in four pieces, instead of the wipe – I&#x27;m going to try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, I got used to the incredible stinging and burning and decided to take it on as a challenge. I don&#x27;t want to pack the mini fan every time I travel, so I trained myself to withstand the burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is all this worth it? Yes. My eyes do not itch as much. I also use Burt&#x27;s bees baby shampoo mixed with a few drops of tea tree oil when I wash my face. The combination seems to be keeping the itching at bay.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent.  My eyes feel refreshed just minutes after using this product.  Though it is a bit expensive (I&#x27;m retired and on a fixed income) I will continue using this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Cliradex made my eyelids burn really bad!  I do not recommend this product at all!&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> Reduce paper packaging waste and save money by compounding your own 5 ounces of eyelid cleanser for about $17. Buy Terpinen-4-ol (T4O) and plain mineral oil. Dilute the T4O with the mineral oil to a concentration of 25% and use in place of Cliradex.  T4O essential oil is a compound in natural Tea Tree Oil that at 25% concentration kills Demodex faster than 25% TTO. Some people may also find T4O less irritating than TTO.    [...]    I bought my 1 ounce bottle of Terpinen-4-ol for $13 from an essential oils retailer on ebay.  A small bottle of mineral oil is about $4 at Target or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Eyes were feeling hot, dry and very itchy; was diagnosed with extreme dry eye and demodex. This product is great. First few times it stings and skin around eyes is red, but then by the end of week my skin had adjusted - no sting, no redness - just cool, clean feeling and no itch. Will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> The pads are convenient and effective but the solution seems harsh and has a burning effect on application the eyes. I stopped using it as soon as I could.</li>
            <li> No doubt this is a very good eyelid cleanser but my eyelids were severely blistered and swollen after first use of this product. No way will I use it again.</li>
            <li> Cliradex works! Finally a product that has tremendously improved my blepharitis and dry eye. Takes a few weeks to see improvement, so be patient and apply gently, don&#x27;t rub too hard. The product does burn a little, but it bothers me much less now that my eyes are less sensitive overall. I do my top lids first and wait a few seconds. Then I pull my lower lids down a bit to apply product directly on the lid margins, and hold lid down a few seconds for the product to dry so it doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes. If you&#x27;re on a tight budget, you can cut a pad in half or thirds while it&#x27;s still in the packet and save tightly wrapped in a baggie.</li>
            <li> it was expensive  and did nothing more than make my eyes burn and sting.I couldn&#x27;t find any benefit or relief that lasted.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes. I have tried the OcuSoft pads in the past and these Cliradex pads are much better for my personal case of mild-moderate blepharitis. I used them last year for about 4 or 5 months and my blepharitis almost completely cleared up. When I stopped using them for a good 4 or 5 months, my blepharitis came back again. I will stick to using these wipes every few months to keep my eye problems in check. The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give them five stars is because they are way too expensive. I wish that my eye doctor would carry these and they were sold at a more reasonable price. Although they burn, I ignore the feeling because it is brief and I know that the wipes work well. Don&#x27;t let people saying they burn discourage you from trying these wipes. I also use them on my eyebrows and facial skin sometimes, just like the package recommends. This seems to help.</li>
            <li> My eye doc thought this would be effective for demodex that she diagnosed.  Cliradex is very expensive but I was able to cut each piece into smaller strips and used it for my eyelid.  The cleanser does sting quite a bit for about a minute.  It is very effective and I noticed noticeable improvement within a week.</li>
            <li> This product works great for cleaning eyelashes and killing bacteria that can cause eye issues.  It also works great as a natural facial cleanser.  It is not the best scented product but it works well and I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This is NOT an immediate &amp;#34;Fix&amp;#34; as it take many applications to get results.  It&#x27;s going well however and there aren&#x27;t many alternatives so go for it.&lt;br /&gt;A bit expensive but the individual envelopes can be used more that once, just reinsert, fold over and use again.</li>
            <li> Expensive. Packets are great for traveling.</li>
            <li> This product is a medieval torture. You have to be prepared to endure chemical burn for a very doubtful result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mainly writing this to let people know that other reviews regarding the painful nature of this product may not be true for everyone. After reading the reviews, I was kind of paranoid to try them. Yes, they sting a little, but if you use them as directed, the stinging is brief and not that bad. I bought them for my rosacea, blepharitis and dry eye conditions and have been using them for a couple of weeks. I think my conditions are somewhat improved (which may increase over time) but nothing dramatic has happened.</li>
            <li> Cliradex is a very good product. It is a little pricey, and it only has 24 in the box. Thirty would be more ideal from a patient standpoint.  I would recommend it to anyone having a problem with their eyes.</li>
            <li> Recommended by opthamologist. Seems to work. My only concern that if it&#x27;s delivered on my deck during the summer, it will bake!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how much these toilettes&#x27; burned my eyelids.. I had to rinse my eyes immediately with warm water to stop the burning... Threw them away.</li>
            <li> Everything went smooth.  Rec&#x27;vd package in a couple of days, everything is good to go.  This stuff is not cheap but it works.</li>
            <li> Smells a little funny, but follow the directions and it works pretty fast. It makes my eyes feel better right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep eyes closed, but don&#x27;t squint when applying. Rub back and forth over lashes and upper and lower eyelid and stay away from the inner/outer corners of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I keep my eyes closed for about fifteen seconds after applying to let it dry some before opening them. My eyes feel immediately refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Use as directed, because if this stuff gets in your eyes, I am pretty sure you will be an unhappy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy good health!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s expensive.  Make sure you can tolerate the cooling menthol effect.</li>
            <li> I thought these would help with my ocular rosacea/dry eye, but all they did was sting and inflame my eyelids. I went through a whole box, cutting each wipe in half, so I think I gave it a fair try. I think I&#x27;ve done more harm than good trying these out.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product! I thought I was suffering from dry eye disease. As did my Opthamologist - but after getting a second opinion, an optometrist suggested I try this. Within one day of use 24 hrs. I had relief. I had been told to clean my eyes with baby soap, which I had been doing, for five years. Copiously! Alas, I could not wear make up - my eyes were so dry. Now one month later I can wear eye make up again! It&#x27;s like a miracle. Downside, you really need to use as directed. The essential oils don&#x27;t hurt but are not comfortable if it goes in the eye. I do rinse well. Second, I think it&#x27;s very costly. Lastly, I wish the box had been sealed. Each packet is of course sealed, but because this is for my eyes, I want it sealed. I also counted my packets. They were all there! I hope this works for others as well as it did for me! No need for Restasis!</li>
            <li> Cleared up eyebrow mites.</li>
            <li> Cliradex works but stings like the dickens!  I have used every other day w/ good results...Thanks Dr. Tseng...a much needed product.</li>
