    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is great for my self esteem as well !</li>
            <li>Impressive and surprising results.</li>
            <li>The package is very nice.</li>
            <li>Very effective.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I am already seeing a nice change in the way things are healing and I will update after the recommended 8 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>The burn is healing up nicely and the area is becoming lighter.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>This stuff is outstanding.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I cleanse my face and apply this after, I no longer use make up primer, this works much better for me.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and light and skin feels like silk !</li>
            <li>I believe strongly that the healing process would not have occurred but for the PureHealPlus.</li>
            <li>I no longer have that problem, I am getting so many positve compliments on how nice and clear my skin has has become.</li>
            <li>It is pricey but worth it if you can&#x27;t stand your scars.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;First one I got was fine, almost full bottle, easy to pump to get the cream but didn&#x27;t last long and instructions said to use it for about 3 months or longer if you are rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Similarly, the color of the scar blends in with his normal color, making the scar look more like a wrinkle than a scar.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any results, scar is still very visible.</li>
            <li>If you want something that really works on reducing your scar size this is it, nothing will come close.</li>
            <li>It was very pricey</li>
            <li>My husband and I highly recommend this product !&lt;</li>
            <li>Over the course of a year we have seen a tremendous improvement to such an extent that if one did not know that my father was injured, they would not suspect that he has this scar.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it - use 3x a day.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a lot more product in the little tube than this one.</li>
            <li>Babylon, New York</li>
            <li>The skin is clear and my complexion is evenly toned.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, my husband had double knee replacements, the incisions were becoming raised and dark on his skin.</li>
            <li>One-of-a-kind product for scars, it real y works well and after only two weeks of use the changes aré visible.</li>
            <li>it for an exchange, 3rd one with exact same problem, exchange again, 4th one the exact same problem, so I gave up, returned it and got money</li>
            <li>After trying many fade creams that only dried my skin out, this product was introduced to me.</li>
            <li>My father suffered a serious injury to his cheek which required many stitches and left a very visible scar (about 2 inches).  </li>
            <li>After 5 surgeries this past  year… I&#x27;ve been using PureHealPlus for only 3 weeks and have noticed a HUGE difference to my scars.  </li>
            <li>He started using this product and the incisions appear to have flattened, the skin around the areas are lightning as well, giving him the natural skin tone back.</li>
            <li>I am a 47 year old African American female .Over</li>

            <li> It too is expensive</li>
            <li> Scar Reducing Skin Care didn&#x27;t do anything for me, expensive as it is.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed and would never recommend PureHealthPlus Scar gel to anybody.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> after receiving a scar revision the DR. and staff  swore by this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or so now . I don&#x27;t see any results, scar is still very visible.</li>
            <li> my doctor suggested i use PH+ after my recent surgery, I had my stitches taken out 3 weeks ago and have used the scar gel for 2 weeks. I am already seeing a nice change in the way things are healing and I will update after the recommended 8 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> One-of-a-kind product for scars, it real y works well and after only two weeks of use the changes aré visible. If you want something that really works on reducing your scar size this is it, nothing will come close. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is outstanding. I was bitten in the face by a pitbull a few months ago. Dramatically reduced redness and the scarring. Impressive and surprising results.</li>
            <li> What a nightmare it was dealing with this product.&lt;br /&gt;First one I got was fine, almost full bottle, easy to pump to get the cream but didn&#x27;t last long and instructions said to use it for about 3 months or longer if you are rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second I got was half empty and impossible to get the product out by pumping at least 15 times to get 1 little drop.&lt;br /&gt;Returned it for an exchange, 3rd one with exact same problem, exchange again, 4th one the exact same problem, so I gave up, returned it and got money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasted weeks trying this horrible, useless overpriced and defective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying at your own risk and beware!!!</li>
            <li> I have used it for two weeks now on an oven burn, and it&#x27;s working well. The burn is healing up nicely and the area is becoming lighter. I will use it on my acne scars next and see what happens. The package is very nice.</li>
            <li> Arrived with cap open and liquid film on the depresser.  Very obvious it had been opened.  Item has made no difference whatsoever in my scars &amp; I have been using for over a month.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I definitely have noticed the difference in my acne scars. I had some pretty bad scars and when i use this regularly i can see the difference.  It is pricey but worth it if you can&#x27;t stand your scars.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because I didn&#x27;t see any change in my very long scar.  This was one of two products I tried.  It was very pricey and since I had not much of a result, I used a different product (NewGel) which I&#x27;m still using.  It too is expensive but I&#x27;m seeing results after a few weeks of use.  Also, it has a lot more product in the little tube than this one.</li>
            <li> I am a 47 year old African American female .Over the years, I had developed dark spots on my face from acne. After trying many fade creams that only dried my skin out, this product was introduced to me. It has done wonders for my skin. The skin is clear and my complexion is evenly toned. In the morning, I cleanse my face and apply this after, I no longer use make up primer, this works much better for me. It goes on smooth and light and skin feels like silk ! At bedtime I apply this before my acne topical, The PureHealplus keeps my skin from  &amp;#34; drying out&amp;#34;, which has previously happened to me when using any medicated topical. I no longer have that problem, I am getting so many positve compliments on how nice and clear my skin has has become.This is great for my self esteem as well ! In conclusion, my husband had double knee replacements, the incisions were becoming raised and dark on his skin. He started using this product and the incisions appear to have flattened, the skin around the areas are lightning as well, giving him the natural skin tone back. My husband and I highly recommend this product !&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. and Mrs. D. Knott&lt;br /&gt;West Babylon, New York</li>
            <li> After 5 surgeries this past  year… I&#x27;ve been using PureHealPlus for only 3 weeks and have noticed a HUGE difference to my scars.  They have lightened and flattened out.  A little of this goes a long way… Can&#x27;t wait to see how they look by the summer.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> PureHealthPlus Scar Reducing Skin Care didn&#x27;t do anything for me, expensive as it is. I&#x27;ve had to buy a different gel. I am disappointed and would never recommend PureHealthPlus Scar gel to anybody.</li>
            <li> Good product. Very effective. After a relatively short period of time this product reduced the effect of sutures and minimized scarring.</li>
            <li> While you are healing, not only does it prevent scarring but it feels so soothing.  I highly recommend it - use 3x a day.</li>
            <li> My father suffered a serious injury to his cheek which required many stitches and left a very visible scar (about 2 inches).  Over the course of a year we have seen a tremendous improvement to such an extent that if one did not know that my father was injured, they would not suspect that he has this scar.  The tissue around the scar also became softer and almost identical to the softness of the rest of his cheek and face.  Similarly, the color of the scar blends in with his normal color, making the scar look more like a wrinkle than a scar.  I believe strongly that the healing process would not have occurred but for the PureHealPlus.</li>
            <li> Works well and has protected areas from scarring.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a plastic surgeon to reduce scarring of benign keratoses burned off. They&#x27;re still red &amp; bumpy &amp; not totally healed, months later -- so it&#x27;s hard to tell whether this may have helped somewhat/at all. Net: certainly not worth the price, in my mind.</li>
