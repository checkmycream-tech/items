            <li>Superb product.</li>
            <li>The pricing through Amazon is great!</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Good product..will continue to order...works well without being greasy..</li>
            <li>and I realize just how good this works.  </li>
            <li>but it is a good light hold gel.  </li>
            <li>Love this as a setting gel and makes my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li>I let myself run out of my favorite thickening gel, and I will try to never let that happen again.</li>
            <li>What I really wanted was Nioxin Volumizing Thickening Gel which is a great product, but can&#x27;t be found.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve now been using it for more than 6 years and love it.</li>
            <li>Good stuff holds hair in place doesnt take much</li>
            <li>Love this product and so glad it came quickly.</li>
            <li>Holds my hair well, smell is not too strong or off-putting.  </li>
            <li>this gel is extremely light</li>
            <li>It is very light , yet holds amazingly well and creates body, not a wet look.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for my very fine, thin, staight hair.</li>
            <li>It has worked very well.</li>
            <li>Does not stay looking good for very long, in fact like a lot of other products, quickly turns flat &amp; oily!  </li>
            <li>I really like this product - it is not too heavy and works very well for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair and the only product that gives me volume and fullness is Nioxin Thickening Gel.</li>
            <li>Very sorry I purchased it, will continue to find a good replacement.&lt;br</li>

            <li> and I will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s on the market.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m trying it out along with the other nioxin hair products in the hope that it works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;MONEY NOT WELL SPENT!</li>
            <li> I also might mention that this gel does not weigh my hair down, is not sticky and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> the previous edition I&#x27;d been using.  </li>
            <li> The bottle cap is a little lose, but nothing leaks out.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if that is how it is meant to be.</li>
            <li> a bit expensive for the volume you&#x27;re getting</li>

            <li> My husband loves the product! Excellent AMAZON service and delivery as always!</li>
            <li> It was as described. Good product</li>
            <li> Good stuff holds hair in place doesnt take much seems to be making hair thicker</li>
            <li> Just look at my hair!</li>
            <li> this gel is extremely light and i saw no difference whatsoever. it&#x27;s a waste of money.  i won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair well, smell is not too strong or off-putting.  The bottle cap is a little lose, but nothing leaks out.  I am not sure if that is how it is meant to be.</li>
            <li> Love this as a setting gel and makes my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> It gives thickness to my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product and so glad it came quickly.</li>
            <li> I did not order ths gel. i do not use gel in my hair. This product was bundled in my order with a misleading discription.</li>
            <li> Good product..will continue to order...works well without being greasy..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for as long as it&#x27;s been out and I will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s on the market.  Nioxin changes their products periodically and I was hoping that this gel would work as well as the previous edition I&#x27;d been using.  Superb product.</li>
            <li> Have used this for about five years.  It has worked very well. The pricing through Amazon is great!</li>
            <li> a bit expensive for the volume you&#x27;re getting but it is a good light hold gel.  i&#x27;m not sure if it really thickens or gives the illusion of thickening but i&#x27;m trying it out along with the other nioxin hair products in the hope that it works.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for my very fine, thin, staight hair. It actuallly gives it some body.  This is the only Nioxin product I&#x27;ve tried...I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I let myself run out of my favorite thickening gel, and I will try to never let that happen again. I have very fine, thin hair and the only product that gives me volume and fullness is Nioxin Thickening Gel. I also might mention that this gel does not weigh my hair down, is not sticky and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have stuck with it for years.  There have been times when I ran out of product and used something else and I realize just how good this works.  It is very light , yet holds amazingly well and creates body, not a wet look. It lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> Thickening Gel, I don&#x27;t think so. What I really wanted was Nioxin Volumizing Thickening Gel which is a great product, but can&#x27;t be found. This product does not work on my hair! Does not stay looking good for very long, in fact like a lot of other products, quickly turns flat &amp; oily!  Very sorry I purchased it, will continue to find a good replacement.&lt;br /&gt;MONEY NOT WELL SPENT!</li>
            <li> My wife was a hairdresser and recommended Nioxin Gel for me and I&#x27;ve now been using it for more than 6 years and love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product - it is not too heavy and works very well for my hair.</li>
