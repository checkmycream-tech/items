            <li>They&#x27;ve been a life-saver more times than I can count!</li>
            <li>Great for light fabrics.  </li>
            <li>Works great, but you must have  lotion free skin for it to adhere.  </li>
            <li>NICE PACKAGING.</li>
            <li>This tape has come in so handy.</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re packaged nicely so you can keep them in your bag or travel with them.</li>
            <li>You kind of get the picture.  </li>
            <li>Its nice not to have to adjust your clothing all the time.  </li>
            <li>Nice that I don&#x27;t have to cut it and</li>
            <li>If you want the best, I&#x27;m pretty sure this is it.</li>
            <li>Good hold and easy to apply and remove</li>
            <li>NOT  a problem anymore, works great, and it stays exactly where I want it to</li>
            <li>These are nice, but not as strong as I&#x27;d like them to be.</li>
            <li>The company filled my order fast and the packaging was very good.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure  </li>
            <li>I love this fashion tape, I use it for so many things....</li>
            <li>Love love love these</li>
            <li>Love this stuff - have used it for years and</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if I was able to use them.</li>
            <li>so many more things I can&#x27;t even remember.  </li>
            <li>Amazon also definitely sells it for the best price out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>problem many women suffer from when wearing ballet flats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Held</li>
            <li>She was able to dance the night away without having to worry about a wardrobe malfunction.</li>
            <li>work fabulously!</li>
            <li>Really works for mending things on the fly.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic!</li>
            <li>All of us love this product.</li>
            <li>Tape works great at keeping shirts in place from revealing too much.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>love this tape..</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>I seriously LOVE this tape.  </li>
            <li>I also love it for keeping taping a shirt to my bra so as the day goes on you aren&#x27;t seeing my bra or more.  </li>
            <li>If you get this product make sure it is not the roll dispenser.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this tape, I&#x27;m never without it....</li>
            <li>Works okay.  </li>
            <li>The paper backing peels off very easily, and the sticky tape comes off your clothing easily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>:) They work fantastic.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m supposed to be one of the more intelligent people I know, so it was pretty funny.</li>
            <li>I use it for all kinds of things but my favorite use is to hem my pants and keep the original hem on the jeans.  </li>
            <li>Because this is made of a thicker plastic, it was easy to grab and yank off again.</li>
            <li>discrete; easy on and easy off...</li>
            <li>These are easy to use and work well.</li>
            <li>It even comes off easily at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Sticks well and lets go easily.</li>
            <li>get this product again, highly recommend, good price</li>
            <li>Seem to work fine with socks that already have a &amp;#34;no-slip gel&amp;#34</li>
            <li>These stuck to our skin just fine, but the fabric wouldn&#x27;t stay stuck to them.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>Have also used tape for a quick temporary emergency hem on pants - and it held all day!</li>
            <li>Long-time loyal customer now has one container for home, one for travel, and one for the purse!</li>
            <li>Work Great for what I needed it for in keeping a loose fitting jacket in place.</li>
            <li>These little tapes are wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Securely holds fabric in place to keep garments where you want them.</li>
            <li>I have used them to secure my bra strap to my boat-neck tops</li>
            <li>does not keep light clothing in place.</li>
            <li>This tape is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Because I liked them so much I decided to try the tape dispenser version of this.  </li>
            <li>Convenient, portable, easy to use, right size!  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this to keep my blouses from gaping between the buttons at the bust, but I now also use them to &amp;#34;hem&amp;#34; my work pants.  </li>
            <li>Unlike another clothing tape I purchased on Amazon, Hollywood Fashion Tape is easy to use and has just the right amount of sticking power to hold your blouse together between buttons or hold your bra staps under your shirt.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for keeping my daughter&#x27;s cochlear implants in place whole running and being active.  </li>
            <li>It works great on bra straps that keep slipping.  </li>
            <li>But overall, a good product and I would buy again.</li>
            <li>I put my gorgeous lace garters on, and realized that they were too big!</li>
            <li>It is not a bad product, but it did not do what I was hoping it would for me.  </li>
            <li>Keeps everything exactly in place, but also easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Yes I received the product quickly.</li>
            <li>You can burn through these really quick</li>
            <li>Bought this pack for &amp;#34;wedding season.&amp;#34; My maid of honor and I are both getting married in May, so I imagine there will be a huge need for some double-sided tape.</li>
            <li>For those younger folks who might happen to have that low cut dress or top, these work great for just about any type of clothing you want to stay in place.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li>This is fantastic stuff and very use to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old fashioned,  I don&#x27;t like my underwear to show, and these strips are the easiest and most reliable to use.</li>
            <li>I think this is a very handy little box to keep in your bag at all times.</li>
            <li>However, these little two sided tapes come in handy for keeping tank top straps in place or that top that might gap open when you bend over, etc.  </li>
            <li>but the company was great, I sent back what I didn&#x27;t use in the first tin and the other 2 untouched tins, my money was refunded very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The tape is clear and peels off easily after you are finished with it.  </li>
            <li>and holds very very very well.</li>
            <li>The stick on very easily and definitely stay in place until you are ready to remove them.</li>
            <li>Better product as compared to Braza which causes my skin to turn red and itchy and tape does not dispense too well from the tape dispenser</li>
            <li>These are very sticky!</li>
            <li>I love the product (Hollywood Fashion Tape- double sided).  </li>
            <li>I first purchased it on a shopping network.  </li>
            <li>This tape held them well for the whole day, and it peeled off painlessly when my hubby retrieved the garter!</li>
            <li>I am finally able to wear some clothes that I had shoved in back of my closet.</li>
            <li>first, I was only able to get the tape off with the writing.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as it should</li>
            <li>Its pretty sticky</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do... keeps your clothes in place.</li>
            <li>Handy tape for keeping clothes in place &amp; love the little tins!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, reliable, and usefully in 100 different outfits and situations.  </li>
            <li>I love the small cases the tape comes in, which made it easy to bring with me in my purse.</li>
            <li>We have been to to use toupee tape, but these are so much gentler on her delicate skin, easy to remove, yet super strong.  </li>
            <li>Not quite as strong as I had hoped, but fortunately many strips come in a single package, so I can double up on them.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll just need to be a bit more careful of where I put it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these tapes!</li>
            <li>this product has worked so very well that I have given some to my friends.</li>
            <li>Tape is ok.. not very sticky.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this for fashion emergencies!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>much easier to use than the tape.</li>
            <li>Really works</li>
            <li>These work very well.</li>
            <li>These work very well, even when you sweat a alot.</li>
            <li>I. Have tried to use this to hem up my daughters pants, used almost a whole container and the hem didn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li>work real well for me.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>very well holding your shirts to wherever you need coverage.  </li>
            <li>I also use it to tape my cardigan to a tank top to prevent it from slipping off my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>It really work...GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>However, it does irritate my skin (ok, I have a sensitive skin), so I can use it only for &amp;#34;fabric to fabric&amp;#34; purpose.</li>
            <li>Perhaps other fabrics would work better.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff... easy to put on and take off without damaging my clothes or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>These are great for those tops that hang low on your shoulders or to keep open front tops closed.</li>
            <li>Another idea I had was to put the tape down on the top of the bra strap and the bottom of the slip strap.</li>
            <li>I have used this clothing tape several times since I received it and it works very well to keep you straps right where you want them,  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little thicker than scotch tape, but made of a more flexible plastic type material.</li>
            <li>I was trying to solve something that required a little more &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;, and this just didn&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li>The strips on the other hand, have an edge to lift off the backing easily.</li>
            <li>The product was neatly packaged, and everything else was great, but for my purposes, it was a fail.</li>
            <li>up through walking to work and normal office work.  </li>
            <li>For single use on special occasions thre is not comparison,</li>
            <li>and lol I&#x27;m ebarrassed to admit, but I was totally using these wrong at first try.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s always some type of top that need a little taping so that bra straps don&#x27;t show, or so that the neckline doesn&#x27;t plunge quite so far.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without these.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without these.</li>
            <li>Be careful about dropping them though, they&#x27;re a pain to clean up.</li>
            <li>These seem to stay stuck on for longer than others I have tried especially when it is hot.  </li>
            <li>I love that this is packaged in three little compact containers, and individually wrapped like band-aids.</li>
            <li>The Double stick tape absolutely works.</li>
            <li>I also used the tape to stick fur trim to my flats, which held up really well - I did have to reinforce them toward the later part of the day.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how well they held up on my shoes.</li>
            <li>I would not have been able to wear my hot, little black dress for NYE without them.</li>
            <li>they were also good at keeping my shirt on my shoulders for part of the night, but even that started to fail later.</li>
            <li>First few times using this she messed up the placement and had to use a new set of strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My shirts that always slip to where my bra straps show no longer do, so I am not constantly figeting fixing my shirt all day long, to cover my them up, thanks to this Hollywood fashion tape.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for keeping my blouse cosed b/w the buttons to prevent awkward gaps but not strong enough to keep my skirt or dress in place.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re thin and clear and go on easily.</li>
            <li>but there aren&#x27;t really any directions other than what says &amp;#34;peel off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>These are much easier to use than other clothing tape I have tried,</li>
            <li>these little suckers can really help in a pinch were strong and reliable</li>
            <li>The shoulders were sliding down and while initially the tape held, about halfway into the event I do remember just taking the tape off , which wasn&#x27;t really holding the sleeves.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great for light fabrics.  </li>
            <li> Works great, but you must have  lotion free skin for it to adhere.  </li>
            <li> NICE PACKAGING.</li>

            <li> NOT  a problem anymore, works great, and it stays exactly where I want it to</li>
            <li> These are nice, but not as strong as I&#x27;d like them to be.</li>
            <li> The company filled my order fast and the packaging was very good.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure  </li>

            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if I was able to use them.</li>
            <li> so many more things I can&#x27;t even remember.  </li>
            <li> Amazon also definitely sells it for the best price out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> problem many women suffer from when wearing ballet flats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Held</li>
            <li> She was able to dance the night away without having to worry about a wardrobe malfunction.</li>
            <li> work fabulously!</li>
            <li> Really works for mending things on the fly.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic!</li>
            <li> All of us love this product.</li>
            <li> Tape works great at keeping shirts in place from revealing too much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> love this tape..</li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> I seriously LOVE this tape.  </li>
            <li> I also love it for keeping taping a shirt to my bra so as the day goes on you aren&#x27;t seeing my bra or more.  </li>
            <li> If you get this product make sure it is not the roll dispenser.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love this tape, I&#x27;m never without it....</li>
            <li> Works okay.  </li>
            <li> The paper backing peels off very easily, and the sticky tape comes off your clothing easily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> :) They work fantastic.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m supposed to be one of the more intelligent people I know, so it was pretty funny.</li>
            <li> I use it for all kinds of things but my favorite use is to hem my pants and keep the original hem on the jeans.  </li>
            <li> Because this is made of a thicker plastic, it was easy to grab and yank off again.</li>
            <li> discrete; easy on and easy off...</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and work well.</li>
            <li> It even comes off easily at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Sticks well and lets go easily.</li>
            <li> get this product again, highly recommend, good price</li>
            <li> Seem to work fine with socks that already have a &amp;#34;no-slip gel&amp;#34</li>
            <li> These stuck to our skin just fine, but the fabric wouldn&#x27;t stay stuck to them.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Have also used tape for a quick temporary emergency hem on pants - and it held all day!</li>
            <li> Long-time loyal customer now has one container for home, one for travel, and one for the purse!</li>
            <li> Work Great for what I needed it for in keeping a loose fitting jacket in place.</li>
            <li> These little tapes are wonderful!  </li>
            <li> Securely holds fabric in place to keep garments where you want them.</li>
            <li> I have used them to secure my bra strap to my boat-neck tops</li>
            <li> does not keep light clothing in place.</li>
            <li> This tape is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Because I liked them so much I decided to try the tape dispenser version of this.  </li>
            <li> Convenient, portable, easy to use, right size!  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this to keep my blouses from gaping between the buttons at the bust, but I now also use them to &amp;#34;hem&amp;#34; my work pants.  </li>
            <li> Unlike another clothing tape I purchased on Amazon, Hollywood Fashion Tape is easy to use and has just the right amount of sticking power to hold your blouse together between buttons or hold your bra staps under your shirt.  </li>
            <li> These are perfect for keeping my daughter&#x27;s cochlear implants in place whole running and being active.  </li>
            <li> It works great on bra straps that keep slipping.  </li>
            <li> But overall, a good product and I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I put my gorgeous lace garters on, and realized that they were too big!</li>
            <li> It is not a bad product, but it did not do what I was hoping it would for me.  </li>
            <li> Keeps everything exactly in place, but also easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Yes I received the product quickly.</li>
            <li> You can burn through these really quick</li>
            <li> Bought this pack for &amp;#34;wedding season.&amp;#34; My maid of honor and I are both getting married in May, so I imagine there will be a huge need for some double-sided tape.</li>
            <li> For those younger folks who might happen to have that low cut dress or top, these work great for just about any type of clothing you want to stay in place.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li> This is fantastic stuff and very use to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old fashioned,  I don&#x27;t like my underwear to show, and these strips are the easiest and most reliable to use.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very handy little box to keep in your bag at all times.</li>
            <li> However, these little two sided tapes come in handy for keeping tank top straps in place or that top that might gap open when you bend over, etc.  </li>
            <li> but the company was great, I sent back what I didn&#x27;t use in the first tin and the other 2 untouched tins, my money was refunded very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The tape is clear and peels off easily after you are finished with it.  </li>
            <li> and holds very very very well.</li>
            <li> The stick on very easily and definitely stay in place until you are ready to remove them.</li>
            <li> Better product as compared to Braza which causes my skin to turn red and itchy and tape does not dispense too well from the tape dispenser</li>
            <li> These are very sticky!</li>
            <li> I love the product (Hollywood Fashion Tape- double sided).  </li>
            <li> I first purchased it on a shopping network.  </li>
            <li> This tape held them well for the whole day, and it peeled off painlessly when my hubby retrieved the garter!</li>
            <li> I am finally able to wear some clothes that I had shoved in back of my closet.</li>
            <li> first, I was only able to get the tape off with the writing.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as it should</li>
            <li> Its pretty sticky</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do... keeps your clothes in place.</li>
            <li> Handy tape for keeping clothes in place &amp; love the little tins!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, reliable, and usefully in 100 different outfits and situations.  </li>
            <li> I love the small cases the tape comes in, which made it easy to bring with me in my purse.</li>
            <li> We have been to to use toupee tape, but these are so much gentler on her delicate skin, easy to remove, yet super strong.  </li>
            <li> Not quite as strong as I had hoped, but fortunately many strips come in a single package, so I can double up on them.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll just need to be a bit more careful of where I put it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these tapes!</li>
            <li> this product has worked so very well that I have given some to my friends.</li>
            <li> Tape is ok.. not very sticky.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this for fashion emergencies!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> much easier to use than the tape.</li>
            <li> Really works</li>
            <li> These work very well.</li>
            <li> These work very well, even when you sweat a alot.</li>
            <li> I. Have tried to use this to hem up my daughters pants, used almost a whole container and the hem didn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> work real well for me.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> very well holding your shirts to wherever you need coverage.  </li>
            <li> I also use it to tape my cardigan to a tank top to prevent it from slipping off my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> It really work...GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> However, it does irritate my skin (ok, I have a sensitive skin), so I can use it only for &amp;#34;fabric to fabric&amp;#34; purpose.</li>
            <li> Perhaps other fabrics would work better.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff... easy to put on and take off without damaging my clothes or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> These are great for those tops that hang low on your shoulders or to keep open front tops closed.</li>
            <li> Another idea I had was to put the tape down on the top of the bra strap and the bottom of the slip strap.</li>
            <li> I have used this clothing tape several times since I received it and it works very well to keep you straps right where you want them,  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little thicker than scotch tape, but made of a more flexible plastic type material.</li>
            <li> I was trying to solve something that required a little more &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;, and this just didn&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li> The strips on the other hand, have an edge to lift off the backing easily.</li>
            <li> The product was neatly packaged, and everything else was great, but for my purposes, it was a fail.</li>
            <li> up through walking to work and normal office work.  </li>
            <li> For single use on special occasions thre is not comparison,</li>
            <li> and lol I&#x27;m ebarrassed to admit, but I was totally using these wrong at first try.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s always some type of top that need a little taping so that bra straps don&#x27;t show, or so that the neckline doesn&#x27;t plunge quite so far.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these.</li>
            <li> Be careful about dropping them though, they&#x27;re a pain to clean up.</li>
            <li> These seem to stay stuck on for longer than others I have tried especially when it is hot.  </li>
            <li> I love that this is packaged in three little compact containers, and individually wrapped like band-aids.</li>
            <li> The Double stick tape absolutely works.</li>
            <li> I also used the tape to stick fur trim to my flats, which held up really well - I did have to reinforce them toward the later part of the day.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how well they held up on my shoes.</li>
            <li> I would not have been able to wear my hot, little black dress for NYE without them.</li>
            <li> they were also good at keeping my shirt on my shoulders for part of the night, but even that started to fail later.</li>
            <li> First few times using this she messed up the placement and had to use a new set of strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My shirts that always slip to where my bra straps show no longer do, so I am not constantly figeting fixing my shirt all day long, to cover my them up, thanks to this Hollywood fashion tape.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping my blouse cosed b/w the buttons to prevent awkward gaps but not strong enough to keep my skirt or dress in place.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thin and clear and go on easily.</li>
            <li> but there aren&#x27;t really any directions other than what says &amp;#34;peel off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These are much easier to use than other clothing tape I have tried,</li>
            <li> these little suckers can really help in a pinch were strong and reliable</li>
            <li> The shoulders were sliding down and while initially the tape held, about halfway into the event I do remember just taking the tape off , which wasn&#x27;t really holding the sleeves.</li>
            <li> The bra was never the same again: the fabric where the tape was placed got permanently stretched out when I removed it.  </li>
            <li> also, I used several of them at the end of a long rectangular silk scarf and voilà -- an infinity scarf!  </li>
            <li> I bought these to help keep my no show socks/liners from slipping off the back of my heel and into my shoe.</li>
            <li> I was CONSTANTLY fiddling with my fallen straps or slipping blouse or shifting tunics....</li>
            <li> I expected something like double sided tape - which this is-</li>
            <li> it just took me a long minute to figure that out.</li>
            <li> Have had a problem with slipping bra straps for years and this product has solved my daily frustration.</li>
            <li> So for about two days I actually thought that these stayed on by folding over the little piece of paper and sticking it that way.. only removing one side of tape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and now choose to only purchase this one.</li>
            <li> many pairs of flats were ruined faster than they should have been due to the odor from sweaty bare feet prior to this purchase :(</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the fabric coming loose.</li>
            <li> so he can not deny, but he will cut a smaller peices and put it on the underside of his dress shirt collars or pockets to keep them down.</li>
            <li> My skin got red and little blisters formed.</li>
            <li> I had a short Halloween costume and wanted to keep it from riding up a little, thought these would spare me from having to tug all night.</li>
            <li> I only wish the strips were a little shorter.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold as well as expected, but they help out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it to keep blouses between the buttons  closed and have put them in the wash and the tape still stays .</li>
            <li> The price for this 3-pack was competitive; it arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> But, this was also a heavy medieval dress.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for years to hold blouses closed.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend and do not use this product so can not really rate it in all honesty</li>
            <li> I can now wear button down shirts and can close up overly long v-necks, or fix bulging side pockets.  </li>
            <li> My liners don&#x27;t bunch up, I don&#x27;t get frustrated by lunch time and remove them, and my shoes aren&#x27;t in danger of becoming stinky.</li>
            <li> first worry was they would feel weird and just like wearing scotch tape on my heel.</li>
            <li> I even thought of other ways to use the tape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other imitations of this product, and nothing comes close.</li>
            <li> I usually wear flats with my work pants, but don&#x27;t want to permanently hem them because I occasionally wear them with heals.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rip your skin off like other brands.</li>
            <li> I cut the strip in half and use it to keep the gaps closed in button-up shirts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve not used this on regular clothing like that deep V-neck shirtI&#x27;ve been afraid to wear for fear of a &amp;#34;wardrobe malfunction&amp;#34;, but if it comes off some of my thinner/stocking like liners, I doubt I&#x27;ll have a problem with regular clothing.</li>
            <li> and I use them everyday to keep my  Bra straps from slipping.  </li>
            <li> I figured I could put a bandaid down and stick the tape to the bandaid and then to my bra strap.</li>
            <li> For years all I heard was &amp;#34;I took my socks off because they won&#x27;t stay up&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;they keep sliding down my heel and bunching&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not wearing socks with my flats today&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Worked well for my shirt that always slides down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive to by the precut tape, but in the long run you will definitely be ahead and much less frustrated.</li>
            <li> Have used these previously.</li>
            <li> I thought it was odd, but I had never tried this.</li>
            <li> I received my package in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I cut them in half</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time at least it does for me.  </li>
            <li> I hate myself for not knowing this was an easy fix to the &amp;#34;slipping sock&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I fold a piece and make a little gathering..</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little too revealing for work, and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worry two, I was going to destroy my socks/liners trying to get the adhesive off.</li>
            <li> I bought this tape before my wedding in case of emergency, and for a few tops that I packed for the honeymoon.</li>
            <li> These little beauties are embarrassing moment life savers!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was wrong, they last all day.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day the blisters broke and looked like small cuts.</li>
            <li> unaware that I was doing Fashion wrong.  </li>
            <li> usually I just attach it to my bras</li>
            <li> so my shoes come off and on at least twice (once to work, once home, and any stops in between)</li>
            <li> Maybe not a good idea to use on delicate fabrics though...</li>
            <li> However, I had a serious allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the tape on a continuous roll, but it&#x27;s tough to remove the backing.</li>
            <li> It holds well and does not leave any residue behind when removed.</li>
            <li> they just bunched up and stuck to my tights and made it look worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a barefoot driver (I seriously can&#x27;t drive with shoes on, weird</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s on, you don&#x27;t feel anything, no plasticy feeling, no sticky weird things going on.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for anything with a lot of lint or fuzz, but I have gotten my liners positioned wrong a couple times</li>
            <li> She is almost through all 3 tins of tape and has not once had the tape fail and her no-show socks slip.  </li>
            <li> Because you NEVER know when your spot-on-trend-but-doesn&#x27;t-quite-lay-correctly attire will start driving you crazy.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work there, but that is not it&#x27;s purpose anyway, so I wasn&#x27;t too disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was quite disappointed with how this product worked</li>
            <li> That annoying gap in the bust area on button shirts, just apply a strip.</li>
            <li> but they were HORRIBLE.</li>

            <li> Perfect for holding clothing necklines in place.</li>
            <li> use these all the time to maintain modesty</li>
            <li> Have used these previously. Better product as compared to Braza which causes my skin to turn red and itchy and tape does not dispense too well from the tape dispenser</li>
            <li> Unlike another clothing tape I purchased on Amazon, Hollywood Fashion Tape is easy to use and has just the right amount of sticking power to hold your blouse together between buttons or hold your bra staps under your shirt.  The paper backing peels off very easily, and the sticky tape comes off your clothing easily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> As advertised, great product</li>
            <li> Securely holds fabric in place to keep garments where you want them.</li>
            <li> I bought these to help keep my no show socks/liners from slipping off the back of my heel and into my shoe. Despite all the tips to buy a smaller size, different brand, etc. I could never keep them from sliding off and bunching up under my foot. I got these on a whim, I figured it would last a bit longer than without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong, they last all day. My liners don&#x27;t bunch up, I don&#x27;t get frustrated by lunch time and remove them, and my shoes aren&#x27;t in danger of becoming stinky. I&#x27;m also a barefoot driver (I seriously can&#x27;t drive with shoes on, weird I know) so my shoes come off and on at least twice (once to work, once home, and any stops in between) but the strips don&#x27;t loosen or fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first worry was they would feel weird and just like wearing scotch tape on my heel. They&#x27;re a little thicker than scotch tape, but made of a more flexible plastic type material. Once it&#x27;s on, you don&#x27;t feel anything, no plasticy feeling, no sticky weird things going on. I forget I have them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worry two, I was going to destroy my socks/liners trying to get the adhesive off. I&#x27;ve used double sided adhesive that stuck to that piece of clothing I was using it with and never came off, so I was not looking for a repeat experience. Because this is made of a thicker plastic, it was easy to grab and yank off again. No residue or anything and I can&#x27;t see anything there after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worry three, I&#x27;d get the tape on and then accidentally get it stuck on the hem of my pants when I was trying to put the liner on, or stuck to a piece of the liner that I didn&#x27;t want it stuck to, have to yank it off and start over again. I can&#x27;t speak for anything with a lot of lint or fuzz, but I have gotten my liners positioned wrong a couple times and I just carefully peeled them off the strips (I stick them directly to my heel) and reposition. I haven&#x27;t had to switch out a strip yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not used this on regular clothing like that deep V-neck shirtI&#x27;ve been afraid to wear for fear of a &amp;#34;wardrobe malfunction&amp;#34;, but if it comes off some of my thinner/stocking like liners, I doubt I&#x27;ll have a problem with regular clothing.</li>
            <li> It works great on bra straps that keep slipping.  I find that I cannot use it day after day when it touches my skin.  It can irritate if you do  so.  Just make sure  you give it a rest.  For single use on special occasions thre is not comparison,</li>
            <li> I love this fashion tape, I use it for so many things....</li>
            <li> Work Great for what I needed it for in keeping a loose fitting jacket in place.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold as well as expected, but they help out.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product. Good hold and easy to apply and remove</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE fashion tape!!! I use it for a lot of different things. Wrap dresses. When my daughters dresses are too big I fold a piece and make a little gathering.. My husband would NEVER admit this, but I do his laundry so he can not deny, but he will cut a smaller peices and put it on the underside of his dress shirt collars or pockets to keep them down. Great tool to have. I ordered the 3 pack to I can keep one at home, one in the car and one at the office. Never know.. Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I use the tape in place of a safety pin on low cut tops or wrap dresses. It holds well and does not leave any residue behind when removed.</li>
            <li> Bought this pack for &amp;#34;wedding season.&amp;#34; My maid of honor and I are both getting married in May, so I imagine there will be a huge need for some double-sided tape. I love that this is packaged in three little compact containers, and individually wrapped like band-aids. Tested on my skin/shirt and it seemed to work great.</li>
            <li> These are very sticky! :) They work fantastic.</li>
            <li> NICE PACKAGING. GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Worked great for my wife.</li>
            <li> I stuck this partly on the outside of my bra to keep a dress in place.  The bra was never the same again: the fabric where the tape was placed got permanently stretched out when I removed it.  It definitely did stick and hold things where I wanted them, I&#x27;ll just need to be a bit more careful of where I put it.</li>
            <li> These little tapes are wonderful!  I have used them to secure my bra strap to my boat-neck tops so the straps don&#x27;t show.  also, I used several of them at the end of a long rectangular silk scarf and voilà -- an infinity scarf!  I highly recommend these tapes!</li>
            <li> this product has worked so very well that I have given some to my friends. We all love it! It is really nice to find a product that does what it advertises that it will!</li>
            <li> The company filled my order fast and the packaging was very good.  I love the product (Hollywood Fashion Tape- double sided).  It is a staple to my wardrobe.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. One day I did a lot of walking and moving around and by the end of the day it wasn&#x27;t still sticking. But overall, a good product and I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love love love these, I keep a pack in my purse just in case I need them</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - have used it for years and</li>
            <li> I use these to keep shirts from gaping open.  These seem to stay stuck on for longer than others I have tried especially when it is hot.  I could imagine using these for hems that have come undone as well.</li>
            <li> Not quite as strong as I had hoped, but fortunately many strips come in a single package, so I can double up on them. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> One of my must-have items at work.</li>
            <li> Tape is ok.. not very sticky.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I first purchased it on a shopping network.  It lasts a very long time at least it does for me.  When I finally was getting low I went back to the shopping channel to purchase the product again but it was no longer being offered.  Thank goodness for Amazon.  Amazon has everything.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in both hands so I couldn&#x27;t use them.  I would give it 5 stars if I was able to use them.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for keeping my daughter&#x27;s cochlear implants in place whole running and being active.  We have been to to use toupee tape, but these are so much gentler on her delicate skin, easy to remove, yet super strong.  This is only product we will use with her.</li>
            <li> Yes I received the product quickly. Very happy with this purchase. The tape works great.</li>
            <li> Great tapes.  Work well as per instructions.  Great for light fabrics.  Haven&#x27;t used them with anything heavier than blouses.</li>
            <li> Order was correct and On time as promised</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. It works on skin to fabric just as good as it does on fabric to fabric.</li>
            <li> Excelent product. It works perfect.</li>
            <li> This tape has come in so handy. I bought this tape before my wedding in case of emergency, and for a few tops that I packed for the honeymoon. I actually did end up using this tape in an emergency on the day of my wedding! I put my gorgeous lace garters on, and realized that they were too big! I ended up taping them onto my leg. This tape held them well for the whole day, and it peeled off painlessly when my hubby retrieved the garter! I highly recommend buying this for fashion emergencies!</li>
            <li> blouses always fell off shoulders,  bra straps showing.  NOT  a problem anymore, works great, and it stays exactly where I want it to</li>
            <li> It does help keep things in place. I tried to use it on a table edge to keep the edge protector in place but it doesn&#x27;t work there, but that is not it&#x27;s purpose anyway, so I wasn&#x27;t too disappointed. It definitely keeps my blouses where I want them. But don&#x27;t expect double duty. I am finally able to wear some clothes that I had shoved in back of my closet.</li>
            <li> The Double stick tape absolutely works. However, I had a serious allergic reaction to it. My skin got red and little blisters formed. By the end of the day the blisters broke and looked like small cuts. I wonder what chemicals are in this tape. However, I would still recommend it. Some people may not have an allergic reaction. I even thought of other ways to use the tape. I figured I could put a bandaid down and stick the tape to the bandaid and then to my bra strap. Another idea I had was to put the tape down on the top of the bra strap and the bottom of the slip strap. In both ways the tape wouldn&#x27;t touch my skin. I haven&#x27;t tried either yet, but I bet they would work.</li>
            <li> Convenient, portable, easy to use, right size!  Fits all needs possible. . .would get this product again, highly recommend, good price</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life, Fashion Tape?!  How did I ever function without you?!  Oh wait, I remember... I was CONSTANTLY fiddling with my fallen straps or slipping blouse or shifting tunics.... unaware that I was doing Fashion wrong.  UGH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, this stuff is great.  I keep a pack in my purse, at home and another in my desk drawer at work. Because you NEVER know when your spot-on-trend-but-doesn&#x27;t-quite-lay-correctly attire will start driving you crazy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely the best.  I&#x27;ve used it to close up a button that tends to bulge over my chest, to raise the neckline of a shirt that&#x27;s a little too revealing for work, and so many more things I can&#x27;t even remember.  It&#x27;s strong, reliable, and usefully in 100 different outfits and situations.  I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it!  Amazon also definitely sells it for the best price out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product - just buy it!</li>
            <li> My husband uses these to keep his ties in place. He&#x27;s a singer and does a lot of moving and dancing on stage.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution for those tops that don&#x27;t quite stay in place . I&#x27;ve used them to cover bra straps and they stay put all day. I&#x27;ve even used it to keep blouses between the buttons  closed and have put them in the wash and the tape still stays . They don&#x27;t ruin my clothes when they&#x27;re removed and have even kept my bridesmaids dress up during my wedding! I&#x27;m a customer for life !</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these.</li>
            <li> Great price for how many you get. You can burn through these really quick so I&#x27;d recommend the value pack. And they&#x27;re packaged nicely so you can keep them in your bag or travel with them. Be careful about dropping them though, they&#x27;re a pain to clean up.</li>
            <li> For years all I heard was &amp;#34;I took my socks off because they won&#x27;t stay up&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;they keep sliding down my heel and bunching&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not wearing socks with my flats today&amp;#34;.  I haven&#x27;t heard any of these since I bought this pack of fashion tape.  She is almost through all 3 tins of tape and has not once had the tape fail and her no-show socks slip.  I hate myself for not knowing this was an easy fix to the &amp;#34;slipping sock&amp;#34; problem many women suffer from when wearing ballet flats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Held up through walking to work and normal office work.  Seem to work fine with socks that already have a &amp;#34;no-slip gel&amp;#34; on the inner heel.  First few times using this she messed up the placement and had to use a new set of strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many pairs of flats were ruined faster than they should have been due to the odor from sweaty bare feet prior to this purchase :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the review heading throw you off.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of low cut dresses and such.  However, these little two sided tapes come in handy for keeping tank top straps in place or that top that might gap open when you bend over, etc.  You kind of get the picture.  For those younger folks who might happen to have that low cut dress or top, these work great for just about any type of clothing you want to stay in place.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter&#x27;s prom dress and they worked perfectly. She was able to dance the night away without having to worry about a wardrobe malfunction.</li>
            <li> It is not a bad product, but it did not do what I was hoping it would for me.  I was trying to solve something that required a little more &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;, and this just didn&#x27;t do it.  I did return it but the company was great, I sent back what I didn&#x27;t use in the first tin and the other 2 untouched tins, my money was refunded very quickly.  I would say the company policy is great if you like it or don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have used this clothing tape several times since I received it and it works very well to keep you straps right where you want them,  Its nice not to have to adjust your clothing all the time.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> The price for this 3-pack was competitive; it arrived on time and as expected. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> this tape is amazing! and holds very very very well. usually I just attach it to my bras so my shirts stay put. it can be placed anywhere though. and lol I&#x27;m ebarrassed to admit, but I was totally using these wrong at first try. first, I was only able to get the tape off with the writing. I thought it was odd, but I had never tried this. I expected something like double sided tape - which this is- it just took me a long minute to figure that out. lol So for about two days I actually thought that these stayed on by folding over the little piece of paper and sticking it that way.. only removing one side of tape. ha! I did not realize until I went to take it off that more paper comes off and that it is in fact invisible tape!  i&#x27;m supposed to be one of the more intelligent people I know, so it was pretty funny. but there aren&#x27;t really any directions other than what says &amp;#34;peel off&amp;#34;. but yes, it actually peels off on both sides and is legit tape. for anyone who had a blonde moment like me.</li>
            <li> Sticks well on the skin but does not stick at all on clothing. Was quite disappointed with how this product worked</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other imitations of this product, and nothing comes close. I will never use anything else. There is no substitute.</li>
            <li> Handy tape for keeping clothes in place &amp; love the little tins!!!</li>
            <li> Have had a problem with slipping bra straps for years and this product has solved my daily frustration. So happy to have discovered them.</li>
            <li> work fabulously! discrete; easy on and easy off...much easier to use than the tape.</li>
            <li> Great find!  I wish I knew about these things earlier! Live and learn.  I can now wear button down shirts and can close up overly long v-necks, or fix bulging side pockets.  They keep the fabric together with no issue for me. I have not tried fabric to skin or strapless garments, however.  Great to just have on hand and in cute purse size containers.</li>
            <li> Does everything it was meant to do!</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and work well.</li>
            <li> These are nice, but not as strong as I&#x27;d like them to be. Perfect for keeping my blouse cosed b/w the buttons to prevent awkward gaps but not strong enough to keep my skirt or dress in place. I had a short Halloween costume and wanted to keep it from riding up a little, thought these would spare me from having to tug all night. Nope. they just bunched up and stuck to my tights and made it look worse. Oh well. they were also good at keeping my shirt on my shoulders for part of the night, but even that started to fail later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old fashioned,  I don&#x27;t like my underwear to show, and these strips are the easiest and most reliable to use. I&#x27;ve tried the tape on a continuous roll, but it&#x27;s tough to remove the backing. The strips on the other hand, have an edge to lift off the backing easily.</li>
            <li> Worked well for my shirt that always slides down.  Will keep using.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Really works</li>
            <li> These work very well.</li>
            <li> Really works for mending things on the fly. Always take them when traveling!</li>
            <li> Love these! I use them all the time especially with summer fashions.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> These are awesome &amp; work really great!!  My shirts that always slip to where my bra straps show no longer do, so I am not constantly figeting fixing my shirt all day long, to cover my them up, thanks to this Hollywood fashion tape.  I just put it on my strap on my shoulder, in front of the mirror, remove the 2nd side of the tape &amp; place my shirt where it needs to be.  Voila!! It even comes off easily at the end of the day.  This is a great product.  The price was good &amp; I received them within the 2 day Prime shipping time.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! I would not have been able to wear my hot, little black dress for NYE without them. Keeps everything exactly in place, but also easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I had a great experience. I received my package in less than a week. I got exactly what I paid for. I can&#x27;t wait to use this product.</li>
            <li> I used these to hold my costume in place for a festival. The shoulders were sliding down and while initially the tape held, about halfway into the event I do remember just taking the tape off , which wasn&#x27;t really holding the sleeves. I used 2 pieces on each of my shoulders. But, this was also a heavy medieval dress. I also used the tape to stick fur trim to my flats, which held up really well - I did have to reinforce them toward the later part of the day. Basically I use them as costume stickers to hold things together. I was really surprised at how well they held up on my shoes. I think this is a very handy little box to keep in your bag at all times. It has more uses than it is intended for!</li>
            <li> Great value. Always have these in my purse!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as it should</li>
            <li> these little suckers can really help in a pinch were strong and reliable</li>
            <li> Can never have enough of this fashion tape.  Great price.</li>
            <li> A staple in my purse. So many great uses.</li>
            <li> These work very well, even when you sweat a alot.</li>
            <li> I. Have tried to use this to hem up my daughters pants, used almost a whole container and the hem didn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> These are great for those tops that hang low on your shoulders or to keep open front tops closed. The stick on very easily and definitely stay in place until you are ready to remove them.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of these:  one for me, and one for each of my sisters. There&#x27;s always some type of top that need a little taping so that bra straps don&#x27;t show, or so that the neckline doesn&#x27;t plunge quite so far. All of us love this product.</li>
            <li> must have.  so convenient and they stay sticky</li>
            <li> Must have for the office and purse. Fixes button gape and hems that come out. I only wish the strips were a little shorter. They feel unwieldy.</li>
            <li> Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;They work real well for me. That annoying gap in the bust area on button shirts, just apply a strip. The gap is gone and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It works very well. However, it does irritate my skin (ok, I have a sensitive skin), so I can use it only for &amp;#34;fabric to fabric&amp;#34; purpose.</li>
            <li> This clothing tape is great.  I prefer modesty and this does the job.  Works very well holding your shirts to wherever you need coverage.  I&#x27;ve already went thru one canister and will be putting in another order soon.</li>
            <li> Tape works great at keeping shirts in place from revealing too much. Have also used tape for a quick temporary emergency hem on pants - and it held all day!</li>
            <li> I use this to take gaps in shirts, blouses, dresses.  Works great, but you must have  lotion free skin for it to adhere.  I also use this a lot for temporary hemming of pants, skirts and jeans.  Holds the hem great!</li>
            <li> These little beauties are embarrassing moment life savers! Every lady out there needs to have a pack of these...buy them!</li>
            <li> does not keep light clothing in place. the cloth sags from the tape.</li>
            <li> my wife swears by these, perfect way to make sure clothing stays in place.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I originally bought this to keep my blouses from gaping between the buttons at the bust, but I now also use them to &amp;#34;hem&amp;#34; my work pants.  I usually wear flats with my work pants, but don&#x27;t want to permanently hem them because I occasionally wear them with heals.  I&#x27;ve also used them to keep my blouse taped to my bra straps so the shoulders don&#x27;t gape and show my bra.  This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> excellent quality and service, i order again</li>
            <li> I only use this tape for clothing. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and now choose to only purchase this one. it works well</li>
            <li> love this tape..it works so well. It keeps clothing where it should be without exposing what shouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> Love these strips! I have been using them for years to hold blouses closed. I cut them in half and they work perfect!</li>
            <li> Good product. It doesn&#x27;t rip your skin off like other brands. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this brand of fashion tape.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these. What had I been doing all those years without them???</li>
            <li> I always use this brand. Definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> This tape is fantastic.  The tape is clear and peels off easily after you are finished with it.  Its pretty sticky and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the fabric coming loose.</li>
            <li> Love these.  They&#x27;ve been a life-saver more times than I can count!</li>
            <li> I used this to hold some garments in place on my wedding day.  It worked great until I started sweating, which happens to most brides!  I love the small cases the tape comes in, which made it easy to bring with me in my purse.</li>
            <li> I use this tape for CosPlay costumes. It holds great and keeps my sleeves and socks where they need to be. It&#x27;s transparent so no one ever notices it. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I cut the strip in half and use it to keep the gaps closed in button-up shirts.</li>
            <li> I seriously LOVE this tape.  I use it for all kinds of things but my favorite use is to hem my pants and keep the original hem on the jeans.  I can wear the same pair of pants with flats and heels.  I also use it to tape my cardigan to a tank top to prevent it from slipping off my shoulders.  I also love it for keeping taping a shirt to my bra so as the day goes on you aren&#x27;t seeing my bra or more.  This is fantastic stuff and very use to use.  I have forgotten and run it through the washing machine with no problem or damage to my clothing.</li>
            <li> These stuck to our skin just fine, but the fabric wouldn&#x27;t stay stuck to them.  I got them for the edge of my daughter&#x27;s lace wedding dress, so it would stay flush against her skin and not buckle out.  It was the French lace with the cut edges that looked frayed.  They wouldn&#x27;t stay stuck to the tape. Perhaps other fabrics would work better.  The product was neatly packaged, and everything else was great, but for my purposes, it was a fail.</li>
            <li> These are the best thing ever if you have straps that fall or shirts that gap. I&#x27;ve probably used hundreds of these things in my life! They&#x27;re thin and clear and go on easily. Every woman needs some!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful, I don&#x27;t see how I could not know about them!  Carry a pack at all times now. Because I liked them so much I decided to try the tape dispenser version of this.  Looked like a good idea but they were HORRIBLE. If you get this product make sure it is not the roll dispenser.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive to by the precut tape, but in the long run you will definitely be ahead and much less frustrated.</li>
            <li> Must have when wearing shirts</li>
            <li> They work well and do the job of holding clothes in place.  I use them all the type to hide bra straps or keep a cardigan in place.</li>
            <li> It really work...GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  It is a very good product and came in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> These tapes are the best and I use them everyday to keep my  Bra straps from slipping.  A wonderful and comfortable solution.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do... keeps your clothes in place. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Wish I had heard about it years ago.  I have one tunic blouse with a V in the front.  The underneath cloth was always trying to &amp;#34;peak&amp;#34; out.  This took care of it.  I&#x27;ve used it to close the front of a blouse too.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend and do not use this product so can not really rate it in all honesty</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... easy to put on and take off without damaging my clothes or irritating my skin. Nice that I don&#x27;t have to cut it and the tins keep the strips neatly contained in my purse so I can find one when I need one.</li>
            <li> I love this tape, I&#x27;m never without it....</li>
            <li> Works well. Maybe not a good idea to use on delicate fabrics though...</li>
            <li> If you want the best, I&#x27;m pretty sure this is it. Convenient.  Sticks well and lets go easily.</li>
            <li> Works okay.  Good for the price.  Don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> These work - enough said.</li>
            <li> Long-time loyal customer now has one container for home, one for travel, and one for the purse! Excellent!</li>
            <li> They worked like I was hoping I&#x27;ve got enough to last for sometime, very glad they came in a pack of 3.</li>
            <li> These are much easier to use than other clothing tape I have tried,</li>
