            <li>Have always loved both these products.</li>
            <li>Good seller and OBAGI</li>
            <li>Good travel product.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase from Liz skincare.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my Obagi face care!</li>
            <li>I just love the Obagi line of products!  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed that I do not have any break outs at all any more!  </li>
            <li>Great to keep in your travel bag and ready to go.</li>
            <li>These are the perfect smaller size for travel.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>Have used products for six years and feel they are foundational to healthy skin.</li>
            <li>Love Obagi products and love the travel size of the cleanser and toner.  </li>
            <li>Authentic Obagi products.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find the Obagi cleansing gel and toner since I had purchased a kit from my dermotaligist</li>
            <li>I received my order very fast and it was packaged nicely in bubble wrap and the seal was still on the products.</li>
            <li>The toner is refreshing and the cleanser is gentle.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>but one of those things that for me, the convenience was worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Keep your skin care items and cosmetics with you on board with these just right bottles.  </li>
            <li>For Obagi users, each step is important, and I love the small sizes to use in the shower or put inside the medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>Same great product in a little package.  </li>
            <li>real plus.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look so much brighter</li>
            <li>These duos are so much more convenient than having to purchase the entire set just to get the travel size cleanser and toner because, even though I use all the products, I don&#x27;t use everything at the same rate.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal for the travel size and it last because you only need very little to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li>More than enough for, at least, a month&#x27;s travel.</li>
            <li>This travel pack was kind of expensive</li>
    </ol>

            <li> For Obagi users, each step is important, and I love the small sizes to use in the shower or put inside the medicine cabinet.  Would definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Good seller and OBAGI and it is the BEST for your skin! TRY IT! &amp;#60;3 You will NOT be dissapointed!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Obaji products work great but they are pricey.  This is a great deal for the travel size and it last because you only need very little to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> Awsome....i.like it...</li>
            <li> Good travel product.  This travel pack was kind of expensive but one of those things that for me, the convenience was worth the price.  I plan on popping the plastic off the inside cover and refilling as needed. Great to keep in your travel bag and ready to go.</li>
