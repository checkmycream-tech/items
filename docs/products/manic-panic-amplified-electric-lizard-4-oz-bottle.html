            <li>This hair color ended up being absolutely awesome!!</li>
            <li>AWESOME!</li>
            <li>It was very impressive at the music festival</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve reapplied about every 2 weeks or so and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This color is SO BRIGHT!</li>
            <li>I bleached mine before I dyed it, though, and the result was great.</li>
            <li>All in all I am happy with it, but I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, so I just wanted to say beware of this seller</li>
            <li>:b</li>
            <li>/&gt;Check out Manic Panic&#x27;s web site for some really good</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>but, I love it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>(And I have been dying my own hair for about almost 10 years).</li>
            <li>- I use it as a sort of top coat.</li>
            <li>LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hyper neon color, I&#x27;ve received so many complements.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely ordering two at a time from now on to make sure I have a good stock!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, good secure packaging.</li>
            <li>It came out super vibrant and even washes out to a nice bright shade of yellow-green.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the color, and the thickness of the dye made it very easy to get in my hair without making a huge mess.</li>
            <li>Once on light brown hair (does not show as easily) and once after hair was lightened (much better).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used foil to separate out the hair and a tint brush to apply - I also strongly advise using gloves.  </li>
            <li>Manic Panic has great reds and blues, but for greens, I&#x27;d steer clear and use special effects.</li>
            <li>The green was so vibrant and beautiful, Im really happy with how it turned out.</li>
            <li>Also the bottle looks huge in the picture, in reality the bottle is like as tall as my pinky.</li>
            <li>but it turned out an awesome neon green color.</li>
            <li>, I did not bleach my hair because it was light brown/blond.</li>
            <li>let the dye set for 2 hours, and the color is lasting great.</li>
            <li>This is intense and takes well, so make sure it&#x27;s what you want :)</li>
            <li>The dye itself was incredibly runny and foamed slightly when I tried to rub it into my hair.</li>
            <li>(I let it sit for a full hour, too), and where it did show up it washed out in about 3 shampoos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many compliments since using it, its been color fast for weeks now</li>
            <li>The green is truly bright and fluorescent!  </li>
            <li>My hair is a perfect neon green and it&#x27;s been fading really gracefully.</li>
            <li>I read that you can (and should) leave this product in as long as you can to get a really bright result.</li>
            <li>and I was really happy with this shade of green.</li>
            <li>you want it for the blacklight effects, then it&#x27;s probably worth it.</li>
            <li>Soft Scrub removed from the sink any drips of green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be sure to protect your hairline / ears with petroleum jelly or your skin will stain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a bright and true green, you need electric lizard.</li>
            <li>Def NOT the super bright green</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind, because that&#x27;s not why I bought this color, but if it&#x27;s what you want, I suggest you make sure your hair is bleached as light as possible before dying to get that effect.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to get such a bright green out of Special Effects or Sparks.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve dyed my hair an un-natural color</li>
            <li>, they might not send you exactly what you ordered.</li>
            <li>Son is happy with his new green hair...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even use the whole bottle, and my hair turned out a deep, brilliant green.     </li>
            <li>It just pops and is very vibrant.</li>
            <li>later this week i&#x27;m excited to see how well it really glows!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t show up much even on my bleached hair</li>
            <li>Colour is nice but doesn&#x27;t last long on</li>
            <li>this is my favorite green dye, it comes out a really bright green!!</li>
            <li>I bleached my dark waist-long hair and dyed it with this color, and it came out super bright green.</li>
            <li>Normally I like manic panic, but I can&#x27;t help feeling that this particular dye is a flop.</li>
            <li>The one slightly disappointing thing was that it didn&#x27;t glow very brightly under blacklights as advertised.</li>
            <li>Mixed with some Ion teal it came out a very lovely shade of green.</li>
            <li>It may only last a few washes until it starts to fade, but its worth having your hair so soft and bright for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it also showed up very well under a black light (not what I wanted it for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far my favorite shade of green I&#x27;ve worn so far!</li>
            <li>I was a vision under a black light.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really run in the shower or stain my pillows, and the color lasts for several weeks without fading.</li>
            <li>The Electric Lizard showed up more yellow than green (I&#x27;ve used the non-amplified version before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my daughter put this on her pre-bleached hair and it barely took!  </li>
            <li>So about a week after bleaching with flash 30 vol (to give my hair a break) I dumped the whole bottle in my freshly washed and dried hair, let it dry with some heat here in there, then wrapped my head in saran wrap and went to bed.</li>
            <li>I used this color a lot when my hair was short, I did a half an half with a turquoise I made and it&#x27;s been one of my favorite dye jobs since I started dying my hair.</li>

            <li> In short, I did every little trick I had heard to make the dye vibrant.</li>
            <li> By contrast, the iguana green dye I used on the rest of my hair was thick and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I had my dark brown hair lightened (highlights, not whole head) professionally and</li>
            <li> My hair was lightened down to nearly white before I did</li>
            <li> I used an entire container of the amplified formula on half of my hair.</li>
            <li> It covered my hair evenly despite being a very uneven combination of blonde,  sky blue, dark blue, and pink.</li>
            <li> Remember, though, this is only SEMI-Permanent dye and it will wash out within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Overall I was not pleased, I will retry it tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I went on a big float trip so mine washed out a little quicker than usual, but that&#x27;s no problem with the product itself.</li>
            <li> I have medium to dark blond hair and didn&#x27;t bother bleaching before using this on my ends.</li>
            <li> The color that resulted was a pale, faded pastel green that did not completely saturate my hair, so some spots were paler than others.</li>
            <li> Lasts like other Manic Panic colors, which is a few weeks when you swim a lot.</li>
            <li> it was like dark puke green.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what other reviewers did to have their color turn out so well.</li>
            <li> Warning, though, you do have to pre-bleach your hair for this to work; otherwise you&#x27;ll get little to none of the effects of it.</li>
            <li> The result was the brightest, softest, electric green hair I have ever seen on anyone.</li>
            <li> re-did the green myself with Manic Panic Amplified Electric Lizard.  </li>
            <li> The color was not bright green</li>
            <li> There is hardly any color there.</li>
            <li> I left the color in over night, applied heat, rinsed with vinegar, and then rinsed with cold water.</li>
            <li> THis is my second time using this dye, and I am still disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately we will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed  with this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible-</li>

            <li> I used an entire container of the amplified formula on half of my hair. I left the color in over night, applied heat, rinsed with vinegar, and then rinsed with cold water. In short, I did every little trick I had heard to make the dye vibrant. It didn&#x27;t help. THis is my second time using this dye, and I am still disappointed. I had decided to try the amplified to see if that helped at all, but it didn&#x27;t. I bleached my hair to almost white-blonde before applying as well. The color that resulted was a pale, faded pastel green that did not completely saturate my hair, so some spots were paler than others. The dye itself was incredibly runny and foamed slightly when I tried to rub it into my hair. By contrast, the iguana green dye I used on the rest of my hair was thick and easy to work with. I didn&#x27;t even use the whole bottle, and my hair turned out a deep, brilliant green.     Normally I like manic panic, but I can&#x27;t help feeling that this particular dye is a flop. I am not sure what other reviewers did to have their color turn out so well. Perhaps it only works on thinner hair? Whatever the reason, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this dye for anyone. Manic Panic has great reds and blues, but for greens, I&#x27;d steer clear and use special effects.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t show up much even on my bleached hair (I let it sit for a full hour, too), and where it did show up it washed out in about 3 shampoos.</li>
            <li> The UV effect starts fading after two washes. Colour is nice but doesn&#x27;t last long on it&#x27;s own - I use it as a sort of top coat.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve dyed my hair an un-natural color and I was really happy with this shade of green. It just pops and is very vibrant. Warning, though, you do have to pre-bleach your hair for this to work; otherwise you&#x27;ll get little to none of the effects of it. I bleached mine before I dyed it, though, and the result was great. Remember, though, this is only SEMI-Permanent dye and it will wash out within a few weeks. I went on a big float trip so mine washed out a little quicker than usual, but that&#x27;s no problem with the product itself. But yeah, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This hair color ended up being absolutely awesome!! I did have to bleach my hair prior to putting the hair color in but it turned out an awesome neon green color.</li>
            <li> I bleached my dark waist-long hair and dyed it with this color, and it came out super bright green. I am very happy with the color, and the thickness of the dye made it very easy to get in my hair without making a huge mess. The one slightly disappointing thing was that it didn&#x27;t glow very brightly under blacklights as advertised. I don&#x27;t really mind, because that&#x27;s not why I bought this color, but if it&#x27;s what you want, I suggest you make sure your hair is bleached as light as possible before dying to get that effect.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite green dye, it comes out a really bright green!! it doesn&#x27;t really run in the shower or stain my pillows, and the color lasts for several weeks without fading.</li>
            <li> Tried it twice. Once on light brown hair (does not show as easily) and once after hair was lightened (much better). Son is happy with his new green hair...</li>
            <li> The product I got in the mail was just the regular electric lizard, not the amplified version. Mixed with some Ion teal it came out a very lovely shade of green. All in all I am happy with it, but I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, so I just wanted to say beware of this seller, they might not send you exactly what you ordered.</li>
            <li> AWESOME! I read that you can (and should) leave this product in as long as you can to get a really bright result. So about a week after bleaching with flash 30 vol (to give my hair a break) I dumped the whole bottle in my freshly washed and dried hair, let it dry with some heat here in there, then wrapped my head in saran wrap and went to bed. The result was the brightest, softest, electric green hair I have ever seen on anyone. It was very impressive at the music festival I went to that weekend. I was a vision under a black light. I will not be using box color or paying a million dollars at a salon for hair color anymore. It may only last a few washes until it starts to fade, but its worth having your hair so soft and bright for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> I have medium to dark blond hair and didn&#x27;t bother bleaching before using this on my ends. It came out super vibrant and even washes out to a nice bright shade of yellow-green. I&#x27;ve reapplied about every 2 weeks or so and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I used this color a lot when my hair was short, I did a half an half with a turquoise I made and it&#x27;s been one of my favorite dye jobs since I started dying my hair.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed  with this product. The color was not bright green it was like dark puke green. I cant blame this entirely on the color though, I did not bleach my hair because it was light brown/blond. Also the bottle looks huge in the picture, in reality the bottle is like as tall as my pinky. Overall I was not pleased, I will retry it tomorrow.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color. I&#x27;ve had so many compliments since using it, its been color fast for weeks now and i&#x27;ve got a Blacklight party in vegas later this week i&#x27;m excited to see how well it really glows!</li>
            <li> This color is SO BRIGHT! I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> The green was so vibrant and beautiful, Im really happy with how it turned out. Now, which color next...? :b</li>
            <li> This is intense and takes well, so make sure it&#x27;s what you want :)</li>
            <li> The Electric Lizard showed up more yellow than green (I&#x27;ve used the non-amplified version before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it also showed up very well under a black light (not what I wanted it for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want it for the blacklight effects, then it&#x27;s probably worth it. I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> I had my dark brown hair lightened (highlights, not whole head) professionally and re-did the green myself with Manic Panic Amplified Electric Lizard.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out Manic Panic&#x27;s web site for some really good tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You MUST have pre-lightened hair to get the color in the jar.  My hair was lightened down to nearly white before I did this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used foil to separate out the hair and a tint brush to apply - I also strongly advise using gloves.  Soft Scrub removed from the sink any drips of green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be sure to protect your hairline / ears with petroleum jelly or your skin will stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the dye set for 2 hours, and the color is lasting great.</li>
            <li> Loved it. It covered my hair evenly despite being a very uneven combination of blonde,  sky blue, dark blue, and pink. I have never used a Manic Panic product before tonight. I used to swear by Ion Color Brilliance but I may never go back after today. Go Manic Panic, Go! I can&#x27;t speak on how long-lasting this color is but, I love it! (And I have been dying my own hair for about almost 10 years).</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get such a bright green out of Special Effects or Sparks. My hair is a perfect neon green and it&#x27;s been fading really gracefully. If you&#x27;re looking for a bright and true green, you need electric lizard.</li>
            <li> Horrible- my daughter put this on her pre-bleached hair and it barely took!  There is hardly any color there. Unfortunately we will be returning it. Def NOT the super bright green she was expecting......</li>
            <li> My wife has stuck with this color for a while, which is saying a lot.  The green is truly bright and fluorescent!  Lasts like other Manic Panic colors, which is a few weeks when you swim a lot.</li>
            <li> So far my favorite shade of green I&#x27;ve worn so far! Hyper neon color, I&#x27;ve received so many complements. Very fast shipping, good secure packaging. I&#x27;m definitely ordering two at a time from now on to make sure I have a good stock!</li>
