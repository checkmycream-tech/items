            <li>The people at Ulta told me they get many, many returns on Chi.  </li>
            <li>The people at Ulta told me they get many, many returns on Chi.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I have to say that the straighener is a better quality than the Chi because it does NOT snag your hair at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought the Babyliss</li>
            <li>But my clients are always satisfied</li>
            <li>and I love the way my hair looks and feels after I leave her.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive used so many irons....</li>
            <li>so i thought &#x27;ONE MORE</li>

            <li>100% recommended!!!\\&quot;, Always buy with this great and excellent company very liable!!!!!,</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Item was arrived before I expected, was very good!!!</li>
            <li>and I can use it to create different styles because it can do beautiful curls ....</li>
            <li>but with this Magnificent iron I finish in less than 20 minutes</li>
            <li>When I was finished with my first curling, the want itself had many, many strands of hair stuck in it.  </li>
            <li>They do get very very hot!</li>
            <li>what a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>made a huge difference while curling.  </li>
            <li>but this is an amazing product that works so well and leaves your hair so shiny and straight.</li>
            <li>I got this like 2 years ago sooooo cheap</li>
            <li>Great especially for the price!</li>
            <li>i wanted this flat iron after using a friends and i fell in love.it makes my hair so smooth.it also takes my hair from curly to pin straight in seconds its the best ever.</li>
            <li>just that one in the past - so it&#x27;s a great deal!!  </li>
            <li>Once again, the BaByliss glided through my hair more readily, and never caught my fine ends.  </li>
            <li>we do use the straight sexy hair smooth and protect spray to protect from the heat..</li>
            <li>If you want a straightener that really, really works, is easy to handle, and does a great job, I definitely recommend this one!</li>
            <li>Would also be helpful if it beeped when ready to use but still way better than my ghd.  </li>
            <li>I can only say that this is a really good purchase.</li>
            <li>in the end, the straight look is ok... but still</li>
            <li>The ultra thin design provides for easy maneuverability and the price is AWESOME.  </li>
            <li>I believe that the baby bliss iron is a miracle ,my daughters hair is pin straight and even when she wases it it stays straight ,its the weirdest thing ive ever seen,, we love it!</li>
            <li>Of course the Amazon price was much better, and in this instance, I got an extra BaByliss Pro for free!  </li>
            <li>Of course the Amazon price was much better, and in this instance, I got an extra BaByliss Pro for free!  </li>
            <li>doesnt pull your hair, it leaves it super glossy and flexible - mind</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it sure leaves your hair</li>
            <li>After I got my straightener, I can only say I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I read many, many reviews before purchasing the Babyliss flat iron.</li>
            <li>Stays hot and keeps my hair smooth and shiny looking.</li>
            <li>It was a special from Ulta ($99)and had a pretty silver trim around the wand.  </li>
            <li>I rarely straightener my hair now</li>
            <li>Great flat iron especially for super curly hair!</li>
            <li>No need to go super hot.</li>
            <li>so I plugged it in right away and gave it a go.  </li>
            <li>I have been using these for 3-4 years now and they get our hair silky smooth and soft without burning it!</li>
            <li>Like, straight out of the salon!</li>
            <li>And just to think, when I first used it I thought all reviews about this item were lies and was going to call you all out on it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The iron gets so hot</li>
            <li>It came with the exact packaging shown in the image.</li>
            <li>What used to take me about 20-25 minutes with my ghd iron, took me only 10 minutes (no hair breakage) and the results were 10x better.  </li>
            <li>Only thing more I could ask for is a bag/resting mat</li>
            <li>and we really like them!  </li>
            <li>The iron gets REALLY HOT.</li>
            <li>Like, REALLY REALLY HOT.</li>
            <li>I tried the safety switch many times,and I tried plugging it in different outlets.  </li>
            <li>Even the next day the BaByliss side held much better than the Chi</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone that want their natural curls to be pin straight!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my last babyliss (same model) and was delighted to get two for the price of one.</li>
            <li>I have pretty course hair with no perm and these irons can get it bone straight.  </li>
            <li>and I personally believe that Babyliss flat iron work just as good</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite flat irons!!</li>
            <li>I did not want to use too much heat</li>
            <li>but it really is legit.</li>
            <li>It really does the job in no time for me.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast fast and does not get any build up on the plates.</li>
            <li>but sometimes the volume is just too much</li>
            <li>They work very well</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that is treated with the keratin treatment</li>
            <li>Its also a very slim iron</li>
            <li>Gets hair extremely straight.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>, n your done so much faster then blow drying your hair.</li>
            <li>And it stays straight for days (unless I run threw the rain).</li>
            <li>Heat stays constant and the size makes it incredibly light weight.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to have the larger one as a back up in the event</li>
            <li>I have medium length thick curly/frizzy hair which I can straighten with a good blow dryer</li>
            <li>I saw a review on youtube of this flat iron and it said the cord was tangle free...</li>
            <li>I then waited to see if one iron would hold the curl better than the other.  </li>
            <li>More so than any other iron.  </li>
            <li>More so than any other iron.  </li>
            <li>I am planning to sell my other one to my friend, and I have already used mine many times.</li>
            <li>When you turn it on, it only takes about 20-30 seconds to get all the way hot, and it gets HOT.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many different high end brands and would definitely recommend this straightener!</li>
            <li>It is very slender and has a &#x27;smooth&#x27; feel when you use it; it does not break your hair like some other straighteners do (when your hair gets caught in the hinges and so forth).  </li>
            <li>Well, like most people, I was a little worried if the package would contain both of the straighteners...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Hispanic and I have really thick, but sleek hair, and this straightener is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it a few times - First of all, it heats up super fast (BUY A HEAT MAP</li>
            <li>This straightening iron definitely lived up to my expectations - which were pretty high.  </li>
            <li>The iron took about a minute (maybe less) to heat up and the titanium plates glided easily through my hair.  </li>
            <li>My grandaughter has this exact same straightener</li>
            <li>especially since salons smell like burning when hot combs are used.</li>
            <li>But I only flat iron my hair when it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>This is my first titanium flat iron</li>
            <li>This flat iron got my hair PIN straight!</li>
            <li>Be careful as this iron gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>(I have natural hair and suffered heat damage before).</li>
            <li>and I stepped on it and completely broke it.</li>
            <li>but when I use this one, it leaves my hair soft and sleek.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my 18 year old daughter</li>
            <li>I gave it to my 18 year old daughter</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair; the iron makes my hair smooth and shiny and stays straight all day.</li>
            <li>I saw the same exact straightening iron in red at the beauty supply store by my house for $179 - and it wasn&#x27;t even a duo!!!  </li>
            <li>This iron cuts down the time it takes to flat iron my girls&#x27; super curly hair!</li>
            <li>It is much quicker to straighten using the BaByliss due to the longer plates.  </li>
            <li>It is much quicker to straighten using the BaByliss due to the longer plates.  </li>
            <li>My hair has a medium amount of natural wave and this flat Iron takes it out.</li>
            <li>Ordered the BaByliss Pro Nano Titanium 1 inch Ultra Thin Duo in Blue last week and was glad to see it waiting for me when I got home from work today.  </li>
            <li>When i got through with my hair, it was still thick and too full.</li>
            <li>I could pick up wider sections of hair due to the long heating elements, and straightened that side of my hair much quicker than the Chi side.</li>

            <li> made a huge difference while curling.  </li>
            <li> but this is an amazing product that works so well and leaves your hair so shiny and straight.</li>
            <li> I got this like 2 years ago sooooo cheap</li>
            <li> Great especially for the price!</li>
            <li> i wanted this flat iron after using a friends and i fell in love.it makes my hair so smooth.it also takes my hair from curly to pin straight in seconds its the best ever.</li>
            <li> just that one in the past - so it&#x27;s a great deal!!  </li>
            <li> Once again, the BaByliss glided through my hair more readily, and never caught my fine ends.  </li>
            <li> we do use the straight sexy hair smooth and protect spray to protect from the heat..</li>
            <li> If you want a straightener that really, really works, is easy to handle, and does a great job, I definitely recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Would also be helpful if it beeped when ready to use but still way better than my ghd.  </li>
            <li> I can only say that this is a really good purchase.</li>
            <li> in the end, the straight look is ok... but still</li>
            <li> The ultra thin design provides for easy maneuverability and the price is AWESOME.  </li>
            <li> I believe that the baby bliss iron is a miracle ,my daughters hair is pin straight and even when she wases it it stays straight ,its the weirdest thing ive ever seen,, we love it!</li>
            <li> Of course the Amazon price was much better, and in this instance, I got an extra BaByliss Pro for free!  </li>
            <li> Of course the Amazon price was much better, and in this instance, I got an extra BaByliss Pro for free!  </li>
            <li> doesnt pull your hair, it leaves it super glossy and flexible - mind</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it sure leaves your hair</li>
            <li> After I got my straightener, I can only say I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I read many, many reviews before purchasing the Babyliss flat iron.</li>
            <li> Stays hot and keeps my hair smooth and shiny looking.</li>
            <li> It was a special from Ulta ($99)and had a pretty silver trim around the wand.  </li>
            <li> I rarely straightener my hair now</li>
            <li> Great flat iron especially for super curly hair!</li>
            <li> No need to go super hot.</li>
            <li> so I plugged it in right away and gave it a go.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these for 3-4 years now and they get our hair silky smooth and soft without burning it!</li>
            <li> Like, straight out of the salon!</li>
            <li> And just to think, when I first used it I thought all reviews about this item were lies and was going to call you all out on it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The iron gets so hot</li>
            <li> It came with the exact packaging shown in the image.</li>
            <li> What used to take me about 20-25 minutes with my ghd iron, took me only 10 minutes (no hair breakage) and the results were 10x better.  </li>
            <li> Only thing more I could ask for is a bag/resting mat</li>
            <li> and we really like them!  </li>
            <li> The iron gets REALLY HOT.</li>
            <li> Like, REALLY REALLY HOT.</li>
            <li> I tried the safety switch many times,and I tried plugging it in different outlets.  </li>
            <li> Even the next day the BaByliss side held much better than the Chi</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that want their natural curls to be pin straight!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my last babyliss (same model) and was delighted to get two for the price of one.</li>
            <li> I have pretty course hair with no perm and these irons can get it bone straight.  </li>
            <li> and I personally believe that Babyliss flat iron work just as good</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite flat irons!!</li>
            <li> I did not want to use too much heat</li>
            <li> but it really is legit.</li>
            <li> It really does the job in no time for me.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast fast and does not get any build up on the plates.</li>
            <li> but sometimes the volume is just too much</li>
            <li> They work very well</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that is treated with the keratin treatment</li>
            <li> Its also a very slim iron</li>
            <li> Gets hair extremely straight.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> , n your done so much faster then blow drying your hair.</li>
            <li> And it stays straight for days (unless I run threw the rain).</li>
            <li> Heat stays constant and the size makes it incredibly light weight.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to have the larger one as a back up in the event</li>
            <li> I have medium length thick curly/frizzy hair which I can straighten with a good blow dryer</li>
            <li> I saw a review on youtube of this flat iron and it said the cord was tangle free...</li>
            <li> I then waited to see if one iron would hold the curl better than the other.  </li>
            <li> More so than any other iron.  </li>
            <li> More so than any other iron.  </li>
            <li> I am planning to sell my other one to my friend, and I have already used mine many times.</li>
            <li> When you turn it on, it only takes about 20-30 seconds to get all the way hot, and it gets HOT.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many different high end brands and would definitely recommend this straightener!</li>
            <li> It is very slender and has a &#x27;smooth&#x27; feel when you use it; it does not break your hair like some other straighteners do (when your hair gets caught in the hinges and so forth).  </li>
            <li> Well, like most people, I was a little worried if the package would contain both of the straighteners...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Hispanic and I have really thick, but sleek hair, and this straightener is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it a few times - First of all, it heats up super fast (BUY A HEAT MAP</li>
            <li> This straightening iron definitely lived up to my expectations - which were pretty high.  </li>
            <li> The iron took about a minute (maybe less) to heat up and the titanium plates glided easily through my hair.  </li>
            <li> My grandaughter has this exact same straightener</li>
            <li> especially since salons smell like burning when hot combs are used.</li>
            <li> But I only flat iron my hair when it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> This is my first titanium flat iron</li>
            <li> This flat iron got my hair PIN straight!</li>
            <li> Be careful as this iron gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> (I have natural hair and suffered heat damage before).</li>
            <li> and I stepped on it and completely broke it.</li>
            <li> but when I use this one, it leaves my hair soft and sleek.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my 18 year old daughter</li>
            <li> I gave it to my 18 year old daughter</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair; the iron makes my hair smooth and shiny and stays straight all day.</li>
            <li> I saw the same exact straightening iron in red at the beauty supply store by my house for $179 - and it wasn&#x27;t even a duo!!!  </li>
            <li> This iron cuts down the time it takes to flat iron my girls&#x27; super curly hair!</li>
            <li> It is much quicker to straighten using the BaByliss due to the longer plates.  </li>
            <li> It is much quicker to straighten using the BaByliss due to the longer plates.  </li>
            <li> My hair has a medium amount of natural wave and this flat Iron takes it out.</li>
            <li> Ordered the BaByliss Pro Nano Titanium 1 inch Ultra Thin Duo in Blue last week and was glad to see it waiting for me when I got home from work today.  </li>
            <li> When i got through with my hair, it was still thick and too full.</li>
            <li> I could pick up wider sections of hair due to the long heating elements, and straightened that side of my hair much quicker than the Chi side.</li>
            <li> Despite the shape of the flat iron, it is possible to do curls with it, regular curls, spiral curls, feathers, flips, etc.   </li>
            <li> 2 Babyliss flat irons for only $99.95!!</li>
            <li> One of them is the regular size and the other is just a little bit smaller (not by much).  </li>
            <li> So in my mind, I already gave this flat iron 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I never had a flat iron that could do this to my hair before.</li>
            <li> I never saw a reason touch that part of the flat iron anyway..</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron set at TJ Maxx for $70.</li>
            <li> I received a Chi flat iron for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I decided to return this iron as well, but waited until after the BaByliss flat iron from Amazon arrived so I could compare</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get those flat spots at your hair line.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this flat iron to anyone.</li>
            <li> In fact, I got it because it is the flat iron my hairdresser uses</li>
            <li> im the flat iron</li>
            <li> I used to use the CHI years ago and it just totally burns your hair, making it dry and fried.</li>
            <li> It is hard to keep it straight too</li>
            <li> The Babyliss did not tug at my hair and the long heating elements</li>
            <li> you, i have extremely long hair</li>
            <li> But that is expected with a salon quality flat iron.</li>
            <li> Later I found it on Amazon and was so shocked that you can get the same exact one with an EXTRA one that was a tad bit smaller for around $100!</li>
            <li> I was without a straightener for about a year and a half, and avoided buying a new one because I didn&#x27;t want to waste $200 again.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I kept researching and wanted to see what negatives this iron brought, because the other ones i bought on amazon were not real.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical at first, thinking it was a fake</li>
            <li> I  tried and tested other name brands</li>
            <li> It does get hot - and I guess a little dangerous - if you touch the area outside of the plates on the end of the arms, but there&#x27;s plenty room on the handle part, so you won&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat down at my powder table and curled one side of my hair with the Chi, and the other side with the Babyliss.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had an automatic shut-off, thats my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> would hands down order the BaByliss over the Chi if I ever need another iron.  </li>
            <li> I would hands down order the BaByliss over the Chi if I ever need another iron.  </li>
            <li> It straightens my hair in over half the time as any other straightener I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I messed up my ends pretty bad, and I don&#x27;t leave the straightener on my ends for long at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered this pack of two for less than the cost of buying</li>
            <li> I like having the 2 sizes because I would rather use only the small one anyway and the small one looks easier to handle.</li>
            <li> It broke after a year and a half and my friend reccomended buying a BabyLiss like hers.</li>
            <li> Replaced same product that got broken by one of the other stylists because everyone wanted to borrow it!</li>
            <li> I looked on the web and with this little push, i decided to invest.</li>
            <li> something happens to the little one.</li>
            <li> I definitely took advantage of this, especially since my mom, my younger sister, and me used to use the one I had a lot, and it was annoying having to wait for one person to finish using it.</li>
            <li> It still stinks because of the high heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad at my self, I spent a lot of money buying flat irons</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulders by about 5 or 6 inches.  </li>
            <li> This only happens when hair is dirty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i kept waiting for the negative specs to pop up and that i would have something to say that i didnt like about it, um...</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was unhappy with my CHI flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Other irons i have to use very thin layers of my hair and it takes forever and</li>
            <li> The titanium plates are ridiculously amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is very thick.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m goin to try, my hair is thin and curly.</li>
            <li> I like its thin design</li>
            <li> I also thought, maybe i&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> But my scary self was just too scared to turn up the heat.</li>
            <li> I wonder what went wrong there.   </li>
            <li> The plug in I want to use is under a table and difficult to get to</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IF PLACED IN THE WRONG PLACE</li>
            <li> The cord is very long and gets tangled terribly.</li>

            <li> i wanted this flat iron after using a friends and i fell in love.it makes my hair so smooth.it also takes my hair from curly to pin straight in seconds its the best ever.</li>
            <li> So I just got this in the mail today. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. As soon as i got it, I washed my hair and got to work. This is my first titanium flat iron and i noticed that the dial goes up to 50. I did not want to use too much heat so I decided to set the dial to 30 (I have natural hair and suffered heat damage before). When i got through with my hair, it was still thick and too full. Not what I expected. So in my mind, I already gave this flat iron 3 stars. I also thought, maybe i&#x27;m doing something wrong. After 30 min of playing in my hair, I decided to try this again. This time, I cranked it up to 50. BOY OH BOY what a HUGE difference. This flat iron got my hair PIN straight! Like, straight out of the salon! I am extremely happy with my purchase. I never had a flat iron that could do this to my hair before. And just to think, when I first used it I thought all reviews about this item were lies and was going to call you all out on it lol. But my scary self was just too scared to turn up the heat. I recommend this to anyone that want their natural curls to be pin straight!!!</li>
            <li> Great flat iron especially for super curly hair! This iron cuts down the time it takes to flat iron my girls&#x27; super curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have used this straightener for about 2 1/2 years now, and I LOVE it!!!  It is very slender and has a &#x27;smooth&#x27; feel when you use it; it does not break your hair like some other straighteners do (when your hair gets caught in the hinges and so forth).  When you turn it on, it only takes about 20-30 seconds to get all the way hot, and it gets HOT.  It does get hot - and I guess a little dangerous - if you touch the area outside of the plates on the end of the arms, but there&#x27;s plenty room on the handle part, so you won&#x27;t do that.  I have used the one I got 2 1/2 years ago every day since then, and it is finally starting to fade away.  I ordered this pack of two for less than the cost of buying just that one in the past - so it&#x27;s a great deal!!  One of them is the regular size and the other is just a little bit smaller (not by much).  It arrived quickly and everything is working great.  If you want a straightener that really, really works, is easy to handle, and does a great job, I definitely recommend this one!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my two sisters in law and they love this iron set, they said that is perfect and that they never have used and iron that works so good like this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad at my self, I spent a lot of money buying flat irons and this is the best !!! Why I didn&#x27;t buy it before :-( ... I can&#x27;t discribe the experience but I&#x27;m goin to try, my hair is thin and curly. It is hard to keep it straight too and it takes me like about an hour to style it but with this Magnificent iron I finish in less than 20 minutes plus It leaves me my hair shining and straigh with just one use... and I can use it to create different styles because it can do beautiful curls .... I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Perfect seller, best that i could imagine, the babyliss work great and 2 x 1 ::::))))) I will recomended 100 %</li>
            <li> My grandaughter has this exact same straightener and I got 2 for the price of what she paid for 1. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. Works great !!!</li>
            <li> shipped as promised, a great product for professional use in a salon, great price for two irons. Replaced same product that got broken by one of the other stylists because everyone wanted to borrow it!</li>
            <li> I had never used Babyliss before but decided to give it a try after reading the reviews and couldn&#x27;t be happier! I have naturally wavy hair and this straightener works great! I&#x27;ve had many different high end brands and would definitely recommend this straightener!</li>
            <li> It works great. I ordered the double-set thinking it&#x27;s too good to be true. But here they are! 2 Babyliss flat irons for only $99.95!! They&#x27;re beautiful. I like having the 2 sizes because I would rather use only the small one anyway and the small one looks easier to handle. I still have the bigger one for back up. I&#x27;m not worried about burning myself. I never saw a reason touch that part of the flat iron anyway..The iron gets so hot I only have to straighten each section 1 time (not 3 times lol) so it saves me a lot of time.  My hair comes out shiny and has body. It moves when i shake it lol. I can whip my hair with this. Despite the shape of the flat iron, it is possible to do curls with it, regular curls, spiral curls, feathers, flips, etc.   CONS:   1. The cord is very long and gets tangled terribly. I saw a review on youtube of this flat iron and it said the cord was tangle free...Mine is not the same cord as the one in the review. My cord has a seam and the one on youtube didnt. :( I wonder what went wrong there.   2. It smells very strong. Like burning. This only happens when hair is dirty. But I only flat iron my hair when it&#x27;s clean. It still stinks because of the high heat. But that is expected with a salon quality flat iron. especially since salons smell like burning when hot combs are used.</li>
            <li> I purchased the larger of the two straighteners about two years ago and paid almost $200 for it from a salon. I had it on the floor one day and I stepped on it and completely broke it. I was without a straightener for about a year and a half, and avoided buying a new one because I didn&#x27;t want to waste $200 again. Later I found it on Amazon and was so shocked that you can get the same exact one with an EXTRA one that was a tad bit smaller for around $100! I was sceptical at first, thinking it was a fake but it really is legit. It came with the exact packaging shown in the image. I definitely took advantage of this, especially since my mom, my younger sister, and me used to use the one I had a lot, and it was annoying having to wait for one person to finish using it. I&#x27;m Hispanic and I have really thick, but sleek hair, and this straightener is amazing. It really does the job in no time for me. I used to use the CHI years ago and it just totally burns your hair, making it dry and fried. I messed up my ends pretty bad, and I don&#x27;t leave the straightener on my ends for long at all. When I use the BaByliss one, it doesn&#x27;t damage it. I rarely straightener my hair now but when I use this one, it leaves my hair soft and sleek. I would definitely recommend this straightener to anyone. You can adjust the heat and you can also try curling your hair with it! Best straightener ever, I&#x27;ll be using this for many years to come and I&#x27;ll make sure I don&#x27;t carelessly leave it on the floor again (;</li>
            <li> Works great and for a great price too. Heats up fast fast and does not get any build up on the plates.</li>
            <li> Best straightener we&#x27;ve found!  My daughter&#x27;s hair would never straighten well but this is an amazing product that works so well and leaves your hair so shiny and straight.</li>
            <li> I got this like 2 years ago sooooo cheap i wanted to buy more as a gift to my cousins but now they are out of stock but when they had it, it was 50% more expensve</li>
            <li> I recommend it,  I  love it.  I  tried and tested other name brands and I personally believe that Babyliss flat iron work just as good</li>
            <li> I have been tried several brand of straightening iron but  this is the best. A set of two just allow me to have the smaller one to travel or spare. I recommend 100%!!!</li>
            <li> great product leaves hair ultra silky without the frizz.  I&#x27;ve used a chi iron for years and was put on to this product by my stylist.  I just Love, Love, Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been styling hai for 13 years and this is the best iron on the market and this is a better deal then we can get at the salon stores!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for 3-4 years now and they get our hair silky smooth and soft without burning it!</li>
            <li> Ordered the BaByliss Pro Nano Titanium 1 inch Ultra Thin Duo in Blue last week and was glad to see it waiting for me when I got home from work today.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try so I plugged it in right away and gave it a go.  This straightening iron definitely lived up to my expectations - which were pretty high.  I have medium length thick curly/frizzy hair which I can straighten with a good blow dryer but sometimes the volume is just too much and if there is any humidity, I&#x27;m doomed.  I used it on number 40 (will try on 35 next time).  The iron took about a minute (maybe less) to heat up and the titanium plates glided easily through my hair.  What used to take me about 20-25 minutes with my ghd iron, took me only 10 minutes (no hair breakage) and the results were 10x better.  Be careful as this iron gets very hot.  The ultra thin design provides for easy maneuverability and the price is AWESOME.  I saw the same exact straightening iron in red at the beauty supply store by my house for $179 - and it wasn&#x27;t even a duo!!!  Only thing more I could ask for is a bag/resting mat but at this price, I am happy to buy one separately.  Would also be helpful if it beeped when ready to use but still way better than my ghd.  FYI, the second iron is about an inch smaller than the larger one and the plates are standard size - I plan to bring that one to work for emergency use :)</li>
            <li> I bought these so my daughter and I both could have one.  They work very well and we really like them!  The slim design is very easy to handle and fits our hands well!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron set at TJ Maxx for $70. The iron works great and heats up super quick. I have thick wavy hair; the iron makes my hair smooth and shiny and stays straight all day. I like its thin design so I can do my bangs and get close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever. It straightens my hair in over half the time as any other straightener I&#x27;ve ever used! I would recommend this product to anybody that straightens their hair a lot. It also curls my hair great. LOVE,LOVE,LOVE!!!!!</li>
            <li> and i Love it! This is the best flat iron I have ever purchased. And having a travel sized that comes with it is amazing. The iron gets REALLY HOT. Like, REALLY REALLY HOT. But you can change the temp on the knobs which is also great. I recommend this product to everyone. I have very curly hair that is treated with the keratin treatment and it works out great.</li>
            <li> I received a Chi flat iron for Christmas.  It was a special from Ulta ($99)and had a pretty silver trim around the wand.  When I would curl my hair with the straightener, my hair would catch in that trim and pull it out.  When I was finished with my first curling, the want itself had many, many strands of hair stuck in it.  Therefore, I took that straightener back and got the duel voltage Chi for $99, so it was an even trade.  However when I got home, the straightener would have to be unplugged and re-plugged back in every time for it to turn on.  I tried the safety switch many times,and I tried plugging it in different outlets.  It made no difference.  The plug in I want to use is under a table and difficult to get to (I have to get on my hands and knees)....I decided to return this iron as well, but waited until after the BaByliss flat iron from Amazon arrived so I could compare the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat down at my powder table and curled one side of my hair with the Chi, and the other side with the Babyliss.  The Babyliss did not tug at my hair and the long heating elements made a huge difference while curling.  The Chi was more difficult to glide through my hair, and the shorter heating elements created problems, because my hair would ride off the end of the iron before I got to the end of my hair.  My hair is past my shoulders by about 5 or 6 inches.  I then waited to see if one iron would hold the curl better than the other.  I honestly think the Babyliss side looked better by the end of the day.  Even the next day the BaByliss side held much better than the Chi side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited until another day and straightened my hair to see if there was a difference when straitening.  Once again, the BaByliss glided through my hair more readily, and never caught my fine ends.  I could pick up wider sections of hair due to the long heating elements, and straightened that side of my hair much quicker than the Chi side. I waited until the end of the day to see if one of the sides of my hair was fuzzier, or not as shiny.  I could not tell any difference between the two sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BaByliss has an adjustable heating element that \\&quot;clicks\\&quot; to a number so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it changing while you are using the iron.  Even thought the controls are on the outside of the iron I never once have changed the heat setting, or turned the unit off accidentally.  The only thing I could see that would improve the BaByliss is an indicator that the iron is up to temperature.  It does not blink like the Chi does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would hands down order the BaByliss over the Chi if I ever need another iron.  The BaByliss has adjustable heat settings, longer heating elements, and smoother plates. I think it is easier to curl using the BaByliss and the curl last longer.  It is much quicker to straighten using the BaByliss due to the longer plates.  The people at Ulta told me they get many, many returns on Chi.  More so than any other iron.  They said now that they are mass produced, the quality has deteriorated, and they suggested the BaByliss.  Of course the Amazon price was much better, and in this instance, I got an extra BaByliss Pro for free!  I gave it to my 18 year old daughter and she loves it as well.hair was fuzzier, or not as shiny.  I could not tell any difference between the two sides.

            <li> Well, like most people, I was a little worried if the package would contain both of the straighteners... It did. Thank goodness. I can only say that this is a really good purchase. Before owning this, I had a Chi. It broke after a year and a half and my friend reccomended buying a BabyLiss like hers. I looked on the web and with this little push, i decided to invest. After I got my straightener, I can only say I am very pleased. I have naturally curly hair and it can be a hassle for some straighteners to fix. This one did it in ten minutes. Additionally, I have to say that the straighener is a better quality than the Chi because it does NOT snag your hair at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase. I received both straighteners in one box with both working as well.  I am planning to sell my other one to my friend, and I have already used mine many times.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was unhappy with my CHI flat iron.  I am so glad I bought the Babyliss and it was a great value since you basically got one free.  It has a temperature control instead of just one heat setting so you can adjust to your type of hair.  Its also a very slim iron so you don&#x27;t get those flat spots at your hair line.  I wish it had an automatic shut-off, thats my only complaint.  I would recommend this flat iron to anyone.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite flat irons!! Great especially for the price! Gets hair extremely straight. They do get very very hot! But my clients are always satisfied</li>
            <li> These are the best irons I&#x27;ve used thus far.  I have pretty course hair with no perm and these irons can get it bone straight.  They are awesome for curls as well.  Having the temp control is wonderful, and I do not need a curler iron as these are great for whatever style I want.  I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my last babyliss (same model) and was delighted to get two for the price of one.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Item was arrived before I expected, was very good!!! 100% recommended!!!\\&quot;, Always buy with this great and excellent company very liable!!!!!,</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my aunt and cousin after straightening their hair with my own BabyBlissPro! They absolutely fell in love, and its a great deal 2 for price of 1! 100% recommended!</li>
            <li> I believe that the baby bliss iron is a miracle ,my daughters hair is pin straight and even when she wases it it stays straight ,its the weirdest thing ive ever seen,, we love it! we do use the straight sexy hair smooth and protect spray to protect from the heat.. Best product ever!! Thank You</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it sure leaves your hair silky n shiny, n your done so much faster then blow drying your hair.</li>
            <li> All I can say is - I LOVE this product!  I read many, many reviews before purchasing the Babyliss flat iron. In fact, I got it because it is the flat iron my hairdresser uses and I love the way my hair looks and feels after I leave her. My hair has a medium amount of natural wave and this flat Iron takes it out. And it stays straight for days (unless I run threw the rain). Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and this is the best flat iron ever! It&#x27;s an awesome deal and you will be pleased!</li>
            <li> wish i could give it 6 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me begin by saying this is the 4th iron i have purchased on amazon and the only one i did not return!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive used so many irons.... im the flat iron queen!&lt;br /&gt;Did some research after my last iron died... i didnt settle. I kept researching and wanted to see what negatives this iron brought, because the other ones i bought on amazon were not real. they were bootlegs!!!.... so i thought &#x27;ONE MORE RISK&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I called Conair (babyliss makers) This seller was a verified one by them so I decided to order!&lt;br /&gt;i kept waiting for the negative specs to pop up and that i would have something to say that i didnt like about it, um... I didnt find much.lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it a few times - First of all, it heats up super fast (BUY A HEAT MAP BECAUSE IF PLACED IN THE WRONG PLACE IT WILL BURN IT OR MELT IT THROUGH ANYTHING!!!) The titanium plates are ridiculously amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt pull your hair, it leaves it super glossy and flexible - mind you, i have extremely long hair and it is very thick. Other irons i have to use very thin layers of my hair and it takes forever and in the end, the straight look is ok... but still kind&#x27;ve coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I feel like a hawaiian. straight gorgeous flexible glossy looking AND feeling hair!!!!  ive already had so many compliments. Ppl asked me if I did some treatment to my hair...lol No. it&#x27;s the IRON!!!! ALL PROPS TO THE IRON!!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.&lt;br /&gt;you will not regret this.&lt;br /&gt;worst case - u can send it back and get your money refunded. BUT YOU WONT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND YOU GET TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE?? It&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only regret - i didnt buy this sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have TWO. Will give one to my sister for christmas &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great iron. I&#x27;ve only used the smaller of the two irons but it&#x27;s nice to have the larger one as a back up in the event something happens to the little one. I use it on a medium heat setting and it does great. No need to go super hot. Heat stays constant and the size makes it incredibly light weight. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Use this every day and have has it for a while now. Stays hot and keeps my hair smooth and shiny looking.</li>
