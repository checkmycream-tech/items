    <ol>
            <li>I have always thought that Gillette makes the best shaving products and this face scrub just reaffirms that.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Great surprise!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this in stores and I am happy Amazon comes through again!</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>This stuff is just the best, and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere; perhaps it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li>This face scrub is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>If you want a pre scrub this one is the best</li>
            <li>that also smells great.  </li>
            <li>Works great for me, 3 pack offsets shipping charge.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>Great product, makes shaving very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I like the warm feel it gives my face as I shave.</li>
            <li>The warming (thermal) agent feels nice.  </li>
            <li>Does a really good job of preparing for a close comfortable shave</li>
            <li>You do get a much closer, smoother shave, and it feels great.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased to recommend this company.</li>
            <li>It feels good on your face because it warms when you rub it on your beard, and it really does help get a closer shave.</li>
            <li>Great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin soft and easy shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some days it will be available and then it will just disappear for months at a time.  </li>
            <li>this product isn&#x27;t covered by Amazon Prime&#x27;s 2 day free shipping guarantee.</li>
            <li>Great product that helps you get that extra close shave!</li>
            <li>It cleans your face and then your shave is twice as smooth and close, I have found.  </li>
            <li>I use it just before shaving, and after shaving my skin is super smooth.  </li>
            <li>Shaving can be a real chore, as most men know.</li>
            <li>On days when I need to shave, but don&#x27;t have time to shower, this quickly and efficiently softens my beard to make shaving a breeze.</li>
            <li>I ordered it, expecting a quick delivery since I am an Amazon Prime customer.</li>
            <li>Amazingly high tech face scrub (once you squeeze it out of the tube and rub it on your face, it actually heats up and gives you a warm face scrub!)</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast and efficient-</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Put this on and then add your shaving cream and your face warms up just like the barbers shops that had the hot saving cream machine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mark of my like of it, that I just ordered six tubes and will order more next time I get paid.</li>
            <li>I love this product only face wash</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does and does it fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a superior facial scrub because it does not leave my skin feeling dry after using it.</li>
            <li>and it really lifts your stubble</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does allow you to get a much closer shave as the warming from the product really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>Everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>I have tried other scrubs, but this is always the better one.</li>
            <li>So when Gillette came out with this face scrub I had to try it, on the off chance that it might make the task a little better.</li>
            <li>Need an old time barber shop shave, this is the item for you!</li>
            <li>I love this Gillette product and have found it somewhat difficult to find locally, so I was glad to see it advertised on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great product that is difficult to find in local stores.</li>
            <li>Prices are coming down and I&#x27;d check your local market for possible better price if home delivery is not necessary.</li>

            <li> Great product, makes shaving very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Does what it says softens up the hair so shaving is a little easier.  Use it on my head before I shave that too.</li>
            <li> Great surprise!  Does exactly what it says it does. You do get a much closer, smoother shave, and it feels great. I was skeptical at first but I&#x27;m now a believer.</li>
            <li> Great product that is difficult to find in local stores. Some days it will be available and then it will just disappear for months at a time.

            <li> my boyfrient loves it.</li>

            <li> I love this Gillette product and have found it somewhat difficult to find locally, so I was glad to see it advertised on Amazon. I ordered it, expecting a quick delivery since I am an Amazon Prime customer. It turns out (and it DOES say this when you&#x27;re purchasing) this product isn&#x27;t covered by Amazon Prime&#x27;s 2 day free shipping guarantee. But when I made just a mildly negative comment on my Amazon review--noting that delivery may take a week or two--the company was on the phone to me within 24 hours expressing concern I was dissatisfied, noting (correctly) the product is not advertised as deliverable within 48 hours, and asking if there was anything they could do to improve our relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was frankly shocked, albeit pleasantly, that they were so concerned about my minor annoyance! Bottom line: We worked matters out and I&#x27;m pleased to recommend this company.</li>
            <li> Great product that helps you get that extra close shave! Would highly recommend this product to anyone! If you want a closer shave then this is the product for you!</li>

When this product first came out, it was very expensive.  Prices are coming down and I&#x27;d check your local market for possible better price if home delivery is not necessary.</li>
            <li> Amazingly high tech face scrub (once you squeeze it out of the tube and rub it on your face, it actually heats up and gives you a warm face scrub!) that also smells great.  If this were sold by anyone other than Gillette, it would cost $20 a tube.  A bargain for what you get.</li>
            <li> I have sistic acne as nd it on my back chest and neck and iv never in 15 years found a product that helps it and also lets me see a difference!</li>
            <li> Works great for me, 3 pack offsets shipping charge.</li>
            <li> This pre-shave face scrub is actually heated!  It cleans your face and then your shave is twice as smooth and close, I have found.  I think the MFG has discontinued the product, but I got a supply from Amazon!  They came through again!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. It&#x27;s a superior facial scrub because it does not leave my skin feeling dry after using it. I am now a dedicated user because it works 4 me. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin soft and easy shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Clean and does not irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this Gillette&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> I love this product only face wash I use</li>
            <li> Will buy again. Everything I expected and more. Very fast and efficient- Always a pleasure doing business with you. Great</li>
            <li> If you want a pre scrub this one is the best</li>
            <li> Does a really good job of preparing for a close comfortable shave</li>
