            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried others but this is the best</li>
            <li>brown eyeliner is a wonderful, neutral brown.</li>
            <li>This works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>This is the best cake eyeliner on the market.  </li>
            <li>Product is good, my eyesight is not!</li>
            <li>me, the brush works great, but I&#x27;ve worked in fashion</li>
            <li>The liner is great.  </li>
            <li>My wife ordered this and says it is great.  </li>
            <li>What a great product AND a bargain price!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>this product is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>This is a good one.</li>
            <li>Good quality product.</li>
            <li>this brand is as good as Maybelline ever was.</li>
            <li>Love the product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to find this product again!  </li>
            <li>The color is a beautiful rich brown.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have used and loved this eyeliner for many years and love it.</li>
            <li>I use my own liner brush, which gives me the precise line I like!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better then liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>THIS ONE DOES BETTER THAN MOST I HAVE TRIED.</li>
            <li>I love it, and yes I would recommend it to anyone in the market for cake eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS..</li>
            <li>Better used as shadow on lids.</li>
            <li>For your day time makeup, I recommend using a thinner tipped brush for a thinner line, but at nighttime, use the brush that comes with eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can smudge the liner while still damp for a more smoky eye</li>
            <li>PRETTY GOOD</li>
            <li>This product has a tiny brush with excellent bristles allowing smooth application.  </li>
            <li>I like the control this product gives, whether you want a light application or more of a smokey eye.  </li>
            <li>It stays and doesn&#x27;t smudge, but comes off with eye make up remover easily.</li>
            <li>SO IT SMEARS EASILY, BUT</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>eyeliner goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Brown color which is a dark brown and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I had n works together fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find a good cake eyeliner, so I was happy to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but then it wouldn&#x27;t fit in the case.  </li>
            <li>This is a product I thought would never be available.  </li>
            <li>The product absorbs a lot of water, so you have to add more than you think, but once you get it to the right consistency, it goes on smoothly and stays well.</li>
            <li>It is a true pressed cake liner, not a powder or cream.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a true statement or not.  </li>
            <li>So happy not to have to use eyeshadow any more which is hard to mix with water.  </li>
            <li>just right for daytime wear, especially if you have fair</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and makes a much thinner line than pencils do..</li>
            <li>I use this eyeliner daily and love it!</li>
            <li>It also stays fresh longer than pencil liners (IMO).</li>
            <li>Stays fresh looking.</li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s a good little brush that doesn&#x27;t splay or develop a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it and will order more, but not for quite a while since it will last a LONG time.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are sensitive to most makeup, and I can barely wear mascara.</li>
            <li>Brown is good; natural and dark, but not glaringly so.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it comes with its own little compact brush, but I wish the brush handle was expandable, which would make it easier to use.</li>
            <li>Cake mascara is hard to find nowadays, so I was delighted to find this.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>So, eyeliner is a must unless I want to look far older than I need to... and far less attractive, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also own this product in black, and like it just as well for when I&#x27;m wearing more eye makeup or want a more dramatic use.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Fran Wilson.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS CAKE EYELINER.</li>
            <li>I HAVE TOO MUCH OIL</li>
            <li>cake dries really fast.</li>
            <li>Does last long time, but I think the kind of brush u use could have bearing on how it goes on.</li>
            <li>Love cake eyeliner, thought I ordered black, but it was brown.(My mistake)</li>
            <li>I use a 000 artist&#x27;s brush and a steady hand.</li>
            <li>Given that I&#x27;m 60 years old, I find the product harder to apply than when I was in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s because I wear glasses now and not having them on to apply eyeliner, is now more of a challenge.</li>
            <li>It is a little darker than I wanted but is OK.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a hurry, this cake liner is a little more forgiving.  </li>
            <li>The brush that comes with the product  gives you a thicker line and is good, but the brush is short and a bit hard to hold on to.</li>
            <li>I can control how dark it is by using more or less water, and I can remove any excess easily (while it&#x27;s still wet) with a cotton swab or a stroke of the application brush (rinsed in water, first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professionally trained make-up artist</li>
            <li>Liquid liners tend to be harsh and you need a steady hand to get it right.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a small brush which makes a fine line, which I like.  </li>
            <li>I can do a small line which is important to me.</li>
            <li>For everyday wear, this brown is exactly what I wanted.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this product&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried others but this is the best</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive to most makeup, and I can barely wear mascara. So, eyeliner is a must unless I want to look far older than I need to... and far less attractive, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brown eyeliner is a wonderful, neutral brown. It&#x27;s not too red and not too blue... just right for daytime wear, especially if you have fair skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no irritation from it. I can control how dark it is by using more or less water, and I can remove any excess easily (while it&#x27;s still wet) with a cotton swab or a stroke of the application brush (rinsed in water, first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the brush works great, but I&#x27;ve worked in fashion so I&#x27;m used to applying eyeliner. That may make a difference, but I don&#x27;t think so. Really, it&#x27;s a good little brush that doesn&#x27;t splay or develop a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also own this product in black, and like it just as well for when I&#x27;m wearing more eye makeup or want a more dramatic use. For everyday wear, this brown is exactly what I wanted. It stays on all day, and rinses off with ease, with plain water. (I have no idea how they&#x27;ve achieved that, but I&#x27;m grateful.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better then liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The liner is great.  I had a little trouble learning to use the brush.  It is so short that I needed to learn how to hold it to put the eyeliner on.  I can do a small line which is important to me.</li>
            <li> Cake eyeliner is hard to find in a market dominated by pencils and gel markers. For me, nothing works as well as cake for a controlled, even line that doesn&#x27;t smudge, flake or peel. I&#x27;m a contact lens wearer so I have to be careful with what products I put around my eyes. This is a good one. It also travels well. I like the fact that it comes with its own little compact brush, but I wish the brush handle was expandable, which would make it easier to use. The product absorbs a lot of water, so you have to add more than you think, but once you get it to the right consistency, it goes on smoothly and stays well.</li>
            <li> I use this eyeliner daily and love it! It stays and doesn&#x27;t smudge, but comes off with eye make up remover easily. I use my own liner brush, which gives me the precise line I like! This is going to last forever!!</li>
            <li> Hard to find cake eyeliner in the stores.  This works perfectly.  It is a little darker than I wanted but is OK.  Good quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to the type of eyeliner I used as a model...a long time ago. Thanks to Fran Wilson.</li>
            <li> Have used and loved this eyeliner for many years and love it. I use a 000 artist&#x27;s brush and a steady hand. Brown is good; natural and dark, but not glaringly so. A cake lasts over a year, too!</li>
            <li> Love the product!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Given that I&#x27;m 60 years old, I find the product harder to apply than when I was in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s because I wear glasses now and not having them on to apply eyeliner, is now more of a challenge. Product is good, my eyesight is not!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professionally trained make-up artist and I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products.  I&#x27;m so glad to find this product again!  I like the control this product gives, whether you want a light application or more of a smokey eye.  Liquid liners tend to be harsh and you need a steady hand to get it right.  If you&#x27;re in a hurry, this cake liner is a little more forgiving.  It also stays fresh longer than pencil liners (IMO).</li>
            <li> I Finally found a cake eyeliner.  I used one for years...Shaklee Brand...then couldn&#x27;t find any for years.  Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this product. It lasts FOREVER!  It goes on easily and makes a much thinner line than pencils do..if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this and says it is great.  &amp;#34;It&#x27;s very similar to a cake eyeliner I used decades ago and cannot find anymore.  It is a true pressed cake liner, not a powder or cream.  It comes with a small brush which makes a fine line, which I like.  I would prefer a longer handle on the brush so it would be easier to manipulate but then it wouldn&#x27;t fit in the case.  The brown color is a dark brown -- sort of brown/black -- not a reddish brown or taupe.  This eyeliner does not flake or run and stays put all day.  I&#x27;m glad I found it and will order more, but not for quite a while since it will last a LONG time.  What a great product AND a bargain price!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Like the color but it does not stay on like laura mercier cake liner does.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS CAKE EYELINER. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE ORDERED IT.CAKE EYELINER IS HARD TO FIND AT THIS PRICE AND IN BROWN. I DO NOT USE THE EYELINER BRUSH THAT COMES WITH IT I ORDERED A LITTLE NICER BRUSH. THIS EYELINER STAYS ON YOUR EYES PRETTY GOOD AND DOES NOT SMEAR. HARD FOR ME TO KEEP EYELINER ON I HAVE TOO MUCH OIL IN MY EYELIDS SO IT SMEARS EASILY, BUT THIS ONE DOES BETTER THAN MOST I HAVE TRIED.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a cake liner. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> this product is great. I love it, and yes I would recommend it to anyone in the market for cake eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Always used to use cake eyeliner, then it disappeared!  So happy not to have to use eyeshadow any more which is hard to mix with water.  this brand is as good as Maybelline ever was.</li>
            <li> This is a product I thought would never be available.  Halleluja! I am so tired of liners that are waxed based and difficult to use.  This product has a tiny brush with excellent bristles allowing smooth application.  The eyeliner seems water proof too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  This is the best cake eyeliner on the market.  It goes on easily and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS..so much easier than the expensive  products I have used in the past!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a good cake eyeliner, so I was happy to find this on Amazon.  The package says it&#x27;s waterproof, but I haven&#x27;t gone swimming with it on so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a true statement or not.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the gel or liquid eyeliners as I find they are difficult to control and tend to dry out quickly.  This eyeliner can be used wet or dry. I prefer to use it wet. I dampen my eyeliner brush and mix it on the cake.  The case comes with a small brush, but I have one that I&#x27;ve used for years.  There is no mirror in the case, but for me that isn&#x27;t a big deal.  I ordered the Brown color which is a dark brown and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> cake dries really fast. Better used as shadow on lids. Flakey but mixed with another cake liner I had n works together fine. Does last long time, but I think the kind of brush u use could have bearing on how it goes on.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I wanted. The color is a beautiful rich brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner goes on easily. The brush that comes with the product  gives you a thicker line and is good, but the brush is short and a bit hard to hold on to. But the brush works well. I use a longer handled thinner tipped brush sometimes too. For your day time makeup, I recommend using a thinner tipped brush for a thinner line, but at nighttime, use the brush that comes with eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can smudge the liner while still damp for a more smoky eye look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Cake mascara is hard to find nowadays, so I was delighted to find this. I like the control over the density of the line. The brush is too small to use with ease.</li>
            <li> Love cake eyeliner, thought I ordered black, but it was brown.(My mistake) The color was still great!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and last all day. Does not look cracked or cake during the day. Stays fresh looking.</li>
