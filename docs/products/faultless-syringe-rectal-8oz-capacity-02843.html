            <li>This is good for emergencies!</li>
            <li>Came in great time.</li>
            <li>Good product as a great price.</li>
            <li>Good, but pipe tends to come out of bulb during use.</li>
            <li>This product is superior to others; greater capacity, and quite durable.</li>
            <li>Good volume, easy to use.</li>
            <li>great for quick coffee enemas.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is ok.</li>
            <li>Unlike open-top enema bags or buckets, there is no way to fill it from the top...</li>
            <li>Just make sure you maintain pressure whilst removing it.</li>
            <li>I think this product would be better if the nipple and bulb had some course threads and screwed into the bulb.</li>
            <li>I like it better this.n the the bottle type.  </li>
            <li>These items aren&#x27;t available in most stores, so I was pleased to be able to purchase them through amazon.</li>
            <li>easy to insert, use, and pull out.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Filling the syringe is easy.  </li>
            <li>so it is easy to store.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for!!</li>
            <li>This thing is so useful and works like a charm!</li>
            <li>You probably aren&#x27;t super excited when you have to get one of these.  </li>
            <li>Even better it is delivered to your door rather than having some attendant at the store trying to figure out why you got one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it regularly for five years and it&#x27;s still in good condition.</li>
            <li>the bulb is quite large, and the nozzle is smooth.</li>
            <li>though, a fine product, and far more comfortable to use than many other anal douches out there.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s a pain in the butt (wink)</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised-easy to use.</li>
            <li>Overall, nothing to write home (or a huge review) about.</li>
            <li>Fast turn-around.</li>
            <li>I actually own several of these for various uses.</li>
            <li>I realize you want a secure seal in order to prevent fluid leakage; however, at the same time, I would think that removing the nozzle every time you use it would quickly wear out that part of the bulb.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, you&#x27;ll want to clean both the bulb and tip thoroughly inside and out after each use.</li>
            <li>Use the same method to clean the bulb.</li>
            <li>Not awful, but could use a few improvements.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at the high reviews.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be exactly like the last one I had.</li>
            <li>It is made to  be easy to hold without feeling clumsy.</li>
            <li>With that said it would seat far enough into the bulb where it would hold under pressure.</li>
            <li>In those cases, you would normally make a specific amount only..</li>
            <li>But an extra safety guard against contamination and the problems it can bring would mean a better overall experience, especially for the less-than-diligent user.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only type which yields enough pressure to clear restrictions.</li>
            <li>the thing I like most about this product is that there isn&#x27;t any water trapped inside after uses and I don&#x27;t have to worry about mold, which apparently was an issue for other consumers with other models and brands</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Sharp&amp;#34; takes on a whole new meaning and level of importance when talking about one&#x27;s delicate internal bits.</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re just using water, I suppose it&#x27;s relatively easy to turn it upside down in a bowl, squeeze all the air out and then release it so it sucks water up into it.  </li>
            <li> flat and insert nozzle in a cup of water.</li>
            <li> and I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit difficult to fit the 2 pieces together.</li>
            <li> Both things seem smaller that I expected, but I will keep them and use them.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your interest and taking the time to check on</li>
            <li> the device has to be turned upside down , air squeezed out to make a vacuum, and inserted into a container of the fluid that you want to infuse.</li>
            <li> even if you had a tiny little funnel.  </li>
            <li> I managed to jam it in there, but it doesn&#x27;t quite go in all the way.. kind of annoying..</li>
            <li> Other reviews mentioned that the end is hard to place, and that is true, but even worse, it won&#x27;t stay in.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> /&gt;Had to knock off one star due to the design of the nipple and the way it is inserted into the bulb.</li>
            <li> This one is almost the same, except that the hole in the bulb where you insert the nozzle thingy seems to be too small.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the tip is not threaded for ease of use.</li>
            <li> Its hard to get the nozzle in.  </li>
            <li> Second, filling the bulb is inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the detachable nozzle is rather difficult to attach to the bulb, and might be quite frustrating if you don&#x27;t do it ahead of time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This thing is so useful and works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Came in great time. The product&#x27;s wall seems thinner than prior purchases of the same. Hope it lasts a year or two. Otherwise it is ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at the high reviews.  First, it&#x27;s a pain in the butt (wink) putting in the nozzle every time you use it.  I realize you want a secure seal in order to prevent fluid leakage; however, at the same time, I would think that removing the nozzle every time you use it would quickly wear out that part of the bulb.  Second, filling the bulb is inconvenient.  Unlike open-top enema bags or buckets, there is no way to fill it from the top... even if you had a tiny little funnel.  The hole is slightly larger than 1/4\\&quot;.  If you&#x27;re just using water, I suppose it&#x27;s relatively easy to turn it upside down in a bowl, squeeze all the air out and then release it so it sucks water up into it.  But what if you&#x27;re doing a cleansing enema with baking soda or a retention enema with coffee?  In those cases, you would normally make a specific amount only.. The only advantage I see is if you wanted something discreet to travel with, because it looks like it could be a nasal irrigator or a mucus remover for babies.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this product at all.</li>
            <li> I use these for flushing drain lines on refrigerators.  It&#x27;s the only type which yields enough pressure to clear restrictions. My only complaint is that the tip is not threaded for ease of use. These items aren&#x27;t available in most stores, so I was pleased to be able to purchase them through amazon.</li>
            <li> Good volume, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good product as a great price.</li>
            <li> Good, but pipe tends to come out of bulb during use.</li>
            <li> I actually own several of these for various uses. They are well made and durable and can be thoroughly cleaned. Besides the manufacturers designation as a medical device, they work well to fill lead/acid batteries, water cut flowers and smaller plants and move fluids from one container to another.</li>
            <li> It is what it is. Overall, nothing to write home (or a huge review) about. Not awful, but could use a few improvements. As noted by other reviewers, ensuring that any seams or sharp edges remaining on the insertable tip from the manufacturing process get polished away would be first on that list. &amp;#34;Sharp&amp;#34; takes on a whole new meaning and level of importance when talking about one&#x27;s delicate internal bits. And a mechanism to prevent backwards flow would be another wish list improvement. Obviously, you&#x27;ll want to clean both the bulb and tip thoroughly inside and out after each use. But an extra safety guard against contamination and the problems it can bring would mean a better overall experience, especially for the less-than-diligent user.</li>
            <li> You probably aren&#x27;t super excited when you have to get one of these.  I guess what I can say is it works.  Even better it is delivered to your door rather than having some attendant at the store trying to figure out why you got one.</li>
            <li> Other reviews mentioned that the end is hard to place, and that is true, but even worse, it won&#x27;t stay in.</li>
            <li> This is good for emergencies! great for quick coffee enemas. Its hard to get the nozzle in.  Lube it well.&lt;br /&gt;VIDEO&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> This product is superior to others; greater capacity, and quite durable. I&#x27;ve used it regularly for five years and it&#x27;s still in good condition.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised-easy to use.</li>
            <li> the bulb is quite large, and the nozzle is smooth. easy to insert, use, and pull out. My only complaint is that the detachable nozzle is rather difficult to attach to the bulb, and might be quite frustrating if you don&#x27;t do it ahead of time. Other than that though, a fine product, and far more comfortable to use than many other anal douches out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an enema syringe, what can I say. We bought this because we are into alternative things. It does its job of cleaning your &amp;#34;backyard&amp;#34; quite well. We do wish it had a one way valve though. Just make sure you maintain pressure whilst removing it.</li>
            <li> Both things seem smaller that I expected, but I will keep them and use them.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your interest and taking the time to check on me!&lt;br /&gt;Carol Z.</li>
            <li> Timely service and it works.</li>
            <li> The nozzle does not stay in place.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Fast turn-around.</li>
            <li> the thing I like most about this product is that there isn&#x27;t any water trapped inside after uses and I don&#x27;t have to worry about mold, which apparently was an issue for other consumers with other models and brands</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use. Filling the syringe is easy.  Squeeze the bulb flat and insert nozzle in a cup of water. Use a disposable cup.Release flatten bulb and the bulb fills with water. Use the same method to clean the bulb. It is just two pieces so it is easy to store.It seems to be well made and I think it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Well what can I say, its a rectal syringe. Works well and gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to knock off one star due to the design of the nipple and the way it is inserted into the bulb. I think this product would be better if the nipple and bulb had some course threads and screwed into the bulb. I tried several times to get the nipple to fully seat into the bulb but was unsuccessful. With that said it would seat far enough into the bulb where it would hold under pressure.</li>
            <li> Bought it from my girl. Does the trick</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for!!</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be exactly like the last one I had. Sadly I left that one under the bathroom sink at an airbnb. This one is almost the same, except that the hole in the bulb where you insert the nozzle thingy seems to be too small. I managed to jam it in there, but it doesn&#x27;t quite go in all the way.. kind of annoying..</li>
            <li> Durable and reliable! Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> What can I say about a syringe?  It does what it is made to do and does it well.  It is made to  be easy to hold without feeling clumsy.I like it better this.n the the bottle type.  And it is not red!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit difficult to fit the 2 pieces together. the device has to be turned upside down , air squeezed out to make a vacuum, and inserted into a container of the fluid that you want to infuse. the tube is pointy and can hurt.  all the same, it works.  no latex.</li>
