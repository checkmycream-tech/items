            <li>Love the light powdery scent</li>
            <li>This rating is due to the combination of the wonderful fragrance and the generous size.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>a bit light need</li>
            <li>is still available.  </li>
            <li>Sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>but I was not as pleased as I normally am with ET products - I&#x27;m still a loyal fan though.</li>
            <li>Depending on who you get, they can be very sarcastic,  and the ones I dealt with yesterday weren&#x27;t very knowledgeable on the return of hazardous items.</li>
            <li>Although the cost was great and this fragrance is ok but seems to be a bit weak compared to Ellen Tracey that i&#x27;ve bought before.</li>
            <li>and was at my house right on time.</li>
            <li>everything came as expected and I was very pleased with the price.</li>
            <li>Gel and body lotion smell absolutely divine!</li>
            <li>and she really likes it!</li>
            <li>Great product and great price!Better then other expensive purfume.</li>
            <li>the large bottle cost me $70.00</li>
            <li>This was a pure rip off.</li>
            <li>but this 3 piece gift set isn&#x27;t the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely will buy it again when it will be done.</li>
            <li>However, the scent was too much for her allergies.</li>
            <li>A real value for the money.</li>
            <li>and just one squirt lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Have been wearing for 15+ years so ordering as much as I can now.</li>
            <li>I have a very large perfume collection and thought It would not be complete without The signature Ellen Tracy.</li>
            <li>It smells fine, lasts long..</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on this perfume than any other I use--love it!!</li>
            <li>I have now a new set .</li>
            <li>The 1st time I used little of the perfume, thinking it might be too strong,</li>
            <li>The gift set was old and the box reflected it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too flowery and doesn&#x27;t make me smell like one of the old Auntie types.</li>
            <li>Lasting smell after much wash.</li>
            <li>You could barely smell the fragrance, that is why the price was so in creditably low  $18.77.  </li>
            <li>Not 2 harsh, just a sweet subtle smells that lets my coworkers know I hv arrived!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve brought this perfume Ellen Tracy for my wife it wasn&#x27;t the gift set, just the perfume from Macy the large bottle cost me $70.00 and my wife loved it but this 3 piece gift set isn&#x27;t the real thing.  The gift set was old and the box reflected it.  You could barely smell the fragrance, that is why the price was so in creditably low  $18.77.  Imitation fragrance, its a Knockoff.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price!Better then other expensive purfume.I absolutely will buy it again when it will be done.Love it.</li>
            <li> I love perfume not toilette.  Perfume scent last longer. This is all of that and more. I get so many compliments from mostly men and ladies too. The price is great. I recommend this scent and this gift set. The bottle is 3.4 oz. Its the big one. It&#x27;s a clean and refreshing scent. Buy, Buy, Buy....</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my mother, she loved the smell of all three products. However, the scent was too much for her allergies. I tried to return it, and it not a returnable item. Amazon did however, refund my money back within 1-2 business days. I would rate the customer service zero! Depending on who you get, they can be very sarcastic,  and the ones I dealt with yesterday weren&#x27;t very knowledgeable on the return of hazardous items. I took three different reps, for me to get a answer. I finally looked it up in the help section, which took me all of two mins. They finally came back to the call, after leaving me on hold for mins and told me the same info, I looked up in two mins. I was very frustrated with them at that point. But, I got my refund and will be purchasing my mom some slipper socks and I just purchased her a smaller version of a perfume she already has.</li>
            <li> everything came as expected and I was very pleased with the price.</li>
            <li> smells awesome and the sent lasts for a long time i swear i bought it for my mom and when she puts it on it lasts even after hours i can still smell it on her! nice fragrance</li>
            <li> I have a very large perfume collection and thought It would not be complete without The signature Ellen Tracy.</li>
            <li> I knew I loved the fragrance itself having bought it once before.  This rating is due to the combination of the wonderful fragrance and the generous size.  A real value for the money.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  I couldn&#x27;t have received better service.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This perfume fragrance does not last for 2 hours. I used  gel, lotion and perfume. The 1st time I used little of the perfume, thinking it might be too strong, but, the fragrance was did not last long. The lotion was very thin not rich or creamy. I used the spray(demo) at Macy it smelled faintly like the one I have and just one squirt lasted much longer. I don&#x27;t know if it was just old or watered down. I would have returned it but I threw away the box it came in. This was a waste of my money. It was deeply discounted, they say you pay for what you get. I think I paid more than what I got. This was a pure rip off.</li>
            <li> Love the light powdery scent</li>
            <li> Size of products was nicer than I expected..love this perfume..Gel and body lotion smell absolutely divine! Was pleasantly surprised by the size..again, great price and great seller to boot!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my moms and she really likes it!</li>
            <li> I truly enjoyed my purchase.</li>
            <li> It smells fine, lasts long..it s perfect!I love it!the price is good..it s a perfect gift!just try and you will not be disappointed/</li>
            <li> Like the Ellen Tracy fragrance.</li>
            <li> I adore this perfume , I finished a set of the shower gel , perfume and the body lotion  which I bought years ago. But I was hesitant in throwing the bottle . I have now a new set . It is from my point of view the best fragrance I ever bought.</li>
            <li> Have used this fragrance before and liked it Got a gift card and used it for this purchase. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on this perfume than any other I use--love it!!</li>
            <li> It smell very weak, almost like it&#x27;s been sitting on the shelf for awhile. Won&#x27;t purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Great price. Delivery was quick. Thanks</li>
            <li> I was given this perfume as a gift 10 years ago and have been using it exclusively since then. Perfume has a tendency to get spicy on me after about 30 minutes and this does not. It&#x27;s not too flowery and doesn&#x27;t make me smell like one of the old Auntie types. I get waiters and men asking all the time what I am wearing. The fact that I can layer with the body wash and body lotion with this set is wonderful. Also, it doesn&#x27;t make you &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; woman with the perfume cloud even if you use all 3 products.</li>
            <li> a bit light need ti be more concentrated</li>
            <li> Ellen Tracy is my signature perfume its what I use everyday and people know it me when they smell it</li>
            <li> My Mom&#x27;s favorite fragrance in the world! She loved it and it was the highlight of the Christmas Season for her (2014). The shipping was immediate and flawless.</li>
            <li> Very sad that this scent has been discontinued.  Have been wearing for 15+ years so ordering as much as I can now. Have a wide variety of products for this. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Men love this perfume</li>
            <li> Price is amazing! I get compliments everywhere I go! Not 2 harsh, just a sweet subtle smells that lets my coworkers know I hv arrived! My husband loves it!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I almost bought it at a perfume outlet store for $ 70.00. I paid $24.99.What a deal !!!</li>
            <li> Great price for the set - but I was not as pleased as I normally am with ET products - I&#x27;m still a loyal fan though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this B 4 love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this is, but it&#x27;s not Ellen Tracy. It smells like the worst &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; perfume you&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> A wonderful fragrance that is light. It is nice that there is a product available that provides layering of fragrance.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite. Lasting smell after much wash. Sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Although the cost was great and this fragrance is ok but seems to be a bit weak compared to Ellen Tracey that i&#x27;ve bought before.</li>
            <li> it was a great gift for my mom. and was at my house right on time. it was verry well wrapped.</li>
            <li> I found Ellen Tracy years ago, and have noticed she makes different perfumes.  Was so happy to find Ellen Tracy, by Ellen Tracy is still available.  The perfume is wonderful</li>
            <li> Love it the smell is amazing</li>
            <li> Very nice Christmas Gift</li>
            <li> It was a gift &amp; my friend loved it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. It has a great smell and I&#x27;m always having people asking me what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing because they love it. I have bought this gift set more than once, not just for myself but for others as well. I recommend giving this fragrance a try ladies :).</li>
