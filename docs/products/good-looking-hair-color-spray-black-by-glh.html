            <li> If you&#x27;re a single male and want to remain that way then by all means use it.  </li>
            <li> The hair spray coloring dose a great job covering up thin to very thin hair.</li>
            <li> overall, i like it, it doesnt come off with sweat, you can actually swim with it without worrying if its running down your face</li>
            <li> Makes a bit of a dmess in the bathroom though and for women makes hair alittle dry and tacky when applied.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry and will wipe off if you slightly rub where you color</li>
            <li> so i can only comment on the black  </li>
            <li> but when I tried using this on a little bald spot, it looked like regular spray paint.  </li>
            <li> the stone has natural energy to attract all negative energy around you, that why, its color change or break  and damages appear inside it.</li>
            <li> The hair was sticky, stiff and messy., and it did not feel natural at all.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO A COMMON PROBLEM WITH OUT A LOT OF WORK.....</li>
            <li> The mess this junk in a can causes is extreme.</li>
            <li> Find other means!</li>
            <li> i use the black can</li>
            <li> Im a young male that suffers from heriditary hair loss</li>
            <li> if you dont have hair itll basically look like youve got black hair spray on your head</li>
            <li> A waste of my $30.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that suffers from hair loss.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t convince me that it isn&#x27;t harmful to your health to have a sickening sweet selling fiber traveling throughout the air and leaving a black sludge like residue on literally every item you use in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It locks the color into your hair and stops the mess! !!</li>
            <li> ( they do not know my secret).</li>
            <li> Here is a secret to stop this from getting on clothes and pillows and rubbing off.</li>
            <li> its not the bad value of the product, but its the nature of crystal of all types.</li>

            <li> I regretted buying this product. A waste of my $30. I used it twice, but did not want to use it again. The hair was sticky, stiff and messy., and it did not feel natural at all.</li>
            <li> The hair spray coloring dose a great job covering up thin to very thin hair. It does not dry and will wipe off if you slightly rub where you color so don&#x27;t let your friends put there fingers through your hair if you use this color spray. I use it after each shower before going out. Mr. Pete</li>
            <li> great product; exactly as described!!!!</li>
            <li> this is the best product for thinning hair period! for the price it is a MUST have!! i cannot tell you how many people compliment my hair daily, and say how thick my hair is. ( they do not know my secret). if u have hair but are thinning in some spots you HAVE To try this. i use the black can so i can only comment on the black  but it has changed my appearance 100 percent.</li>
            <li> This product is so awesome. Im more confident now than I have been in months. Im a young male that suffers from heriditary hair loss and I must say I can now do things that I use to.  Im so thankful for this product and I will continue to order more.  I highly recommend this product to anyone that suffers from hair loss.</li>
            <li> I like the way it blends in with my own hair. My hair setting lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;don;t know what a headline is</li>
            <li> The hair spray was great. It holds good and last a long time. The color matches great with my natural color i will order again soon. Thank you David wyche</li>
            <li> i do like it, but to be honest it really only looks good if youve got your hair short and also if youve got hair. if you dont have hair itll basically look like youve got black hair spray on your head, i like incorporating it with my topik&lt;br /&gt;but overall, i like it, it doesnt come off with sweat, you can actually swim with it without worrying if its running down your face</li>
            <li> only recommended if you are ussing it like for Halloween....  its like paint!  it will run if it gets wet. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Product made it on time. It helps so much!</li>
            <li> Here is a secret to stop this from getting on clothes and pillows and rubbing off. Just spray hairspray on after you apply to your hair. It locks the color into your hair and stops the mess! !!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It does wonders until you get under bright lights. Balding spots will glare under bright lights especially the sun.</li>
            <li> Really does work.  Makes a bit of a dmess in the bathroom though and for women makes hair alittle dry and tacky when applied.  Perfect thoguh for updoes and when scrunching hair to take that shine away from scalp.  Great product.  Great concpet.</li>
            <li> I choose this item becuase what i have seen on you tube videos,i was sceptable, so it was tried, and no one knew i had it on.I would recommned to others, rating is worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO A COMMON PROBLEM WITH OUT A LOT OF WORK.....I WILL CONTINUE TO USE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Getting kind of pricey!!Every time by new one. Cost more then do last one.Good service do!!</li>
            <li> It might have been because I have really short hair but when I tried using this on a little bald spot, it looked like regular spray paint.  Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well, good choice if you need it, fast results. If you have issues with balding, this is a smart choice. I had no idea it works as well as it does until i tried it for myself.</li>
            <li> This product comes in colors that match any hair type.  It is super easy to use.  Not only does it hide grays and bald spots, it actually has some sort of &#x27;fibers&#x27; in it that attach and &#x27;create hair&#x27;.  Plus, you can sweat, go swimming in it, get caught in the rain and it won&#x27;t come off. It comes off effortlessly when you shampoo.  Amazon it a great place to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending GLH, my hubs loves it to help conseal his balding areas, he is using this while treating with Minoxidil... :)</li>
            <li> i like it very nice shape, it gives nice energy. the stone has natural energy to attract all negative energy around you, that why, its color change or break  and damages appear inside it. its not the bad value of the product, but its the nature of crystal of all types.</li>
            <li> this product works on me, it really cover my thinning crown but every time i got sweat i feel itchy to my scalp</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a single male and want to remain that way then by all means use it.  The mess this junk in a can causes is extreme. It not only will ruin your clothing, your leather or fabric furniture and cause a huge mess for the bathtub. This stuff has to be toxic for your health as well. You can&#x27;t convince me that it isn&#x27;t harmful to your health to have a sickening sweet selling fiber traveling throughout the air and leaving a black sludge like residue on literally every item you use in the bathroom.  Find other means! GROSS!!!!!</li>
