            <li>The stand is great and the color is really nice.</li>
            <li>It still smells good, though.  </li>
            <li>Good brush, no shedding, would buy again</li>

            <li>Very smooth to the face, and lifted the hairs for a great close shave.</li>
            <li>So much better, and this brush is great.</li>
            <li>That said, I very pleased with the look and feel of it.</li>
            <li>..haven&#x27;t lost a hair which is more than I can say for myself!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok !</li>

            <li>This brush gives an amazing lather.</li>
            <li>The comfort and lather is amazing.  </li>
            <li>If not it&#x27;s a nice brush</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s nice looking.</li>
            <li>holder fits nicely under the sink in the cabinet.....</li>
            <li>awesome brush feels great on my face you can definitely compare its quality to the ones over $100.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the stand if you want to keep it inverted.  </li>
            <li>Holds heat well, and I get a nice lather.</li>
            <li>Creates a nice lather and stays with the bristles to evenly spread all across my face.</li>

            <li>Or buy your SO a nice dinner.</li>
            <li>I expect many many good years of service.</li>
            <li>Starts out good and just gets better and better.</li>
            <li>There may be better brushes out there that cost more, but for the money I think this is about as good as you can get.</li>
            <li>The best badger hair as I mentioned is VERY soft.</li>
            <li>A very well made brush, a very good value.</li>
            <li>Followed by a nice clean shave and a hot cup of coffee, it is the perfect way to start any day.</li>
            <li>Once every six months, I soak it in a warm bath of 2 cups of water and 2 tbsp of boraxo to thoroughly wash it it out and restore the bristles to their most absorptive.</li>
            <li>While not quite as soft as the silvertips, it&#x27;s size and density are perfect.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to find a good brush that you can be proud to own, but you&#x27;re also being budget conscious...</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaving brush I have ever purchased since I began using them in 1972.</li>
            <li>My go-to brush is the Parker Best Badger thus far when looking to spend &lt;$50.</li>
            <li>It is just the right size and whips up a great lather with a minimum of fuss.  </li>
            <li>This was a great first brush purchase that didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>To me it is more suitable as a \\&quot;travel</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the badger hair on my face.  </li>
            <li>This was just ok</li>
            <li>I can use one for a month or more before replacing it with this combination of brush and soap.  </li>
            <li>After thorough experimentation, this is still my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>your boar and buy better soap</li>
            <li>Has   not lost more than a couple of bristles   in all this time.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting better</li>
            <li>the more</li>
            <li>I bought this brush after reading reviews and am so glad</li>
            <li>It works very well and is a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li>For the price, I could not ask for a better brush.</li>
            <li>However, at this point, my boar head brush is softer and doesn&#x27;t stick my face anymore, but I think this is just a product of using it more often.  </li>
            <li>Would have given 5 stars if stand was better.</li>
            <li>A fitting brush for a beginner into shaving.</li>
            <li>It holds a substantial amount of shaving cream(enough for 8+ passes, more that you would ever need).</li>
            <li>I wanted to get a bit more scrub on the whiskers to get the shave cream under the whiskers and raise them up.</li>
            <li>For many years now, I have used cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li>After shopping around I learned that the Edwin Jagger name is synonymous with top notch shaving products, and I rolled the dice on this brush.  </li>
            <li>also choose a rounded brush over a staight brush, because it would cover more of my face faster, and provide more surface area.</li>
            <li>love this brush</li>
            <li>I think it would be better if the stand were taller and the brush were to hang from the knob at the top so that the bristles are untouched.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am really enjoying the experience.</li>
            <li>Great quality brush lathers really well.</li>
            <li>The badger brush has proved to be softer, produce a better lather and hold more of the shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy shaving now!</li>
            <li>but that was more of operator error than the brush itself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to get even better with use</li>
            <li>Contrary to many of the reviews here, my brush has lost more than two dozen bristles in the 45 days I have owned it.</li>
            <li>;  I would say he is pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than satisfied with the shaving brush.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t used to the softness of the badger as compared to the boar brush I had been using, but the size was great and it creates a very luxurious lather.</li>
            <li>Think I will try a Parker Best Badger next.  </li>
            <li>It felt great, smelled good and did a great job whipping up a thick lather.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Soft.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs just the right amount of moisture for a good</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying the EJ products I&#x27;ve purchased; they are of high quality and provide great bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>pure badger brush is as good or better than this EJ.</li>
            <li>New to DE shaving and this brush just whips up a great lather.</li>
            <li>A very close shave, a luxurious lather, and a pleasant experience now</li>
            <li>Its simple, get a good brush and a good cake of soap.  </li>
            <li>This brush for me is a perfect combination of smooth silkiness with just enough backbone to make it functional.  </li>
            <li>100% Best Badger Bristle Shaving Brush -- White &amp; Chrome Handle with Free Stand]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very well-made product and helps me get a great, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Edwin Jagger Best Badger shaving brush for 2 weeks now - and a single DE razor blade - and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>I guess I could have gotten along fine w/ just the boar, but I wanted to try something more</li>
            <li>Excellent hair density can sometimes  make it feel a touch took rough on the skin</li>
            <li>I can build a better lather quicker, and it makes for a closer shave, and feels pretty nice on the face too.</li>
            <li>I should enjoy many years of shaving using this brush.</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s way better than the cheap one.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other best hair brushes, but I would recommend this to any looking to upgrade.</li>
            <li>Works as described and easy to use.</li>
            <li>That was the easy winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The stand it comes with can be attached to wall surface for easy storing.</li>
            <li>Better hair is better right?</li>
            <li>This is clearly a superior product and I expect it to last many many years.</li>
            <li>Humans tend to associate heaviness with quality, which isn&#x27;t necessarily true, but I just love something that feels substantial in your hands, and this brush is a bit lacking in this category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great, full, brush that creates and hold a beautiful, thick, lather.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush about a year ago and really liked it at first.  </li>
            <li>The hairs on this brush not only work up a lather quickly but feel really great on my skin and do the job of standing up my beard hairs for a nice, clean shave well.</li>
            <li>but this does just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Did malt a bit in the beginning but is fine now.  </li>
            <li>It is a HUGE step up from a boar brush.</li>
            <li>A huge difference.</li>
            <li>Outstanding and worth every $</li>
            <li>Still provides a comfortable lather.</li>
            <li>My face is well hydrated with the lather produced with this brush (and a Crabtree &amp; Evelyn shaving cream) and the razor glides smoothly and leaves a silky smooth aftermath.    </li>
            <li>I know a ton of person enjoy it</li>
            <li>course with the help of the brush you will also want to apply the lather from shaving soap , not gel or foam from a cheap can.</li>
            <li>Great brush, still using this over a year later</li>
            <li>I got him into shaving with a safety razor and got a cheap brush</li>
            <li>spending a minute to gently work up a good lather is well worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is just simply a flat out great product.</li>
            <li>This was my first brush, it very nice and very soft.</li>
            <li>: Smell-free new, had no issues with many lost bristles, very light weight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>A nice brush at a decent price.</li>
            <li>The one from capitain choice is amazing, highly recommanded.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I became more experienced, the hair loss from the brush is much less.</li>
            <li>This brush lifts my beard and helps create a rich, foamy lather.  </li>
            <li>Whips up a rich lather and holds its shape well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>And I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I truly don&#x27;t see why you would need to spend more for a higher quality type of badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li>The better the brush the more water and heat it will retain and thus will make you a better lather in a short time, so</li>
            <li>The medium size is ideal for my average size face.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more the fist time and you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a great shave for years.    </li>
            <li>This particular brush is of very good quality only lost 4 or so strands and continues to get softer with every use.</li>
            <li>it just ain&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li>I found a nice old mug on one of the auction sites.  </li>
            <li>They seem to work well on my beard and are a good middle of the road price range.  </li>
            <li>I would say it is worth the price you pay, have bought cheap ones before and have to end up replacing them every couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Very soft, creates a great lather with the Taylor of Old Bond Street Jermyn Street shaving cream I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>a reasonably priced good quality brush to replace my very old brush.</li>
            <li>This particular brush is much nicer feeling and produces better lather than the brush I used many years ago.  </li>
            <li>You need to spend a little more and get a cake of some really good soap.  </li>
            <li>The accompanying stand is adequate in holding the brush when not in use or drying.</li>
            <li>The size of the loft is adequate and the bristles are well packed.</li>
            <li>This brush is an excellent choice for those that stick to or that are getting back to the origins and the pleasure of a traditional shave.</li>
            <li>I lather up in 4 quadrants to keep the face lather wet, a good wet lather is important to a good and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>So far there&#x27;s been very minimal shedding and the stand, although nothing special, works perfectly in my shower.</li>
            <li>They are handy, work well with shaving creams available in just about all department/grocery stores, and rarely produce nicks or cuts... if you change cartridges relatively regularly.  </li>
            <li>It feels soft and smooth on your face and beard and shaving is now a luxury for me, not just a daily chore, the brush softens the hair and works great, you can feel the exfoliation effects...</li>
            <li>that is wonderful, but the base is heavier than I want to take on frequent business trips and works best when lathering in a bowl.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush (just switched to wet shaving with a safety razor after 30 years of cartridge shaving), so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it seems well-made and works great.</li>
            <li>Even though this is my first brush from all the reviews I have read I would think that overall at this price range it might be as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>I am new to wet shaving and just upgraded my brush from a pure badger to this best badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, and not just for beginners!!!</li>
            <li>badger hair is soft, and is able to hold a lot of water between the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;It builds great gobs of lather with less effort in the bowl than a boar brush</li>
            <li>I used it twice so far and love it.  </li>
            <li>Ya, its gonna cost you about 40 bucks, but its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked the handle to be a bit longer, but it&#x27;s the same size as a medium-size brush should be.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend getting a nice inexpensive boar brush and break it in to use soaps.</li>
            <li>but I AM sure this brush will last much longer and it definitely is better at holding water and generating lather..</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to by a separate stand, nice for a beginner like me looking for a simple set up to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too soft or harsh; provides an excellent balance when applying shaving cream.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Edwin Jagger Traditional English Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush.  </li>
            <li>Full size brushes are available at the same price and they really deliver a better lather.</li>
            <li>Just right, both for cream and for soap.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to get a decent brush that can with a drip stand, and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>this is a good, hard working brush, well made, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>handle is comfortable, high quality, and one piece with no visible mold lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I now use a small Pyrex bowl to lather up and that works great, lots of room</li>
            <li>My husband is really into the zen of shaving every morning and this has become his favorite brush so soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve handled some higher prices brushes and I&#x27;d say this is right there with them.</li>
            <li>It sheds a bit more than expected and the stand looks and feel cheap.</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin and says it is nice and soft against his skin.</li>
            <li>However, I find this smaller brush easier to handle, easier to clean, and no less effective.</li>
            <li>Just another half an inch would make it far more comfortable to use in the mug and on your face.would make it far more comfortable to use in the mug and on your face.</li>
            <li>100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand]]</li>
            <li>Bottom line is, trust this English company that has been manufacturing quality products for many years, they have a long tradition to live up to and prices are fair on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the badger hair brush, it is test I ever owned in the last 80 years.</li>
            <li>I have been using brushes to mix shaving cream/soap/gel for about 10 years now, but this is my first badger brush.  </li>
            <li>No one ever saw a badger taking a hot bath, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lost about four hairs on the first lather but hasn&#x27;t lost a hair since.  </li>
            <li>My title explains it pretty well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried this bursh w/ a cream yet, but for a soap puck, it does pretty well.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I went back to a brush and soap shave.  </li>
            <li>Makes a great lather that remains through at least three passes.</li>
            <li>however, it lost a lot of hair the first time i used it, and still hasn&#x27;t stopped shedding.</li>
            <li>This was my first shaving brush and I am thoroughly satisfied with initial build quality.</li>
            <li>Lost 8-10 hairs on the first use and none since.</li>
            <li>Let it soak for 20 minutes before first use improved</li>
            <li>I started out many years ago with a shaving mug, a cake of soap and a double edge razor.  </li>
            <li>This was my first shave brush and for that purpose this brush was a luxurious start.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This brush gets better after a short break-in period.  </li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>The brush did smell a bit upon first wetting.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>If you want pretty chrome and want to spend buy one, after all this is a bathroom counter accessory.</li>
            <li>it should last many years.</li>
            <li>it will sit next to the Jagger 98l DE razor I bought as my first DE razor for many years.</li>
            <li>From the first moment I put it to my face</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush, so I have nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the DE razor blades are so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>I found that a cheap old [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>what after the first 4 or 5 uses even if you don&#x27;t do the pet shampoo/dawn dish detergent prewash.</li>
            <li>this is my first shave brush so I have nothing to compare it to</li>
            <li>This is my first brush and after looking at a bunch of reviews I settled with this one.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li>&quot; It whips up a great lather, is not too rough or soft, doesn&#x27;t have a funky animal smell, and is very well balanced.  </li>
            <li>My first brush was of boar hair, a little too rough, but, I was not to know the difference until I ordered my Edwin Jagger Best Badger brush.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare this shaving brush to the many more expensive options out there, but upgrading from a cheap non-badger brush has bee absolutely worth it for me.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this brush is as good of a brush as any of the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>My husband has a lovely white beard and is very fastidious about shaving.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am not certain that this brush is so much more effective than a cheap boar&#x27;s hair brush that one might get at the drug store as to warrant being ten times the price...</li>
            <li>The bristles have enough backbone that it easily lathers both creams and soaps.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to other good-quality brushes, but from what I&#x27;ve read online, it is as good as brushes many times more expensive.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not quite silvertip soft, I found this brush to be very gentle and enjoyable, especially compared to anything else in this price</li>
            <li>grade of badger is supposed to be softer than a \\&quot;Pure Badger\\&quot; grade brush and a tad stiffer than the \\&quot;Silvertip Badger\\&quot; grade.</li>
            <li>&quot; I would recommend the Parker 100% Pure Badge brush instead.</li>
            <li>If you have large hands this might not be for you.</li>
            <li>it is worthy to spend a few more dollars in a quality brush like this one.</li>
            <li>More expensive, higher quality badger brushes are mostly too soft to work up a good lather, and cheaper ones loose the hairs almost from day one, and you don&#x27;t want those on your face when your razor will just slide over them and not shave you.  </li>
            <li>It was somewhat smaller than I was expecting, but works fine.</li>
            <li>So it seems like a very high quality brush.</li>
            <li>Well-made, holder is attractive enough for the bathroom sink and bristles are sturdy and except for a few at the beginning when I began to use it, they don&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li>Creates a great lather and has only lost a few bristles in that time.</li>
            <li>I stated out with a cheap brush (about $7) and fell for some soap that some people make and sell from basic ingredients and scented oils</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>It holds water really well.  </li>
            <li>Quality is better  than I expected.</li>
            <li>Bit the bullet and spent more money buying this brush for my husband.  </li>
            <li>First, when they try to tell you not to expect much lather from their soap, and that is normal, well....</li>
            <li>I am liking it more and more, now that it is broken in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been straight-razor shaving for a couple of years now and had so far never been able to make a proper lather using the cheapo boar brush</li>
            <li>Absolutely a lot better than a brush I spent $25 for,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good, thick brush.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving brush as I&#x27;m new to shaving with a DE razor.</li>
            <li>I felt this would be the right time to go old school.</li>
            <li>The fibers stay together rather than flare out like so many other brushes tend to do.</li>
            <li>I did have to watch a few you tube videos on how to lather a brush before I was able to get that good slick lather</li>
            <li>so the bristles by definition are a little firmer then a Pure brush, but honestly this brush is as soft as I would use.  </li>
            <li>Well being new to wet shaving I did not want to ruin a very expensive brush, so I eliminated the top two qualities and targeted the best quality brush I could find under $60.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the whole safety razor, brush and shaving soap ritual.  </li>
            <li>It works much better than the previous brands that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>This particular brush is well made</li>
            <li>I fully expect this one to not only last the rest of my life, but find good use long after I am gone.</li>
            <li>Did not come with the stand, which is quite bad.&lt;br /&gt;Also, black color was not available when I decided to buy, and I would have like black a lot more, but personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great quality brush, but do not expect the silvertip quality as it is not!</li>
            <li>I would highly recomend a badger brush to someone who is thinking of purchasing a brush.  </li>
            <li>Quality is high.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The brush is high quality, hand knotted in Sheffield England.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is not any advantage and the bristles don&#x27;t give as nice a lather as some other brushes for the same cost.</li>
            <li>Smooth and stays wet.</li>
            <li>but I know that will be normal over the course of use.</li>
            <li>There also seems to be quite a bit of shedding, and while this is supposed to be normal I will have to monitor it to see if it stops or continues over time.</li>
            <li>this one is a firm, plush brush that will make you glad you bought it.</li>
            <li>well worth the extra cost</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good brush, not a great brush.</li>
            <li>Come back at the end and go over any areas you missed, short hairs left, or better yet redo the whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it still seems new.</li>
            <li>a lot before I try anything new) brushes and razors.</li>
            <li>B004OJM9XE Semogue 620 Superior Boar Bristle Shaving Brush]] to see if a brush with a slightly firmer reputation might due the trick for face lathering road trips - will update after a couple of weeks or so.</li>
            <li>but it is very minor and will get used to it  quickly.</li>
            <li>With this shaving brush, the lather (using Taylor Jermyn Street shaving cream) was thick and rich the very first time out of the gate.</li>
            <li>Its not necessary to use really hot water either.  </li>
            <li>This is about the 3rd or 4th of these brushes that I&#x27;ve bought, but the first of this brand.</li>
            <li>He loves it and often remarks how much better it is than his last one, which came from the other side of the Pacific.</li>
            <li>I started lathering with an old mug, but I was banging the top of the brush annoying my wife and not getting a good lather.</li>
            <li>that I have slowed down to actually enjoy the experience.</li>
            <li>When and IF the new brush needs to be replaced, we will certainly buy British again.</li>
            <li>for the rest of your \\&quot;kit\\&quot; that is less important in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>My first impression is that this brush seems to work up a lather very well, is comfortable to hold, simple to use, and with some basic working instructions appears as if it will last for quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the medium size, which only cost a few dollars more than the small.</li>
            <li>I had researched it at various shaving sites and thought it would last many years, but now it can barely whip-up enough lather for one a pass shave.  </li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush, so I don&#x27;t have a point of comparison, but other reviewers seem to focus on how much hair brushes lose.</li>
            <li>It is smaller than you might expect if you are used to a large size brush head.</li>
            <li>With that said I do wish it had a little more back bone to it.</li>
            <li>My favorite soap was evelyn &amp; crabtree almond oil hard dish soap.</li>
            <li>This brush will not perform very well with shaving soaps as it does not really have much of a backbone.</li>
            <li>and it has just enough splay to really massage your face but not lose lather</li>
            <li>It is soft and holds soap well.</li>
            <li>I prefer ivory with some natural striping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with Taylor of Old Bond Street soaps, Mama Bear scented shaving pucks and VDH pucks.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft.  </li>
            <li>is a soft brush</li>
            <li>I attribute that to the badger bristles used in this brush instead of the boar bristles that my old brush used.  </li>
            <li>I buy it to replace an old 12 years of service shaving brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I use it w/ Taylor of Old Bond shaving cream)</li>
            <li>I bought a quality shave cream - Taylor of Old Bond also from Amazon.</li>
            <li>but my face would be redder after shaving if I applied the lather directly to my face with the brush as opposed to lathering up in my palm and then applying it by hand.</li>
            <li>This is not as soft as a silver tip</li>
            <li>It has soft tips.  </li>
            <li>It never had much of a \\&quot;wild animal\\&quot; smell, and whatever smell it had went away within a week of use.  </li>
            <li>brush smelled only upon first getting wet as some have stated, but the smell went away after the first lather.</li>
            <li>Feels soft against my skin.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap $8 shaving brushes.</li>
            <li>Really does make a big difference when compared to just using fingertips...</li>
            <li>so I am guessing  not as soft as it can be</li>
            <li>I chose it because of the reviews and it was middle-of-the-pack as far as pricing.</li>
            <li>It is soft enough to face lather with, holds just the right amount of water and has enough backbone to tackle anything you throw at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush holder is a simple but adequate device that allows the brush to drain and dry after use.</li>
            <li>It did loose some hair first time I used it and soaked it</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this brush to anyone starting out brush lathering their shaving cream, or making a first upgrade from horse or boar hair.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this brush for about a month now, so I can&#x27;t comment about the longevity of this particular brush.</li>
            <li>I have lost a few hairs, but that is to be expected when breaking in any brush, and it will produce a great lather in relatively little time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, but just firm enough to be comfortable and do its job efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have this brush paired with a classic stone shaving bowl, and this combination makes tons of creamy lather in no time flat.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first badger brush purchase, but since then I&#x27;ve acquired multiple Shavemac silvertips and a handful of more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>Major step up from the synthetic I used.</li>
            <li>The drip stand is a real god-send; his old one took two days to dry out properly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable brush that will hang with the more expensive models.</li>
            <li>A stand is a must to let your brush air dry properly, with the brush tips down, and you never want to rest the brush on it&#x27;s bristles, so even during shaving flip it over to rest it on the counter, once dry completely you can invert your brush on its&#x27; top for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to choose a shave brush?</li>
            <li>When his old shaving brush fell apart, we decided to upgrade to the English product.</li>
            <li>Now, I am new to wetshaving, and this is only my second brush.</li>
            <li>With a few of the larger silvertips I have to use a significant amount of product and the results aren&#x27;t that much different.</li>
            <li>ever so slight animal funk smell at first, there are tricks to get rid of this though and it does fade no matter</li>
            <li>His previous one had hairs falling out left and right.</li>
            <li>The price seemed reasonable compared to other brands of brushes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s only lost a few hairs (less than 10), and they don&#x27;t seem to be coming out any more.</li>
            <li>It is luxurious, but stiff enough to raise a rich, wet lather directly on my face using The Body Shop&#x27;s shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>The handle is verry little and at first use I feel like doing micropainting with the tip of your finger, this is not viril at all.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical if a brush would really make a difference and found IT REALLY DOES!!!  </li>
            <li>: On the slightly too small size, but most concerning was that it got \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; faster than any brush I have used.</li>
            <li>I bought for about $8 or so at Whole Foods—whether using shaving soap or shaving cream (of various brands, cheap and expensive).</li>
            <li>It lost a few hairs during the first two shaves, now it is not loosing anything.</li>
            <li>I have had other shaving brushes  some large and some considerably more expensive</li>
            <li>B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] was as firm after several months use (my first shaving brush) than the EJ after less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tend to whip my lather very hard and this brush takes it just fine.</li>
            <li>I would rate this brush as just OK due to its very small size.</li>
            <li>They are not too soft and limp and not hard either.  </li>
            <li>I want to point out that I have seen the more expensive brushes make a much richer lather with less soap.</li>
            <li>This will certainly cause the outer edges of the brush to lose shape after a while or even break a few bristles off in time.</li>

            <li> I have another fantastic best badger [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The stand is great and the color is really nice.</li>
            <li> It still smells good, though.  </li>
            <li> Good brush, no shedding, would buy again</li>
            <li> You can spend more money, but this is just simply a wonderful product that is perfect right out of the box.</li>
            <li> At $50 for a brush I thought it better be really good!  </li>
            <li> The best badger hair soaks up a tremendous amount of water with one of the softest lofts I have used.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth to the face, and lifted the hairs for a great close shave.</li>
            <li> So much better, and this brush is great.</li>
            <li> That said, I very pleased with the look and feel of it.</li>
            <li> ..haven&#x27;t lost a hair which is more than I can say for myself!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok !</li>
            <li> They also retain heat well, even while applying on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this brush and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great brush at a very reasonable price.</li>

            <li> If not it&#x27;s a nice brush</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s nice looking.</li>
            <li> holder fits nicely under the sink in the cabinet.....</li>
            <li> awesome brush feels great on my face you can definitely compare its quality to the ones over $100.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have the stand if you want to keep it inverted.  </li>
            <li> Holds heat well, and I get a nice lather.</li>
            <li> Creates a nice lather and stays with the bristles to evenly spread all across my face.</li>
            <li> Nice, quality product.</li>

            <li> Or buy your SO a nice dinner.</li>
            <li> I expect many many good years of service.</li>
            <li> Starts out good and just gets better and better.</li>
            <li> There may be better brushes out there that cost more, but for the money I think this is about as good as you can get.</li>
            <li> The best badger hair as I mentioned is VERY soft.</li>
            <li> A very well made brush, a very good value.</li>
            <li> Followed by a nice clean shave and a hot cup of coffee, it is the perfect way to start any day.</li>
            <li> Once every six months, I soak it in a warm bath of 2 cups of water and 2 tbsp of boraxo to thoroughly wash it it out and restore the bristles to their most absorptive.</li>
            <li> While not quite as soft as the silvertips, it&#x27;s size and density are perfect.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to find a good brush that you can be proud to own, but you&#x27;re also being budget conscious...</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaving brush I have ever purchased since I began using them in 1972.</li>
            <li> My go-to brush is the Parker Best Badger thus far when looking to spend &lt;$50.</li>
            <li> It is just the right size and whips up a great lather with a minimum of fuss.  </li>
            <li> This was a great first brush purchase that didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> To me it is more suitable as a \\&quot;travel</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the badger hair on my face.  </li>
            <li> This was just ok</li>
            <li> I can use one for a month or more before replacing it with this combination of brush and soap.  </li>
            <li> After thorough experimentation, this is still my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> your boar and buy better soap</li>
            <li> Has   not lost more than a couple of bristles   in all this time.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting better</li>
            <li> the more</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after reading reviews and am so glad</li>
            <li> It works very well and is a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> For the price, I could not ask for a better brush.</li>
            <li> However, at this point, my boar head brush is softer and doesn&#x27;t stick my face anymore, but I think this is just a product of using it more often.  </li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars if stand was better.</li>
            <li> A fitting brush for a beginner into shaving.</li>
            <li> It holds a substantial amount of shaving cream(enough for 8+ passes, more that you would ever need).</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a bit more scrub on the whiskers to get the shave cream under the whiskers and raise them up.</li>
            <li> For many years now, I have used cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li> After shopping around I learned that the Edwin Jagger name is synonymous with top notch shaving products, and I rolled the dice on this brush.  </li>
            <li> also choose a rounded brush over a staight brush, because it would cover more of my face faster, and provide more surface area.</li>
            <li> love this brush</li>
            <li> I think it would be better if the stand were taller and the brush were to hang from the knob at the top so that the bristles are untouched.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I am really enjoying the experience.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush lathers really well.</li>
            <li> The badger brush has proved to be softer, produce a better lather and hold more of the shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy shaving now!</li>
            <li> but that was more of operator error than the brush itself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to get even better with use</li>
            <li> Contrary to many of the reviews here, my brush has lost more than two dozen bristles in the 45 days I have owned it.</li>
            <li> ;  I would say he is pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than satisfied with the shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t used to the softness of the badger as compared to the boar brush I had been using, but the size was great and it creates a very luxurious lather.</li>
            <li> Think I will try a Parker Best Badger next.  </li>
            <li> It felt great, smelled good and did a great job whipping up a thick lather.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Soft.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs just the right amount of moisture for a good</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the EJ products I&#x27;ve purchased; they are of high quality and provide great bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> pure badger brush is as good or better than this EJ.</li>
            <li> New to DE shaving and this brush just whips up a great lather.</li>
            <li> A very close shave, a luxurious lather, and a pleasant experience now</li>
            <li> Its simple, get a good brush and a good cake of soap.  </li>
            <li> This brush for me is a perfect combination of smooth silkiness with just enough backbone to make it functional.  </li>
            <li> 100% Best Badger Bristle Shaving Brush -- White &amp; Chrome Handle with Free Stand]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very well-made product and helps me get a great, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Edwin Jagger Best Badger shaving brush for 2 weeks now - and a single DE razor blade - and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> I guess I could have gotten along fine w/ just the boar, but I wanted to try something more</li>
            <li> Excellent hair density can sometimes  make it feel a touch took rough on the skin</li>
            <li> I can build a better lather quicker, and it makes for a closer shave, and feels pretty nice on the face too.</li>
            <li> I should enjoy many years of shaving using this brush.</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s way better than the cheap one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other best hair brushes, but I would recommend this to any looking to upgrade.</li>
            <li> Works as described and easy to use.</li>
            <li> That was the easy winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The stand it comes with can be attached to wall surface for easy storing.</li>
            <li> Better hair is better right?</li>
            <li> This is clearly a superior product and I expect it to last many many years.</li>
            <li> Humans tend to associate heaviness with quality, which isn&#x27;t necessarily true, but I just love something that feels substantial in your hands, and this brush is a bit lacking in this category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great, full, brush that creates and hold a beautiful, thick, lather.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush about a year ago and really liked it at first.  </li>
            <li> The hairs on this brush not only work up a lather quickly but feel really great on my skin and do the job of standing up my beard hairs for a nice, clean shave well.</li>
            <li> but this does just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Did malt a bit in the beginning but is fine now.  </li>
            <li> It is a HUGE step up from a boar brush.</li>
            <li> A huge difference.</li>
            <li> Outstanding and worth every $</li>
            <li> Still provides a comfortable lather.</li>
            <li> My face is well hydrated with the lather produced with this brush (and a Crabtree &amp; Evelyn shaving cream) and the razor glides smoothly and leaves a silky smooth aftermath.    </li>
            <li> I know a ton of person enjoy it</li>
            <li> course with the help of the brush you will also want to apply the lather from shaving soap , not gel or foam from a cheap can.</li>
            <li> Great brush, still using this over a year later</li>
            <li> I got him into shaving with a safety razor and got a cheap brush</li>
            <li> spending a minute to gently work up a good lather is well worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is just simply a flat out great product.</li>
            <li> This was my first brush, it very nice and very soft.</li>
            <li> : Smell-free new, had no issues with many lost bristles, very light weight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> A nice brush at a decent price.</li>
            <li> The one from capitain choice is amazing, highly recommanded.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I became more experienced, the hair loss from the brush is much less.</li>
            <li> This brush lifts my beard and helps create a rich, foamy lather.  </li>
            <li> Whips up a rich lather and holds its shape well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> And I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I truly don&#x27;t see why you would need to spend more for a higher quality type of badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li> The better the brush the more water and heat it will retain and thus will make you a better lather in a short time, so</li>
            <li> The medium size is ideal for my average size face.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more the fist time and you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a great shave for years.    </li>
            <li> This particular brush is of very good quality only lost 4 or so strands and continues to get softer with every use.</li>
            <li> it just ain&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li> I found a nice old mug on one of the auction sites.  </li>
            <li> They seem to work well on my beard and are a good middle of the road price range.  </li>
            <li> I would say it is worth the price you pay, have bought cheap ones before and have to end up replacing them every couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Very soft, creates a great lather with the Taylor of Old Bond Street Jermyn Street shaving cream I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> a reasonably priced good quality brush to replace my very old brush.</li>
            <li> This particular brush is much nicer feeling and produces better lather than the brush I used many years ago.  </li>
            <li> You need to spend a little more and get a cake of some really good soap.  </li>
            <li> The accompanying stand is adequate in holding the brush when not in use or drying.</li>
            <li> The size of the loft is adequate and the bristles are well packed.</li>
            <li> This brush is an excellent choice for those that stick to or that are getting back to the origins and the pleasure of a traditional shave.</li>
            <li> I lather up in 4 quadrants to keep the face lather wet, a good wet lather is important to a good and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> So far there&#x27;s been very minimal shedding and the stand, although nothing special, works perfectly in my shower.</li>
            <li> They are handy, work well with shaving creams available in just about all department/grocery stores, and rarely produce nicks or cuts... if you change cartridges relatively regularly.  </li>
            <li> It feels soft and smooth on your face and beard and shaving is now a luxury for me, not just a daily chore, the brush softens the hair and works great, you can feel the exfoliation effects...</li>
            <li> that is wonderful, but the base is heavier than I want to take on frequent business trips and works best when lathering in a bowl.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush (just switched to wet shaving with a safety razor after 30 years of cartridge shaving), so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it seems well-made and works great.</li>
            <li> Even though this is my first brush from all the reviews I have read I would think that overall at this price range it might be as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and just upgraded my brush from a pure badger to this best badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, and not just for beginners!!!</li>
            <li> badger hair is soft, and is able to hold a lot of water between the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;It builds great gobs of lather with less effort in the bowl than a boar brush</li>
            <li> I used it twice so far and love it.  </li>
            <li> Ya, its gonna cost you about 40 bucks, but its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked the handle to be a bit longer, but it&#x27;s the same size as a medium-size brush should be.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend getting a nice inexpensive boar brush and break it in to use soaps.</li>
            <li> but I AM sure this brush will last much longer and it definitely is better at holding water and generating lather..</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to by a separate stand, nice for a beginner like me looking for a simple set up to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too soft or harsh; provides an excellent balance when applying shaving cream.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the Edwin Jagger Traditional English Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush.  </li>
            <li> Full size brushes are available at the same price and they really deliver a better lather.</li>
            <li> Just right, both for cream and for soap.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to get a decent brush that can with a drip stand, and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> this is a good, hard working brush, well made, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> handle is comfortable, high quality, and one piece with no visible mold lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now use a small Pyrex bowl to lather up and that works great, lots of room</li>
            <li> My husband is really into the zen of shaving every morning and this has become his favorite brush so soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve handled some higher prices brushes and I&#x27;d say this is right there with them.</li>
            <li> It sheds a bit more than expected and the stand looks and feel cheap.</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin and says it is nice and soft against his skin.</li>
            <li> However, I find this smaller brush easier to handle, easier to clean, and no less effective.</li>
            <li> Just another half an inch would make it far more comfortable to use in the mug and on your face.would make it far more comfortable to use in the mug and on your face.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand]]</li>
            <li> Bottom line is, trust this English company that has been manufacturing quality products for many years, they have a long tradition to live up to and prices are fair on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the badger hair brush, it is test I ever owned in the last 80 years.</li>
            <li> I have been using brushes to mix shaving cream/soap/gel for about 10 years now, but this is my first badger brush.  </li>
            <li> No one ever saw a badger taking a hot bath, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lost about four hairs on the first lather but hasn&#x27;t lost a hair since.  </li>
            <li> My title explains it pretty well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this bursh w/ a cream yet, but for a soap puck, it does pretty well.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I went back to a brush and soap shave.  </li>
            <li> Makes a great lather that remains through at least three passes.</li>
            <li> however, it lost a lot of hair the first time i used it, and still hasn&#x27;t stopped shedding.</li>
            <li> This was my first shaving brush and I am thoroughly satisfied with initial build quality.</li>
            <li> Lost 8-10 hairs on the first use and none since.</li>
            <li> Let it soak for 20 minutes before first use improved</li>
            <li> I started out many years ago with a shaving mug, a cake of soap and a double edge razor.  </li>
            <li> This was my first shave brush and for that purpose this brush was a luxurious start.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This brush gets better after a short break-in period.  </li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush did smell a bit upon first wetting.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> If you want pretty chrome and want to spend buy one, after all this is a bathroom counter accessory.</li>
            <li> it should last many years.</li>
            <li> it will sit next to the Jagger 98l DE razor I bought as my first DE razor for many years.</li>
            <li> From the first moment I put it to my face</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I have nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the DE razor blades are so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I found that a cheap old [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> what after the first 4 or 5 uses even if you don&#x27;t do the pet shampoo/dawn dish detergent prewash.</li>
            <li> this is my first shave brush so I have nothing to compare it to</li>
            <li> This is my first brush and after looking at a bunch of reviews I settled with this one.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush.</li>
            <li> &quot; It whips up a great lather, is not too rough or soft, doesn&#x27;t have a funky animal smell, and is very well balanced.  </li>
            <li> My first brush was of boar hair, a little too rough, but, I was not to know the difference until I ordered my Edwin Jagger Best Badger brush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare this shaving brush to the many more expensive options out there, but upgrading from a cheap non-badger brush has bee absolutely worth it for me.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this brush is as good of a brush as any of the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> My husband has a lovely white beard and is very fastidious about shaving.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am not certain that this brush is so much more effective than a cheap boar&#x27;s hair brush that one might get at the drug store as to warrant being ten times the price...</li>
            <li> The bristles have enough backbone that it easily lathers both creams and soaps.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to other good-quality brushes, but from what I&#x27;ve read online, it is as good as brushes many times more expensive.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not quite silvertip soft, I found this brush to be very gentle and enjoyable, especially compared to anything else in this price</li>
            <li> grade of badger is supposed to be softer than a \\&quot;Pure Badger\\&quot; grade brush and a tad stiffer than the \\&quot;Silvertip Badger\\&quot; grade.</li>
            <li> &quot; I would recommend the Parker 100% Pure Badge brush instead.</li>
            <li> If you have large hands this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> it is worthy to spend a few more dollars in a quality brush like this one.</li>
            <li> More expensive, higher quality badger brushes are mostly too soft to work up a good lather, and cheaper ones loose the hairs almost from day one, and you don&#x27;t want those on your face when your razor will just slide over them and not shave you.  </li>
            <li> It was somewhat smaller than I was expecting, but works fine.</li>
            <li> So it seems like a very high quality brush.</li>
            <li> Well-made, holder is attractive enough for the bathroom sink and bristles are sturdy and except for a few at the beginning when I began to use it, they don&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li> Creates a great lather and has only lost a few bristles in that time.</li>
            <li> I stated out with a cheap brush (about $7) and fell for some soap that some people make and sell from basic ingredients and scented oils</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> It holds water really well.  </li>
            <li> Quality is better  than I expected.</li>
            <li> Bit the bullet and spent more money buying this brush for my husband.  </li>
            <li> First, when they try to tell you not to expect much lather from their soap, and that is normal, well....</li>
            <li> I am liking it more and more, now that it is broken in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been straight-razor shaving for a couple of years now and had so far never been able to make a proper lather using the cheapo boar brush</li>
            <li> Absolutely a lot better than a brush I spent $25 for,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good, thick brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush as I&#x27;m new to shaving with a DE razor.</li>
            <li> I felt this would be the right time to go old school.</li>
            <li> The fibers stay together rather than flare out like so many other brushes tend to do.</li>
            <li> I did have to watch a few you tube videos on how to lather a brush before I was able to get that good slick lather</li>
            <li> so the bristles by definition are a little firmer then a Pure brush, but honestly this brush is as soft as I would use.  </li>
            <li> Well being new to wet shaving I did not want to ruin a very expensive brush, so I eliminated the top two qualities and targeted the best quality brush I could find under $60.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole safety razor, brush and shaving soap ritual.  </li>
            <li> It works much better than the previous brands that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> This particular brush is well made</li>
            <li> I fully expect this one to not only last the rest of my life, but find good use long after I am gone.</li>
            <li> Did not come with the stand, which is quite bad.&lt;br /&gt;Also, black color was not available when I decided to buy, and I would have like black a lot more, but personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great quality brush, but do not expect the silvertip quality as it is not!</li>
            <li> I would highly recomend a badger brush to someone who is thinking of purchasing a brush.  </li>
            <li> Quality is high.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The brush is high quality, hand knotted in Sheffield England.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is not any advantage and the bristles don&#x27;t give as nice a lather as some other brushes for the same cost.</li>
            <li> Smooth and stays wet.</li>
            <li> but I know that will be normal over the course of use.</li>
            <li> There also seems to be quite a bit of shedding, and while this is supposed to be normal I will have to monitor it to see if it stops or continues over time.</li>
            <li> this one is a firm, plush brush that will make you glad you bought it.</li>
            <li> well worth the extra cost</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good brush, not a great brush.</li>
            <li> Come back at the end and go over any areas you missed, short hairs left, or better yet redo the whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it still seems new.</li>
            <li> a lot before I try anything new) brushes and razors.</li>
            <li> B004OJM9XE Semogue 620 Superior Boar Bristle Shaving Brush]] to see if a brush with a slightly firmer reputation might due the trick for face lathering road trips - will update after a couple of weeks or so.</li>
            <li> but it is very minor and will get used to it  quickly.</li>
            <li> With this shaving brush, the lather (using Taylor Jermyn Street shaving cream) was thick and rich the very first time out of the gate.</li>
            <li> Its not necessary to use really hot water either.  </li>
            <li> This is about the 3rd or 4th of these brushes that I&#x27;ve bought, but the first of this brand.</li>
            <li> He loves it and often remarks how much better it is than his last one, which came from the other side of the Pacific.</li>
            <li> I started lathering with an old mug, but I was banging the top of the brush annoying my wife and not getting a good lather.</li>
            <li> that I have slowed down to actually enjoy the experience.</li>
            <li> When and IF the new brush needs to be replaced, we will certainly buy British again.</li>
            <li> for the rest of your \\&quot;kit\\&quot; that is less important in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> My first impression is that this brush seems to work up a lather very well, is comfortable to hold, simple to use, and with some basic working instructions appears as if it will last for quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the medium size, which only cost a few dollars more than the small.</li>
            <li> I had researched it at various shaving sites and thought it would last many years, but now it can barely whip-up enough lather for one a pass shave.  </li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush, so I don&#x27;t have a point of comparison, but other reviewers seem to focus on how much hair brushes lose.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than you might expect if you are used to a large size brush head.</li>
            <li> With that said I do wish it had a little more back bone to it.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap was evelyn &amp; crabtree almond oil hard dish soap.</li>
            <li> This brush will not perform very well with shaving soaps as it does not really have much of a backbone.</li>
            <li> and it has just enough splay to really massage your face but not lose lather</li>
            <li> It is soft and holds soap well.</li>
            <li> I prefer ivory with some natural striping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with Taylor of Old Bond Street soaps, Mama Bear scented shaving pucks and VDH pucks.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft.  </li>
            <li> is a soft brush</li>
            <li> I attribute that to the badger bristles used in this brush instead of the boar bristles that my old brush used.  </li>
            <li> I buy it to replace an old 12 years of service shaving brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I use it w/ Taylor of Old Bond shaving cream)</li>
            <li> I bought a quality shave cream - Taylor of Old Bond also from Amazon.</li>
            <li> but my face would be redder after shaving if I applied the lather directly to my face with the brush as opposed to lathering up in my palm and then applying it by hand.</li>
            <li> This is not as soft as a silver tip</li>
            <li> It has soft tips.  </li>
            <li> It never had much of a \\&quot;wild animal\\&quot; smell, and whatever smell it had went away within a week of use.  </li>
            <li> brush smelled only upon first getting wet as some have stated, but the smell went away after the first lather.</li>
            <li> Feels soft against my skin.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap $8 shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> Really does make a big difference when compared to just using fingertips...</li>
            <li> so I am guessing  not as soft as it can be</li>
            <li> I chose it because of the reviews and it was middle-of-the-pack as far as pricing.</li>
            <li> It is soft enough to face lather with, holds just the right amount of water and has enough backbone to tackle anything you throw at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush holder is a simple but adequate device that allows the brush to drain and dry after use.</li>
            <li> It did loose some hair first time I used it and soaked it</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this brush to anyone starting out brush lathering their shaving cream, or making a first upgrade from horse or boar hair.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this brush for about a month now, so I can&#x27;t comment about the longevity of this particular brush.</li>
            <li> I have lost a few hairs, but that is to be expected when breaking in any brush, and it will produce a great lather in relatively little time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, but just firm enough to be comfortable and do its job efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have this brush paired with a classic stone shaving bowl, and this combination makes tons of creamy lather in no time flat.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first badger brush purchase, but since then I&#x27;ve acquired multiple Shavemac silvertips and a handful of more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Major step up from the synthetic I used.</li>
            <li> The drip stand is a real god-send; his old one took two days to dry out properly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable brush that will hang with the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> A stand is a must to let your brush air dry properly, with the brush tips down, and you never want to rest the brush on it&#x27;s bristles, so even during shaving flip it over to rest it on the counter, once dry completely you can invert your brush on its&#x27; top for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to choose a shave brush?</li>
            <li> When his old shaving brush fell apart, we decided to upgrade to the English product.</li>
            <li> Now, I am new to wetshaving, and this is only my second brush.</li>
            <li> With a few of the larger silvertips I have to use a significant amount of product and the results aren&#x27;t that much different.</li>
            <li> ever so slight animal funk smell at first, there are tricks to get rid of this though and it does fade no matter</li>
            <li> His previous one had hairs falling out left and right.</li>
            <li> The price seemed reasonable compared to other brands of brushes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only lost a few hairs (less than 10), and they don&#x27;t seem to be coming out any more.</li>
            <li> It is luxurious, but stiff enough to raise a rich, wet lather directly on my face using The Body Shop&#x27;s shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> The handle is verry little and at first use I feel like doing micropainting with the tip of your finger, this is not viril at all.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical if a brush would really make a difference and found IT REALLY DOES!!!  </li>
            <li> : On the slightly too small size, but most concerning was that it got \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; faster than any brush I have used.</li>
            <li> I bought for about $8 or so at Whole Foods—whether using shaving soap or shaving cream (of various brands, cheap and expensive).</li>
            <li> It lost a few hairs during the first two shaves, now it is not loosing anything.</li>
            <li> I have had other shaving brushes  some large and some considerably more expensive</li>
            <li> B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] was as firm after several months use (my first shaving brush) than the EJ after less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tend to whip my lather very hard and this brush takes it just fine.</li>
            <li> I would rate this brush as just OK due to its very small size.</li>
            <li> They are not too soft and limp and not hard either.  </li>
            <li> I want to point out that I have seen the more expensive brushes make a much richer lather with less soap.</li>
            <li> This will certainly cause the outer edges of the brush to lose shape after a while or even break a few bristles off in time.</li>
            <li> I got rid of the smell by lathering it up once a day and leaving it dry (with the lather still on it) for 24hrs for a few days the first week.</li>
            <li> The one negative is the brush shed about a dozen bristles the first two weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> but, I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
            <li> few hairs lost each day in the first two weeks of use, then it settled down, not to worry there&#x27;s still plenty left in the brush!&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li> After soaking completely, I shake off the excess and add a little at a time if necessary.</li>
            <li> It is easy to work up a very thick bowl lather with this brush, however you can expect occasional shedding due to its relatively loosely packed knot.</li>
            <li> It is twice the size, holds twice the water and is just as soft and is less expensive.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Soft, yet stiff enough to carry the soap or cream.</li>
            <li> The drip stand actually has a sticky pad on the back if you wish to mount it to the wall, which I have done since it frees the other hand from having to hold the stand while removing the brush for use.</li>
            <li> My only gripe would be that the imitation ivory handle doesn&#x27;t actually look like ivory.</li>
            <li> The badger hair is very soft; you would have to have very sensitive skin to find this brush irritating.</li>
            <li> Quite smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> As all the model and cie as long disapear I gest this one should do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Bit of a subjective thing, but there is no need to blow big $$$ on a brush, imo, as the returns are minimal to nil.</li>
            <li> I recently (as of last September) started wet shaving.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a long time and a lot of shaves!  </li>
            <li> The hairs are not as soft or and the head is not full as my other badger.  </li>
            <li> I recently went &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; and bought this item along with a double edge razor (Merkur heavy duty) and Proraso soap.</li>
            <li> He loves it and says it&#x27;s high quality but sometimes sheds &amp; loses hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t lost a single hair in all this time.  </li>
            <li> The brush is a little smaller than what I expected (especially the handle), and this is why I am deducting one star.</li>
            <li> Being new to wet shaving I have to remind myself not to press too hard</li>
            <li> It only lost a few hairs at beginning of use.</li>
            <li> but I am not an expert on wet shaving yet either,</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending so much money on the shaving creams and razor blades.</li>
            <li> While the base is &amp;#34;faux&amp;#34; ivory, it looks quite nice and seems to be carved and finished</li>
            <li> Compared to my boar head brush, I&#x27;d say that they both equally stuck my face with their sharp little hairs.  </li>
            <li> although you have to slow down and make multiple passes instead of \\&quot;slap - dap - done\\&quot; that is possible with the cartridge razor system.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this brush for it&#x27;s small size which I expected  would match smaller and hands and face of a person 5 feet tall.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked to see how much more lather this brush would create over my previous boar hair brush.  </li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than some of the other badger hair brushes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product, like all products I purchase on Amazon, based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have to compare this brush to my other badger brush, which came from an $80 kit, and my boar hair brush.  </li>
            <li> No hot water, soaking 5 min before use, rince, shake for removing water and hang on the stand work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have four other brushes to compare it with including a high-end brush by Rooney.  </li>
            <li> but after that I have not seen any other hair loss.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave every day, usually every 2-3 days, so it&#x27;s not even getting a daily workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This brush beats all the other brushes that I had used over the years hands down.    </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t want to have a large stand or a bunch of unnecessary things with me to shave!</li>
            <li> only negative about this product is that the handle could be just a bit longer.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that I find it to be a bit lacking in weight.</li>
            <li> that ruins your brush.  </li>
            <li> Then it started to lose a couple of hairs per day; then several hairs per day; then at least a dozen hairs per day.  </li>
            <li> The blades are MUCH less expensive, and I have found that the shave is also much closer...</li>
            <li> The foam and gel from a can that can be found in every supermarket contain chemical rubbish which is very bad for your skin, especially after the first pass when your pours are open.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps someone out there that is deciding on getting serious about shaving properly.  </li>
            <li> Like the subject line says.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It works well for face lathering too, as its not super floppy.&lt;br /&gt;The little stand works well and is unobtrusive.  </li>
            <li> I am a woman, and quite frankly, if we get down to it, there are quite a few faces to one leg.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lost a few hairs as expected, but not many.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to spend hundreds of dollars, just be sensible, and do a little research.  </li>
            <li> Purchased badger instead of boar because my husband uses cream rather than soap and it was recommended for a little softer bristle for cream use.</li>
            <li> You see a lot of these brands on web sites with different model numbers, so it&#x27;s sort of tough to compare them before buying.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, don&#x27;t waste your time buying anything else except a bagder brush.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t cut corners and try to save a few cents buying crappy soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is dramatically diffident than my $10 omega boar brush.</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t remember the particulars now, it seems that the Edwin Jagger web site did a poor to non-existent job of comparing their different products.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been shaving with this brush for a few months now and thought I&#x27;d leave a review.</li>
            <li> I was tired of buying cheaper brushes only to have them fall apart within a year.</li>
            <li> brush looses an occasional hair which can be either a sign of poor quality or misuse.</li>
            <li> (there is no seam that one would see on a cheap, injection molded, plastic base).</li>
            <li> He has had for about a month now, uses everyday</li>
            <li> Perhaps the bristles are too stiff and I should have gone with a softer brush</li>
            <li> The brush will hold a large amount of lather and it just won&#x27;t quit, so for the price I find it very difficult to beat.</li>
            <li> Am shocked at how big a difference it has made to the overall quality of my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> For me, that is at least once each week to week and a half.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if that is a technique issue or a brush issue.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and had a very faint smell that cleared up after a couple of shaves.     </li>
            <li> ONLY complaint is that the brush, unfortunately, smelled awful when I first got it wet.</li>
            <li> Any softer and it would be hard to work in the lather and stand up my beard.  </li>
            <li> Really hard to lather as the hair are splinting in all direction</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s me being to hard on the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact anything softer than this might be hard to lather up efficiently.</li>
            <li> additionally, for this quality of hair and knot size, i would recommend at least a $5 price drop.</li>
            <li> I knew to go with badger hair from all my research on DE &amp; wet shaving, but picking the quality of badger hair from the 4 types of badger hair qualities was difficult.</li>
            <li> : the brush work, I mean i can lather on my hand or my bowl.</li>
            <li> Nothing serious</li>
            <li> It is not good for the brush.</li>
            <li> And finaly the hair sting, if you skin is irritate by an agressive razor or you want to do face lathering it could irritating.</li>
            <li> this one is too thin to use, I will try another.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the expensive ones yet</li>
            <li> The stand is simplistic and will probably get a fancier one to hold brush, shaver and bowl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m I wrong ?</li>
            <li> I bought this to take on vacations and find it to be softer than my expensive silver-tip brush.  </li>
            <li> Yes but also very expensive.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make it anymore :(</li>
            <li> Cartridges are EXPENSIVE!!!      </li>

            <li> I ordered a medium size brush that the item description said it was 4.8 inches in length. The brush I received was only 3 3/4 inches in length. Quite smaller than I expected. The box did have the correct item number. I have it a 3 star rating because of the above reason</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than some of the other badger hair brushes.  I haven&#x27;t used the expensive ones yet but this does just fine for me.  I have noticed a stray hair ever shave or two but I know that will be normal over the course of use.</li>
            <li> Love the badger hair brush, it is test I ever owned in the last 80 years. Smooth and stays wet.</li>
            <li> This brush gives an amazing lather. Using it, I&#x27;ve been able to get my best shave ever.  Now, I am new to wetshaving, and this is only my second brush. It is a HUGE step up from a boar brush. I can&#x27;t compare it to other good-quality brushes, but from what I&#x27;ve read online, it is as good as brushes many times more expensive.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years now. Outstanding and worth every $</li>
            <li> I got this brush as a Christmas present.  I used it twice so far and love it.  I love the feel of the badger hair on my face.  I have been using brushes to mix shaving cream/soap/gel for about 10 years now, but this is my first badger brush.  This brush beats all the other brushes that I had used over the years hands down.    I would highly recomend a badger brush to someone who is thinking of purchasing a brush.  To me, the cost of the brush good.  I have seen more expensive and cheaper brushes on the internet.  You have to decide which one you would like to buy according to your budget.    In my opinion, don&#x27;t waste your time buying anything else except a bagder brush.  Spend a little more the fist time and you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a great shave for years.    For me, if I need to buy a brush again, it&#x27;s going to be a badger brush..........</li>
            <li> Bought this about a month ago and have used it every day since with Proraso shave soap and cream and could not be happier.Wish I had done this sooner.Went back to DE shaving a couple years ago with 34c Merkur razor with Shark blades.I had used only Proraso cream and lathered up with my hands.This was just ok but with the brush..it&#x27;s magnificent.This is a very nice brush..haven&#x27;t lost a hair which is more than I can say for myself!</li>
            <li> I have had badger hair brushes for over 20 years. One thing is that I found was that the brushes lost hair when used. This brush performs great, feels good, and has no hair loss.  I expect many many good years of service.</li>
            <li> Husband is very happy with this.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps someone out there that is deciding on getting serious about shaving properly.  Its simple, get a good brush and a good cake of soap.  You don&#x27;t have to spend hundreds of dollars, just be sensible, and do a little research.  I stated out with a cheap brush (about $7) and fell for some soap that some people make and sell from basic ingredients and scented oils but they know NOTHING about shaving soap.  First, when they try to tell you not to expect much lather from their soap, and that is normal, well.... it just ain&#x27;t true.  You need to spend a little more and get a cake of some really good soap.  I use Edwin Jagger soap in my mug and with the proper brush, you can get loads of lather. The soap is about $8 on here.  Don&#x27;t cut corners and try to save a few cents buying crappy soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Edwin Jagger Traditional English Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush.  Ya, its gonna cost you about 40 bucks, but its worth every penny. More expensive, higher quality badger brushes are mostly too soft to work up a good lather, and cheaper ones loose the hairs almost from day one, and you don&#x27;t want those on your face when your razor will just slide over them and not shave you.  Its not necessary to use really hot water either.  It is not good for the brush. No one ever saw a badger taking a hot bath, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the rest of your \\&quot;kit\\&quot; that is less important in my opinion.  I found a nice old mug on one of the auction sites.  For my razor, I like the the Gillette brand 3 blade type.  They seem to work well on my beard and are a good middle of the road price range.  I can use one for a month or more before replacing it with this combination of brush and soap.  Bottom line is, trust this English company that has been manufacturing quality products for many years, they have a long tradition to live up to and prices are fair on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative about this product is that the handle could be just a bit longer. Just another half an inch would make it far more comfortable to use in the mug and on your face.would make it far more comfortable to use in the mug and on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush almost daily for two years.  Well worth the money.  I haven&#x27;t lost a single hair in all this time.  The comfort and lather is amazing.  Once every six months, I soak it in a warm bath of 2 cups of water and 2 tbsp of boraxo to thoroughly wash it it out and restore the bristles to their most absorptive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush now for about six months and it is just simply a flat out great product. It is soft enough to face lather with, holds just the right amount of water and has enough backbone to tackle anything you throw at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first badger brush purchase, but since then I&#x27;ve acquired multiple Shavemac silvertips and a handful of more expensive brushes. After thorough experimentation, this is still my favorite brush. While not quite as soft as the silvertips, it&#x27;s size and density are perfect. With a few of the larger silvertips I have to use a significant amount of product and the results aren&#x27;t that much different. After a generous three pass shave there&#x27;s still plenty of lather in this baby and it has just enough splay to really massage your face but not lose lather integrity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve since sold all but one silvertip.....and my trusty EJ is my goto brush. You can spend more money, but this is just simply a wonderful product that is perfect right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Well-made, holder is attractive enough for the bathroom sink and bristles are sturdy and except for a few at the beginning when I began to use it, they don&#x27;t fall out.  This is clearly a superior product and I expect it to last many many years.</li>
            <li> Like the subject line says.  Spend the money on this brush.  It lost about four hairs on the first lather but hasn&#x27;t lost a hair since.  This brush lifts my beard and helps create a rich, foamy lather.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really great product purchased for my son! He loves it and says it&#x27;s high quality but sometimes sheds &amp; loses hair. Great transaction!</li>
            <li> My title explains it pretty well. I haven&#x27;t tried this bursh w/ a cream yet, but for a soap puck, it does pretty well. I don&#x27;t think it is dramatically diffident than my $10 omega boar brush. I guess I could have gotten along fine w/ just the boar, but I wanted to try something more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your boar and buy better soap if your budget conscience. If not it&#x27;s a nice brush that&#x27;s nice looking.</li>
            <li> Very  nice  feeling brush. Excellent hair density can sometimes  make it feel a touch took rough on the skin but it is very minor and will get used to it  quickly.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I went back to a brush and soap shave.  So much better, and this brush is great.</li>
            <li> Great brush .....enjoy using it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;The holder fits nicely under the sink in the cabinet.....</li>
            <li> This is about the 3rd or 4th of these brushes that I&#x27;ve bought, but the first of this brand. It works much better than the previous brands that I&#x27;ve had. It was somewhat smaller than I was expecting, but works fine. You see a lot of these brands on web sites with different model numbers, so it&#x27;s sort of tough to compare them before buying. Although I can&#x27;t remember the particulars now, it seems that the Edwin Jagger web site did a poor to non-existent job of comparing their different products. But then that&#x27;s their web-weenies fault...the product was great.</li>
            <li> Also used in the shower display, this shaving brush appeals to&lt;br /&gt;gentlemen who would purchase the type of shower depicted in this showroom setting.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this brush is as good of a brush as any of the more expensive brushes. It only lost a few hairs at beginning of use. It is soft and holds soap well.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush. If you want a brush for every day practical use this is the best one out there.</li>
            <li> Full size brushes are available at the same price and they really deliver a better lather. Ordered this brush for it&#x27;s small size which I expected  would match smaller and hands and face of a person 5 feet tall.  It is not any advantage and the bristles don&#x27;t give as nice a lather as some other brushes for the same cost. I will use it for travel.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush (just switched to wet shaving with a safety razor after 30 years of cartridge shaving), so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it seems well-made and works great. The brush holds lots of water and lather. My only gripe would be that the imitation ivory handle doesn&#x27;t actually look like ivory. It&#x27;s just a solid cream color. I prefer ivory with some natural striping. There also seems to be quite a bit of shedding, and while this is supposed to be normal I will have to monitor it to see if it stops or continues over time. This was a great first brush purchase that didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> This brush is a perfect match for the Jagger Aloe shaving soap. There are cheaper brushes on the market this one is a firm, plush brush that will make you glad you bought it. The brush holder is a simple but adequate device that allows the brush to drain and dry after use.</li>
            <li> Been using this now for over 6 months.  Still provides a comfortable lather. Has   not lost more than a couple of bristles   in all this time.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best brush I&#x27;ve used. It is 100% Badger. The fibers stay together rather than flare out like so many other brushes tend to do. Makes a great lather that remains through at least three passes. The drip stand actually has a sticky pad on the back if you wish to mount it to the wall, which I have done since it frees the other hand from having to hold the stand while removing the brush for use.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brush.  It has a nice weighted handle, and the size of the bristles are great.  They are not too soft and limp and not hard either.  Just right, both for cream and for soap.  And it is a quality product.    The bristles are soft and had a very faint smell that cleared up after a couple of shaves.     Highly recommended, and not just for beginners!!!</li>
            <li> I should say my husband loves the quality of this shaving brush. He says it gives him a really good shave.</li>
            <li> this is a good, hard working brush, well made, and easy to use. however, it lost a lot of hair the first time i used it, and still hasn&#x27;t stopped shedding. additionally, for this quality of hair and knot size, i would recommend at least a $5 price drop. oh, and the included plastic stand it just rubbish, and should not be considered a benefit when comparing this product to others that do not have a stand.</li>
            <li> awesome brush feels great on my face you can definitely compare its quality to the ones over $100. check this article out    [...]</li>
            <li> I bought this product, like all products I purchase on Amazon, based on other reviews. This was my first shaving brush and I am thoroughly satisfied with initial build quality. The accompanying stand is adequate in holding the brush when not in use or drying. It has a simple circular sticker on the back to stick on the bathroom wall or mirror or wherever you&#x27;re going to keep your brush. I leave mine on the bathroom counter so I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;The bristle quality is very good; it is effective for creating a great foam and exfoliating your face. Water retention is also very good. After soaking completely, I shake off the excess and add a little at a time if necessary. I&#x27;ve used it with Taylor of Old Bond Street soaps, Mama Bear scented shaving pucks and VDH pucks. I&#x27;ve found that it does a great job creating lather. The size of the loft is adequate and the bristles are well packed. They also retain heat well, even while applying on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this brush and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great brush at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome !  It&#x27;s lost a few hairs as expected, but not many.  It&#x27;s getting better the more I use it and works great for lathering both creams and soaps.  Very satisfied !</li>
            <li> The brush is soft.  Quality is high.  It&#x27;s nice to have the stand if you want to keep it inverted.  I&#x27;ve used my brush for several years and have had no problems at all with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the price.  Lost 8-10 hairs on the first use and none since.</li>
            <li> My husband is really into the zen of shaving every morning and this has become his favorite brush so soft!</li>
            <li> This brush and stand are perfect for my line of work. I&#x27;m gone a lot so I don&#x27;t want to have a large stand or a bunch of unnecessary things with me to shave! This does the job. Not to mention the brush is also great at lathering and feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after reading reviews and am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;This is a soft brush yet makes a great lather and feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> This was my first brush, it very nice and very soft. With that said I do wish it had a little more back bone to it. It works very well and is a great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I am liking it more and more, now that it is broken in.</li>
            <li> For the price, I could not ask for a better brush. I&#x27;ve handled some higher prices brushes and I&#x27;d say this is right there with them. Holds heat well, and I get a nice lather. I will definitely be purchasing another of these in the future.</li>
            <li> I have to compare this brush to my other badger brush, which came from an $80 kit, and my boar hair brush.  The hairs are not as soft or and the head is not full as my other badger.  Compared to my boar head brush, I&#x27;d say that they both equally stuck my face with their sharp little hairs.  However, at this point, my boar head brush is softer and doesn&#x27;t stick my face anymore, but I think this is just a product of using it more often.  I guess I just expected a soft badger brush out of the box.  As for hair loss, I think I&#x27;ve lost maybe 1/2 dozen hairs after maybe a dozen shaves.  I assume that this brush will soften over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this brush to a friend?  No.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the money. Works as described and easy to use. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable brush that will hang with the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> New to DE shaving and this brush just whips up a great lather. I wanted to get a decent brush that can with a drip stand, and this fit the bill. Very smooth to the face, and lifted the hairs for a great close shave. I would reccommend this to anyone who wanted a great brush.</li>
            <li> Soap and brush is what I learned to shave with. With the rising cost of blades and the ludicris number of blades on them I felt this would be the right time to go old school. This particular brush is of very good quality only lost 4 or so strands and continues to get softer with every use. Creates a nice lather and stays with the bristles to evenly spread all across my face. The stand is simplistic and will probably get a fancier one to hold brush, shaver and bowl. Would have given 5 stars if stand was better. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Goad water absorbs water well, looks great and creates a great lather. A fitting brush for a beginner into shaving.</li>
            <li> Very soft, creates a great lather with the Taylor of Old Bond Street Jermyn Street shaving cream I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Let it soak for 20 minutes before first use improved it&#x27;s ability to lather. Don&#x27;t judge it until after you have used it a week. Starts out good and just gets better and better.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see how much more lather this brush would create over my previous boar hair brush.  Very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been shaving with this brush for a few months now and thought I&#x27;d leave a review. For a best badger hair brush this was reasonably priced, and I have found the performance to be excellent. I tend to whip my lather very hard and this brush takes it just fine. I have lost a few hairs, but that is to be expected when breaking in any brush, and it will produce a great lather in relatively little time. It holds a substantial amount of shaving cream(enough for 8+ passes, more that you would ever need). While it&#x27;s not quite silvertip soft, I found this brush to be very gentle and enjoyable, especially compared to anything else in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I find it to be a bit lacking in weight. Humans tend to associate heaviness with quality, which isn&#x27;t necessarily true, but I just love something that feels substantial in your hands, and this brush is a bit lacking in this category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone starting out brush lathering their shaving cream, or making a first upgrade from horse or boar hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush along with my purchase of the Edwin Jagger DE89L razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good high end \\&quot;Best Badger\\&quot; grade shaving brush. Whips up a rich lather and holds its shape well.&lt;br /&gt;This grade of badger is supposed to be softer than a \\&quot;Pure Badger\\&quot; grade brush and a tad stiffer than the \\&quot;Silvertip Badger\\&quot; grade. I wanted to get a bit more scrub on the whiskers to get the shave cream under the whiskers and raise them up. I would have liked the handle to be a bit longer, but it&#x27;s the same size as a medium-size brush should be. The price seemed reasonable compared to other brands of brushes. I have only been using this brush for about a month now, so I can&#x27;t comment about the longevity of this particular brush.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for over 40 years.  That&#x27;s a long time and a lot of shaves!  I started out many years ago with a shaving mug, a cake of soap and a double edge razor.  Over the years, I dabbled with electric razors, but I always felt that the shave was not as close as with a razor with an actual blade.  For many years now, I have used cartridge razors.  They are handy, work well with shaving creams available in just about all department/grocery stores, and rarely produce nicks or cuts... if you change cartridges relatively regularly.  For me, that is at least once each week to week and a half.  Cartridges are EXPENSIVE!!!      I recently switched back to double edge razor shaving.  The blades are MUCH less expensive, and I have found that the shave is also much closer... although you have to slow down and make multiple passes instead of \\&quot;slap - dap - done\\&quot; that is possible with the cartridge razor system.  I purchased the shaving brush to increase the luxury of the shave - a luxury that I can well afford with the elimination of the expense of the cartridges that I no longer have to fork $$$ out for.  This particular brush is much nicer feeling and produces better lather than the brush I used many years ago.  I attribute that to the badger bristles used in this brush instead of the boar bristles that my old brush used.  My face is well hydrated with the lather produced with this brush (and a Crabtree &amp; Evelyn shaving cream) and the razor glides smoothly and leaves a silky smooth aftermath.    I have been using the Edwin Jagger Best Badger shaving brush for 2 weeks now - and a single DE razor blade - and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  A very close shave, a luxurious lather, and a pleasant experience now that I have slowed down to actually enjoy the experience.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I was quite impressed by the quality of the build of this brush. It&#x27;s soft, but just firm enough to be comfortable and do its job efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint is that the brush, unfortunately, smelled awful when I first got it wet. This is always a temporary problem with almost any Brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It sheds a bit more than expected and the stand looks and feel cheap.</li>
            <li> I only recently went back to shaving with a traditional double edge razor (Edwin Jagger DE89 paired with a iKon Bulldog handle) and that required getting a brush, bowl, shaving cream, etc...  After shopping around I learned that the Edwin Jagger name is synonymous with top notch shaving products, and I rolled the dice on this brush.  At $50 for a brush I thought it better be really good!  And I was not disappointed.  It is a Best badger brush so the bristles by definition are a little firmer then a Pure brush, but honestly this brush is as soft as I would use.  Any softer and it would be hard to work in the lather and stand up my beard.  This brush for me is a perfect combination of smooth silkiness with just enough backbone to make it functional.  I have this brush paired with a classic stone shaving bowl, and this combination makes tons of creamy lather in no time flat.  If you want to treat yourself, whip up some lather with this brush and work it into your beard for 1-2 minutes before shaving.  Followed by a nice clean shave and a hot cup of coffee, it is the perfect way to start any day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah I don&#x27;t really like it. I know a ton of person enjoy it I&#x27;m I wrong ? I buy it to replace an old 12 years of service shaving brush. As all the model and cie as long disapear I gest this one should do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: this brush as no backbone. Really hard to lather as the hair are splinting in all direction and you don&#x27;t want to broke them. The handle is verry little and at first use I feel like doing micropainting with the tip of your finger, this is not viril at all. And finaly the hair sting, if you skin is irritate by an agressive razor or you want to do face lathering it could irritating. For bowl lathering you should consider a short bowl as this handle is short. The one from capitain choice is amazing, highly recommanded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: the brush work, I mean i can lather on my hand or my bowl. The stand is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have any probleme about loosing hair. I lost 4 in 7 shave. No hot water, soaking 5 min before use, rince, shake for removing water and hang on the stand work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommand it to my friend. I would say try a Semogue boar 620 or 830.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a brush that would match as close a possible to a set that my brother-in-law has. The brush was a gift for him. He really likes it.</li>
            <li> This was my first shave brush and for that purpose this brush was a luxurious start. The best badger hair soaks up a tremendous amount of water with one of the softest lofts I have used.  It is easy to work up a very thick bowl lather with this brush, however you can expect occasional shedding due to its relatively loosely packed knot. The best badger hair as I mentioned is VERY soft. This brush will not perform very well with shaving soaps as it does not really have much of a backbone. The brush will hold a large amount of lather and it just won&#x27;t quit, so for the price I find it very difficult to beat. I would definitely recommend getting a nice inexpensive boar brush and break it in to use soaps.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectation&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I truly don&#x27;t see why you would need to spend more for a higher quality type of badger hair brush.  This one is seriously awesome and I have had no problems with it.  I use it almost daily.  Of course the more expensive ones will continue to sell well because to some people, the price doesn&#x27;t matter.  If you&#x27;re trying to find a good brush that you can be proud to own, but you&#x27;re also being budget conscious...this is a great option.</li>
            <li> I was tired of buying cheaper brushes only to have them fall apart within a year. I have only had this brush for a month but have seen no hair loss and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for 6 months and it works great. No noticable hair lose. This was exactly what I was looking for. a reasonably priced good quality brush to replace my very old brush. My favorite soap was evelyn &amp; crabtree almond oil hard dish soap. They don&#x27;t make it anymore :(</li>
            <li> This brush gets better after a short break-in period.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now.  It holds water really well.  I would recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shed hairs like cheaper brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Soft.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs just the right amount of moisture for a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;(I use it w/ Taylor of Old Bond shaving cream)</li>
            <li> Nice, quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a year and a half.  Perfect size, lather. Bought another for a gift to my son.</li>
            <li> This brush is an excellent choice for those that stick to or that are getting back to the origins and the pleasure of a traditional shave. The better the brush the more water and heat it will retain and thus will make you a better lather in a short time, so it is worthy to spend a few more dollars in a quality brush like this one. This brush will offer you a gentle and pleasurable face massage and exfoliation every morning, preparing the road for a superb shave.&lt;br /&gt;Of course with the help of the brush you will also want to apply the lather from shaving soap , not gel or foam from a cheap can. The foam and gel from a can that can be found in every supermarket contain chemical rubbish which is very bad for your skin, especially after the first pass when your pours are open. I therefore recommend you use this brush with Proraso shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Purchased badger instead of boar because my husband uses cream rather than soap and it was recommended for a little softer bristle for cream use. The quality of handle and bristles are very nice and it was a well received gift for a man that shaves 3-4 a week</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush, so I don&#x27;t have a point of comparison, but other reviewers seem to focus on how much hair brushes lose. I can say this one occasionally has 1 or 2 hairs fall out, sometimes none at all. So it seems like a very high quality brush.</li>
            <li> I would rate this brush as just OK due to its very small size. To me it is more suitable as a \\&quot;travel brush.\\&quot; I would recommend the Parker 100% Pure Badge brush instead. It is twice the size, holds twice the water and is just as soft and is less expensive.[[ASIN:B002RJC1HC Parker Safety Razor 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand]]</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush.  I was skeptical if a brush would really make a difference and found IT REALLY DOES!!!  This particular brush is well made and I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great brush!  I bought this to take on vacations and find it to be softer than my expensive silver-tip brush.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been straight-razor shaving for a couple of years now and had so far never been able to make a proper lather using the cheapo boar brush I bought for about $8 or so at Whole Foods—whether using shaving soap or shaving cream (of various brands, cheap and expensive). With this shaving brush, the lather (using Taylor Jermyn Street shaving cream) was thick and rich the very first time out of the gate. I can&#x27;t compare this shaving brush to the many more expensive options out there, but upgrading from a cheap non-badger brush has bee absolutely worth it for me. Highly recommended. The brush did smell a bit upon first wetting. I got rid of the smell by lathering it up once a day and leaving it dry (with the lather still on it) for 24hrs for a few days the first week. No complaints.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome brush. I would give it 5 but, I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent badger brush feels good on my face and I believe I will get years of service out of the brush</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush. I have been using it for 5 months now, as my beginning into DE shaving.  The brush is high quality, hand knotted in Sheffield England. It feels soft and smooth on your face and beard and shaving is now a luxury for me, not just a daily chore, the brush softens the hair and works great, you can feel the exfoliation effects...now I know why my wife loves facials.  The included stand is very nice and matches perfectly, I am very happy with the stand included. If you want pretty chrome and want to spend buy one, after all this is a bathroom counter accessory. A stand is a must to let your brush air dry properly, with the brush tips down, and you never want to rest the brush on it&#x27;s bristles, so even during shaving flip it over to rest it on the counter, once dry completely you can invert your brush on its&#x27; top for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to choose a shave brush? I knew to go with badger hair from all my research on DE &amp; wet shaving, but picking the quality of badger hair from the 4 types of badger hair qualities was difficult. Better hair is better right? Yes but also very expensive. Well being new to wet shaving I did not want to ruin a very expensive brush, so I eliminated the top two qualities and targeted the best quality brush I could find under $60.  This brush was about $45 included a stand and was Best Badger. That was the easy winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also choose a rounded brush over a staight brush, because it would cover more of my face faster, and provide more surface area. The medium size is ideal for my average size face. I lather up in 4 quadrants to keep the face lather wet, a good wet lather is important to a good and comfortable shave. Once you finish a quadrant rinse and move to the next area. Come back at the end and go over any areas you missed, short hairs left, or better yet redo the whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brush looses an occasional hair which can be either a sign of poor quality or misuse. As I became more experienced, the hair loss from the brush is much less. Maybe one hair a week, it is still a lot but I am not an expert on wet shaving yet either, so for the price and inexperience I think that&#x27;s me being to hard on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take care of this brush it should last many years. Being new to wet shaving I have to remind myself not to press too hard so I don&#x27;t ruin the brush tips...that ruins your brush.  I bought a quality shave cream - Taylor of Old Bond also from Amazon. I started lathering with an old mug, but I was banging the top of the brush annoying my wife and not getting a good lather. I now use a small Pyrex bowl to lather up and that works great, lots of room and I get a great lather....spending a minute to gently work up a good lather is well worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush it will sit next to the Jagger 98l DE razor I bought as my first DE razor for many years.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than you might expect if you are used to a large size brush head. However, I find this smaller brush easier to handle, easier to clean, and no less effective. The badger hair is very soft; you would have to have very sensitive skin to find this brush irritating. It is well made. While the base is &amp;#34;faux&amp;#34; ivory, it looks quite nice and seems to be carved and finished (there is no seam that one would see on a cheap, injection molded, plastic base). Comes with a matching drying stand that is essential. Overall, I am not certain that this brush is so much more effective than a cheap boar&#x27;s hair brush that one might get at the drug store as to warrant being ten times the price...but I AM sure this brush will last much longer and it definitely is better at holding water and generating lather..</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving and just upgraded my brush from a pure badger to this best badger hair brush.  From the first moment I put it to my face I felt the difference.  I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other best hair brushes, but I would recommend this to any looking to upgrade.</li>
            <li> My opinion should be taken with a grain of salt. I recently went &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; and bought this item along with a double edge razor (Merkur heavy duty) and Proraso soap. I&#x27;m still learning how to maximize lather. I&#x27;ve gone to lathering up my palm and then applying it to my face as the brush seemed to irritate my face a bit. Nothing serious but my face would be redder after shaving if I applied the lather directly to my face with the brush as opposed to lathering up in my palm and then applying it by hand. Perhaps the bristles are too stiff and I should have gone with a softer brush but, I didn&#x27;t know. I also have an engineering problem with the stand. Notice in the picture that the stand holds the brush at the spot where the bristles enter the handle. When returning the brush to its stand, this always causes a couple or bristles to be pushed or moved around. This will certainly cause the outer edges of the brush to lose shape after a while or even break a few bristles off in time. I think it would be better if the stand were taller and the brush were to hang from the knob at the top so that the bristles are untouched. Otherwise, I am really enjoying the experience. It&#x27;s a pleasurable morning ritual.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to replace his cheapo badger brush. His previous one had hairs falling out left and right. Only a couple have fallen out. He uses this with Proraso Shaving Soap, he loves both. He actually said he looks forward to shaving now.</li>
            <li> Had the brush for 2 months. Creates a great lather and has only lost a few bristles in that time.</li>
            <li> Suggested to be the best one for a beginner. Did not come with the stand, which is quite bad.&lt;br /&gt;Also, black color was not available when I decided to buy, and I would have like black a lot more, but personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great quality brush, but do not expect the silvertip quality as it is not!</li>
            <li> This is not as soft as a silver tip (I have one of those too), but it is easier to load with a shave soap. I prefer the silver tip with creams. Bit of a subjective thing, but there is no need to blow big $$$ on a brush, imo, as the returns are minimal to nil. Spend it on soaps, creams and balms. Or buy your SO a nice dinner.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for about 9 months.  I have four other brushes to compare it with including a high-end brush by Rooney.  I have to say this Edwin Jagger is a superb brush.  It has soft tips.  The bristles have enough backbone that it easily lathers both creams and soaps.  It never had much of a \\&quot;wild animal\\&quot; smell, and whatever smell it had went away within a week of use.  The one negative is the brush shed about a dozen bristles the first two weeks of use.  It continues to shed a bristle every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush as I&#x27;m new to shaving with a DE razor. My first impression is that this brush seems to work up a lather very well, is comfortable to hold, simple to use, and with some basic working instructions appears as if it will last for quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush smelled only upon first getting wet as some have stated, but the smell went away after the first lather. The hairs on this brush not only work up a lather quickly but feel really great on my skin and do the job of standing up my beard hairs for a nice, clean shave well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He has had for about a month now, uses everyday and it still seems new. He has sensitive skin and says it is nice and soft against his skin. Did malt a bit in the beginning but is fine now.  I would say it is worth the price you pay, have bought cheap ones before and have to end up replacing them every couple weeks.</li>
            <li> My husband has a lovely white beard and is very fastidious about shaving. When his old shaving brush fell apart, we decided to upgrade to the English product. He loves it and often remarks how much better it is than his last one, which came from the other side of the Pacific. The drip stand is a real god-send; his old one took two days to dry out properly. When and IF the new brush needs to be replaced, we will certainly buy British again.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush lathers really well. The stand it comes with can be attached to wall surface for easy storing. I bought this with the porcelain shaving bowl as a gift for hubby who shaves his head and face and he is happy with both.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaving brush I have ever purchased since I began using them in 1972. I fully expect this one to not only last the rest of my life, but find good use long after I am gone.</li>
            <li> Great, full, brush that creates and hold a beautiful, thick, lather.  Feels soft against my skin.  A nice brush at a decent price.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving brush I have ever owned, and I have paid much more!  It is luxurious, but stiff enough to raise a rich, wet lather directly on my face using The Body Shop&#x27;s shaving cream.  I love the medium size, which only cost a few dollars more than the small.</li>
            <li> omg very good product but some times the hair will come out from shaving but the over all was good.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush, so I have nothing to compare it to.  That said, I very pleased with the look and feel of it. It performed well in both bowl and face lathering.  It&#x27;s a good, thick brush.</li>
            <li> Ahhhh.....this badger brush is AMAZING! I recently (as of last September) started wet shaving. My first brush was of boar hair, a little too rough, but, I was not to know the difference until I ordered my Edwin Jagger Best Badger brush. I kept researching (I do that a lot before I try anything new) brushes and razors. I am still a big fan of Edwin Jagger razors. The badger brush has proved to be softer, produce a better lather and hold more of the shaving soap. It is a pleasure to use. I actually enjoy shaving now! Not to mention the DE razor blades are so much cheaper! I am a woman, and quite frankly, if we get down to it, there are quite a few faces to one leg. I got tired of spending so much money on the shaving creams and razor blades. Now with my Edwin Jagger brush and DE razor, shaving is a pleasure again!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good shaving brush for travel. Looking to have something that I can face lather with when in hotels. I have another fantastic best badger [[ASIN:B004U6P0NW Parker Safety Razor 100% Best Badger Bristle Shaving Brush -- White &amp; Chrome Handle with Free Stand]] that is wonderful, but the base is heavier than I want to take on frequent business trips and works best when lathering in a bowl. The EJ brush fell short of expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smell-free new, had no issues with many lost bristles, very light weight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: On the slightly too small size, but most concerning was that it got \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; faster than any brush I have used. I found that a cheap old [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] was as firm after several months use (my first shaving brush) than the EJ after less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pure badger brush is as good or better than this EJ. I just got a boar brush [[ASIN:B004OJM9XE Semogue 620 Superior Boar Bristle Shaving Brush]] to see if a brush with a slightly firmer reputation might due the trick for face lathering road trips - will update after a couple of weeks or so. My go-to brush is the Parker Best Badger thus far when looking to spend &lt;$50.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole safety razor, brush and shaving soap ritual.  So with that said, this is my upgrade brush from the Burma boar I&#x27;ve been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The handle is comfortable, high quality, and one piece with no visible mold lines.&lt;br /&gt;The badger hair is soft, and is able to hold a lot of water between the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;It builds great gobs of lather with less effort in the bowl than a boar brush&lt;br /&gt;It works well for face lathering too, as its not super floppy.&lt;br /&gt;The little stand works well and is unobtrusive.  You don&#x27;t have to by a separate stand, nice for a beginner like me looking for a simple set up to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A few hairs lost each day in the first two weeks of use, then it settled down, not to worry there&#x27;s still plenty left in the brush!&lt;br /&gt;An ever so slight animal funk smell at first, there are tricks to get rid of this though and it does fade no matter what after the first 4 or 5 uses even if you don&#x27;t do the pet shampoo/dawn dish detergent prewash.</li>
            <li> this is my first shave brush so I have nothing to compare it to but with that said I like it. the quality of the manufacturing is great. I find that it lathers the shave soap brilliantly. I did have to watch a few you tube videos on how to lather a brush before I was able to get that good slick lather but that was more of operator error than the brush itself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap $8 shaving brushes. You will notice a difference in lathering with a badger brush. A huge difference.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. Holds loads of water. Builds a great lather. Major step up from the synthetic I used. Am shocked at how big a difference it has made to the overall quality of my shaving experience. Prepped with dish washing detergent for 24 hours and then with shampoo for another 24 and did not experience any discernible smell. It&#x27;s supposed to get even better with use so I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and works great. I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about a week (I shave daily) and it&#x27;s only lost a few hairs (less than 10), and they don&#x27;t seem to be coming out any more. Really does make a big difference when compared to just using fingertips...I can build a better lather quicker, and it makes for a closer shave, and feels pretty nice on the face too. There may be better brushes out there that cost more, but for the money I think this is about as good as you can get.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush and after looking at a bunch of reviews I settled with this one. It is not silver badger hair so I am guessing  not as soft as it can be but overall that is not an issue. In fact anything softer than this might be hard to lather up efficiently. The brush is a little smaller than what I expected (especially the handle), and this is why I am deducting one star. If you have large hands this might not be for you. It did loose some hair first time I used it and soaked it but after that I have not seen any other hair loss. The stand is great and the color is really nice. I want to point out that I have seen the more expensive brushes make a much richer lather with less soap. Not sure if that is a technique issue or a brush issue. Even though this is my first brush from all the reviews I have read I would think that overall at this price range it might be as good as it gets. I think the next step would be a brush at the $75 dollar range.</li>
            <li> Contrary to many of the reviews here, my brush has lost more than two dozen bristles in the 45 days I have owned it. I don&#x27;t shave every day, usually every 2-3 days, so it&#x27;s not even getting a daily workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do rinse it and hang it in its stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good brush, not a great brush. I chose it because of the reviews and it was middle-of-the-pack as far as pricing. Maybe I should have gone a step up or down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this one is too thin to use, I will try another.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this brush. It lost a few hairs during the first two shaves, now it is not loosing anything. If you are looking for a quality, handmade badger brush. Look no further! I should enjoy many years of shaving using this brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving brush. I received it as a birthday present from my wife, and all I can say is \\&quot;wow!\\&quot; It whips up a great lather, is not too rough or soft, doesn&#x27;t have a funky animal smell, and is very well balanced.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks now and, literally, it has lost but one hair.  It&#x27;s a very well-made product and helps me get a great, comfortable shave. I am really enjoying the EJ products I&#x27;ve purchased; they are of high quality and provide great bang for the buck. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my son for Christmas.  Just received a text from him saying &amp;#34;the shave set is awesome!&amp;#34;  I would say he is pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Quality is better  than I expected. I&#x27;m more than satisfied with the shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I have had other shaving brushes  some large and some considerably more expensive&lt;br /&gt;and I have find this to be the best.  It is just the right size and whips up a great lather with a minimum of fuss.  The price is eminately resonable.</li>
            <li> great brush, lathers well.</li>
            <li> Not too soft or harsh; provides an excellent balance when applying shaving cream. The included stand was a welcome addition, too!</li>
            <li> So far there&#x27;s been very minimal shedding and the stand, although nothing special, works perfectly in my shower. I wasn&#x27;t used to the softness of the badger as compared to the boar brush I had been using, but the size was great and it creates a very luxurious lather.</li>
            <li> The husband loves it!! Great buy with the mug!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush about a year ago and really liked it at first.  It felt great, smelled good and did a great job whipping up a thick lather.  Then it started to lose a couple of hairs per day; then several hairs per day; then at least a dozen hairs per day.  Now it is a shadow of its former self. I had researched it at various shaving sites and thought it would last many years, but now it can barely whip-up enough lather for one a pass shave.  It still smells good, though.  Think I will try a Parker Best Badger next.  May have to go with something synthetic.</li>
            <li> Great brush, still using this over a year later</li>
            <li> Absolutely a lot better than a brush I spent $25 for, well worth the extra cost I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Bit the bullet and spent more money buying this brush for my husband.  I got him into shaving with a safety razor and got a cheap brush incase he didn&#x27;t like it.  He loves this brush.  He says it&#x27;s way better than the cheap one.  I guess you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Good brush, no shedding, would buy again</li>
            <li> Soft, yet stiff enough to carry the soap or cream. No problem with bristles falling out. A very well made brush, a very good value.</li>
