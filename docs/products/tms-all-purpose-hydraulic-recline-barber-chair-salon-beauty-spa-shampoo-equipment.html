            <li>they are a little bit um incorrect on the bills some things are not in the right spots certain pieces didn&#x27;t fit correctly other than that pretty good chair be careful and take good care of it maintain it or it will fall apart</li>
            <li>I really like to chair</li>
            <li>You guys really came through.</li>
            <li>I guess under the proper lighting conditions you can make anything look better than it is actually constructed.</li>
            <li>chair is nice and sturdy but instructions R a bit confusing</li>
            <li>I ordered eleven chairs for my new shop.</li>

            <li> If you want to wait forever for chairs from china.&lt;br /&gt;Bought 4 chairs none would go together.&lt;br /&gt;Not as described very cheap and cheesy.&lt;br /&gt;You will have to machine the bases so they would go together....really.&lt;br /&gt;RETURNED still waiting on all my refund (2 months endless hours and emails) from Amozon.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible product very poorly made and sold.&lt;br /&gt;Third party will not stand behind product........</li>

            <li> I really like to chair it&#x27;s very comfortable</li>
            <li> good costumer care .. love  it</li>
            <li> Just had to add on more thing. Thank you for helping me with my issue. You guys really came through. As I said before, You guys rock!!!</li>
            <li> Chairs came and were delivered as expected with no real problems. I ordered eleven chairs for my new shop. After that unloading all the boxes I didn&#x27;t take the time to check each box for chair color since I ordered black chairs. After opening the boxes days later when construction was at a point I could put chairs in. I then noticed that I had three red chairs. I didn&#x27;t have the time to even try to send them back. So I made the most out of the mistake. It turned out okay but could have been a huge problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything it describes</li>
            <li> Room for improvement in package</li>
            <li> Chair are wide,nice &amp; comfortable .</li>
            <li> i bought this chair for my husband and put it together so fast it was so easy. you do need some tools like some socket wrenches and a screw driver that would make it easier otherwise you will definitely have trouble. the chair is more comfortable than most chairs at any salon that ive been to. very sturdy and very heavy. this isnt your average lame lightweight computer chair your unlicensed barber uses.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> chair is nice and sturdy but instructions R a bit confusing bought dear is a video on youtube that can help you with this issue quality wise is good for $300 I bet there&#x27;s better but for the money is is good it looks like a $800  chair material wise fabric its good you are going to need a booster seat for the children with this chair make sure you have a tool set you going to need it it&#x27;s comfortable I guess  I could stay there for an hour and not complain this chair has no warranty so make sure you purchase a warranty on Amazon when you purchase this chair is just 20 bucks for 2 years but you could get your money back you got 90 daysI hope this helps</li>
            <li> Really happy with this chair. Came fast and assumable simply.</li>
            <li> Did the bankrupt reach to two pieces and did not the pieces replace to me atrocious attention</li>
            <li> When we assembled it we noticed it was defective...but great in sending replacement</li>
            <li> Not as solid a platform as the photos make it appear.  I guess under the proper lighting conditions you can make anything look better than it is actually constructed.</li>
            <li> These chairs are aweful!  Don&#x27;t buy!  Bought 2 abs neither one was good chairs they lend and didn&#x27;t go together properly</li>
            <li> As a Barber let me tell you how great this chair is. If you are looking for a really confortable barber chair this fits that category perfectly. I been having this chair for quite some time now and I cannot complain how awesome It works. Not only that but all my clients love it as well.</li>
