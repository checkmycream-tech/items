            <li>so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great stuff...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this mostly because it burned my eyes!!  </li>

            <li>My skin has never been more breakout-free!!</li>
            <li>Amazing face wash!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing please give it a try if your having breakouts !</li>
            <li>but it does not do a good job cleaning and leads to clogged pores and breakouts.</li>
            <li>Loreal (youth code foaming gel) makes a great product which is cheaper and cleans much better.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, great packaging, great product... makes my skin feel tighter.  </li>
            <li>I do love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>However, I really liked the Elta sunscreen I got after a Vitalize peel and so thought I&#x27;d try this foaming enzyme cleanser.</li>
            <li>I just decant it into my own dispenser and use that instead.</li>
            <li>Loving the Elta  MD product line</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good just like the foaming version better.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the astounding part #1.</li>
            <li>nice and non greasy.  </li>
            <li>Great at keeping my pores clean but can be a bit drying.  </li>
            <li>version of my story is, I found a GREAT PRODUCT by going to GREAT DOCTOR with old time values.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and is a great product.</li>
            <li>Very light and does not cause break outs.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and it was a good price.</li>
            <li>The astounding part #2 is that it rinses easily</li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>Ask your doctor they can tell you more about this product than I can</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better</li>
            <li>and I can safely say, it is my favourite cleanser ever.</li>
            <li>Cleans your face and leaves smooth skin!</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this brand gets everything off your face without drying.</li>
            <li>Nice gentle cleanser good for my skin wihile</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t lather at all, making me think I needed a lot more than I thought I would need to wash my face -- i.e. about 5 pumps per washing.  </li>
            <li>Magical softness.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face nice and clean without over-drying it.</li>
            <li>Excellent and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin dry.</li>
            <li>I have used many facial cleaners over the years, and this one is absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve used for makeup removal.</li>
            <li>This may work fine for those not on these meds.</li>
            <li>A simple flick up spout (like Mario Badescu) or flip up top (like most shampoo bottles) would be a MUCH better choice.</li>
            <li>I first got introduced to EltaMD at this spa where I would get my microdermabrasion treatments 3 years ago, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>This cleanser replenishes and sends me to bed with a smile on my face!</li>
            <li>My  face feels and looks CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a problem with blackheads for years and tried many products but this one works and fast.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m just in my mid-twenties, I&#x27;ve gone through my fair share of different face cleansing products.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not a bad deal for the price.</li>
            <li>I have mildly oily skin, and this is supposed to be for all skin types.  </li>
            <li>Discovered this face wash thru my dermatologist when I was four months pregnant.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, MANY cleansers over the years, high end and cheap drugstore brands, from Dior and Demalogica to Cetaphil and Ponds,  to help my combination, sensitive and now aging skin.</li>
            <li>It takes off every last bit of makeup from my face (even eye makeup) and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and most importantly, CLEAN!</li>
            <li>leave face feeling nice but not dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from Neutrogena, Cetaphil, Aveeno, japanese face washes, scrubs, and MORE!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve starting using this amazing product about a month ago</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every</li>
            <li>nice pump action don&#x27;t give you to much at one time.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing products- truly gentle enough to clean, never dries my face .</li>
            <li>and all is right in the world...</li>
            <li>Makeup comes right off.</li>
            <li>It really makes my face feel clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>almost none actually..I have decent combination skin, prone to white heads, and this works great for my skin type, my husband has clear more dry skin and it works fantastic on him too..</li>
            <li>This has a slightly different pump head than the one I bought six months ago or so, but same great</li>
            <li>The most recent was Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>My skin wasn&#x27;t getting better and yet the prescription stayed the same.</li>
            <li>This is a good brand (I use their sunscreen), but this cleanser was way too harsh for me.  </li>
            <li>and my skin feels delightfully soft and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>This allows me to use less makeup and show the world more of my natural skin. :)</li>
            <li>I rarely, if ever, get breakouts, and my skin feels really clean afterwards, if a teensy bit dry -</li>
            <li>This cleanser really gets my makeup off at the end of the day, even my eye makeup, but I have found it to be a bit drying.</li>
            <li>It is non-drying and it really helps my face with flaking I have since I use Trentenoin.</li>
            <li>I wear so much ).  </li>
            <li>Really should try it .</li>
            <li>Even though this cleanser seemed to remove makeup very well, it didn&#x27;t rinse well.  </li>
            <li>Slightly more drying than I expected considering my oily skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for over two years and it really cleans deep without scrubbing, which is so much better for sensitive or problem skin.</li>
            <li>This face wash lathers well on my clarisonic brush and has a low, clean scent,</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin, especially sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>A half pump will take off about 90% of my makeup and the rest (mostly around the eyes)</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different cleansers for the last 20 or so years; this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>It really helps to clear skin of pimples !</li>
            <li>Nice product similar in consistency to other dermatologist recommended products like Cetaphyl.</li>
            <li>I am using a few of EltaMD&#x27;s products and am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>product is thick and lathers up nicely when applied.</li>
            <li>(if you wear foundation or blusher) rinsing off and there&#x27;s usually no hint of make up residue on the cotton ball when I tone afterwards.  </li>
            <li>remove eye makeup with some jojoba oil -- wear very little foundation most of the time -- then wet my skin slightly and apply this to cleanse -- use a warm washcloth to remove it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate me but cleans well.</li>
            <li>My face has completely cleared up, haven&#x27;t gotten a break out since, and removes my make up with just one wash.</li>
            <li>It cleans my skin and leaves it soft....</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it seems like cleansers either make my face feel like it&#x27;s an itchy, cracking dessert,</li>
            <li>I have tried several and they all work very well.</li>
            <li>I have soft water at home</li>
            <li>Not harsh or abrasive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d expect a product like this to retail at $50, so while $20 is kind of expensive, it&#x27;s worth it and will last me around 3 months.</li>
            <li>They are not too expensive (for me), and work so good on your skin.</li>
            <li>Not much product is required and the pump lets out just about the right amount.</li>
            <li>I have horrible adult acne and very oil skin, but this line works perfectly for me</li>
            <li>New fan of EltaMD products and this facial cleanser does not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>, At first, I thought I just had a faulty bottle, but the same happened on the 2nd and 3rd.</li>
            <li>The only cleanser that cleans and preserves the natural qualities in my skin.</li>
            <li>I wear heavy liquid foundation every day, so I need something really powerful at night to take off my makeup.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t over dry and helps with breakouts, highly recomend this, no needed eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>He recommended Elta MD Facial Cleanser and Elta MD UV Facial SPF 30+ Lotion which he sold in his office for convenience but told me I could find it cheaper by going on Amazon (it&#x27;s not everyday you run into a doctor like this).</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t be surprised if your skin is a tiny bit dry.</li>

            <li> It also seemed to really dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin - dry on the cheeks and oily chin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not enough to stop me buying it - just a little niggle.</li>
            <li> it is really drying out my face and causing me to break out with a lot of pimples and i am not happy about that...</li>
            <li> Only use it when I wear heavy make up.</li>
            <li> However, it was overly drying, and after just five days using it, I have dry, scaly skin all around my eyes that isn&#x27;t going away!!  </li>
            <li> and I mean only a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> My skin was horrible , my dermalogica special cleansing gel was not cutting it anymore.</li>
            <li> I like it because my face doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, tight or dry after using.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product and any other EltaMD products..</li>
            <li> decided to try another doctor and he took me off all the meds the other doctor had me use.</li>
            <li> no need to explain I threw down the toilet a waste of money for sure///</li>
            <li> For years I had to make the an appointment costing $150  dollar for a less than a 5 minute visit just to get another prescription.</li>
            <li> have been dealing with little breakouts since puberty</li>
            <li> After just a few uses, the pump clogs up</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use any harsh cleansers to tame my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not many products can do that.</li>
            <li> Sadly this is too drying for my face - my face turned blotchy red after using it.</li>
            <li> No more blotchy towels and pillow cases.</li>
            <li> For a while I was using hand soap to wash my face because it didn&#x27;t seem much different than the expensive cleansers I was purchasing at the time.</li>
            <li> and I had to use my usual Cetaphil to remove the cleanser residue.  </li>
            <li> Considering the cleanser is designed to foam, it seems a poor choice of dispenser.</li>
            <li> but I think the poor rinsing will still be a problem.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t see the need for even the faint orange scent at all, Hasn&#x27;t been irritating to my skin though</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have any of those problems anymore with my skin or making expensive appointments and buying expensive</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nigh-on impossible to get the cleanser out</li>
            <li> I took a star off the product because the bottle it comes in is absolutely TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me when I broke out with a horrible face wash!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great at keeping my pores clean but can be a bit drying.  I&#x27;ve had a problem with blackheads for years and tried many products but this one works and fast.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I also send my friends as gift. They love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial cleanser for years. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate me but cleans well.</li>
            <li> This cleanser really gets my makeup off at the end of the day, even my eye makeup, but I have found it to be a bit drying. I have combination/oily skin and when I use this it makes my dry areas drier. Not many products can do that.</li>
            <li> only facial cleanser my doctor recommends!</li>
            <li> Ask your doctor they can tell you more about this product than I can but it works for me.</li>
            <li> I am using a few of EltaMD&#x27;s products and am so pleased with the results. My skin has never looked better</li>
            <li> I do love this product! It really makes my face feel clean and refreshed.  You only need to use a tiny amount, so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my doctor about Elta MD foaming cleanser and I&#x27;ve starting using this amazing product about a month ago and I&#x27;m in love!! My face has completely cleared up, haven&#x27;t gotten a break out since, and removes my make up with just one wash. I am very happy with this cleanser and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I had facial cosmetic procedures and noticed this brand in my dermatologist office.  The price is very reasonable and is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, MANY cleansers over the years, high end and cheap drugstore brands, from Dior and Demalogica to Cetaphil and Ponds,  to help my combination, sensitive and now aging skin. The most recent was Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel which I did like but didn&#x27;t quite stop the occasional breakout.  However, I really liked the Elta sunscreen I got after a Vitalize peel and so thought I&#x27;d try this foaming enzyme cleanser. This will be my fourth bottle and I can safely say, it is my favourite cleanser ever. I rarely, if ever, get breakouts, and my skin feels really clean afterwards, if a teensy bit dry - and I mean only a tiny bit. You can actually see the make up (if you wear foundation or blusher) rinsing off and there&#x27;s usually no hint of make up residue on the cotton ball when I tone afterwards.  I took a star off the product because the bottle it comes in is absolutely TERRIBLE. After just a few uses, the pump clogs up and it&#x27;s nigh-on impossible to get the cleanser out, At first, I thought I just had a faulty bottle, but the same happened on the 2nd and 3rd. Considering the cleanser is designed to foam, it seems a poor choice of dispenser. A simple flick up spout (like Mario Badescu) or flip up top (like most shampoo bottles) would be a MUCH better choice. However, it&#x27;s not enough to stop me buying it - just a little niggle. I just decant it into my own dispenser and use that instead.</li>
            <li> Nice product similar in consistency to other dermatologist recommended products like Cetaphyl. but I wish it was totally unscented, I don&#x27;t see the need for even the faint orange scent at all, Hasn&#x27;t been irritating to my skin though so I&#x27;m happy with it. Doesn&#x27;t strip the skin and does well removing mascara (non waterproof). Loving the Elta  MD product line</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good just like the foaming version better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this mostly because it burned my eyes!!  It also seemed to really dry out my skin.  Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin and leaves it soft....non-drying.&lt;br /&gt;I remove eye makeup with some jojoba oil -- wear very little foundation most of the time -- then wet my skin slightly and apply this to cleanse -- use a warm washcloth to remove it.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great packaging, great product... makes my skin feel tighter.  Love it!  Thank you</li>
            <li> Elta MD is the bomb of face products.  Very light and does not cause break outs.  Cleans your face and leaves smooth skin!</li>
            <li> Great stuff...It is non-drying and it really helps my face with flaking I have since I use Trentenoin. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Amazing face wash! It really helps to clear skin of pimples ! My dermatologist recommended this to me when I broke out with a horrible face wash! It&#x27;s amazing please give it a try if your having breakouts !</li>
            <li> Sadly this is too drying for my face - my face turned blotchy red after using it. I have combination skin - dry on the cheeks and oily chin.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to give this to my brother who likes it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this product! I order 6 bottles every 6 mo. Buy it.</li>
            <li> it is really drying out my face and causing me to break out with a lot of pimples and i am not happy about that...</li>
            <li> I wear heavy liquid foundation every day, so I need something really powerful at night to take off my makeup. This is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve used for makeup removal. A half pump will take off about 90% of my makeup and the rest (mostly around the eyes) I&#x27;ll wipe off with a facial cloth. I&#x27;d expect a product like this to retail at $50, so while $20 is kind of expensive, it&#x27;s worth it and will last me around 3 months.</li>
            <li> This has a slightly different pump head than the one I bought six months ago or so, but same great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been dealing with little breakouts since puberty so I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different cleansers for the last 20 or so years; this is definitely my favorite. It leaves my face nice and clean without over-drying it. I have sensitive skin and it seems like cleansers either make my face feel like it&#x27;s an itchy, cracking dessert, or like I just rubbed olive oil all over it. This one feels like it cleanses but still leaves my skin balanced. My skin looks better than it has for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve bought and I will continue to buy it. Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No noticeable scent.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this cleanser.  I have mildly oily skin, and this is supposed to be for all skin types.  However, it was overly drying, and after just five days using it, I have dry, scaly skin all around my eyes that isn&#x27;t going away!!  This is a good brand (I use their sunscreen), but this cleanser was way too harsh for me.  In elta md&#x27;s defense, I also use a topical antibiotic 2x/day and benzoyl peroxide and retinoid 1x/day.  This may work fine for those not on these meds.</li>
            <li> I first got introduced to EltaMD at this spa where I would get my microdermabrasion treatments 3 years ago, and I am glad I did. They are not too expensive (for me), and work so good on your skin. This face wash lathers well on my clarisonic brush and has a low, clean scent, almost none actually..I have decent combination skin, prone to white heads, and this works great for my skin type, my husband has clear more dry skin and it works fantastic on him too..I recommend this product and any other EltaMD products..I have tried several and they all work very well.</li>
            <li> Love this brand gets everything off your face without drying.</li>
            <li> Best face wash that strips all the makeup and oil off. Only use it when I wear heavy make up. It dries you skin after but gets every bit of make up off. Hadn&#x27;t had any acne from makeup every since using this product. Love IT!!</li>
            <li> no need to explain I threw down the toilet a waste of money for sure/// I use EltaMD sunblock and its the best but this stuff sucked big time.</li>
            <li> Nice gentle cleanser good for my skin wihile I&#x27;m on Acutane.  Product arrived quickly and it was a good price.</li>
            <li> New fan of EltaMD products and this facial cleanser does not disappoint.  I have horrible adult acne and very oil skin, but this line works perfectly for me and I don&#x27;t have to use any harsh cleansers to tame my skin.  No more blotchy towels and pillow cases.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have used this product for several years and it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin, especially sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Discovered this face wash thru my dermatologist when I was four months pregnant. My skin was horrible , my dermalogica special cleansing gel was not cutting it anymore. This is an amazing products- truly gentle enough to clean, never dries my face . Gets my make up off ( except eye make up bec I wear so much ).  Really should try it . I bought a bottle for my sister and she loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Tried this but it does not do a good job cleaning and leads to clogged pores and breakouts. Loreal (youth code foaming gel) makes a great product which is cheaper and cleans much better. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For a while I was using hand soap to wash my face because it didn&#x27;t seem much different than the expensive cleansers I was purchasing at the time. I stumbled upon this product, however, and I have converted back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is thick and lathers up nicely when applied. Not much product is required and the pump lets out just about the right amount. My makeup, especially eye makeup, is removed effortlessly - that&#x27;s the astounding part #1. The astounding part #2 is that it rinses easily and my skin feels delightfully soft and clean afterwards. I then apply my moisturizer and sunblock if by day or Retin-A if by night and all is right in the world... according to my skin anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is going to last a long time so it&#x27;s not a bad deal for the price. Will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This gets all makeup including eye makeup off! Doesn&#x27;t over dry and helps with breakouts, highly recomend this, no needed eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I have soft water at home so that may be the reason.  Even though this cleanser seemed to remove makeup very well, it didn&#x27;t rinse well.  My face felt slippery and I had to use my usual Cetaphil to remove the cleanser residue.  It also didn&#x27;t lather at all, making me think I needed a lot more than I thought I would need to wash my face -- i.e. about 5 pumps per washing.  There is a foaming version of this cleanser but I think the poor rinsing will still be a problem.  I think I will go back to my Cetaphil facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with the skin on my face and neck and for years I was applying medication for the problem. For years I had to make the an appointment costing $150  dollar for a less than a 5 minute visit just to get another prescription. It occurred to me that I was turning into the doctors retirement fund because nothing ever changed, it was the some drill over and over with no end in sight. My skin wasn&#x27;t getting better and yet the prescription stayed the same. I didn&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try another doctor and he took me off all the meds the other doctor had me use. He recommended Elta MD Facial Cleanser and Elta MD UV Facial SPF 30+ Lotion which he sold in his office for convenience but told me I could find it cheaper by going on Amazon (it&#x27;s not everyday you run into a doctor like this). Now I don&#x27;t have any of those problems anymore with my skin or making expensive appointments and buying expensive meds.&lt;br /&gt;The Readers Digest version of my story is, I found a GREAT PRODUCT by going to GREAT DOCTOR with old time values.</li>
            <li> The only cleanser that cleans and preserves the natural qualities in my skin. I won&#x27;t use anything else. Not harsh or abrasive. Magical softness.</li>
            <li> nice and non greasy.  came recommended by my skin doctor.  leave face feeling nice but not dry.  will recommend. nice pump action don&#x27;t give you to much at one time.</li>
            <li> I have used this exclusively for several years based on a recommendation from my dermotologist. It is the very best</li>
            <li> I have used many facial cleaners over the years, and this one is absolutely the best.  Can&#x27;t imagine ever going without it.  I like it because my face doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, tight or dry after using.  My  face feels and looks CLEAN. Makeup comes right off.</li>
            <li> Excellent and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin dry. My dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for over two years and it really cleans deep without scrubbing, which is so much better for sensitive or problem skin.</li>
            <li> Slightly more drying than I expected considering my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m just in my mid-twenties, I&#x27;ve gone through my fair share of different face cleansing products. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Neutrogena, Cetaphil, Aveeno, japanese face washes, scrubs, and MORE! I stumbled upon this product through my mother and I love it! It takes off every last bit of makeup from my face (even eye makeup) and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and most importantly, CLEAN! We put our skin through hell and and back with layers of makeup, sun, and daily exposure to the elements. This cleanser replenishes and sends me to bed with a smile on my face! Of course you need to moisturize after using this product... so don&#x27;t be surprised if your skin is a tiny bit dry. My skin has never been more breakout-free!! This allows me to use less makeup and show the world more of my natural skin. :)</li>
